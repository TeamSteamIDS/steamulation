												This little onlinegame was once a really good one. It had a really nice developer team with friendly gamemasters, a community which was always fun to have a chat with. Regular content updates with bug fixes, where the developers often listened to feedback. New game modes, new levels... but: these times are all over, and I must WARN you about this game.It started with the acquisition by Sega at the end of 2011. The guys at Three Rings said, there won't be any changes because of this. It was the first lie, because of Sega, there were suddenly EU servers. Although this was positive, everything went VERY slowly downhill since this. I'm not going to cover much gameplay elements, because these are available in other reviews.A few weeks later in November 2011, they have released a content update with recycled boss levels, which are very same, but only harder. What's the catch? Per level, you needed a ""shadow key"", and it was findable as a 1% drop in lockboxes, something where you had to spend 2$/€/whatever to open one (if you wanted to of course). For a 1% chance. The community responded by a massive protest, saying that everyone should boycott this. Especially because the developers never did such a rip-off before. One week later, the shadow keys were available for ""a limited time"", for an energy price of 1800, something around more than 6$. The following weeks they were permanently added for purchase. This was not to be the first money try controlled by Sega.The next ""big"" thing was in 2012 a new boss level added as a DLC, for purchase with a 7$ fee. Once again many community members were upset about this, since they had released in 2011 three whole boss and many other levels for free. Although you may say, ""but they need to earn money too!"", you may be right, but this was abused by an increasing money greed by Sega, slowly completely ruining the future and meaning of the game. I will shorten the next events in 2012: After several other cash grab attempts, the most hilarious attempt happened at the end of 2012. It was the guild hall update, and seriously EVERYTHING was overexpensive. Only people with 24 hour free time, farming the same repetitive levels 100 times per day, or 3 - 4 digit number wallets had the pleasure to burn their cash, or better said, to customize your own guild hall.Meanwhile, Sega had found out that people don't like DLCs. They like costumes! Which means, the development for all other stuff like from their view pointless things like content updates are completely throttled, and costumes were released and updated regulary, sometimes several times in a month. Usually one costume box was available for ""free"" if you purchased energy for more than 20$. Later these boxes were available for energy as well, but on the same real-money level.In December 2012, Three Rings had announced the Battle Sprites, little pets which are a nice help in a battle, but not really necessary. The community was hyped. 7 months later, in July 2013, they had finally released the Battle Sprites. What happened in the meantime? Nothing at all, only tons of cash promos with even more costumes. Please note, most costumes aren't something new. They were simple reskins, a cheap color change. Even a 12 year old could achieve this in programs like Paint.net or Gimp with a few clicks. More about these Battle Sprites: If you get your first one for free, the Sprite is level 1, and completely useless. You can level it up until level 100, but this will take a develish amount of time, if you aren't planing to level it up the rest of your life. Here grins the cash grab again: There were plently of purchaseable items to speed up the progress. Veteran players which had a lot of minerals and materials by previous level missions had the best chances to avoid the cash grab as good as possible on their way to level the poor Sprite up to level 100. And there are the next things to facepalm about:The Battle Sprites are completely unbalanced. The Dragon, which was meant to be an offensive Sprite, is ridiculously weak. The half-offensive-defensive Ghost Sprite has more offensive powers and damage.Even the defensive Cat Sprite is better than the Dragon, because the skill ""Heart Attack"" makes it much easier for you to spam your own attacks, if there are heart pickups everywhere. Major balance problems like this aren't fixed; it's still the same today! And there are no signs that they care about this, or the developers are not allowed to care about it. Gameplay bugs, glitches or balance problems have a pathetic high chance to be completely ignored at all, which wasn't the case in 2011. Today they will only issue an emergency patch when one of their cash ""promos"" stuff has a little texture bug, glitch, or whatever. It became very obvious that it's all about new cash stuff and costumes now, and many veteran members have left the game because of this situation. This online game has too little content to live without content updates, these were an important reason for many people to stay. And since these people have left the game, there are now only these left which think the current situation is perfectly okay and everything is great. Which is another problem:While you had in 2011 a lot of people free for an adventure or a chat, this is today only partially the case anymore. Many people have developed their own closed-circle-connections in their guilds, like to talk or blaspheme about other people, because of boredom or whatever reasons (I can confirm this with the German community, English could be different). Since there are no new content updates anymore, except one or two simple short missions in ONE year, some people stay there for Social Engineering. The game supports Steam trading, where you could trade energy for games, items from other online games items or more. Which is very attractive for some people. But I have kept the best to the last:In early months of 2014, someone has hacked the game, and has duplicated items in auctionhouse or had gifted them to other people (as far as I could see it on the forums before it got censored away). They have banned almost everyone who has purchased or accepted such duplicated items in the auctionhouse or via trade, and how are we and other people supposed to see if a virtual item is actually ""real"" or not (since when are virtual items real anyway?). A friend of mine got such items via a trade, and he gave me some to me and a few guildmates too, because free things are always good, isn't it? From their view obviously not. Many others, including me, got banned in a massive ban wave, with hundreds of other people, and they absolutely don't care about it, nor my massive amount of playtime or invested money. I had contacted their support, which said, ""We require a healthy mind from every player"", refusing to take off the ban, and indirectly saying I'm a liar. But they´re the liars they already knew about that bug for weeks and didn´t fix it.Their gamemaster staff became like ""brainwashed"", handling situations for their profit. In 2011 they have never thought about crazy things like a massive ban wave, just because one bad guy set a fire in the game (metaphorical). It was a time where they have cared about their people very intensively, if people were actually happy about the game progress. And it's all over. No active content development, no mature and friendly community anymore, no new things, no hope at all. This game is for every interested gamer a hopeless case now if you want to play it for a long time. Because Sega treats Spiral Knights like a cashcow, milking it's milk til it's blood and bones. No wonder why one of their lead designers called Nick left Three Rings this year. It was once a very promising and great game, until Sega came in. I could extend this long text even more, but I will stop now.Thanks for reading!			",485,106,17,42,27,8,38

												I'VE PLAYED THIS GAME FOR 5000 HOURS SO I KNOW WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUTAnd by the way, if it's too long to read there is no point to play it: The Game's servers are going to close. So recommending or not, there is no reason to start it whatsoever (it has not been confirmed, but its on forums).I would definetely give this game a thumbs up, but for its current state, it's a no from me. I don't wanna hate on the game, but what bugs me the most are the developpers that gave up on this game that it had the potential to be something bigger and something everyone would enjoy playing. I would give this review a thumbs up, but I'm giving a thumbs down because of the devs. And before you trynna defend in the comments before reading this, I suggest you do. I've spent 5000 hours on this game,more than any other I've spent and you cn definetely say I enjoyed it A LOT. But I feel like I got betrayed. It would be a 10/10 if the game was active and constantly had new things to offer.You might definetely know me if you played this game as Speedkillerr, technically still a Guild Master in Unity(an old powerfull guild). I've also made yearly Christmas Giveaways to the ENTIRE GAME! YES, I used to advertise in haven for free stuff, and over 40 people would line up to give free items to friends and strangers. So before concidering me as an ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, make some research or stop assuming. To introduce you to this game, you are a knight and you must find a core, where a really old artifact was stolen by the Gremlins(a destructive enemy faction), and you must bring it back to Haven. Your Mission is also to help Spiral HQ to find the missing Alpha team that got sucked into the core. Unfortunately, the game never had the core open until few months ago and boy...the lore was disappointing. So if you are looking for story, you will not find it interesting as the gameplay progresses. Only As a 1-star player or a recruit, the story will be enjoyable. Here is the positive part: I loooooove the costumes and the design of characters. It gives so much inspiration to designers and drawers out there. The designing part of the game is friendly. Spiral Knights on DeviantArt is a really common place for players to go. I've changed my profile picture in the past A LOT when I would find a badass or cool spiral knights pic. I even make em myself using Spiral Spy, Three Ring's software. I've made profile pictures for many friends and other peeps. I love the design and costumization of the game a lot.What's really nice about this game is also Haven. It looks such an ideal and peaceful place for players to interact, trade, participate in events, practise, generally become better players. The design of the Town Square looks amazing and delightful! If you are going to start the game, I recommend to look around and explore the place. No wonder why most of people stay there most of their time!The mobs-monsters are inspiring as well. Dividing them into different families and each faction-family has its own unique story and species. Personally, ""the nightmare"" mobs are my favourite (shadow zombies, gremlins, trojans, etc).The game isn't challenging for you? Try out Shadow Lair! It's epic and has a lotta action!I am also glad to see new accessories lately in early 2016. I can definetely say the design has improved A LOT. Variety expanded. But if I rant about it bellow, it's for not just that reason. The lack of new items is still a debate. Sadly,the game is dead. I'm repeating, the game is dead. Only 500 users playing on steam. Now you're going to tell me that steam users only populate 30% of the game, but still...it is not enough. The developpers don't care about this game anymore. Some devs were playing the game and doing nothing all day. Just showing off their expensive ♥♥♥♥♥♥ items that no one can afford. The Head-Dev of the game(Nick) quit. The are almost no updates in the game.Let's break this into two pieces now. 1-for PvE and 2-for PvP1) Missions get repetitive, there are only 5-10 daily missions that are randomely generated. Arcade depths are empty since there is a ""Mission"" option where you get straight into the lore. There is no variety into the missions, that's just how I felt through out the years. Since most of the game is filled with players who finished the lore and are 5-star, the Lord Vanaduke mission is the primary selection for grinding, which is the only one that gives the most crowns(currency of the game). And yes,it's just THAT mission that you get the most money from. And it definetely gets repetitive since it's the only one that shows progress. And it takes about 30-40 minutes to complete. Either way, PvE is boring, that's all I'm gonna say,especially when you're alone.2) The worst part of this game. Basically 99% of the game is PvP. Classic. It's called Lockdown. You just get in 2 teams and kill each other andcapturing points. OP people always playing, you see no noobs anymore. And basically the people who play PvP excessivly are the ones who live at their mom's basement and don't have anything else to play. It can be fun at some parts, but it's repetitive and BORING. More boring that Call of Duty nowadays. And everyone is using the same TWO weapons.  That's basically PvP. No variation in this game. There is also Blast Network but it has 0 players for 3 YEARS STRAIGHT. I've never seen anyone playing it. Whenever there is a match, it's surprising. It's like the most useless PvP part of the game. You just bomb others.The prices of the items are broken. The Auction House is empty. Nothing is sold anymore, I only see 2-3 traders a day, while back in the days, there were trades everywhere. There are rarely new items anymore. Just some promo ♥♥♥♥♥♥ costumes that only difference they have is their color. NOTHING ELSE. That's what we get twice a year only.BIG problem in the game nowadays is the wealth gap. Now it's just rich vs poor. No in between. It's like the players have been divided in two species. The rich people monopolize everything. The bad thing also is that only 2-3 guilds are active. And the really big ones are literally ruining the game. Guild vs Guild PvP only has ONE guild which you can play against. ONE! And this one is the most hated to VS since they don't even let you play with others..and they are incredibly tryhards lol. My guild tried to vs with a friendly guild. And we didn't manage to play because that annoying guild gets in the way.No joke, the game was full and joyfull back in 2012. It reached its climax in 2013. The servers were full. There was action going on, and the community was humble. Now it's all about competition and who is the best on LD(Lockdown). Servers are empty. There is only 1 server active and sometimes it is empty as well. The game had full potential to become something new and different. I liked the lore and the setting at one point, but the devs don't care anymore and half of the quit. Three Rings is falling and there is nothing we can do about it. The 2 biggest guilds in the game broke and went to other games.It used to be my favourite game for a loooong time, but it got boring. You only enjoy it for a small tangent of time. Then you will hate that you got consummed by it. This ain't just a rant, it's the players' voice. It's not just my voice, it's everyone's complaints,pros and cons in just a compressed and really brief review of the game. I don't like hating on things, because I'm not able to make a game like that myself, but knowing that the developers aren't in a good shape and kinda gave up on the game, made me feel betrayed.Want a simpler one?: DO NOT touch this game if you don't like repetitiveness. Good thing it's free, so you can just try it out yourself. I play it sometimes because I wanna hang out with friends, there are some personal parts that keep me going,Peace out, here is a smiley face if you managed to read this vicious text  :)			",40,5,2,2,6,0,2

												Okay, here goes.This game used to be fun. It still is.I would recommend it to a friend.But with one word of advice.Use only crowns for trading with other players, and don't stockpile energy. These days, everyone is crying out at OOO to ""make the game better"", to ""stop the pay to win"" or ""I WANT MY X BACK BECAUSE MY Y IS NOT GOOD ZOMG.""They complain it is pay to win. It's not, not at all.We just make it that way.Whenever someone asks for gear, if they offer energy, no matter how tantalizing it may seem, don't do it.If you want your crowns to mean something, then use those instead of trading for energy. Trade a sword for crowns, or use the crowns to buy things. Not energy.That is all.Don't use energy, and the game will slowly return to not being as pay to win, due to people not using energy for much anymore. Spread the word, and things will get better.

												As much as I love this game, and continue to play it, I do not reccomend that others play it. The game is nice sure, but it takes too long to progress, and many people (some of my friends included) are turned off this game because of the dismal rewards for completing anything in Spiral Knights. There has been no communication to players about any upcoming updates from the developers (last major update was twelve months ago) and it seems any updates now are just for cosmetic pay boxes, not gauranteed to give you anything worth your money, not to mention the gamebreaker gun recently added in a 'prize' box.In short, this game would be better if they removed a few features, tweaked the Player Vs Player, released new content more frequently and made it easier for new comers to get geared up.

												I suppose it might be time for me to write this review, considering I've played since shortly after it became available on Steam. Granted, I've taken some pretty lengthy breaks, but I've logged quite a few hours into this game. TL;DR: A personally nostalgiac MMO that isn't quite what it used to be.When I started playing this game, I pretty much played solo. There were no missions, nor was the story something you had to experience along the way - back then, all it took was learning the mechanics and diving into it. It was pretty grindy back then, but definitely manageable. As a new player, and with content being released a little more regularly then, grinding consistently paid off. If that were still the case, I'd probably recommend this game.I got about halfway through levelling up my first set of gear when I realized how quickly things would go if I were in a guild. My first guild experience lasted a day, and I hopped through a few smaller ones until I found my first home. I'm glad to say that a few people from that guild I'm still friends with in real life - and honestly, there are only a handful of MMOs that have actually brought people into my life for an extended period of time outside of game. I suppose that adds to the nostalgia. I got a little more levelled up in that guild, but my interest started to fade and I stopped playing.When I started again, I hopped around a few more times, settling in for a month or two with some relatively active guilds, but didn't find another in-game group that I clicked with until I joined my current guild. Again, I still keep in contact with several guild mates to this day, not as often lately but it's nice knowing they're there and that they helped me through a time in my life that was a bit troubled. I reached end game with them, and started to feel the interest fade, as well. The mission system took some of the mystery out of the game, but that wasn't too bad. Then energy was replaced with crystals, and the game essentially became pay-to-win. A lot of people stopped playing.The community in this game has always been one of its strong suits, something that would be a definitive selling point so long as it thrived. However, I don't really see it thriving like it used to. Sure, I have friends that play still, and there are many other great people online pretty regularly. I could go on and on with examples about how changes have impacted the community, though - when I started playing, random clusters of players just chatting away was a regular sight in the more common areas. I don't see that as much now. A lot of community talk has gone from focusing on lore or gameplay elements to constant wondering when something new will happen with the game. Overall, I concur with what many other reviews say. The Zelda-esque gameplay is really appealing, and the art, both audio and visual, is unforgettable. Yet it has lost its charm. For new players, getting to end-game would take a lot of time or money, or both, and even then, what good does it do? While the journey to the end itself is quite fun, and there is an opportunity to meet some great people along the way, there isn't much to expect after. Even as a completionist, I've pretty much given up on levelling all of my gear - it just doesn't seem worth it, and at this point, things are too repetitive. Do I recommend this game? A few years ago, sure, but now, I sadly cannot. If that changes, I'll be sure to update my review, but I'm not counting on it.EDIT: In response to comments questioning how I can dislike a game that I put 1100+ hours into, the answer is this. I actually was quite fond of the game for several years, and during that time, yes, I played it a lot. The game has had many updates (and I do agree that some of them were for the better, especially allowing people to play more without waiting. The energy revamps were much needed), yet the missions system and energy change was, in my opinion, the last ""great"" update to the game. Considering the grindiness that the game currently has, I don't consider it welcoming to new players in the sense that the game is fun for quite a while, and then becomes rather repetitive and frustrating.To be fair, the game was *always* repetitive and frustrating - the difference, at least for me, is that at one point it was fun enough that I didn't mind, and now, with a lack of additional content (we've been at the core for a while now and only recently got a glimmer of hope that we'd move deeper into the world), it's less fun and more ""I'm playing this game because I used to play this game."" Is this review biased? Of course it is, I logged over a thousand hours into the game. Needless to say it had an impact on my life. I'm definitely grateful for those hours, but I won't simply recommend it to everyone based on the fun I had a couple years ago - especially since the game has become less fun for me. The game will always have a special place in my memory - I just can't say with certainty that it would be anywhere near the same for someone just starting out now. Take from that what you will.---And to clear things up for anyone looking for a concise list of pros/cons, here you are:PROS:Captivating gameplayGear is upgraded, not the character, so there is replay valueContent is interestingCONS:Grindy / RepetitiveLatest additions are mostly cosmetic, occasional fleeting hope for more contentPVP is difficult to get into without a lot of great gearGame has become, in essence, P2W.**Totally possible to win without paying, but takes a considerable amount of grinding.

												I remembered those days when I first found out about this game in 2013. I was amazed by everything in this game the characters, designs, platforms and much much more. I had a lot fun with this game because it was unlike anything I've played before in a F2P. During the first few ranks I've leveled up myself very quickly ( total ranks of 10) however when I got to the rank of ""defender elite rank 8"" everything went from a nice straight forward game to a total grindfest. Let me explain, in the old days of SK in 2012 all the gears are leveled up with heat and crafted wtih energy ( you find heat when you kill enemies and you obtain energy by waiting for hours to get the energy to regenerate) however in the new forge update in 2013 everything went downfall. They have slowed down our mission progress by adding fire crystals or orbs to level up and crafting your gears and weapons. What this means is that the energy regeneration is completely removed so you have to use orbs to craft new weapons. Orbs are very rare so if you could not find 3 orbs to craft for a single gear or weapon then you are stuck on a rank and could not proceed to new missions until you buy it from the energy deposit ( shop ) or find it during tier runs. Heating is another problem, if you could not find fire crystals to level up your gear then all the precious hard earned heat is wasted.Back then, the gear and weapons level up automatically so no fire crystals are involved to block progress. Another problem in this game is its economy. Yes, you can still buy energy from the energy deposit as little as 11k crowns for 100energy nowadays. Crowns are ingame currency we use in SK you obtain them by killing off enemies. The energy price for 3 eternals orbs (highest ranked orbs) is 800energy. So 11 x 8 = 88, then you need 88k Crowns to craft one of the highest gear/Weapon in SK. It does not sound too bad did it? Well if you did 1 full run for tier 3 (total tiers 1, 2 and 3 being the highest) you get an average of 8k crowns. Took me 40 min on average to solo through the full tier 3 ( don’t bother looking to join a party, the game is pretty much dead and even if you do it would take you more time to complete a tier because you need to wait for other people ). So 40 x 11 = 440/60 = 7.3, then you need to take a total of 7hrs and 15 min to have the amount total of money to craft a single 5 star gear/weapon ( total stars 1-5). Pretty much you can find orbs in tier runs but they very rarely come by so you could be sitting and playing SK for months and still haven’t found a full set of 3 orbs. The final problem is that the game is dead as I have mentioned earlier. The developers are constantly recolouring the themes of costumes (costumes are cosmetics and have no impacts on armor and stats, the purpose is to look good). Everyday, every week and every month of a year they don’t add new missions, new contents or new gears/weapons. I have to mention they did a gunner update of new gear and armor in 2014 and it was amazing not only that they added new missions. It went pretty well however from 2014-2016 they did not release anything new, just recoloured cosmetics and repeated events. I got to vanguard rank 10 in 2015 it was already boring me out when I’ve finished all the missions and got all the good gear. Lack of new contentI have much more to say about this game but I think I’ve given you a viewpoint of why I don’t recommend this game unless you like a big grindfest mate.If you read all of it you deserve a cookie.

												Before I begin, do NOT bring my play time into account of this review. I played back when the game had a much more appealing idea behind it and wasn't 100% reliant on Promos to keep it alive.Now honestly what can be said about this game that hasn't already. From its core it was a very promising game. Frequent updates, fun gameplay, and interesting lore are what made this game so great from the very start. The majority of that changed for the worse when accessories were implemented as it gave the developers a false ideal that accessories are what should keep the game a float instead of pure content that most other games thrive off of to survive. For the most part the game in itself was a great one from the start, but with every level, every floor, every depth you went down further it started to lose the magic that it once had. It became less of a challenge for the player and just ended up turning into a limitless grind to see who could have the best looking set overall. Cosmetics can be nice and mix things up in games, but when that game survives off of that simple factor alone then it is truly not going to last forever. This game could have been something special if it truly didn't rely on cosmetics and reskins to keep it going. I may have a great deal of a time in this game, but it took me much longer than it should have to truly realize how the devs were handling it after countless promo that managed to root itself in with every event. On its own the gameplay stands out, it's fun whether you enjoy solo play (only for so long), and can be even better when you have a party of friends to play with, but you will quickly lose all enjoyment that you originally had once you reach the end-game content as it doesn't have much to offer other than reskinned bosses with extra challenge added to them. Other than the never-ending grind that presents itself for end-game there truly is no goal afterwards as it gives you nothing to strive for. For what it is the soundtrack is great, and can easily be memorable if you happen to enjoy calm tunes when relaxing in Haven or enjoy dramatic music when engaging in battle. The graphics are also quite nice with how everything seems to be made to appear cute, but at the same time present some sort of danger. The community (although much smaller now) also happens to be a pretty good part of what makes the game what it is (except the PvP part of it. You know who you are). Other than that the only true flaw that makes me not want to recommend this game is that the devs have basically given up on putting out any true content updates, and mostly focus on reskins and cosmetics like most F2P models fall victim too.I can’t say I’d ever go back to this game either since it lost all of its charm as soon as I started playing other games and noticed the only real reason I originally played it was due to a nostalgic feeling that it gave. For the most part it reminded me of Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past, and when I had first started this seemed like a wonderful experience since this was what I thought I was missing out on especially since it had co-op functionality.All - in - All great idea, and interesting mechanics, but the devs have basically become greedy, and have chosen to take the lazy route only to release cosmetics that add no value to the game other than making it another bland dress-up game to see who has the most valuable and shiniest sets.TL:DR This game is decent, but like most F2P games it has its flaws, and won’t last you too long nowadays like it used to for enjoyment if you want a truly memorable experience.

												Aside from being a game filled with hazardous paywalls (which can be easily averted), and other nasties with the ingame economy, I really don't see why this title gets so much flak from the community. Solid Multiplayer RPG, four man dungeon crawling. Wearing armor and items while you complete levels allows you to gain EXP (Known as Heat) to further level the items to a maximum of level 10. From there you can transmute and pick different branches that you want to evolve your weapon for a cost of in-game currency.The game used to employ a revive system where you would share your HP to revive them, and uses now items known as Spark of Life.  The game used to be much more limited in terms of how much you could play per day, your Knight would store ""Mist Energy"" in their armor as time passes, and you could use this energy to power the Elevators (which help you advance to lower dungeons in the specific dungeon series).The dungeons in general are randomly generated based on user contributions to that specific elevator, by adding different crystals (which you can find in almost every level), you may influence how the next dungeon will be generated.  EDIT: I have been told that such is not the case anymore. I believe it is a nice addition to the randomness of the stages, and it forces you to be prepared for the dungeons you go into. The netcode is rather solid, I have not had many problems with my connection and playing the game, aside from the occasional lag spike between other players.The themes and atmosphere are well designed, and the music compliments said environments.All in all I would very much recommend this game to my friends and family, even though my opinion may be unpopular.

												This game was fun, at the start. It has a nice Zelda style gameplay, good design and art, plus a good crafting system and auction house and all that kind of stuff. The problem is the game just gets outright redundant before too long. The variety of the missions and the maps in the depths leaves a ton to be desired. After awhile it also becomes clear that there isn't as much weapon variety as you may have thought, and there are some weapon and armor combos that simply overpower others making many of them pointless.The biggest problem is that while many MMO's deal with content issues early, they continue to develop and expand the game as time goes on. The issue here is that Three Rings has hardly developed a thing in the many years since the game came out. A few maps and missions have come in, but overall the story and main questing route all stalls exactly where it has since the very beginning. They're really good at developing new prize boxes to get people to pay real money for the chance of getting some rare cosmetic item, but development of the actual game has seemingly outright stalled. This last big update they hyped for quite awhile took over a year to come out and really just consisted of a few new guns and a couple new pieces of armor.Spiral Knights is just a great example of a good game and a good concept losing its steam due to mismanagement and greed. If they cared as much about making progress on their game as they did about finding new ways to get people to spend cash on prize boxes then their game might have a larger playerbase and they wouldn't need to stoop so low to milk the cash cow. I'd love to see this game get back on its feet as I enjoyed the content it did have, but I just don't see that happening until the developer starts to care again. When all is said and done the game is dead now.			",196,22,2,29,22,1,24

												What used to be a flourishing indie game inspired from some of gaming's best retro is now a shell of it's former self. Spiral Knights was fun when it was under indie ownership and it was still great when Nick was leading the development team. He left with a somber note and now I see why; the developer is clearly more interested in adding grind walls to get money out of it's players than it is providing a fun and balanced gameplay. RIP Spiral Knights, SEGA ruins yet another good thing.Good night sweet prince.EDIT: READ ON FOR AN ACTUAL REVIEW, STILL DON'T PLAY THIS GAME. Spiral Knights started out as an indie game developed and funded by Three Rings (simply called OOO from here on). It got many rewards and was lauded by critics cause of it's fun and unique playstyle for an MMO and easy to learn, hard to master approach. Like many games it has dual economy; in game money being >crowns< and the real world alternative >crystal energy<.For a short while, one could easy get energy crystals from simply playing the game to earn crowns which they could then trade for EC. This worked for a while and it was very fair way for players to get the premium gear and goodies the game had to offer without ever needing to spending actual cash. The game did, however, limit how much you could play in a single day with MIST ENERGY, which you used to progress down floors into game's dungeons. You could get about an hour or so of play time of your 100 daily mist energy, so it was good incentive to buy an elevator pass so you could play the game as much as you wanted. For small price of $5.95, you could play the game for as much as you wanted for as long as you wanted (see how I racked up 2000+ hours?).The game always had balance issues but with enough practice, you could overcome them. Swordsmen had the best selection of armor and weapons, dished out the most damage and had the most of the game's content dedicated to it. Gunners were gimped by poor damage output, a 3 bullet clip, and reduced movement speed when firing. Bomber probably had the worst of it all. Bombs take what feels like an eternity to charge, and you can only place down one bomb at a time. The blast radius was embracing unless you had a 4* or 5* weapon and even then, you were at large risk of dying because of how bombs functioned.Did I mention they teased opening the Core for years?Things started to turn sour, though, once SEGA purchased the developer. Content started to slow to a halt, and a steady increase in cosmetic promotions were now the common flavor of the month. SEGA, of course was more interested in milking the game's acclaim for cash rather than developing upon it's success as a wonderful, retro gaming-inspired masterpiece. It took almost a year for the guild hall update to finally release and it took even longer for Gunner Update to hit the players. In between that, there was dozens of promotional boxes featuring nothing but armor and weapon recolors and underwhelming chances of getting said items. It was a skinner box idea to start with that only got worse, as at this point in the game, the promo boxes didn't even provide the player with EC. There were two nails in the coffin for this game: the first being the addition of the Furnace and the departure of head developer/game creative director Nick Popovich. This game was a love letter of gaming for Nick and it really showed. Sadly, he left on a subtly sad note and moved on with his life. It was clear at that point that SEGA was simply using the game was means of collecting easy cash off of young people with no knowledge of how their gambling--erm--lockboxes work. rather than make an evolving game. OOO is now a money machine for SEGA and nothing else. The Furnace turned the game into an nigh painful grindfest and it's god awful at it too. ""Heat"" up your gear now and spend rare fire crystals at a chance at leveling up your gear. Do yourself a favor, if you see this game in your recommended feed by Steam, click ""Not Interested"" and said yourself the wasted harddrive space. .... oh, the core finally opened up. Big whoop.

Posted: December 9, 2013
												Having played the game for over 300 hours, seeing many iterations of the game, and seeing the general direction of where the game is headed, I honestly can't recommend it for most players.There's a lot of problems with the way the game is run and how it is being developed that are more than a little concerning. Over the course of the two years I've played this game, I've gone from having a lot of hope for it and being really excited to see how it develops, to being sorely disappointed with the quality of the updates and actually feeling sad for all the squandered potential the game had.Let's get into details now shall we?Positives:- GameplayPretty unique in its gameplay. Haven't seen any other MMO that plays quite like it. A good take on translating the top-down Legend of Zelda style play and turning it into an MMO. It's easy to understand and play, with some advanced techniques to pick up along the way.The randomly generated levels also add a bit of replayability to the game.- SoundThe music for the game is pretty good. Though generally upbeat and calm, it can get hectic or atmospheric when it needs to.The sound effects are also pretty decent and add a lot of character to the colorful cast of enemies you'll find yourself beating down.- ArtThe absolute biggest positive of the game in my opinion. Virtually every art asset is well designed and rendered in a very unique and eyecatching style. They're also very well animated to boot!Granted, there are some exceptions where lazy design or lackluster work sticks out (an example being a certain line of upgradeable helmets only has 2 textures between all 6 of them), but overall the art is what stands out the most to me.- CommunityHonestly one of the nicest MMO communities I've seen. There's hardly any hostilities towards other players and most players are genuinely helpful towards one another. The glaring exception being the PvP minigame, Lockdown.Negatives:- UpdatesOne of the most disappointing things about the game is the general lack of content brought by updates. It is understandable that updates aren't frequent when you realize how small the OOO dev team is, but the amount of content released over the course of the two years I've played is pitifully small. A lot of the ""new"" content is just rehashed older content to pad out the game or one-time bosses, enemies, and set pieces put into single Missions while the rest of the gameworld (which is played VASTLY more than most single Missions) is in sore need of more variety.And that's not even getting into the annoying cash-grab updates dedicated solely to costumes.- PerformanceBeing an MMO built on Java, there's definitely going to be performance issues unless the game is perfectly optimized (which it isn't). An abundance of entities on the screen can slow the game to a crawl no matter the quality, which wouldn't be a problem if there weren't also an insane abundance of levels that use huge hordes of enemies and particle effects. The game lags a lot and that's not even getting into the extremely small number of servers causing problems for those that can't get a decent connection.Then there's also an inherent problem with the game running on Macs which further harms performance. Not as pronounced a problem, but definitely noticeable.- BalanceOne of the biggest breaking points for me. The balance of the arsenal of weapons and armor is abyssmal. Some weapons are inexplicably far more powerful and useful than others. Others are so painfully useless or weak that it's a wonder if they get used at all.Example: Any armor that ""emphasizes"" defense doesn't offer much more defense than other armors that also offer major attack bonuses. Even then, most of the defensive sets only allow you to take a single extra hit or maybe two incomparison to the offensive sets. Essentially, any armor set that doesn't boost your attack power in some way is obsolete to those that do.It's been this way for YEARS, with the community clamoring for balance and suggesting ways to balance things out. Some balance changes were even promised for underpowered or broken weapons, but after more than a year on some of them, no changes have been made.It completely baffles me why the devs can't simply change numbers around on the equipment, but it apparently is too tough for them to do so.Speaking of broken balance...- LockdownThe broken balance certainly doesn't help things in Spiral Knight's PvP mini-game. Aside from equipment making it hard to take seriously, it's a PvP game and generates all the toxicity that a PvP crowd can. Unless you're really into PvP, it's best to steer clear from this unbalanced mess.- GrindingBeing a Free-to-Play MMO, grinding is to be expected. However, with the limited number of randomly generated areas and how little moneyand experience some areas offer in comparison to the boss levels, it gets incredibly dull, incredibly fast.And then there's the issue of the Forge, a mechanic that slows down a player from levelling their equipment. Aside from needing the game's equivalent to experience, you also need a rather big number of rare items for a CHANCE to bring your euipment to the next level unless you use a LARGE number of said rare items to get that chance to 100%. Then there's the fact that you can't access the Forge from everywhere in the game, which creates a disconnect between gaining a level and that rewarding feeling of leveling up.- DifficultyI don't quite agree with OOO's idea of difficulty being to add more health and damage onto monsters or to throw so many monsters at the players that damage is nigh unavoidable. It just reinforces the superiority of the offensive sets of equipment since they can deal with both sitautions faster and more efficiently. More diverse groupings of enemies or improving the AI along with the general power given to the players is the more fulfilling and strategic route to go, in my opinion. Giving the mosters more health and damage just makes battles long, grindy, and extremely frustrating should they touch you.- Revive systemThis used to be a big plus for the game until the mechanic was completely overhauled earler this year.Before, players could pick up any allies that got incapacitated at the cost of half of their health. It encouraged teamplay and helping each other out, while also making most players cautious with their health since it could save a teammate as well.Now, you can't offer your health to revive your team. It instead relies on a rare item that you can either get from treasure drops or purchase with your own money. If you want to revive a teammate it's going to cost you one of your own revive items and to even do so you have to open a menu and select to revive said teammate. It takes a lot more time and is never even mentioned as an option in the game as opposed to the old method where all you had to do was stand near your teammate, see the revive icon, and click.This change really broke the teamplay aspect of the game for me. Instead of your team making daring rescues to revive one another, now you have your team lying on the floor begging for a revive because they don't want to use their own.- End gameThe end game has been stagnant for more than a year now. Once you have your 5 Star equipment set and reach the end of the Missions there honestly isn't much to do unless you have money to pay for the Shadow Lairs. Even then, the Shadow Lairs are seriously just rehashed boss levels with hordes more enemies to make it more ""difficult."" What's worse is that you have to pay an exorbitant amount of Energy/real money to even enter one of them ONCE. All for useless, gimmicky pieces of armor.-----And that's my review for the game. Feel free to give it a look (it is free afterall), but be warned that there are a LOT of problems with the game.Personally, I'd recommend trying out another free MMO like Warframe or maybe Vindictus.

												This game has a multitude of things to do. The storyline and environment are very unique and interesting. Also with many things to do even after you reach “end game” of the storyline. New content is added quite often though, expansions to the game it's self are rare, they do happen. Overall this game has been quite a lot of fun for me through the years of play and I think it will continue to be so for me. Some people however do a lot of complaining (even me sometimes) about how the game needs to expand in many different ways of functioning content of the players instead of cosmetic, but I think this game has actually stayed fairly true to the origin of being an ""arcade game"" type and has kept that in mind when add-in’s have happened. This is not a game to run around in open and endless fields, fighting monsters at random locations, but actual arcade play where we have different levels or ""depths"" as they're called with mostly set setups, though still with a very large variety of monsters and types of depths through the game to experience many new things and keep the game entertaining. I think as long as you can keep that in mind this game can be endless fun and just down right enjoyable for it's uniqueness.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The closest thing I can compare the gameplay to is Zelda I guess, with all the top-down action and switches that open doors and grass and foliage to cut and stuff. The low-poly graphics are charming, and the whole game carries a pretty likeable asthetic. That said, this is an MMO, and all that implies (read: there's grinding). At least playing levels is now free where it used to cost 10 Mist Energy per floor, but on the other hand, heating up your items to upgrade them now sucks aggressively. So if you really don't like grinding, steer clear of this and basically the entire MMO genre. There is admittedly not as much content in this game as I would like. But I'll cut the dev team some slack because it's -tiny-, and I've met some pretty cool folks in here, so I still don't have any regrets.			",209,15,8,13,11,3,29

A Spiral Knights ReviewFirst things first, I loved this game. I still do. Love its' artstyle, the design, the unique atmosphere, and all my friends who have supported me through these 4 years in the game. and the 5035 hours oh my ****ing god!One thing that hasn't changed during the years is the artstyle and all the crazy cool new (and cute) stuff that has been added into the game. The community is mostly nice, apart from a few rotten apples. The artwork that has been made based on this game is enthralling at least. The epic moments when battling a boss with a bunch of friends via a voice chat system is a thing to remember even after many years.Even though all these fun times, I am obliged to quit this game. ""But why, Dreff? You said that you'll never quit this game ever!Forge Okay so in the old times, your gear would gain heat which levels them up after the heat bar is filled to the max. You only had to get in the clockworks and play, and after the level was completed, you'd get heat and if the bar got filled, the weapon leveled up. Now you need to upgrade with Fire Crystals. Reason why it is so annoying is because it is really going to limit your weapon upgrading to the ones that you really want to have level 10. The game also urges you to spend your pennies on fire crystals to level your gear up faster.Pay 2 win?  I've spent a horrendous amount of money on this game. Most of my purchases I made for this game to show my support and maybe get some cool items along the way. A fair time ago you obtained prize boxes via a normal energy purchase. I really liked that, you'd only get a couple of boxes along with a purchase but you'd get that energy along. Then the system was changed so that you couldn't get boxes along for free via an energy purchase. This is the one reason why the energy prices in game are so high.Energy Price in-game You can pay in game via a direct change of X crowns into 100 energy, or sell 100 energy for X crowns. The prices used to be static 5000cr which was pretty cheap. The current prices are double as much. One of the reasons for this is that people don't buy any Energy with real money anymore. During an event, you could get boxes along energy purchases. Most of the people sold their energy via the Energy Trade system in the game (Post offers to sell/buy energy for x amount of crowns) Nowadays it's a pretty static 9k-10k crowns to get 100 energy.Furthermore Another thing which causes players not to buy ce directly is because you can get way more energy with other virtual currencies, such as tf2 keys. The least amount of energy you can buy in SK with real money is 750e. It costs about 2,40€, basically slightly more than a tf2 key would cost me, (currently 2,20€ per tf2 key) If you sell those keys to a player you found in-game or via the forums, you'd get 2000e/key. More than 2x energy than buying it in-game. Awesome, right?Less challenging & other In the older times, there weren't many of the new additions, such as the Battle Sprites, Dash & Shield Bash, etc. I think these along with some other things have made the game a lot more easier than before. I personally enjoyed the difficulty, perhaps the ridiculous stacking revive costs with energy were a bit too much though. But, when you ran with a party, you could run next to a fallen party member, revive them for the cost of half of your own health. It made the game interesting to play with a party, since there was no way you could pay energy prices every time you died. You could also drop health pills if your team had none and desperately in need of some delicious pills, which made co-working together important and it stiched people together.The Core Aight, the big one. Cherry on top of the cake. You delved every time down to the clockworks, fighting monsters and grabbing that loot. Once you ventured all the way to the bottom, there was this mysterious thing called... The Core. First time I made it into the core I was just thinking that what on earth could be inside that thing? Valuables? Maybe a whole new series of levels, insanely difficult but rewarding at the same time? None of those I am afraid... Just... White space. Me and so many others were so excited about it! This could have been such a potential for new, intriguing missions to do, new content that would last for a fair amount of time. Sigh.Inactivity Sigh. I've had a ton of cool friends in-game that I played actively with, got to know better and who helped me during my tough times. No, I wasn't just seeking acceptance from randoms online, some of my closest of friends helped me during my darkest of hours It's a shame that people are quitting the game, I've lost 100 or so people from my friends list, some of which I didn't really even get to say goodbye to. Now, some of my friends will go through the same, as I leave without saying farewell or anything.Farewell,-DreffGG no re ",79,8,0,10,1,1,10

												it's still worth playing, but poor decisions, lack of updates and further balancing (they balanced a few things but after the lead designer quit everything went down hill fast including an allready announced BIG update and balancing) will make it so that the game will get to grindy for your taste and/or boring REAL fast (grinding the same maps for more money) it's free so DO give it a shot and like me, keep hope the devs will redeem themselves and go back to the old ways and make this a realy great MMOThe lead designer left OOO and after that the game went from good to recycled and VERY grindy.There was a big update announced while the LD was still at OOO but now still no news and the only ""updates"" the game gets is recycled/recolord costume pieces or just reskinned (end-game) weapons.the game itself is fun, it used to be hard to progress but still was doable... now it will take you forever to just ""forge"" (will get back to this) equipment to progress and make it into the ""end-game"" stages (Tier 3 and onwards)there used to be an energy system (it's still there... somewhat) that gave you 100 energy each day (would cost 10 energy to play a single map, X amount of energy to craft stuff, increasing amounts to resurect yourself...) at first i didn't like it (the early stages... you know, the time where you want to get to play as much as you can hehe) then they introduced elevator passes (free maps, so the 100 energy could be spend wich ever way you wanted) and well... that was just awsome! and there was also an other energy appart from the 100 you got every day (this you could trade for with ingame currency or get with real money) there was a small diffrence between the 2 appart from one being free every day and the other grindable or purchasable.so now a bit about the new energy system, the dailey energy got removed (wich is even better then purchasing an elevator pass if you don't want to support the devs) and the elevator (maps) cost is removed wich makes it easy to play as much as you want, how you want. the other energy however is still there :) but now you can only either buy pre-forged weapons or craft new weapons. (same as the old system)still sounds good doesn't it? :) offcourse it does! the energy system made it so you could play as much as you want. ok you COULD play as much as you want before but you needed to get the energy to do so wich was kinda pricy with ingame curency on lower lvl's (will come back on this too)so now on to something that (will) ruin(ed) the game for new players and players that still need to create A LOT of gear... the forge! just thinking about this thing makes me glad i got to play the game for so long (1100+ hours hehe) this is the demon that makes this game 100 times more grindy compared to pre-update. after this thing came out i created a few new pieces for my arsenal (wich was easy at first because it had all of the stuff needed to create them) but then came upgrading time... and i still wonder if the idiot who thought this would be ""fun"" was high on crack or something! this thing can REALY make you give up on a good game...and also an old problem that further emphasizes how bad the forge update actualy is. you guessed it... grinding for ingame curency and stuff to create/forge/upgrade gear.why it's never realy adressed, i don't know... but boss fights (and the levels leading up to) give you A LOT more money and mats then just playing the random levels. wich makes grinding boring REAL fast.

												For a free-to-play game, it was great.  I enjoyed most of my time playing with friends, and the large quantity of weapons and armors seemed very enjoyable.  However, the game has numerous difficulty spikes, along with areas that (thanks to newer updates) almost force you to pay to get the best type of armor you want.  However, thanks to the varying damages and damage resistances, as well as status effects, newer players are basically punished for not paying.  Although they have made quite a few changes to the game since it began, some of which making it much easier for newer players (such as doing away with elevator costs, and removing ""Mist energy"", they replace those things with more difficulty spikes.  Also, while the game is nice when you begin, and harder later on (forcing you to play with others, and hopefully good players at that), the other portions of the game (PvP, and the DLC's) are extremely lacking.  PvP is a mashup of horrible pings, buttmad children, and people using the game's auto-aim feature.  The DLC's offer you two things: A useless couple costumes, along with extra lives and such, or an extremely annoying (and difficulty spike filled) raid on a Gremlin base.  However, at the end you get an overpowered weapon, decent bomb, and the ability to make a decent gunner mask.  The story of the game is also lacking.  It seems almost like they aren't sure what to do with the game.  They have plenty of lore, whether it be about the Spiral Knight Order, or any of their enemies, however they seem to have nowhere to take the game's story from here.  The ""end"" of the game was supposed to be getting to the core to find an energy source and leave.  Instead, you get to the core, find out its locked, and have an option (if you save up a lot of in-game money, or pay roughly $7.50) to re-play any of the four boss levels, only more satanic, leading you to believe that you're in that world's version of hell, perhaps.  However, the game stops there.  It leaves so many questions that I'm sure everyone wants answered.  What happened to the recon unit, what happened to the Shadow Lairs, what happens to Warmaster Seerus, what is in the core, or even if you will escape?Sadly, i've been playing this game for around two years, and in my time they havn't added much in story progression since then.  I'll reccomend the game now, but I feel they're losing players, and if they don't finish the story in a good way, or at least expand more, the game will kinda get empty, and eventually die.

												If I was writing this review 2 years ago I would say, ""HELL YEAH! PLAY DIS♥♥♥♥♥♥♥"" but as time moved on there was a new update which gave the game a new overhaul of mechanics. For those who are unfamiliar you might not notice any difference, but back then there was an energy system that stopped players from playing or reviving in the dungeons when they ran out; this was known as the mist energy system. You were allowed up to have up to 100 mist each day which would be used for crafting, elevator fees to get to missions, and revives. As much as I complained about the old system to my friends, it still had a nice balance to the f2p model, since if you went into the dungeons others can help pay the fees and other players can revive teamates by giving them part of their health. This idea allowed for more cooperative play with others and made the community more nice. Even though some may argue the idea that restrcting time played was a bad thing, I think it was a good idea, especially considering that those who play games for hours on end eventually get bored of playing them. Think of how the horrible android and ios games keep others playing, because they don't tire out the game the whole day through charging towards beating it. Besides if you liked the game and wated to continue playing for as much as one wants you could support the devs and pay real life money for energy (ingame currency) for as low as 2 bucks!Now to fast forward to today, the overhual update ripped the energy system which means no more elevator fees, good right? Well for that reason alone, yes, but as for what happens to the balancing I didn't think it was worth it. Now that you can play as much as you desire, the devs needed to add more artificial time which creates the lovely mmo sin of grinding. Grinding is a standard for many f2p mmo's but this game takes it to a new extreme. If you weren't a vanguard (the highest level in the game) before the update then you would most likely never reach that feat without sacrificing your time away for social life, friends, family, every other game, or even talking on the phone before you can possibly think to reach the next rank. (Yes most of that was exaggerated, but it is the slowest leveling process I have ever experienced to date.) For players who aren't badass vanguards with their awesome guild will most likely be spending their time grinding for months, the game looses its playability and gets boring and stale. Another major complaint is that revives can no happen by someone sacrificing health for others, nope! Instead they decided to go with another approach to balance the game for making profits, which is the sparks of life system. You NEED sparks of life in order to revives or wait as you team goes to the next floor. If you run out well too bad for you now go buys some more. I know someone will argue that you can buys some from the auction house, while yes that is true it also gives another reason to grind even more beside leveling and gear which you need in order to progress to the next rank.Now to talk about pvp! Oh boy what to say...well if you aren't a vanguard with high level gear and an awesome team full of vanguards also with high quality gear, then you will always die in an unfair fight. The reason why this happens is because the matching system has the same algorithm system as christianmingle.com (no offense to christians of any sorts) and will pair you up against a team that out guns you the whole way, so no pvp unless you are high level with good gear and a good team of friends or a guild. This system was broken before and after the overhual update so that aspect would be a complaint either way.Now we get to talk about content and updates, ""oh goody, tehehehehe!"" *Ahem* I don't exactly know who to point my finger at but I'm going to direct the blame towards Sega since publishers usually have more control over monotization and content updates than the actual developers. Sega I'm sorry to have to inform that, costumes and outfits don't count as extra content as those are asthetics that you only buy, thus the word monotise comes in. Content should be more updates to add to the game that will give it more play time and replayability not a cheap ploy and tactic to make more money besides the ludicrous sparks of life system. Now content in this game is just an expansion to the new minigame called ""auction house madness"" (yes I made that up) which means that if you want to get access to the new ""content"" well then go grind for three months to buy them from the auction house or just use your real life money to exchange it for ingame currency. I am not ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ you I once put $20 into this game when I returned to play with my friends and guess where most of the want to... yep you are most likely correct, a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ costume! I am ashamed of myself for not realizing what I fell for, and then I bought 20 sparks of life that I shared with my friends and our guild, to which we then ran out within the first week in order to not start over on the rediculous boss fights that we were not prepared for. I now hate Sega and I will never trust them with ANY game, period! Do NOT put any money into this game, I swear, I hate everything that the corrupt publishers in this industry stand for and ruining our favorite games. If you do spend money after reading this review then shame on you, you don't derserve to be viewed as a gamer as they would not stand for the♥♥♥♥♥♥Now for a little story: Spiral Knights was once a love for me, she would give me happiness and give my friends and I something to do when we were seeking a game to play. I mean sure she would sometimes just sit there after a certain amount of time but I would usually repay her kindness in full to which she then spent more time with us before the day was over. Unfortunately, she now has suffers from a mental dissorder that her step father induced to fullfill his greedy needs. As much as I hated to, we left her and never looked back.Now ending off after the cheesy story telling, I give this game a thumbs down with the side note of thanks Sega, you truely opened my eyes, now I know who lies behind the real ideas of what a gamer want and it defenitely wasn't you.

												I've played this game for ages, more than I want to admit, when the guild hall update came out, we had one of the top guild halls, we saved 20 million crowns to make sure of that, quite honnestly, I spent around 2000$ on this game over the course of a year and a half, had an online girlfriend on there for over a year, made friends; some of who I talk to till this day; one of which, my head GM of my guild and I are pretty much best friends.That being said, this game has every marking of a tax deductible. there has been no significant new content in about 2 years, the admins on any social media including their own website WILL ban you for saying anything negative, the incompetence of the staff is IMMENSE and there is a-lot of cronyism going on in the studio.on some occasions, I've had to contact the CEO directly to get anything done, this is not a normal practice for a game that once had such promise, when your staff basically favours certain players over others and exchange favours for e-stroking.I've left this game about a year ago now, around the month of january 2014, I couldn't handle the ridiculousness of a crappy studio like three rings anymore.It's a shame cause I made amazing friends on there, but my goodness, the people working there are awful. case in point, the gunner update took almost 2 years to release.thanks for the reskins OOO.

												I just noticed this sitting in my Steam library and the number of hours I've played on this game, I must say this is what defined my childhood. Around 6 years ago, the old community was as brilliant as ever, everyone was kind and always willing to help out newbies like me, I made so many friends by completing missions together and trading items, playing the game just always brought a smile to my face.However, those days are long gone. There is hardly anyone playing this game anymore compared to the activity from ~4-6 years ago, the current community is still gradually dying and there's much less chatter between players now in the haven. I feel this game is only on a steady decline until it is completely forgotten. I will always remember the good old days from this game, but it is not worth playing anymore.			",377,66,7,43,20,6,23

												A very fun game to start off with!Then after hours and hours of cartoony fun everything begins to grind to a halt, leveling your character becomes almost impossible without endless hours of grinding and at this point it becomes ""free to play, pay to win."" Other than this i have no problems with a great game.PROS:- Very good art.- Very fun level design.- Good mechanics.- Community is great, friendly, and always wanna help others!- Great game overall.CONS:- Becomes ""pay to win.""- Music can get repetitive and boring if you play for hours.My final rating: 8/10.Why? Although its pay to win, the hours of fun i've had with this game make up for it. Play the game, enjoy it (i promise you will), and then when you get to the point where you cant continue very well, decide wether you wanna buy lots of gear or not. its free unless you choose to pay, so go hard gamers! Try it out, you wont regret it!			",79,10,1,7,5,0,2

												~This game is pretty much dead~Pros:>Party system allows cooperation between up to four players within levels>Fun weapons and game play>Leveling up or heating weapons and armours is a rewarding experience>PvPCons:>Parties are now very difficult to form due to the fact that so few people play the game now>Levels are repetitive and unorginal.>Party team work used to be a thing until a new mechanic removed the ability for players to revive fallen team mates by sharing their remaining health, now each player needs to stock up on sparks of life, by finding them or buying them.>Leveling up gear is done by a mechanic called heat. Heat is basically experience and it's physically dropped by boxes and enemies. It used to be an acceptable grind to heat an item, which payed off by the rewarding feeling of accomplishment. This has been removed by the introduction of heat forges. Now you need to buy crystals to progress your weapon to the next level. Often you can find these crystals via random drops, however for higher level weapons you require hundreds of crystals per level and you'd be lucky to find 1 or 2 in a single run. Of course, the idea is that you pay money to level up your gear. If you're a serious player you'll want a lot of gear too, which entails a lot of money to simply do what you can do for free in any normal RPG game -Level up!>The current developers use SK to dredge money from players who love recycled cosmetics >PvP is dead.>All my friends are dead.>This game is dead.Rip.

												I would really like to be able to promote this game, but I can't. If it was about 2+ years ago I could, but that is not the case.First thing, do not be mislead by my amount of hours played. I started SK before it was brought to Steam, and refused to link my main account to my Steam account due to perpetual connectivity issues between the two. I have more hours logged on SK than I have on Terraria and Mincraft combined. They have changed the tutorial area from when I started, it is admittedly much better now. Has a minor storyline and teaches you how to use your various abilities. The game is much more approachable for newbies. Which is a definite plus. The removal of the energy system to do levels also means that newbies aren't restricted to 10 floors at max before they have to quit for about 24 hours (or pay money). That is all definite pluses.The issues start about mid-tier, or 3-star gear. 3-star fire crystals and alchemy orbs are incredibly hard to find. Too early and you get 2-star stuff, if you do the boss areas odds are you will get 4-star stuff... and you don't get the recipe to downgrade the 4-star fire crystals to 3-star until AFTER a mision that requires you to level up 3-star gear enough to be in full 4-star gear. This is a minor setback, the big setback is high tier equipment. You need 5-star alchemy orbs and fire crystals for that, and unlike earlier tiers you can not downgrade higher crystals to make them. To fully level a single piece of 5-star equipment is going to cost you 453 fire crystals... or about 50 runs of the boss mission. You have at minimum a shield, 2 weapons, armor, and helmet, at maximum 2 more weapons. So that is a minimum of 250 boss mission runs, or 350 at maximum. And that is just for your starting set of gear.But they don't want you to grind all that... they want you to buy the crystals. 50 5-star fire crystals costs 700 energy (cash shop currency), which is about 10-12 runs of the boss mission I mentioned, converting in game currency to cash shop currency (via a player run market). AKA NOT CHEAP!They introduced pets at one point, reworking the mineral system (which originally were used to help influence the dungeons and get you some easy currency as well) into a way to feed and level the pets. There are 3 color pets: red, purple, and yellow. There are 5 colored minerals... 2 of which, blue and green, have absolutely zero use. There are floors that are just horribly annoying to do, too high difficulty for too little payout. They're nice to experience, but a lot of groups will actively avoid them, to the point of waiting at the elevator at the end of a floor for 10 minutes to avoid such bad floors. Some floors, are amazingly fun. A lot of people hate Candlestick Keep, where an immortal ghost chases you, but I find them fun. Arenas are a blast, along with various other areas. But in comparison you can get Treasure Vaults... which are junk ironically, Compounds that are full of minis and are incredibly annoying, or Fiend floors... which a lot of people despise. The last constantly available boss was introduced well over 2 years ago. There are minor bosses you can fight once for daily missions, but actual bosses you can just decide to go fight there has not been a new one in ages. There has been more gear added, but it is mostly reskins of other weapons with stat changes. And its hard to level due to the incredibly annoying fire crystal system. PVP is even worse, it is dominated by people that have quite literally dropped $100s into the game by now. They have the best gear possible, my gear is high end (and I can do fairly well against them) but their stuff puts mine to shame, for the casual player you are just going to get beaten into the ground repeatedly. In addition to that if you don't have accessory slots (cash shop only!) than you are going to be at an even bigger disadvantage as everybody runs with health booster accessories. On a sadder note, the game is dying. It started when the chief developer left, and now various other devs have as well. At one point it was not uncommon to see a dozen instances of the town going. For one event my guild saw over 70 instances running. Now you are lucky to get 3, and none of them are showing as full.I really, REALLY want to be able to recommend this game... but I can't, not anymore. I love the art style, it is unique and cute and colorful. I love the music, Candlestick Keep has incredibly creepy but whimsical sounding music, the Wildwoods has beautifully fitting music for how its designed. I greatly like the atmosphere of the game, especially some of the areas created during the game's prime. The Wildwoods look amazing, as much as I dislike Compounds they look fantastic, and the Void is nicely threatening. The combat is fairly balanced in PVE until you hit high end. But I still can't recommend the game. Too many things have changed that just make it not player friendly anymore, and it shows.Edit: And the game just got bought from Sega by a company called Grey Havens. Hopefully it will be good for the game, but it might be too little too late, only time will tell on that one.			",107,23,1,13,4,0,13

												Spiral Knights is free to play online game. You play as a small knight and choose whatever color you want to begin with then start with a sword and gun. After you finish the basic tourtal of the mission you'll enter a world that is call Clockworks. They'll teach you how to heat your armors and wepons to make them stronger and how to learn recipes to make your own wepons and armors. Sence Spiral Knights updated to elevator energy cost you no longer need to pay 10 energy everytime so your free to explore the world. And you also would get one of the Battle Spirtes as a pet known as Drakon, Seraphynx and Maskeraith when you finish the three tourtal about each of there different skills then you'll have to decide on picking Drakon, Seraphynx and Maskeraith as you Battle Spirtes. They each have different type of battle skills. You'll have to go on missions and a lot of acrade runs for crowns, orbs and heats to level all away up to Vanguard. It take time to get there but it's a fun game to play.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Ah....this game..the memories.Spiral Knights was a wonderful game many years ago (2012, 2013). There were so many players, many guilds, amazing new events and just a lovely family. I may not of played this game that much, but i've had enough to get the experience of it. It really made me a happy person. The designing of your character was one of the best unique features in this game. Anyway,  I went off for a bit, and came back and everything went dead. The leading top guild died... (The Umpire), events became repetitive, everything was becoming a ""pay money for this"" kind of thing.  If you are to go on it nowadays, there are maybe MAX two guilds in the whole game still alive...and there are either only the poor or rich players. Lockdown (PVP) has died completely as everyone has left...the game has pretty much died completely. The Auction House where people buy the things and people sell has completely died too.. I miss it and i'm sure alot of other people do too. Don't play it, there is no point.--(Past Player Greywolfrb to anyone who knows me)EDIT: Grey Havens have taken over, hopefully they can bring the game to life again..			",25,2,0,6,0,0,3

												A puzzle-based, RPG, PVE/PVP, dungeon crawling game. Ever since the F2P update where you can actually find and work for items for free rather than pay energy to do literally everything, the game is now 100x better. Plenty of weapons, plenty of events (often prize box events though), plenty of customization, plenty of costumes. The PVE is probably one of the better Co-op PVE's out there, let alone it being free to play. However, it can be frusturating to farm for orbs to get weapons. If you get past that and do the missions given to you, it isn't a big deal. The market as well is completely capitalism based, so finding good deals can be tough unless you try your luck on auctioning. If you are outbid, you are refunded. I've been playing this the day it came out on steam, stopped because of the P2W♥♥♥♥♥♥ but came back again to this lovely update. Give it a shot, but get a friend why don't you.			",88,5,2,10,1,0,1

												Spiral Knights (SK) is a free-to-play MMORPG that I started playing in 2011.  I was instantly hooked on this simple game primarily due to the community of friends that played this game with me.  To understand the perspective of this review, I believe it would help to understand the type of player I was.  I reached the end-game completing every dungeon available.  I played at the top tier player-vs-player (PVP) level with - at the time - a vast variety of superior gear.   PROS: You do not need to invest a a single penny into SK to beat the game, or to enjoy it.  The majority of its paid content is cosmetic and to speed up the farming process.  The game can be played solo, but has its benefits for being played in a co-op party up to four players (random or friends).  These benefits include more loot drops, a teammate revival system, and the normal benefits with playing with a party of friends.  There is no character leveling system, and your advancement comes from upgrading your armor and weapons.CONS: For an MMORPG, however, SK has many flaws.  The game does not offer a spell casting system (aside from the addition of pets in late 2013), only the choice of swords, guns, bombs, and a shield.  By and large, swords are the superior weapon of choice, though balances over the course of 4 years have attempted to narrowed this superiorty gap.  In addition, the game is extremely limited in its end-game content, with the storyline still not being completed for over 3 years.  SK is constantly riddled with latency issues, and simple balances suggested by the community are largely ignored despite the community's desire to be involved with the direction that SK will take.Verdict: SK is honestly a cute, fun, and simple game.  The game has undergone a variety of changes over the several years it has been out; these changes are largely aesthetic, however.  SK suffers from the lack of new content and a completed storyline.  It is plagued with latency issues and the lack of balancing.  While I would recommend more avid gamers to look into other free MMORPG game such as Warframe, Vindictus, or Neverwinter.  SK does draw from its strengths - being cute, free, and simple - and it can truly offer many hours of fun memories with the right group of players.			",166,34,3,11,13,1,36

												As much as I want to recommend this game, I simply can't.I have filled this game with 700 hours of my lifetime, and I do not regret them. I enjoy this game and I surely as hell will be playing it more and stack hours ontop of hours playing this game. The thing is, I can't recommend it to new people to play it. This game is a huge grind. A huge grind doing the exact same thing over and over. If you actually want to make progress in the game then be prepared to farm like you have never farmed before because the resources you need to progress are pretty time consuming to get. If you are going to be a new player, you will not be able to get very far unless you are willing to spend a huge chunk of your life playing this game. Grinding and farming your way all the way to get that full set And even then, you are going to need to farm for your life to get that gear upgraded to it's full potential. Eventually you will get there, but it's extremely time consuming.Futhermore, this game gets updated quite frequently with COSMETICS, stuff that looks flashy and pretty cool, but you get it by spending alot of real money on the game or FARMING TWICE AS MUCH AS YOU USED TO. Other then that you won't get any big updates with content. We got the gunner update I think a year after it was supposed to be released(not sure?) and that's it.If farming and grinding is your thing, then I would say go for it.If you are willing to spend ALOT of time on this game, I'd say go for it.If you are willing to spend alot of real money and be a buyfag, I'd say go for it.Perhaps it is fun to try it out once to never play it again since the gameplay is happy with flashy colours and whatnot, but other then that I really recommend you to spend your worthy time on something much more productive.

												Honestly, after playing this game for years and spending hours upon hours and multitudes of my money I can say that while this is/was a rock solid MMO and I had nothing but fun in it, I cannot recommend it to play to anyone. It's far to dead, the golden has all but faded into ashes at our feet and the few players left either don't care and are merely waiting for the game or are just denying the inevitable. The PVP used to be awesome, full teams Tiers 1-3 hundreds of players and competition and while there was a meta fun weapons could always be found. Now it's nothing but AAcheron to win and full BK and if you don't have that or a derivitive some othe rplayer will and they'll dumpster your day. The PvE oh man, where do i begin. Before missions and all those updates it was one of the funnest, most explorative, planned, and beautiful creations I had ever seen in a game like this. But now it's nothing but a shodw of its former self. The enemies were fun, diving was a challenge that required planning and a variety of gear. It was fun to meet up with other knights and plan a party so you could do an entire boss run together. Now, you just need 3 swords, a gun, and one set of armor and you can carry your way through the entire game. The art, it's so freaking beautiful. The concept, the execution, was all amazing. Again, it has become a shadow of what it once was. In the end, this game is exactly that a shadow. It's fallen from it's once great perch to a low where it still could be an amazing game but it simply lacks the support and desire to become anything.The sad truth, is this game was a solid 10/10 amazing game to play and I would love nothing more than to go 2-3 years back in time and replay the best moments of my life in this game. but as of today, while it's still a great game i don't want anyone to get sucke din and then leave feeling empty.

												I used to play this game back in 2012. It used to be pretty fun, and the community was great. Lots of people willing to give you a hand if you need it in a mission, and the grinding was fair (unless you're aiming for an expensive costume or furniture, which would then take some time). I even created my own guild in this game, and our guild was pretty well-known amongst the older members of the community. But if the game was that good, then why did I give it thumbs down? First, notice the past tense, ""was"". I don't deny the game was fun in the past, and I still visit this game from time to time purely due to nostaligia. But, to sum it up, this game really lacks development. In these 4 years I've been playing, there have not been much new content. Money was not an issue to the devs, but the devs just became money craving maniacs. To be fair to them, it wasn't always like that. But after the update where the forging system was introduced, elevator fee removed, and battle sprites came out (about 2 years ago approximately), the devs basically stopped pushing out any new content. Instead, they went for the ""costume hype"" and reskinned tons of costumes just so that people are more willing to spend their money in this game. Barely any of that money went into the game however. The levels were the same, and the grinding becomes increasingly more and more boring. In the meantime, while more and more older members of the community leaves the game due to boredom, the community becomes worse and worse as a result. Now no one's willing to help out a poor guy who just needs some help on a boss unless they pay up. The game just doesn't feel the same anymore as a result. About a year ago, the devs might've finally sensed that their game is going down the drain, and finally released some new content, the mysterious core itself. However, I can't help but express my disappointment. While the storyline might finally be ""complete"", the levels themselves were just a reuse of old things. Same level designs, same textures, even the monsters are just copied from shadow lairs. In other words, the devs did absolutely nothing except piecing together a few new levels from pre-exisiting levels. Even the ending of the game is just like the ending of a shadow lair run, which was introduced way before this update was pushed out. In the meantime, the prices and the grinding in the game reaches the point of insanity. It bores me to the point where I'd rather go and ""play"" Cookie Clicker than spending another hour just to do another ""vana run"" just to get those radiant crystals. You can argue that everyone will eventually be bored by these grinding type of games, but at least they're fun with friends. This game achieves the extraordinary, in that you'll find these vana runs boring even if you're with your friends. Why? Because the grinding is real. Be prepared to run Vanaduke 100 times if you want to heat your 5 star weapon from level 1 to 10 fail-proof. 30 would probably be the minimum if you're lucky enough to get the level up on the 30% success forges (they rarely succeed, I really doubt if it's 30% at all). Since each run takes an hour give or take, be prepared to spend 50-100 hours just to heat ONE piece of 5 star equipment. Please note that your knight have at least 4 5 star equipments you need to heat before you can become a Vanguard. So if you're not the kind of guy who want to spend 500+ hours in this game grinding your head off, then I recommend you don't waste your time on this game. I wasted 1500 hours on this game total (including my time on my old Steam account), and I must say I seriously regret it. Don't be like me. 2/10, would not grind again.  ",23,1,2,1,3,0,8

												Spiral Knights is free to play cooperative dungeon crawler fantasy MMORPG.The player begins as a simple knight, and jump into action with an ever-changing, randomized world known as the Clockworks. Players can influence the areas they enter by depositing different minerals into the gates before they open. As players level up, they can upgrade their equipment or craft new items.Every Spiral Knight has two attacks: one primary attack with a melee weapon and one special attack. You start with a gun but can later gain access to bombs, and your arsenal is constantly changing as you defeat new enemies and learn to manufacture new weapons.One of Spiral Knights' greatest strengths is its art direction. Enemies are somehow a combination of threatening and adorable, armor upgrades make your Knight look both tough and huggable, and every environment you visit has tons of cool elements that make it interesting and distinct from the others in the game.Spiral Knights is a wonderful game. It is beautifully designed and fun to play and offers hours of interesting combat in a variety of environments.But there's one enormous catch: You have to pay real-life money to play Spiral Knights if you plan to play it for more than an hour at a time. Almost everything you do in Spiral Knights costs Energy. If you want to run a mission it costs 10 Energy, if you want to go to the second level of the dungeon it will be again 10 Energy. You start every day with 100 Energy, which you will quickly consume through normal gameplay.Overall, Spiral Knights is a fun, engaging, pretty game. So if you have nothing else to do, you can check it out.Sounds 6/10Graphics 7/10Gameplay 7/10Atmosphere 6/10If you liked my review, please feel free to follow me and/or my curator group:http://steamcommunity.com/id/Ov3RT4K3R/myworkshopfiles/?section=guideshttp://steamcommunity.com/groups/orcollective#curationAlso feel free to check out my YouTube Channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC83DYCmrWfl9ttrhX54jmWA ",1592,618,71,238,229,30,272

BackstoryObviously, spoilers are shaded. Mouse over them if you want to see them.The spiral knights, a group of aliens running away from the Morai(an antagonistic group that next to nothing is known about) on their space ship called ""Skylark"", are shot down by a mysterious force, and the civilization crashes on the planet ""Cradle."" 4 spiral knights, known as the alpha squad, dived into the mantle of the planet before anyone else could, but mysteriously disapeared as they approached the center of the planet,being chased by the ""living shadows"".Beneath the surface of the planet are many worlds, natural and artificial. In some of these worlds, there are notes left by the alpha squad, regarding their journey through that area. The core is a massive unnatural metal sphere at the center of the planet. It contains a massive amount of energy, but it's sealed off, with no known way to open it.At the end of the game, however, it is opened, and the ""living shadows"" are leeching off of its power.The purpose of the Spiral Order is to rescue the Alpha Squad, wherever they are, and to exploit the infinite energy of the core to restore their spaceship.GameplayAt the beginning of the game, you create your knight. You can choose their eye color, eye shape, height, name, and armor(all the armors at the start have the same stats). After this you are shown the basic controls.

In the game itself, you are running through levels, defeating enemies with swords, bombs, and handguns, and protecting yourself with your helmet, armor, and shield. There is also selectable missions you can do to advance in the game's story.

Also, when you aren't running through the clockworks(the areas beneath the surface of the planet), you can talk with your fellow knights in haven, a town on the surface. There, you can also buy items from the ""strangers"", or other knights selling them in the Auction House.

The game's currency is called crowns. Every time you kill a monster, they drop crowns. You can also gain crowns by selling some of your stuff.

You can make your gear stronger several different ways. The main way is through heat, which also drops off defeated monsters. Another way is to craft up your item. The last way is through Unique Variants(commonly abbreviated UV). These have a random chance of being generated when you make an item, and apply a permanent random boost to that item. There can be 3 UVs on one piece of equipment.

As you venture in the clockworks, you can fight by yourself, or with up to 3 other people in most cases. The only exception to this rule is the gamemasters, who can join even when your party is full.I love this game, but it has some SERIOUS drawbacks.This is a great game, even though some aspects of it make me want to curl up and die.Here is my list of pros and cons(don't worry, I'll explain these later).Pros:  GameplayStoryEasy to play(mostly)Shadow LairsNice first playthroughCons: GameplayCommunityRarityShadow Lairs2nd+ PlaythroughsThe gameplay is fun, especially if you like dungeon crawlers. I had never played a game like this before, and I loved it. The game is easy for new people to pick up, and you can make the game harder if you want to. The first time through the game is really fun, because unless you spoiled the story to yourself, the story is really deep and interesting. If you care nothing about Super-Endgame-Epic spoilers, read the hidden text following:The core is a prison designed by ""The Architect""(presumably Tinkinzar) to contain the deity(the Sleeper) inside it, and to protect it from the ever-strengthening swarm(the ""living shadows""), which it failed to do. The alpha squad is inside the core, fighting the swarm as it grows. The ""Extra"" modes, the Shadow Lairs, are freaky, fun, and offer awesome prizes...that is, if you can find actual good people to do them with, leading to my cons.These cons can drive me NUTS, as much as I hate to say it. Yes, I listed ""Gameplay"" in both categories. The gameplay is fun in most cases, but the thing I hate the most about it has to do mostly with the weapons in the game. Some of the weapons are obviously superior for stupid reasons than other weapons in their same star catagory, like how the cutter series(this is the actual set of weapons I use in the game because its fun, poses a challenge, and actually requires a strategy to use) is pointless simply due to that half of its attacks don't hit (which is supposed to be this weapon's main selling point), and some people would venture further to say that it's awful because all of its lines do pure normal damage, which means it won't do next-to-nothing against anything, but it won't do tons of damage against anything either. Moving on to the community. I have met a group of GREAT people on this game that I hang out with alot. However, the majority of the game community is stuck up, because the people greater than other people refuse to teach the newbs how to get better, and only tell them what they mess up in. They also judge people for their weapon choices. Like how I didn't choose the statistically best weapon cuz I don't want to feel too strong and make the game too easy to beat, thus killing fun.Becoming stronger in this game has been a pain since day one. My main problems come from all the types of rarity, for the same simple and annoying reasons. On crafting, the orbs are stupidly rare, and it's hard enough to get the specific type you are looking for. On forging, the problem mostly only applies to 5* items. The fire crystals are too rare, like before, and you need like 30 of the 5* ones to do anything with a large chance of failing, and if you can't find them, you're stuck with a weapon that is weaker than the one you had directly before it. Also, if your LUCKY, you might find 9 of those 30-90 fire crystals in ONE FSC run! YAY! SoLs are annoying also. Too rare, and too little benefit. The ones you get can literally be drained in one stratum, and the only benefit is the likely meh loot in that stratum.I also mentioned the S. Lairs twice, once in each catagory. I hate it because it costs a ton to get in it, and unless you do it on the hardest possible setting, your stuck doing it yourself, while paying about 150,000 crowns to do it for the slight chance of getting epic gear at the end. AND, you will probably pay another 30,000 crowns to revive yourself. Despite the monstrous costs, the most annoying part is the community again. As I stated before, most strong enough people won't join you unless you do it on elite, effectively slimming your chance of getting that gear your looking for. Even if you offer to let them in free on an easier difficulty level, they still mostly won't go with you. I know this from experience.Another thing I found out is that playing the game more than once is boring, because of the cons listed above.All In AllI love this game, but be warned that their is significant downsides to the game.The main way to overcome most of these issues is to get some nice friends to play with you, then spend the majority of the game working together. Or you can play by yourself and do what the stuck-up pros tell you to do: git gud(I HATE THAT).Also, kinda off topic, but when people ask you for money, help them ACQUIRE it so they can gain battle experience. It'll keep you wealthy, and they will become smarter with the game's mechanics.GAME RATINGStoryline: 10/10Unique and interesting.Gameplay: 5/10Fun for a while, but becomes monotonous.Graphics: WHO SHOULD CARE?I  love the graphics. Why does the gaming community judge games they play by the graphics? That's also stuck-up.OVERALL: 7.5/10 ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The opening elements of this game have all that are required to get one started for the Free 2 Play MMO: a few tutorials and free items, and a bright colorful atmosphere and some playerbase. This is the hook for new players. The puzzle/combat atmosphere is artistically wonderful, but becomes second after a while. Eventually after 2/3's of the game is complete comes the end game grind wall. There is no true reliable way to level up gear without spending days searching for ennough material. The outlook of the game shifted 2 years ago in 2013 after the lead developer left the game, and has since become a stale promotional money grab for the developer with scarce new content, and only random chance boxes with the only new content weapons and gear at incredibly low percentages at around <5%. Recolored costumes every two weeks, and no attempts to keep long veteran players. Do not play this game unless you want to become addicted and subject to false advertisement that perpetuates dead shovelware.			",57,5,0,2,4,0,3

												It was quite fun when I got it, and still great 900 hours later. Not many free games have the very positive reviews this one does, and guess what? OOO eliminated the mist energy system. Players can now play unlimited levels! There's PvP, PvE, and a pretty decent chat system. Players can play with their friends or with random people, or even alone.Even with the mist system I would still recommend it, and without that limitation I definitely suggest that people play this. It  doesn't have very heavy graphics requirements and can run well on dinosaur computers on low.The developers are updating, slowly but surely.			",55,8,7,7,7,0,5

												This is a neat little game which isn't for everybody, But i personally enjoy it.Pros (Hopefully with meaning)+Easy and quick-to-learn controls make the players able to quickly adapt to the game.+Fun and challenging level design keeping you on your toes with enemies and puzzles.+Fun and challenging bossfights with great different mechanics to defeat each one.+Easy to see everything on screen due to it being mostly top-down display.Cons (With yet again, Hope of meaning)-Can get repetetive with the grinding.-Hard to beat the lowest-down (aka hardest) levels without friends on board.-Playing with random people can be frustrating without proper communications.-The crafting system requires lots of grinding to be done to gain the resources for each item.In short its a well-balanced game and fun for people who enjoy quick bursts of action, time-taking puzzles and lots of multiplayer fun!(Yes, I took time out of my sleeping pattern to write this review, Thats how sad i am.)

												Despite the significantly lower player base and also my recent inactivity on the game, I still feel that I'm obliged to provide my own insight into this game that I've invested quite a bit of time into.To start off, Spiral Knights is basically a hack-and-slash multiplayer RPG that enables players to explore the depths of the Clockworks, fight monsters, play through a story(-ish) mission mode and engage in player-versus-player minigames. Boss battles, swarms of enemies, hazardous environments, the like. However, there's more than just combat when it comes to player-player interactions as the game. The game's other features include:- Item trading between players, and an Auction House system that enables players to buy/sell their items for in-game currency.- Guilds and Guild Halls where players can get together, share items such as weapons and materials, access most shops within short distances from each other, and craft trophies using materials dropped from bosses. Guild halls have a required upkeep that guild members need to pay weekly. Teamwork!- Sword/Gun/Armour/Bomb crafting system which allows players to equip their arsenal to suit their battle needs.- Upgrades to gear called Unique Variants that add bonuses to the gear and have a chance of being obtained during crafting or can be randomly applied to gear for a fee.- Costumes/Accessories that players can use to add their own artistic touch to their armour, with the large number of items and colour schemes available, the possibilities are almost endless!- Events that go in rotations throughout the year, as well as annual holiday events that give players the chance to obtain items and gear that are related to the event's theme, some of which have special characteristics that no other items have!- An alternate currency (Energy) that can be purchased using real money and can be used to purchase items and gear directly from an in-game store (Supply Depot) or even converted to the regular in-game currency.I think there are more features but those are what I came up with off the top of my head. Personally, the game can be quite fun, especially for people who love slashing, smashing and blasting monsters in a cute, anime-style fashion. There are three weapon classes, swords, guns, and bombs, and none are necessarily better than the other. The game's battle mechanics may seem simple since most of the time since spamming attacks usually does the job. This makes the learning curve easy because learning to incorporate movement with one's attacks makes a pretty solid player, however the skill ceiling is a little higher due to techniques such as shield-canceling, shield-bashing, charge attacks and using status effects to one's advantage. Upgrading your gear up to 5-star isn't very difficult but it does need some time.I understand that some of the people reading this may be (or may have been at some point) regular SK players and might think that this combat stuff is a little pointless, but that's just because we do it so much that it just becomes a habit and that it's ""easy peasy"" and that makes it a little more difficult to look at these things objectively.The player base and community are mostly very laid back, very chill, and I've met some pretty awesome people on my journey (You know who you are :P). Most people would be more than happy to give you a hand on a mission or on a Clockworks raid, either for completion purposes or just to help you make some cash. Yes, there may be a couple of rude players or scammers here and there but I prefer to look at the big picture and say that they won't totally ruin your experience of the game itself.Summary:- The game looks neat and simple, it's not overdone for the most part, however when it comes to costumes and accessories it can be a little tiring to have the same items released but in a different colour scheme. The NPC artwork is cool. Overall quite pleasing to look at.- Combat mechanics are easy to learn, whether using swords, guns, or bombs. Weapons have different attack speeds and damage types. Monsters have resistances and weaknesses to certain damage types and makes weapon choice important. PvP has quite a high skill ceiling, but weapons with 'Attack Speed Increase' or 'Charge Time Reduction' Unique Variants, armour with 'Defense Increase' Unique Variants, and trinkets with health or attack speed boosts certainly do help. But I guess the main enemy in PvP is lag. :P- Helpful and nice player base, the game is more fun when played with others, also allows for coordinated gameplay (most of the time).			",22,2,0,0,1,0,0

												It's a rather fun game on the journey to get to end-game. Once you're at end-game however, the game more or less runs out of new content to offer, updates providing new content do not come out often either. The downloadable content mission is worth a try as it is one of the more difficult dungeons in the game. Playing with a full party of friends you know makes the game greatly more enjoyable l've found. A unique game that is worth a look at the very least.			",144,12,0,18,7,0,5

												Long time player of Spiral Knights. Used to be blocked from Steam due to Asia rights of the game being sold to another company.This game was created by Three Rings, then bought by SEGA, which promptly turn this game into a microtransaction costume simulator. No more new contents, every seaonal events are rehash of previous years, and game became extremely grindy.Now it is in the hands of Grey Havens, former employees of Three Rings (http://forums.spiralknights.com/en/node/114101). I am not sure what plans they have for the game, but I hope they'd think hard about introducing actual new contents. The game needs new mechanics, the old ones have already been driven into a corner. To make the game fun again, big changes are required.As it is now, it's a no from me.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Spiral Knights is a great game. Mechanically it plays well. It has very interesting and rich lore. The enemies are creative and inventive. All of the art is pleasant to look at and very well detailed. The cooperative play is great and even has voice communication. This game has changed a lot since it came out and most of the changes were positive. They have added a ton of content that repeatedly pulled me back in from other games that I moved to.The game no longer sees these huge updates. The caring support and community inclusion is no longer there. With the departure of senior developers and the management of Sega has left the game as a cash-grab at best. It has become a money sink with no real reason to put money into it. Most users quickly learn this and the playerbase has been on a steady rotation for some time.I used to love this game and it is still definitely the game that I loved, but without bringing in drastically new content it has stagnated and can no longer hold my interest. New players be warned.			",160,13,1,21,4,3,13

												For the most part, its a long boring grind.Not at first.But after you burn through the missions, see most of the arcade levels, and the novelty of PvP wears off, it is all you are left with, and in my opinion, this process happens fairly quick.Unless you are looking for a boring grind with a learning curve, you probably should not play this game, you can pay to skip the grind, but seeing as the grind is 80% of the game it will only make the content end faster. At the time of posting, the community is pretty much dead, and still dying, the in-game economy isnt looking so good either.Personally i plan to continue to play, its a decent way to burn some time, but its definitly not for everyone.

												I have a love hate relationship with this game, I love the artwork and content (even though some say it needs more and it does, it is slowly dying) I can 100% say there is no other game like this game and that is what makes it so special. Pros: Missions give you access to gear and items needed to play the game, they start from the beginning armor to end game gear (nothing thats 100% wanted but it gives you access to play end game content).There is an arcade side of the game, which was the original concept. 4 gates consisting of 29 floors, but only 24 floors that have monsters. The arcade gates change every 7 days and its random, so every arcade run you do will be different from the last. If you wanna merchant, there is plenty of promos you can sink your money into. Cons: There is a ton of promos, one every 2 weeks. They throw promos out like they are candy and are not working toward new content and game updates. If you have to submitted a support ticket then you should expect 2-48 hours of waiting for a reply. This is how they get money out of you, they force you into paying for in-game items with real money cause you cant contact support when you have issues of not getting back into a party. The Develops and Gm's are not dedicated to running this game, and their minds are only after $$$$, but you are thinking what gaming company is not only after $$$$? All of them are, for the most part, but this one is one of the worst ones because as I stated they refuse to help you if you need help. I've heard ""sorry we couldnt help you out in time, maybe next time"" after they expected the rest of my party to wait 2-3 hours for me to get back into the party. You need to see this game as it truely is, It is only about pretty costumes and accessories and thats it. This game is mainly used to see who looks the best and as a chat room. Just think of this game as a chat room version of Tinder with mini games to play like PvP and missions etc. So end point is no i wouldn't recommend this game.			",163,95,1,33,17,0,22

You might like if: You want a free-to-play without a catch and you enjoy cute hack-and-slash titles that are easy to get into but have sufficient depth of customisation to keep its content rich later on.One of the original 5 Steam Free-to-Plays. It was brilliant then and still quite formidable now. It's strength is that nothing is ultimately hidden behind a paywall and you're not bombarded with constant advertising. All of the content is (to my knowledge) available... you just have to work for it. You can spend real money to speed things up and get goodies more frequently - but it's entirely optional.The game itself is a simple Zelda-esque hack-and-slash where you take control of a knight, armed with a shield and 2 weapons of your choice from swords, pistols or bombs. It's elegantly simple but with sufficient skill required to master it. You navigate random, procedurally generated levels (or scripted missions) taking out a variety of foes - descending further into the game, where harder enemies, better loot and bosses lurk... All the while learning and crafting better kit (with plenty of room to really specialise later on). It's very easy to get into and is delightfully warm and charming; both in its cute aesthetics and fun music.You can play solo or form a team of up to 4 knights for an expedition - luckily, the enemies strengthen accordingly, so it doesn't necessarily make things easier  (i.e. you're not penalised if you want some solo runs).My only qualm is that, since its inception, some of the updates have made the game a tad overcomplicated. The crafting gets a bit puzzling where, in addition to normal recipe items, you now need fire to level up your kit (where before it levelled up as you played), alchemy orbs to craft new kit, special food to feed your pet and rare items to evolve them... All of which are found in different ways. You can get the hang of it - but it's a bit much upfront.But it's nice to see Spiral Knights still getting some love and updates since 2011. Whilst the new inability to revive teammates is a shame - the trade-off is that they've removed the previous limit on how many levels a player could enjoy in a day (without spending in-game currency) - so you can at least play a lot more now.... oh, and it's free which, all things considering, it's pretty phenomenal for the content.

												Spiral Knights is a multiplayer Legend of Zelda with an arcade feel and a cute steampunk flair. The game sounds and looks beautiful, handles very well, and has a lot of replayability.However, that replayability can only be stretched so far, and recently it's been in dire need of a new update or expansion. But, new players still have hours of entertainment ahead of them if they wish to dive in! Grab three friends and head deep into the clockworks, slashing, shooting, and exploding your way through puzzles and minions alike.			",205,76,2,37,13,4,30

												This game was fun at first, but then the game started getting bad when the game developers started ruining the game based on choices that traded off fun for money.The game has an amazing art-style and conept all together, but when you've played it for as long as I have, or anyone else for that matter - you begin to question what to do now. I've beaten all the bosses, I've played all the levels and events, and now I'm sitting here waiting for something new. Now I'm sure that OOO actually added a few things, but most of it is costumes or items that are more than likely literally P2W by forcing you to buy their prize boxes and hope you get their exclusive reskin/unique weapons.The only thing keeping this game alive right now is the unfinished plot we're all waiting to complete (ei: The Core), reoccuring events if you didn't build the weapons, and the Gunner Update that's been delayed in a Half-Life 3 ways. (""It'll be released when it's ready."")			",185,63,1,17,16,3,14

												This game stole my soul for a month straight. I must of been drunk or something but I only have good memories of this game. They have ruined this game for me with the recent updates but hey, what do I know. From experience I say this game is worth the $0.00 dollars you pay and you should try it, you just might like it!

												If you live in a country far away from where the servers are located, this game would be perfect for testing your patience and anger management.* Think you dodged a rocket? Think again...* Think you blocked an attack with your sheild? Nope.* Jumped out of the way to evade an attack? Too slow!* Think you switched your weapon? Let me use the first weapon for you!* Ran over retracted spiked floor? Nope, let me take some life off you for good measure* Finished your 2 strike combo attack? Let me repeat that last swing for you so you can get hit during the animation while not doing any damage to the monsters!* Have a personal ADSL2+ connection that averages 11.5Mbps and have thrown money at the game?  Thanks, we will gladly take your money, here have some extra lag.But that is ok because if you die, you can use spark items to revive. Ran out of life sparks? Sure, no problem! The in game shop has plenty for sale for real money!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Great game that was ruined because devs got greedy and lost their way. It was fun couple of years ago (2011) when I played it and I did buy energy using real money to support the game and dev team. I only did it once and for the $20 I got plenty of things. In fact I might be one of the few players who managed to beat the game and get all but one achievement. If my memory serves me right it was the deposit X amount of crystals which I never earned since I quit playing.Why am I writing the review now? Well because I was feeling nostalgic and was curious to see what has changed. Sadly the game has gone downhill, you can no longer make profit in the AH and sell stuff to buy energy, they removed the energy system but added lots of cosmetics and ♥♥♥♥ that ruins the core gameplay unless you pay constantly. I wish I could recommend the game because the atmosphere and animations are quite fun, but I cannot. You might be able to get couple of hours out of it but don’t expect to accomplish much without paying ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ of money. p.s. Game is written in Java so expect memory leaks and random crashes.

												I'm so sick of all the kids who download this game to get the free tf2 hat and say the achievement doesn't work and just leaves a bad review. If you have nothing good to say, then get out of this community, because that is the cancer of Spiral Knights.This game is just a simple dungeon crawler game with a lot of good mechanics. It might be irritating to play, but when you reach a high rank and you find the item that you need. You feel happy inside.I suggest actually giving this game a try. I have been playing this game from 2013-2016 (I quit for two years), and I always loved the game, I didn't quit because I was bored, I quit because I didn't have any time.I highly suggest this game to someone who has a lot of time.

												I know, I have 1,500 hours in this game and i dont recomend it. Well It's for a reason;    For starters i got into it and i was hyped, It was so cool so many different things tons of stuff, but i realised this isn't a good game. Here's why:1: The game has low content. Three rings doesn't focus on it the way they should, Instead they focus on another game with less players and less activity.2: The community is♥♥♥♥♥♥ Litterally the whole community is horrible. I mean there is some exceptions and I've met some good friends on there, but the majority is crap. They all have a GIANT ego and if you insult it your automatically put into hated and you really have a horrible time. Also they all brag about how much ""Ingame money"" they have and it gets annoying, I will say why in a minute.3: Three rings made a good game but they ruined it: Okay I know you guys are like ""No they didn't!"" Well yes they kinda did. For starters it is SO hard to get ingame money legit. They have it to where everything is high priced you would want, but if you pay for it you can get rich with about $100. That means that the majority of the community is pay to win and they brag about the money that came out of their mom's wallet. Another thing is they post little to no content i said it before, but im saying it again this game is so low content.4: What they do with the money: So we all know sonic is dead, Yes I know i have a tails' picture as my profile pic, but Sonic was kinda over done, it also didn't survive the leap to 3D. So what 3 Rings is doing with the money you spend on the game is handing it over to sega, giving them money to make more sonic games. 5: The gameplay is♥♥♥♥♥♥ Now I said that grinding in the earlier here's a close up on that. For 1 you have to put in 100+ man hours to get to the max level with good gear. For 2 The money grind on the max level is hard, you have to do a last boss mission that takes 30 minutes to do for a small sum of 8,000 crowns. That means on a saturday a regular person would go from 12:00 Pm- 10:00 Pm is only making about 20 runs a day and 160,000 crowns, which is a small amount.Thats my complaints it really could be a good game if they fixed them but their not gonna do that anytime soon. Thank you for reading.			",33,1,2,3,4,0,3

												tfl;dfr : A pretty good free 50 ~ 1337 hour game with good gameplay mechanics.This is a review of the actual game, not going to mentioning my unbelievable lag because of how far I lived from the servers. Not mentioning how much the community in pvp complains like no tomorrow or how the developers only updates the game with actual content once every 2 years. Nope, none of that, no where in this guide shall I write about any of that.Spiral knights is developed by three rings design ( also the developers of the popular online puzzle game, puzzle pirates ) and published by sega. Spiral knights ( SK ) is a Hack 'n slash MMORPG zelda type game. SK is a 2D imensional game in a 3D environment. It has a birdseye view, slightly tilted so that you can see a lot more going on at the top than in the bottom-- I don't need to go over this stuff, right?Gameplay : SK is a dungeon crawler based game, it's not sandbox/open world.WeaponsThere are a crap load of weapons. There are three main weapon typesGuns, Swords,Bombs.And then for each of these, there are 4 types of damage, normal, elemental, shadow and piercing. And then some of them have status effects, Stun, fire, freeze, etc.You basically hit stuff until they die. There's a shield button too, but it's better to kill things before they get a chance to even touch you.Swords are easier to use than guns. I can't speak for bombs as I have not used them much before.For swords, all you really need to do in PvE is the same thing as cookie clicker except that you click untill they die. You need to learn a few more 'advanced' gameplay mechanics for gunning in order to avoid the reload so that a lot more guns become viable to use. The mechanics don't take more than a day to learn and that's about as hard as the game gets. PvE wise, at least.There is a mission mode for PvE which help you get from one tier to the next. You do set levels and get the one-time rewards. However, they are repeatable and you can still get the dropped loot from monsters and treasure boxes.The (not so) main mode now for PvE is the arcade. Randomly generated levels that you can play through, getting progressively harder every 4 levels or depths, with a mini-town in between which we call strata's e.g. 'Strata 4' would be levels 13 ~ 17.There are 4 bosses in total, with 1 additional DLC boss.And many different variants / types of monsters to beat up.This game's gear is gained through crafting. ( which reminded me of dark cloud 2 / dark chronicle which I loved very much when I was younger )They are split into stars. 1*, 2*, 3*, 4* and 5 stars.Getting stronger as you go up, Duh.You purchase recipes from NPC's or other players and find the materials required for making the gear. And then you've got to get alchemy orbs. They are a fairly rare drop from treasure boxes and you need 3 of the same orb, that is the same star as the gear you want to make or upgrade to. Though these orbs can be found anywhere in PvE treasure boxes, you can also spend real money to get 'Energy' in order to buy these orbs. Though, unlike many other MMO's, you can buy energy from other players with in-game currency dropped by monsters. It acts like a stock market.From start to end ( 1* ~> 5* ) I'd say it would take about a good 100 ~ 150 hours if you're new to the game ( from personal experience ). 50 if you're buying your way through it although the game's a lot more fun when you take your time. SK is a lot of fun with friends too, up to a 4 man co-op party in PvE.Sprites:There are currently 3 sprites in-game. They give passive bonuses as well as 3 different skills for each pet.They're not much but they're there.PvP - The end-game stuff that's a lot harder than PvE. ( There's also a pvp mode called bomber ma-- I mean blast network )In SK, PvP ( Player vs Player ) is called Lockdown ( LD ). LD may look easy and cool at first and it's easy to pick up and get kil-- play* though You need to know ( a poop load ) more game mechanics to be good at PvP in SK. The learning curve is what kept me in the game after all these hours. In PvP, there is a huge skill leap from PvE and because of this, many players get discouraged and don't play it at all. But PvP is a wonderful thing in SK, you can kill people and win.There are 3 different classes for PvPGuardian, Striker and Recon.Guardian has a huge shield that protects team mates within a certain radius from enemy attacksRecon can cloak / go invisible and juke people to deathStriker(S) with two capital s' coz most people play strikers. Can walk prettay fast and dodge and run.They all give different stat boosts and debuffs ( unboosts? Disboost? Inboost? ) and play differently.And though a lot of people say there isn't much content, ( probably after playing for at least 200 hours, yes, if you don't pvp after or try new weapons/armour, there probably is a lack of content after 200, 200. Two hundred hours ) there is at least 100 hours of content with great gameplay mechanics and this is free. FREE . The game is still being updated and has events every few months.Thank-you for reading this painstakingly long review.Spiral knights is a good game with easy to grasp, hard to be good at, mechanics and I have enjoyed my time with it very, very much.

Spiral Knights is a good game, this game is totally recommended for young kids, this game is not a hardcore RPG like Diablo, Torchlight, or Path Of Exile, however Spiral Knights is a brawler type of game, it has a different feel, it has a mixture of fantasy medieval futuristic theme to itthis game has a lot more things to do, it has a rich story and the environment are very unique and interesting, even after finishing the game, you'll still have a lot of fun things to do and explore, even with friends this game is a lot of fun, since enegry has been moved to an optional thing, the game is less frustrating then before, and overall this game fun, unique and cute			",44,2,0,0,1,0,6

												Spiral Knights had so much going for it, but now stands as a glorious monument to repeatedly poor developer decisions eating away at the core of a game like an infection. Money-grubbing Ubisoft you might expect this from, but it's a bit disheartening to see yet another misguided indie dev fall for the 'costume & cosmetics' trap at the expense of gameplay. Mind you, Hello Games just might've punctured that particular indie goodwill bubble once and for all.That being said! If you have no problems with eternal grinding, don't mind being stuck on the gear treadmill and like the look of the game world, then don't let this review stop you. There's plenty of good in Spiral Knights, and given the generous price of $0, you could do a lot worse than trying it out.Let's start with the good: Spiral Knights looks the business, with a cutesy blocky aesthetic that meshes well with the light tone of the game. The customisation options are plentiful, and it's satisfying the collect cool weapons, armour and gear while progressing through the story. The only problem is the immense, mountainous grind that infests everything in this game world. Even the early game is tainted somewhat, but the cracks split into crevasses before you even spot the endgame on the horizon. Every level will need to be rerun many, many times for currency and rare drops; in some games this isn't a problem at all, but Spiral Knights remains a relatively simple game at heart. It's an entry-level game in the genre, and so combat and exploration are highly simplistic...meaning that repetition follows, and no amount of customisation can salvage it.The OST is nice, no two ways about it; touching at times, intense at others. The story is a little light, quite whimsical but ultimately engaging enough. And the dungeon-running is pretty neat when you first emerge from your escape pod, particularly if you have a few friends to accompany you through the Clockworks. It's just that there's no longevity to the fun, and things get insanely repetitive very rapidly. Even the midgame content recycles assets to a significant degree, let alone the endgame where the majority of the grinding will be done. You have quite a few weaponry options in combat, but few moves to utilise - it gets dull pretty fast. Diminishing returns set in quickly.As I said before, if you don't mind a huge grind then don't let my review deter you - there are certainly far worse options out there. Quite a few of the complaints of long time players may not apply to new adventurers, and given that Spiral Knights is now FTP, it can't hurt to try it out. Just don't hesitate to bail out if it all wears a bit thin; it saddens me that for all the obvious charm therein, I don't see myself playing this one again.			",431,96,10,47,35,3,77

												I had lots of fun times playing this game i do admit, played this game with some really close mates also, but honestly the game is just too repetitive and becomes boring after a while. I had to quit this game and come back to it many times since it was getting kinda boring once you reach the final rank and had the most of the Op gear in the game. Right now the game is basically dead, there are like not many people online. The games grinding system isn't too bad if you are a high rank but if you are stuck with 3* gear farming those *elite orbs* can be absolute cancer.After all the game has been a great game to me but i certainly dont recommend it if you are thinking to start the game from scratch. Since the game is dead, it will be a waste of your time and pointless because of the amount of online players still playing it, and the amount of hard grinding you'd have to do to get the all best 5 *star gear* that you would want. I'd give the game a solid 6/10   R.I.P SK 2K16 :(			",36,1,7,4,2,0,1

												Early game is pretty fun and fairly easy to advance through.  However, once you hit mid game (missions 5-1 and on), it starts to get increasingly grindy... or you can pay real money to expedite your advance.That said, I was going to go through just to finish the game and get all achievements.  But I found out one achievement requires buying 2 trinket slot upgrades and 2 weapon slot upgrades - things you can only buy with energy (combined cost of 800 energy).  To get energy you have to pay cash (750 energy for $2.5) or you can exchange your crowns (game currency) for energy (~10,000 crowns for 100 energy).  You can probably raise about 10,000 crowns every 1-2 hours.  Additionally, the trinket and weapon upgrade slots only last 30 days - if you want them after that time, you'd have to get them again...Another issue is you get to pick one of three pets as part of the 'story' progression.  Once you pick, you cannot change your mind - you are stuck with it.  However, it is possible to get other pets... at a cost of 2100 energy each.The third issue is upgrading gear - a requirement for 'story' progression.  To upgrade one piece, you need three orbs of the correct level, but all orbs are very rare drops.  Mission 4-1 requires a set of 2 star gear (gear set = helmet, armor, shield, weapon - 2 star, easy enough).  5-2 requires 3 star gear (I saved time grinding by using 20K crowns to trade for 200 energy to buy a pack of three advanced orbs to complete my set).  Mission 6-2 requires 4 star gear... I only have one elite orb right now and need at least 16.  I can get packs of 3 for 400 energy each (total of 1600 = 160,000 crowns) or spend a few hours at a time to get a chance for one orb to drop.  Not sure which mission requires lv 5 gear, but those orbs cost 800 energy for a pack of three...  Leveling gear is similarily frustrating for level 3 gear and up - fire crystals drop more frequently than orbs, but you need a lot more to level up 5 pieces of equipment to level 10.A few final notes: At times the game can lag a little - but if you are in a pack of baddies, you could find yourself dead without seeing yourself get hit (I died with full health due to internet connection lag four times in 50 hrs of gameplay.  Lastly, as you reach mid game the levels and baddies become a little redundant (especially with all the required grinding).Also note that my perspective is primarily from a solo vantage - played a little co-op with a friend.  So I cannot comment on PvP or guild play or the like.All considered, I cannot recommend this game as it gives you two options to progress once you reach mid game - grind tons of hours for little gain or pay chunks of cash.

Spiral Knights seems great, but lacks in plenty of placesSpiral Knights is an alright MMO, alright for free at least. It's definitely worth a try, seeing as how the initial pricetag is agreeable. For me, however, it's more of a social platform than a real kind of game. Allow me to explain as to why I see it as I do.Part 1: The GearSpiral Knight's selection of equippable gear is quite wide at first glance, there are plenty of different resistances and weaknesses to all kinds of armor, all of which can be interchanged at a moment's notice, but the variety is wasted upon especially superior gear that provides a kind of range that none other can provide. For example, if you were to choose between say, a Seraphic set or a Wolver set, the seraphic would give a damage buff equal to that of the wolver. However, the Wolver set gives a universal buff to swords, meaning that it does what the seraphic does, but can go beyond that, as well. It's armors like those that begin to break down the options available through common sense and unfair stats. Why anyone would go with an armor so selective versus an armor completely open-ended is beyond me, and most likely anyone else.An even better case is when it comes to early-game bombers and bombers overall. Bombs themselves are fairly underpowered items when working up, so it's more likely people go Gunner or Swordsman, for better attack and whatnot. Bombers overall that strictly follow the bomber line can choose the Mad Bomber Gear, giving them amazing stats for bombs, but horrible defense. There's another armor that does this, surprisingly, but, get this, it does it for EVERY WEAPON. Whoever decided that was a good idea must've thought pretty lowly of bombers, as it completely voids the Mad Bomber gear, allowing for sidearms and whatnot to be used in conjunction with bombs. All in all, the gear doesn't stop there, and most likely won't as the game progresses.Part 2: UpdatesYou'd think with the previously mentioned, they'd begin working on balancing armors and fixing things up, right? Hah, no. You want some costumes? Here's a few hundred. You want some reskins? Here's a box of 'em, have fun. Balancing the game is about as much of a lie as Santa. As while it's not real content, some people still love ripping open the new boxes and slapping whatever colorful paper that was inside right onto their character. I can understand dishing out some cash for a thing to make you look snazzy, but why feed a company more money when their game's pretty darn broken? I understand wanting to make the most out of the overpowered gear, but seeing one team of adventurers run into a dungeon all brandishing the same kind of gear is boring, stale, and just sad. There is no unique quality among players, no matter what little accessory they slap onto their armor, it's still the same cookie-cutter formula. I had more fun running into a dungeon with some close friends of whom we all chose oddjob gear, it was complex, it was different, it was confusing, and most of all, it was fun. Don't even begin on promised ""updates"" that hold new gear, as they delay for as long as they can. I'd get more in-depth with it, but I'll have to get back to you on that one. (Pun intended.)Part 3: The MonotonySo say you've finished the endgame, you've beat Vanaduke, heated your gear as far as you please, and have successfully reached the coveted rank of Vanguard. What's left? Apparently not much, if you don't have a guild, some good Spiral Knights friends, or anything immediately tying to it. The endgame leaves very little left, sure you have PvP, sure you have Blast Network, sure you might have guildruns, but why bother? PvP offers gear that has an alternative spin on some of your favorite (not-by-choice) weapons, with some stats made exceptionally worse, or some still a bit broken. But what's that to you? You've spent all this time grinding through repetitive missions for the things necessary to create your god-tier gear, so why bother struggling through all of that again? And don't try to play the card that PvP is interesting, it's usually the people with the broken gear using the broken swords. More often than not it's always Skolver wearing Strikers with the occasional Gunner or Snarbolax wearing Striker. Blast Network's just a bomberman port, playable by all skill levels no matter what, and to be fair, it's fairly fun. However, the lack of discrimination between skill levels can make it harsh on those who try it out, and more experienced players could potentially offset newcomers who'd like to begin playing as well.Part 3-2: The MonotonyDon't think it's just endgame, either, as the monotony can set in as immediately as when you first begin to start. The missions assigned to you to gain rank feel incredibly scripted and not as free as they could be. It feels more like a chore than anything else, and nowhere near as fun as the random generation of the Clockworks (Which seems to be, for the most part, swept under the rug.). The Clockworks now takes discovering on your own to find, which the game already doesn't reward, making it harder to want to do so. Missions are also more likely to have the boxes you need to find to use for the drop system to give you the main crafting materials that you need for better gear, so that's another hit against the Clockworks. If you find that grinding much to your distaste, don't worry, the online store will be happy to help, for the right price, of course. Online store not your cup of tea either? The Auction House sells them at prices only a ""few"" monotonous boss runs can pay for!I'm sure I could go on, but the review's already long enough as is.OverallSpiral Knights is an okay MMO, not great under any means, but it's not horrible. The only shining light that keeps this game from a true dark abyss would have to be it's community. The community has it's fair share of mean customers and nice folk. You can find some pretty good friends, and some truly cool people on this game. All it takes is a little bit of chatting, and you've found one heck of a pal. The missions and so are more tolerable with a fun group, as the dulling world can take on a new sense of rejuvenation with good talks, funny dialogue, and crazy moments. This game is saved by it's community, whether it be a good or bad thing. I only ever come back to Spiral Knights more for the people than the actual game, truth be told.All in all, Spiral Knights receives a 6/10 from me, for what it's worth. The game has alot to fix, and sadly, they haven't done much fixing. The experience can only really be fulfilled with friends, as going alone can dull the sense of wonderment you'll receive initially. I say you take some time out and find a little clique of sorts that you do things with, and you'll make it one great of an experience.			",139,15,1,13,10,2,7

												In-game inventory shows in steam user arsenal, played this game about 4-5 years ago, got hit by nostalgia hammer and this is what I think...I often played this game solo. Sometimes my pal would join me in, but it was too much of a grind fest for them.My initial experience then was shock. An awe to the music, conept and art style. It really blew my mind how well made can a game be! It was era of Korean and Chinese grind-based mmo's which offered balance breaking p2w items or there were good, but p2p games. And there was Spiral Knights which had in-game transactions but overall, you, as a pleb poorfg player (like me), could actually catch up eventually with rich irl players.Game had simple but well thoght story and lore. Player, as a inhabitant of a cog-based planet, need to delve into the deeps to git gud items and kill mighty bosses. It's got retro rpg flair but you can use swords, guns or bombs, play up to 4 people and do ride-like dungeons and score good loot.Initially this made me soil my pants with excitement as it was trully a game I needed back then! It reminded me of Phantasy Star Online, which I spent countless hours playing on my Dreamcast console. Spiral Knights were great follow up to that at the time being.But then I started to realize this game was just amazingly successful indie project which somehow got greenlit to steam (back then it wasn't taht easy to join the platform) and eventually Three rings software were devoured by SEGA, which again, at the time, made many questionable decissions to make the company alive and on the market.Basically game was more and more becoming pointless grind. The key fun factor in games where you need to do the same thing over and over are: astonishing, super rare drops and challenging, sometimes very unfair bosses. Spiral Knight had none of these for me so, while still being rather scrub player, I left the game and quickly forget about it.5 years passed.So here I am. Still having those basic, in game items stocked up in my steam armory, flashing ""Spiral Knights"" logo everynoe and then it finally hit my soft spot and made me want to experience this game yet once more.The game is very light, it's under 700mb and patches in 2-3 minutes. Still had my account on so I jumped into elevator and went for some fightin'.Initial experience wasn't best to be honest. Game felt clumsy, control of the character wasn't that bad but I felt clearly this game is almost decade old.Enemy AI is noneexistent. Either, creeps charge their power-ups so long you can kill them or shot orbs which aren't threat. Boss fights are a bit more challenging but it's not that punishing bullet hell so any Ikaruga or Touhou player could play it with their elbows while focusing on crosswords.Inventory is old styled 30 or something bag so it gets full very fast. Same for the utility belt. They've added more NPC rtm sellers offering you actually decent items for ~5€ which could be grinded in one evening.Bombs are useless at my low level but doubt they are any better later on. Damage output might be ok in team fights but overall for solo play it's lowest dps, 1/10th of sword-gun combo or worse.Maps got few more objects on them and doesn't feel so empty now but fixed side camer is a bit annoying.Music aged badly. Mixture of chiptune and keyboard-programmed orchestrals aren't bad but the compression/low quality of sounds itself and limited number fo tracks makes it annoying.In the end, playing this game for about an hour made me realize how much it's just a shadow of much better, earlier mentioned PSO or any other mmo game actually.It's not bad game. it could be really great expecially since it might be a cross platform with much stronger handheld devices nowadays. Core concept is still worth exploring but it's clear that the developers or any creative team isn't there. This is now a money pit. There aren't any significant changes as it's still same game I've played 7(?) years ago, when it wasn't merged onto steam. In most cases, many would say it's great thing! Game not only lasted same for so long but you can just jump back to it after long period! -well I'd wish. You can pay up for items to grind faster or for not so impressive recolored hats with slightly better stats which again, would help you in grinding.Is the game dead?Well, my buddylist had players which didn't log for 4+ years. Elevator area in town had 2 other players and while setting up my party, there were a couple of open groups vs endless lists when I played it back then. With plenty players occupying elevators and chat going so fast, sometimes it was impossible to follow.In the end, nostalgia was beaten up by the reality check and as much as this game is appealing it's not near anything related to ""fun"". Sadly! It could be really great tittle but feels like burnt out star glowing with pale red dim light of the past bright and warm light.			",51,18,1,16,5,0,13

												I first said this game was super cute and all (and it is, really cute indeed). Game play is fine and all, and this game is pretty basic, making it fun to anyone to play without those pro and noobs stuff. A nice 4Co-Op game with a good amount of levels and some Bosses.But okay, I admit something after playing this for some good time. IT TAKES TOO MUCH TIME TO EVOLVE AND UPGRADING. Seriously, you have to upgrade your armor, weapons and shields. But that will only make you farm like hell! Because ♥♥♥♥♥ are EXPENSIVE! Play like 3 hours until your energy runs out, get some money, buy stuff, upgrade, play another 3 hours the next day, get money, get Crystal Energy, play ANOTHER 3 HOURS IN THE NEXT DAY (until the energy runs out AGAIN!), spare money and Crystal Energy for later, and so on.Conclusion? This game loses its fun with time. Too much farming, too much time lost.The only way to upgrade quickly is to actually BUY CRYSTAL ENERGY WITH REAL MONEY, so you can sell it to others, and keep Energy for you can earn some cash (in-game) to upgrade and buy stuff. This is the strategy used to make you BUY and spend money on this game (it's a FREE TO PLAY, not actually a FREE GAME [ you: well thanks captain obvious ] You're welcome) I recommend it for those who are patiant and LIKE FARMING playing something repeative (Also Recommended for the Team Fortress 2 Hat)Background Music's are awesome, I love them. Calm in non-fighting environments, and catchy battle themes. Just me, Title Screen and Tutorial level has the best themes in the entire game!			",373,103,13,31,21,5,29

												Do NOT play this game if you hate grindingThe game is rather fun, however beware as later in the game it gets really grindy unless you wanna pay-to-win. I know it takes a lot of work to keep up a f2p game, but the amount of grinding needed to move on is really stupid and unneccesary.			",75,9,0,8,4,0,9

												Having played this game for around 8,000 Hours (3,800 on this account, and 4,200 on another account) from Late 2011- Mid 2014, I must say it's been a great 3.5 years in the game. So great for me that I wouldn't say it's exaggerating that it has changed my life in many ways. (< Extremely irrevelant to the review though)About the game:Spiral Knights is a fun MMORPG game to be playing with a group of friends, completing the missions from the Storyline, collecting all sorts of unique Gear, Costumes and Accessories to customize your character's looks, or even merchanting in the game. (Merchanting is completely optional, but it was something that I've done for over 2 years in the game at least, and it was a good experience, getting to know more players, etc.) Pros:-A Wide Selection of Accessories to choose from, making your own unique costume-Grinding (If you're into that sort of thing)-Chatting inside and outside of the game-Merchanting (If you want to include this from your perspective)-Challenges for beginners-It's Free!Cons:-Drops for specific items in-game is pretty rare, and players would sometimes just buy it directly from the Store, the Auction House or Players because they're not getting the drop.-Once you've cleared everything, incluiding the DLC, you have pretty much nothing left to do, asides from collecting new gear and so on.Spiral Knights from my Point of View:Back when Nick was still in OOO, Spiral Knights was updated with a lot of new events, challenges, costumes, etc. For PvE, My friends and I had a lot of fun clearing these challenges and grinding for the gears we so desperately want. Spiral Knights got a whole lot better when the Storyline was introduced, and the plot was interesting enough for us to keep playing, and we wouldn't get bored even though we're killing the same boss over and over again. (Well, that's what grinding in a MMO is about anyway...)As for PvP, being in a different region from the Game Server will affect your gameplay for this game mode. But there are  people who're in the same state as me, but can dominate others. (Kudos to them, and no offence intended to anyone in this comment)However, once Nick left, the amount of content for this game started to drop drastically, and I've only seen 1 or 2 major updates ever since he left. There are still updates to the game, but with just Accessories and Costumes, not much of content. This was the point where my friends and I had pretty much nothing left to do, after having almost everything we wanted. We came up with new ideas to entertain ourselves, such as time attacks for a certain lair, costume contests, etc. (I personally got so bored that I decided to design and make a whole ton of unique Costumes for my Character)But after a while, all these ideas started to die down slowly, and I see a lot of Veterans and my friends leaving the game, and I've followed suit, and cashed out from the game, with almost no intention of coming back to play again unless I see an update which can convince me to play again. (I still love the game though..) I do visit the game occasionally, just to see how the game is doing, and everyone who're still playing the game.The SK Community is one of the best Communities I've ever seen, and it probably would be. Players helping one another with problems, debates with just about anything related to the game, etc. As mentioned before, I'd hate to leave the game, but with almost no content, I see no reason of staying on.For any beginner(s) reading this Review, I welcome you to have a go at this game, but don't be expecting too much unless you're into a lot of grinding for your desired items. :) TL:DR-A lot of grinding required, and pray RNG is with you when it comes to obtaining something you want from Boxes, etc.-Intersting Storyline-Fun with friends-End Game is boringHave fun, and may the Energy be with you!-Revolutional			",41,3,0,3,2,0,0

												I hadn't played Spiral Knights for over 2 years, so I decided to give it another go. Sadly, this game is mostly dead, and I am certain it will never become very active again. The developers pretty much abandoned it, the only thing that ever seems to be updated is adding new cosmetic items available as micro-transactions in-game, which is very sad, as well as repeats of events at Christmas and Halloween. SK's activity boomed during late 2012 and 2013, and I was lucky enough to play it at the time. It was such a good game, I always came back to playing it. Early 2014 was the last time I properly played it, departing as it was becoming less and less active, and my guild Aurora was in the decline (we were one of the 'big' guilds back then). When I came on SK for the first time in 2 years, I was so sad to see the state it was in. Haven used to be completely bustling with players, all shouting for trades. The marketplace used to be so full, and was constantly being updated by players with more gear available to buy, now Haven and the marketplace are pretty empty. Its also really hard to find any PvE games with other people unless you go out of your way to organise something with the few people that are still playing SK, so you really have to do any PvE solo, which for the most part sucks, because its very hard in the later levels and it takes a long time to do. The only thing that you will be able to play is Lockdown, which is just PvP. The only people who really play SK now are just 'hardcore' PvP players all using the same loadouts. Of course with only 450-600 people in game via Steam each day there are almost never new players, so the game is just steadily dying. Of course I still have to recommend this game, because if people ever started to play it even twice the amount of people playing now, then that would just be awesome.  This is so very enjoyable to play, and of course, I have so many expensive and rare old items, so if people ever start playing this again I can show off :3 being serious, please give this game another chance, it would be awesome af if the devs ever started to do anything with this again... I doubt it will ever happen, but still, I have to give this game a positive rating.			",261,43,5,23,12,1,22

												Its not F2P game anymore when you have to buy revives with ingame currency (energy).  Pros:  + Family friendly  + Controller support  + Elemental damage system  + well designed maps/platform  + There are 2 ways to play the game, simple one being going all normal dmg weapons which kids can understand easily, and other way is understanding elemental system + enemy elemental resistance/ vulnerability which could take some time to get used to.  + The game is not dead as people say, there are still enough people playing it, the game was released 2011, ofcourse it has to die sometime.Cons:  - Asian server not available  - Enemies are not balanced when playing solo (it is fixed on 4 player difficulty, it doesn't change when only 1 player is available). In short, you can't play this game solo.  - More grind = less fun, for example: Orbs of Alchemy droprate is horrible (I am not against the grind system, but in this game its not balanced).  - You have to buy revives with ingame currency. Thats a big no for a F2P game. Warframe used to have this system, they removed it and added xp loss + 4 revives system, which everybody liked. In spiral knights you loose ingame currency + xp/heat, so its just useless. Want to revive teammates? yeah you have to use the ingame currency for that.  ",557,133,17,74,49,11,71

Posted: March 25, 2015
												         Spiral Knights is a good idea of a game, however the execution of the game and the later installments made to said game make it not as recommended as most of the community might make you think. I will not be absoulutely negative in this review, frankly because I've played more than enough time on this game (200+ Hours) and I enjoyed a majority of said time spent. It was fun. But now, I honestly can never go back to this game, now that I've taken a long hard look at it after some experience playing it and taking a few years of a break away from it. I realized that this game is great sounding on paper, and the execution was probably spot on at the beginning, but as Sega bought the license and copyright to Spiral Knights, you could say it sort of went a little downhill. It became pay to win rather than a good experience for gamers, and to be honest, I fell into the trap and put a lot of money into the game, not an insane amount but still a lot.         When I was playing the game, if you didn't have money to speed up the process, you we're endlessly grinding for materials you needed to upgrade. Depending on your luck, it would last from 30 minutes to several hours just to get that ONE item you need for crafting. It's tedious and repetitive and overall, negative. Another negative is no real FUN minigames to play. The only side things you could do we're play PvP or play a rehashed version of Bomberman, which doesn't really handle all that well. Two important negatives are the gameplay and the soundtrack. I barely remember any tracks from this game, and some just sound like generic music, give or take. Also, the gameplay feels sluggish, and at it's worst, laggy. Also, there are some really annoying difficulty spikes in this game, such as the second boss where you are forced to use shadow weapons or else you lose ultimately.          There isn't that much you can do in terms of defense and dodging. For example, there isn't a stand-alone dodge that you can use on a basis. This makes bullet-hell bosses and levels incredibly frustrating to push through, especially in a group. You have a shield, sure, but that won't last long, especially since for me, it was always easy to bust through for enemies, even upgraded. Sometimes you even got shield-locked by enemies who constantly attack you. Enviornments are a little dull to an extent, and even sometimes there's too much stuff happening on screen, causing way too much lag which might get you booted from the game, like I did several times. Not like there really was much to do in this game anyway. In fact, as the months went on, I found myself at the end bored because there wasn't really that much content to keep me entertained for as long as I thought, roughly around a few maps and the occasional boss here and then. They have tried to supply us with updates with new content and the such, but even then, it just isn't enough to keep me around longer. Especially that ludicrous dlc or ""packs"" that they're giving out now, costing far too much than it's actual value. Basically, Capcom level dlc. Would you pay $40 for one armor set and a few items in the game? If you said yes, you really don't value your money as much as you should be.         Last but not least, the servers. How do the servers of Spiral Knights hold up? To be honest, they're kinda bad, especially when they are over-populated. If I wanted a lagless experience, I had to go on some of the barren servers. If you decide to join a populated server, prepare for everyone to lag walk, especially in the central district. This game cannot handle so many players at once if the servers are bad. If they manage to fix the servers and give us plenty of more content, I might look back for some revelations. But for now, that's all the negatives. Let's move on to the positives!          I had a lot of fun with this game with my friends. It was indeed fun to team up on missions together and leveling up your armor and weapons feels good. You can feel a difference in power between weapons and armor and their levels respectibly, regarding the shield. Once you have the materials and money for a new weapon, it feels rewarding to make it and use it. Busting up a monster is fun, especially a boss. The enemies have some variety to them and some are pretty challenging to beat, which is cool. The combat, although sluggish, is pretty solid, if it doesn't lag, ugh. Those are pretty much all the positive I can really think of. I'm not even going to mention the story, because let's be honest: Do any players of Spiral Knights really care for the story at all? Nope, because it's too boring for me to care about and so generic that if this story was in a bad triple AAA game these days, it would fit right in.----Final Verdict----5/10 [Average]There are far too many flaws and issues for me to consider this a great or good game. However, like I said before, I did have a lot of fun with it, so it's not that bad. If more thought and imagination was put into this game, as well as massive improvements to multiple things, this game woud score highly with me, honest. But as it stands now, this is a game I wouldn't necessarily recommend playing. If there are other people playing this game, why are you still playing this? What drives you to keep playing this game, knowing it's flaws? With that said, my name is Lucky Masterz and this was my first review on Steam.Let the silver be your guide! ~ Lucky ~			",22,0,0,1,0,0,0

												In short I like it so try it you might too i would give it 8/10 after a while 6.6 to 6.9 out of 10Pretty fun game there are some points where you have to grind (i.e upgrading items from 3 stars to 4 stars which is the worst and 2 stars to 3 stars is bad too) but if you can past those then the game is pretty straight forward. I would recommend it up to a point where grinding or paying to progress (pick one) as you can buy the orbs to upgrade your items to do the other levels or grind like i said and hope to find them  unless you get enough crowns from grinding to trade someone for them you need at least 12 which is used to upgrade helm wep shield and armor. Along with trading what I dislike is the item is bind to you when you use it and cost a lot of energy (the premium currency) to unbind it and make it tradeable again althought this is part of the ecomony I dont like it as costumes and accessories act the same where they bind and you have to pay to unbind them to trade themI wouldn't say it pay to win idk why people say that more of pay to progress or pay to look good (i.e tf2 hats and cosmetics ish you can't paint them) since you can buy item which is cool but you can grind and I mean grind and get all 5 star armor with out spending a penny just a lot of time which is what an mmo does grind. The only time you will most likely pay is if you want to buy orbs already and not grind to do other mission and continue the story, buy dlc (which is cheaper in steam than in game), buy a cosmetics, keys for unboxing, or do the shadow levels.From what I played I seen and heard that most player are mid level to high level and multiplayer doesn't really matter or no one cares about it anymore although there are some people that will play  co op like I would if someone wants to ask. The update are more just cosmetics as there a no new levels that I have seen although with the amount of level I did see it is enjoyable i would give the game and 8/10 then after playing it for a week around 6.6 to 6.9/10 it does get repetitive although you should try it you will like most likely enjoy it so I would say try it out.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------TF2 free hatPlay the game go to arcade and just play any gate until you get to depth 4 or 5 (it a checkpoint area) and on lower left hand corner you should see the mail saying you got mail from mann co. that mean you got the hat.If you are still confuse just add me when I am online and I will help you out if i am free....which you should not need since it super easy to get to get to the depth but still if you need help I might help if I am free but I would ask for the crowns aka currency you got from the trip which isn't a lot btw			",96,29,8,2,6,2,24

												This is one of the most magnificent and incredible game i have ever played in my life, a art style stylish and unique yet not repulsing. Action music that always got my body pumped just when it got difficult. the amazing community that accepts newcomers gracefully. This game is a masterpiece... At least it used to be... Let me tell a tell of when Spiral Knights was a shining jewel to all on the holy fields of steam. It was by no means the most popular game but everyone acknowledged that the game was something special and held a unique place in their heart. In the beggining days of Spiral Knights everything was bliss the developers rained free updates and were passionate, commited and even holy. I came to this game and SK speaked to me, it entranced me and sucked me into it twirls of fate. I loved that game so much, playing and being free with my friends that were like me and had dreams of progressing far in the game. For every gaping flaw in the game like the mist energy issue i still loved spiral knights and dreamed of secrets to still be discovered. I pictured myself reaching to the star on planet cradle and adventuring in the galaxy and saving the Knight race. I wanted to do so much for this game and my commitment was ultimate. Then it all came crashing down with a update that removed mist energy while making elevators free. Having had the difficulties with mist energy i, like many others applauded the update and were so happy to have finally been able to progress more and faster. Little did anyone know that the evil on Earth wanted to take this game and cut its destined glory and quench it in squelched potential. Under our watchful noses they coerced the power of Goodness that SK had with payment and promises that they would keep the game alive and great. All this time we were to busy meddling with the game to realise the horror of what would happen.. They slowly started corrupting SK by making money grabbing events that were intended to steal cash. Even then we should have armed our virtual armor and strod bravely and formidibly to defeat the greatest threat to Spiral Knights ever. But alas we did not stand up for the our source of love. As they twisted and turned this cherished title into a ruinous ruin of apathy and sadness. There is a place in SK where the realities come so close to these ruins. There was a great ruler of the aldmerian empire but his great evil burned and destroyed his own people... The hate twisted and killed untold innocents but in his blind hate he never stopped intill nothing could be done to save his people. SK has countinued to stutter and tremble in its later life until now. Where a new coven has come together to promise that they will keep this game alive and bring it into renewal. But alas those promises have been nothing but a attempt to once again break the loyal knights hearts and love of Spiral knights. Repeating the same crimes and betrayels of devotion again and again. I cannot say what spiral knights final fate is but as of now everything has been a ruin,  with the galiant guilds of knights shattered and broken never to be renewed again. The utter horror of realizing that this game was maimed like a newborn babe never to fully see its full potential. I was one of the great knights, undivided and devoted to SK utterly. but i have to     see with utter shame to see that we failed to save spiral knights when in its greatest time of need. We are *truly wretched..*Edit: lol i got banned from SK discussion. U know what they say... humans never change...			",33,4,0,8,5,0,1

												What happened to this game?After a long break, I came back to Spiral Knights hoping for the charming, cute and relaxing atmosphere it once had. A simple yet rewarding game. Go down the clockworks, level up your weapons, hope Basil has something awesome, kill some bosses, get deeper, trade at the auction house, buy energy through the market at the right time, and so on. The game was so fun yet simple that it lured me back over a year later without even being reminded of it.So what is this game now? A grindfest. The main reason for this is because you can no longer level up your equipment more than once in a single Clockworks run, you need to grind for (sometimes ridiculous amounts of) Fire Crystals, waste Heat (experience) and ""forge"" them even then with a chance of failure.Adding to this, the mission system feels completely detached from the game itself, in fact a lot of the modes are. Everything just doesn't meld together, it feels like a mix of gameplay ideas all accessed from a mess of a menu system. Zero immersion unlike before.I can overlook the poor performance because it's a game written in Java. Which in itself is huge feet. Optimising games in Java is hard, especially to look like Spiral Knights does.The music is relaxing and exilerating at the right times. The enemies, though lacking in variety, are well designed much like the rest of the characters and stages.It's just sad that Three Rings decided to take the game in this direction. Though, with the servers still being somewhat dodgy,  it's probably a choice of what we have now or nothing at all.			",216,38,6,29,14,0,18

												been playing this for a while, then found it on steam and have been having a blast, it may seem simple, but it is definitely high quality F2P, met with regular updates it'd be a shame if you didn't at least try it!Its been overhauled as of late so if you are and old player it would be a good time to give it another spin Oct. 2013-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------In Spiral Knights, you play as a member of a race, the titular ""knights"", who has become stranded on a planet made entirely out of layers upon layers of clockwork dungeons made from pieces of other shattered planets. You descend down through the clockworks towards the planets core, working from a main social hub called Haven. While Haven is where you start, its most definitely not the only town in the clockworks. Throughout the game you will use a variety of bombs, guns, swords, and abilities to fight through the dungeons collecting loot and defeating monsters, traveling deeper and deeper on your way to discover the mysteries of the clockwork and eventually uncover the ""core"".- 12/5/15			",374,144,14,85,57,11,89

												I've started playing this game from steam since 2012, but quit many times in the middle, but in 2013 i returned after the battle sprites update, and i'm still playing it. Even with 350+ hours, i've not fully seen all the game has to offer. It's fun mostly and addicting if you're into these type of games, it's design is one of a kind, but thats the pros, the cons is that when you make progress in the game, you'll want to spend money on it because you'll be progressing very very slowly which makes this game very grindy, but all the items in the game you can get from grinding, there are only costume that only requires money for aquiring.

												This game used to be good until the trade off by the company. The quality of their work dramatically dropped as they started passing off costumes as already existing armor and reskinned. The mechanics of the game are awesome as in for combat wise and stuff. The economy however is highly unstable and changes depending on the patch. The game really grabs you when you start off considering there are loads to do. After you complete your missions and stuff, it's mostly a vanity game like who has the coolest costume or best equips. The PVP system is a joke, there is no standard arena you can just hop into. It's team dependent besides for blast network. It's very hard to level your equipment now ever since the ""heat drought"". So it's much harder for low level players to get into the higher tiers. The events are pretty cool but most items released during events are just cheap reskinned knockoffs compared to the beginning. This game is only fun to play with friends, by itself its just a grindfest. Potential of the game I give it 5 stars, quality of the game I give it 2 stars.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												*Sigh* Where to start... okay, this was originally a recommendation but since the past year, this game has gone downhill very quickly and it is bad. The main issues are: The forging system, the lack of new end game content and the constant repeat of events over and over again. Oh, don't forget the constant new gift boxes instead of new end game content... I don't think it will last much longer at this rate.			",52,3,0,7,2,0,1

												I would recommend this game to anyone. This game overall is an absolutely delightful experience. It has a beautifully simplistic style and the music is flat out awesome (seriously. I would buy this game with money if it were just a blank screen with a quit button and the full soundtrack playing on repeat). I'm gonna be honest, I got into this game purely for the tf2 hat, but found myself completely lured in by it's extremely charming auditory and visual style, as well as it's strangely addictive gameplay. I was very suprised when I, first thinking that the simple hack and slash fighting style would get repetitive fast, discovered that... it never really did. I also like when you can customise your character's appearance and for some reason they just end up looking completely badass. One thing that I disliked, however, were the Candlestick Keep levels. I hate to be rushed, especially in such a pretty game as this one. What I'm trying to say is that this game is awesome, and I have no clue why it's free.10\10			",56,11,1,10,6,2,1

												Spiral Knights is free to play online game. You play as a small knight and choose whatever color you want to begin with then start with a sword and gun. After you finish the basic tourtal of the mission you'll enter a world that is call Clockworks. They'll teach you how to heat your armors and wepons to make them stronger and how to learn recipes to make your own wepons and armors. Sence Spiral Knights updated to elevator energy cost you no longer need to pay 10 energy everytime so your free to explore the world. And you also would get one of the Battle Spirtes as a pet known as Drakon, Seraphynx and Maskeraith when you finish the three tourtal about each of there different skills then you'll have to decide on picking Drakon, Seraphynx and Maskeraith as you Battle Spirtes. They each have different type of battle skills. You'll have to go on missions and a lot of acrade runs for crowns, orbs and heats to level all away up to Vanguard. It take time to get there but it's a fun game to play.			",79,20,2,3,8,0,12

												After spending lots of time playing Spiral Knights, I simply can't recommend this game to other gamers, especially players new to the game.  Instead of working on and releasing new playable content into the SK world, the team at OOO pours their time into making useless accessories, costumes and variant skins, none of which impact the actual gameplay.  It's great for those who enjoy peacocking in a digital world among mostly tweens, but otherwise it's rather unfortunate.  In the years I've played it, the game has simply lacked in progression.  Then, sadly, when new holiday or special event ""limited-time"" levels are introduced, the developers focus on making the level as difficult and un-fun as possible. These short-lived levels force you to grind for new collectables in order to attain the object of your desire, all the while getting killed over and over again, forcing you to, essentially, pay-to-play (and/or waste lots of hours grinding... but time is money, no?).I wish I had more positive things to say about SK... I really wish I could tell you that the story and levels keep getting better and better... that the gameplay is a ton of fun and that the majority of the people you meet won't beg you for your currency or items... that new bosses are being introduced and new strategies keep things interesting... that being in and/or owning a guild has any sort of point whatsoever... that the best update was better than 30-second speed boosts so you don't waste so much time running down long empty halls in each depth... ... but I can't... nope... not at this time at least... maybe in a few years... if it doesn't go the way of OOO's Dr. Who: World's in Time (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_Who:_Worlds_in_Time)...

Product received for free
												If you don't have many games to try or you want something new, how about Spiral Knights?It's a top-down action-adventure dungeon crawler, in which you fight monsters with swords (obvciously), bombs and guns.You level up your character as you play and obtain better equipment for your character.There are four boss raids and many hidden and rare content. Most of them are event-only items.If you like collecting rare stuff, this game has it all.The intro for the game is great and levels are really detailed. After that the game loses dynamizm and level are procedurally generated, so there are instances that you'll end up in the same corridor. That's the main thing about the levels. Most of them are made from patterns, so there are a lot of combinations, but in-game you feel that's the same level. The music is really memorable and atmospheric. I can't forget the Jigsaw Valley and the menu music.Because it's a F2P game, there are instances where packing money is useful, but the only gameplay changingelements are weapon slots. You can also buy weapons and armor, but that's only for quicker progress. And here is my issue with the game:Around Tier 3, you HAVE TO upgrade your equipment in order to continue the game. And the orbs required to craft them are really rare and can go for thousands of crowns. If you are lucky, you'll get there eventually. I had no luck and after two months of grinding, I finally got my FIRST 5-star weapon. Now I have to get my armor and a shield. That's another 8 months to spend, but I didn't had the patience to do this all. Soon, the game got boring.I played this game for around 2 years and I think it wasn't wasted in any bit.My most proud one is when I attempted the most difficult boss raid designed for 5-star sets. I only got 4 star equipment and I carried my whole 4 member team on my back. They called me the Gordon Freeman of Spiral Knights. That was epic. I died at the final boss, but it was worth it. Tier 3 is pretty challenging. The game gets relatively harder as you play and you can choose harder difficulty for more loot, which is fair.Get the game, play it for some time. If you like rogue-like games, you'll probably like it.			",46,7,1,0,5,0,3

												This is like a modernized old school Zelda that just so happens to be online. It borders on the okay to meh realm because it really doesn't show you new tricks. There is a 3/4ths top down perspective and you and strangers hunt through areas, solve easy puzzles. It all seems very straight forward. You pick your primary and secondary weapon when the dungeon begins. The problem is that the dungeons are missions so it is a little confusing that you don't just walk to the dungeons. A mission will just poof take you there. The TF2 hat took me 2 hours to get.			",1129,324,52,104,96,15,167

												One of the best and my most played game of all! After 500 hours of gameplay I love practically everything about this game, its easy to learn, fun to play with friends, and making new and better things for your user. Spiral Knights holds a special place in my heart as it kept making me want to come back and play again and again! Being able to play with other online players in case you are stuck or need help or want to trade to get something that you want. Even the online Auction House is great as its almost (if not) run entirely by the players. Along with the fun and challenging arcade mode, there is the main mission mode that helps up your rank withing the game. Each mission consists of a goal while the arcade is made up of random courses that are picked by players and swap between other courses within to keep changing, nothing is ever the same. Lastly is most likely the least favorite thing to do is the crafting as it is a big hassle to collect tons of items and then forge your weapon to the specific level and then having the money to pay costs. Besides forging and crafting this games has to be one of the best MMO games out there and its FREE! (Unless you want perks or DLC)My Score for Spiral Knights is 95/100I Highly recommend giving this game a try and inviting your friends to play through the game with you!			",54,13,1,5,6,0,9

												The main reason I dislike this game is because it follows the very commonly done formula of many FTP/MMOs, that is to say, players who do not want to dish out cash will be forced to grind and grind until they meet the necessary requirements to go onto the next level (in which they must do the same thing again).At first, I thought Spiral Knights had a lot of promise. The art style is simply gorgeous, the playable characters, hell, EVERYTHING is adorable, the soundtrack was delightful and to top it all off it all had a huge Zelda influence. I thought this was going to be ""Zelda: Four Swords The MMO"", an aspect which got me very excited. Mostly because Nintendo didn't add online to the 3DS version of Four Swords. This is not Four Swords the MMO. It is not fun. Combat is dreadful, especially by yourself on higher difficulties. In a nutshell, combat can be described as ""hit and run"" and repeat. There is no strategy involved, it's just a matter of paying attention and hoping the lag doesn't screw you over (this game lags a lot, at least for me and always at the worst possible times. I can't count how many times I've died because of it.) What makes matters worse is that if you die, you will need a material called ""Spark of Life"" to revive yourself so you don't lose all your things and can continue the mission. However, this material is very hard to find, but of course the only reliable way to obtain it is buying it with money. The only times I can tell you I legitamentally had fun are when I played with friends but then again, anything is fun with friends. You're probably saying, ""since you suck at the game why don't you lower the difficulty bro?"", well that's where the FTP structure comes in. Spiral Knights prevents you from progressing until your armor meets the minimum rank. In order to accomplish this, the game has a crafting system and you must collect the necessary materials and crowns (game's currency) in order to build the armor you need.The problem is that the materials are extremely rare. These materials have a better chance of spawning on higher difficulties, but the drop rate is still low enough that you'll be forced to play the same mission again and again and again and again and again until you finally get what you need. This seems to get worse and worse as the more you progress, the better the armor the rarer the materials are. I assume this is how the FTP structure of this game works, to frustrate people enough to make them spend real money on these materials in order to progress. I can't really blame this, though, since a lot of free-to-play games do this sort of thing. Frankly, it's disgusting and makes for a bad videogame. I'd rather pay upfront for a game that won't give me BS than waste time doing something that's not fun and that I realize won't get me anywhere because the whole game will just be this.I love the idea of Spiral Knights. I like the lore and the universe and it's characters and it's graphics. But this is a videogame, not a movie or a show so gameplay is the most important thing these sorts of things have to offer. And Spiral Knights offers bad gameplay. Maybe it'd be better off as a retail game or something, but this is just basic MMO design.But, you can play this game without paying a single cent. Probably, I haven't finished it and I probably never will. You're just going to need to put up with repetitive, boring grinding to either find the materials or gather enough crowns to buy them off the market.Unless you have a bunch of friends wanting to play this with you, don't waste your time on this.

												“The Skylark has been hit, sir!” one of the Knights cried out.“Evacuate immediately! Nobody should be left on board!” came the orders of Captain Ozlo....And so the story begins.-----Spiral Knights is an MMORPG with roguelike elements and a scientific fantasy theme. You play as one of the Knights of the Spiral Order. Your primary function, before the crash of the Skylark, which was a massive spaceship, was to discover power strong enough to defeat your enemies in the Morai Wars on Isora, your homeworld. The Skylark picked up a major energy reading on a planet called Cradle. However, when the Skylark ventured to the planet, someone or something fired some sort of weapon at the ship, thus causing it to crash into the planet and partially explode.Now, instead of finding a power source to save Isora, you are now looking for a way to fix the Skylark and return home. You aren't alone in this endeavor. Other crash survivors are also working towards the same goal.Despite its welcoming name, Cradle holds many secrets. One secret is that of the alien species on the surface of the planet. Known only as Strangers, they have agreed to help the Knights by selling them equipment and materials. Other, darker secret hide below Cradle's surface though. Deep within the depths of the planet is a complex dungeon system known as the Clockworks.Not much is known about the Clockworks. The Knights know it is constantly changing and that a race of aliens known as Gremlins live within the confines of the Clockworks. They are also are aware of the Core, which is in the center of the planet and was the thing giving off the energy source detected by the Skylark. Theories of the nature of the Clockworks vary from an experiment by the Gremlins to a museum of alien worlds absorbed by Cradle. Apart from the theories and facts, it is up to the player to explore the dungeons of the Clockworks and find a way off the planet.-----The game itself is really straightforward. Spiral HQ will give you missions that will teach you everything you need to know as well as give you ways to explore the Clockworks. These missions are divided up into different sections that will serve as tutorials and advance the story. There are also daily missions that will eventually get your prestige up (which basically gives you a spiffy symbol next to your name).Another major part of the game is alchemy. Using materials you find in the dungeons, Bazaar, or Market, you can create weapons and armor that will assist you in exploration. There are currently five levels of equipment with one being the worst and five being the best. These levels, known as stars, allow you to gauge how well-suited (no pun intended) you are for a mission.This equipment can be “forged” by collecting heat spheres in the Clockworks. One an item is fully heated after completing a level, you may use a Fire Crystal to level up your equipment. This is not the same leveling up that goes along with alchemy however. The equipment you use must be leveled up so many times using forging before it can be turned into a higher star using alchemy. Long story short, forging is a stepping stone used to better equipment in the alchemy stations.Pets are another part of Spiral Knights. There are three types of pets that are conducive to certain playing styles. The first pet is a dragon that is predominantly used for offense. The second pet, being a cat, is mainly a support pet. The third, which is a phantom, is a combination of offense and defense.-----Fear not! You don't have to brave the Clockworks alone! Guilds and exploration parties are both commonplace in Spiral Knights. Banding together to explore the dungeons below is an excellent way to level up and have fun.Guilds tend to be more formal than exploration parties. Depending on the size and seriousness of the guild, the guild may demand a few things from you. The guild has an “upkeep” cost that must be met weekly to keep the guild running properly. A guild also has the chance to purchase upgrades and decorations for their guild hall. That all comes with a higher upkeep cost though! A stricter guild will demand a certain amount of crowns, the in-game currency, per week from you whereas a lax guild could care less about how much you donate.-----All of this is wrapped up nicely with a beautiful soundtrack, cute graphics, player trading, a “stock market,” and frequent events.-----8/10This game is amazingly good. It could do with some more updates and a bit more content, but overall is finely tuned game. I would recommend checking it out, especially with a few friends so you can all learn and explore together.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I began playing before they removed ME (Mist Energy). Wonderful little time. You had to wait for energy to recharge, and you didnt simply soak 24/7 of your time into it. A few runs a day, chores, other things, then other games. Grinding was bearable and you could revive teammates by giving them half of your life.  Then came the Forge. Grinding stones wasnt an absolute pain for the first 3 tiers, but then came the fact that T1 Gear can only be upgraded by heat & T1 Heat Stones. Another thing is that Gear takes to long to grind! And they made a new item and took away the life saving old revive system! Sparks of Life were the new reviving system, and they were SO RARE, that you only got them in dedicated grinding. VERY DEDICATED GRINDING. There are 5 Tiers of equipment, but you barely even get to own T4 items. I had 2-3 and then i quit. The Developer of this game left 000 (Three Rings) and SEGA took over. SEGA turned this into a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ grindfest, which nobody likes. Fast progression to those who paid. This is why F2P games should follow Warframes principle and make everything obtainable with currency, but easily grindable. RIP Spiral Knights, you were once crafted with good intentions, now you are a quick cash grab...EDIT: Grey Havens (former OOO employes) have bought spiral knights and another OOO Game! Hope they fix everything SEGA destroyed.			",77,5,1,7,6,0,2

												Creative space survival story that is able to blend perfectly with the MMO genre. The game follows a survivor of a race of knights caught in a war as he/she crash lands on an unknown planet and has to craft gear such as weapons, armors, and shields to fend off predators and survive in this new world. The game has an ever-expanding story mode/campaign, a self-sustained economy that allows players to exchange in-game items with each other for in-game currency or for other items from other games,(which is why this game is so closely attached to the TF2 economy) guilds in which friends and strangers can commune and play together, events in which there are special missions and rewards, and even prize boxes that allow you to obtain cosmetics or branded gear for real-life money. Numerous weapons, armor, shields, and most importantly cosmetics and acessories such as costumes for your knight that conceal your not so good looking battle-armor. If you're looking for a game that has more than one way to advance, this is the game for you.However, developers have been having internal issues and the consequence of that is a severe lack of content and what feels like an incomplete game. Thos game has potential, but it needs support to get there.			",43,4,0,2,3,1,0

Posted: April 3
												EDIT: Lots of clean-up and stuff.I was looking for free-to-play stuff on Steam, and found this cute little Nintendo-ish MMO.Spiral Knights is an action MMO set in a world that feels like a cross between Legend of Zelda and Metroid. Alien knights fleeing a dying world crash-landed their starship on a strange planet called Cradle, which is a patchwork of places taken from other planets, with many rotating layers of mazelike levels within called the Clockworks. Granted sanctuary by the mysterious Strangers who run the surface town of Haven, they begin their search for the massive energy source that led them here in the first place. But they're not the only life on Cradle: Fiends, Slimes, Beasts, Undead, Gremlins, and Constructs all compete for territory here. An elite team of Spiral Knights reached the Core, and were never heard from again; the search for them forms the main quest.The game uses a ""twin stick"" control scheme; I used mouse and keyboard for this. WASD moves you around, and the mouse controls a pointer for aiming your attacks and thrown objects. Left Mouse Button attacks, Right Mouse Button blocks. Shift+ Left Mouse Button does a shield dash that bashes monsters out of your way and Stuns them, using up half your shield bar. Shift + Right Mouse Button does a quick hop in the direction you're moving, or in the direction you're facing if you're not moving; this helps you dodge area attacks, but has about a ten second cooldown.Up to four Knights can party together. It's drop-in/drop-out, unless the party is private or locked.You start with a Helm, Armor, and Shield slot, and two Weapon Slots. Two additional Weapon Slots can be purchased, as well as two Trinket Slots that let you equip some Trinkets for a slight stat boost, but these only last 30 days before expiring. You can equip any other Helm or Armor as a ""Costume"" over the Helm and Armor you're actually using, giving you some control over your Knight's appearance. There are also special Costume items which can be used just for this purpose, and decorative Accessories to attach to Helm, Armor, or Costume items. The in-game cash store sells Prize Boxes which contain random Costumes and Accessories. Many of these are just reskins of existing items in new color schemes, others are bizarre original creations.There are three kinds of weapons available: Swords, Guns, and Bombs. Holding the attack button begins charging your weapon's charge attack, which does more damage and has stronger effects than the normal attack. Bombs can only use the charge attack, but cover a wide area; you're all immune to your own weapons, so you can bomb away at close range.The game has four damage types, and every type of enemy is partly resistant to one type and vulnerable to another. There are also status effects that can be inflicted by some weapons, like Fire, Freeze, Shock, Poison, and Stun. Different kinds of Helm, Armor, and Shield give different status and damage protections; this is vital in the deepest Clockworks.After a few missions you get to pick a Battle Sprite from the three different types, each of which has various special powers on a cooldown. They're very difficult to level up to full power, but they can make some situations much easier.You have a Heath bar and a Shield bar. Any hits taken when not blocking come straight out of Health, which doesn't regenerate, so blocking with your Shield is absolutely essential to survival. Your shield bar recharges in a few seconds.Getting KO'd triggers your emergency revive, which gets replenished at the start of each level. Any KO after that requires a Spark of Life to revive you, or you can wait for your party to finish the level, but then you get no experience.Experience is tied to your gear instead of your character. In addition to collecting Crowns (coins) and crafting Materials, you collect Heat Crystals which are added to your gear at the end of the level. When an item has a full bar, you can then use Fire Crystals to ""Forge"" the item to a higher level. Gear also comes in different star ratings, from 0* to 5*, and crafting a 3* or higher item usually requires the previous version as a material. Crafting an item requires 3 Orbs of Alchemy of the appropriate star level, a small amount of Crowns, and you need to know the Recipe for it.This is where the game starts to run into problems. As you can see, there are at least five different resources involved in character progress. This was changed from the original system, which alienated a *lot* of players, and effectively paywalls most of the game's interesting content. The amount of grinding required to do this without paying soon gets utterly ludicrous.The part where free-to-play Knights usually ""hit the wall"" is the The Sovereign Slime, since it's very hard to finish the Royal Jelly Palace without either grinding for a lot of custom gear, or having a Guild or a more experienced Knight carry you through. If you can make it through that, you can probably muddle through the rest of the game eventually, but there are literal ""gear checks"" (the Hall of Heroes missions) which require you to have gear of a certain star level before you can attempt the next level of missions. This will take a while to save up for, since the Recipes you get as mission rewards are mostly for default normal damage gear that is not competitive past the middle of the game, and Orbs are rare drops and not cheap. Many crafting chains branch, but some underpowered branches are effectively dead ends.There is an Auction House which allows a player economy of sorts, you can buy or sell most unbound items for a small fee. There is a also a trade chat channel for people who would rather deal directly with other players through the trade system. However, any gear you have ever equipped (or crafted from something you have ever equipped) is ""Bound"" and can't be traded to other players. There's a way to Unbind equipment, but it costs more than an item of that star level would cost from the store, so it's pointless unless it's an item with rare Unique Variants (extra powers that you have a slim chance to gain from crafting) or an item from a long-gone Prize Box like the Overcharged Mixmaster.All of this adds up to leave the game in something of a typical ""MMO death spiral"" as new players hit the paywall and bounce off, and old players get burned out and move on to other games. PvP is also mostly dead for the same reasons.My recommendation is that you fight your way up to the Royal Jelly and see if you like it. There are packages available for purchase in-game, like the Deluxe Starter Pack or the Battle Pack, which can only be bought once but give some extra collectibles and/or costumes. You're probably better off spending the money on Energy (which can also be bought or sold for Crowns) instead, since the extras inflate the cost and are only useful to some players. The Krogmo Coin Boosters in the Battle Pack are only useful if you play a lot of PvP, for example. By this point, you should have a fair idea of what you need. Check the game's wiki to make sure you're on the right track.""This sounds terrible, why are you giving it a thumbs up?"" Partly because I feel ridiculous giving a thumbs down to something I've played for over 4,000 hours, it was my gaming comfort food in a very tough time in my life. Partly because, once you get past the grinding and get better gear, the gameplay is actually very challenging and pretty satisfying. The real game starts at high level, but most players won't tolerate the grinding long enough to get there.TL;DR: Get your Steam Wallet out, do an epic grind through the procedurally generated Arcade, or just hit it and quit it.PS: If you stay, go escort some noobs through their story missions, they could use the help.

												Ever wanted to play a game for over a thousand hours just for the developers to one day realise they're raking it in and, not just give up on releasing any more proper updates whatsoever, but also modify the current game mechanics to cost the player as much as possible, trying as hard as they can to squeeze real-world money out of you before the game swallows itself whole? Well here's your chance!• Change the forge system in order to make it even more of a grind because you won't supply enough actual playable content to keep people occupied• Drastically lower the drop rates of essential upgrade components such that players can't even realistically level their 5* equipment anymore without paying real-world money• Occasionally taunt the players with the promise of new playable content, and then keep delaying it month after month, when in reality it hasn't even been started yet• Leave the players with *absolutely nothing* but seemingly endless weekly premium boxes containing re-colours of already-existing pieces of equipment which, just for laughs, you let your five year old son make after pointing him to the 'hue' toggle• If a player tries to mention it's immoral to do all this, delete his post on sight, remove him from the official group, remove his rights to post on the steam discussion board and hell, if possible track him down and exterminate him while you're at it. Petty things such as freedom of speech or having a personal opinion are not allowedThis is the loving touch that only Three Rings can provide!TL;DR - Avoid like the plague			",174,51,11,18,21,3,32

												I really do love this game. The soundtrack is soft and arcade-like, the artistic design is *MWAH*, lore is nice and flexible,  and the gameplay is simple and easy to get used to. If this was a couple of years ago, of COURSE I would reccomend this game!!However, there are some big issues that suck the joy out of this kawaii child.1. The economy, even in the early days, was nothing short of sucky. It's basically a 'im rich and have a few bundles of cash to burn' exclusive environment, making steady progression something more of an eternal endeavor.2. JJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJAVA.3. omg u like lag? i like lag yes yes give me more lag4. I swear this gets an update every X hours. I can never just OPEN THIS GAME AND PLAY IT.5. Community jumped ship because they were smart. I love this kid. I want to see it grow up happy and healthy. But sadly, as far as the state that it's in, it's not worth your time. ",9,3,2,2,0,0,0

												Spiral Knights is an all around good game. It's got stunning graphics, and the cartoony vibe fits it well. Combat is pretty solid, with loads of custimization and what not. Not that many microtranscations, and they're only for DLC or extra crowns (in game currency) or crystal energy (I believe crafting item). Colors are pretty nice too. Performance runs very well, with only a few chugs or hiccups here and there. Community is decent at kindness, but don't expect them to be throwing crowns at your face if you're begging (unless they're really nice). Guilds are also loads of fun. Storyline is probably interesting but I don't pay much mind to it. Spiral Knights, gets an 8/10.			",88,12,1,7,10,0,7

												With the amount of time i put into this, i wish i could give it a positive review. But i cant.Pros: Original artstyle, arcade-inspired gameplay, and colorfulCons: The game feels like an absolute chore. The drop rates for items you need to progress are far too low, and its hard enough to find the boxes they're supposed to drop from. The textures bug out quite often, and its very unappealing. The worst part about this game, however, is the fact that its become a huge cash grab for the devs.Through your several days of trying to find the item you need, the game tries its best to remind you, ""Hey, why not just buy this premium currency for your hard-earned money and buy it instead?"" They constantly try to get you to sink too much of your time and money into this product,I started playing the game last year, and came back to it this month. It was still the same as it is now, and im immensely disappointed that it hasnt changed a bit.All i can say is that im deleting all my files for the game, and its very unlikely i'll be pciking this one up again.

												At first the game seems alright. It's heavily pay-to-win, but, that bit's rather negligible (so long as you never encounter any other players) As you get further in the game, it gets rather ridiculous. Rank-based missions start off simple. One unique/generic level, then advance two one generic and one unique level (if not two generic), and then two generic and one unique (or just three basic, unoriginal stages that you could find elsewhere). The tutorials are fine and dandy, but the lack of continuity in it is a little irritating. The game decides to explain certain monsters on certain difficulties *after* you've already encountered them, which is pretty hecked up in its own right, when they could've easily optimized the mission's levels to not contain something you haven't been taught to understand. Alas, it's straightforward genericstages.I haven't invested in it very much, but PvP seems to heavily rely less on survivability, and more on how much damage you can dish out in one life. Thick armor's given up for combat buffs, and a certain popular weapon-set seems to be one that you can't get without a ridiculous mass of crowns or persistence in a specific set of days.

												When this game first launched, and for the first two years it was running, it was great.  Spiral Knights had a lot of potential, but gradually, has been going down hall.  With more of a focus on costumes and reskinned gear and little attention added to new gear, new stages or new bosses.  The grinding aspect was fine at first, but becomes tedius when grinding the same stages and same bosses after 3 years.			",60,13,1,2,6,0,2

												All, probably, read stories about brave knights who went down in vaults for fight with a dragon, overcoming traps and winning on the way against the whole hordes of monsters. And if you dream to be that knight, this game for you. Game narrates about history of knights who were wrecked on a hostile planet. You play for one of these knights and with colleagues you travel on vaults, winning on the way of monsters and solving puzzles to reach a kernel of this hostile planet. Certainly, in original state of Spiral Knights of very few people it will be necessary. It is game without plot, with incidentally generated levels, with crowds of enemies. Only I aim, games tamping of pockets by game currency and continuous search of the best equipment that it was possible to move to more difficult level is. Game on pilaf will hold on or not, everything depends on developers. Certainly, Three Rings Design everything provided it and constantly try to diversify game. First, players lay a hand to creation of levels. Secondly, regular large updatings in which are added new equipment, monsters, bosses, levels and it is a lot of that else. In the third, fascinating puzzles over which it is necessary to think. In four, players can influence game economy. If developers continue in the same spirit game the bigger success waits still, differently players will quickly lose to it interest. The first impression of game as from a usual unpretentious arcade, but after some hours of game you understand that tightens you this fascinating world. In this game everything depends on you and your equipment, after all strength of the real knight depends on ability of possession of the weapon and its jokes. It is game for those who loves browsers with monsters and puzzles. In this game it isn't necessary to turn gray in the days that to achieve something. Probably, the majority represent the knight with a sword in the right hand and a board in left or with a spear on a horse. But these knights except boards and swords can arm with the gun or a bomb and to carry amulets and bracelets, and the number of the most this weapon pleases with a variety. Possibilities of the weapon too strike from a freezing to a damnation. When you use bombs sometimes, apparently, that you play Bomberman, especially it is shown when you battle among boxes. The attention is drawn by game in team, here it isn't necessary to compete because of game currency or resources as everything is distributed equally. Therefore players try to play is put, after all not to pass some moments without harmonious team work and mutual assistance. Game process looks quite attractively, you crumble packs of monsters, you fight with bosses, you plunder treasuries, you solve puzzles. Puzzles in this game deserve attention, they are very interesting, though aren't too difficult. But nevertheless, on pro-procession of two hours, game after all becomes boring. On the substance of Spiral Knights – qualitative arcadian RPG MMOG, beautiful and at first sight the extremely unusual behind which it is possible to spend some hours in day			",82,13,5,9,4,0,5

												Excellent game if you're into a casual MMORPG. It contains PvE features together with a VERY competitive PvP feature called ""Lockdown."" As a pro-league Dota 2 player, I felt that Lockdown was really enjoyable to play competitively.Gameplay:For short, it's a dungeon crawler. Nothing too shabby, with the birds-eye-view, you're pretty much aware of a decent radius around your character. The game consists of two default controls which focus on keyboard or mouse although fully customizable to your fitting especially if you have a gaming mouse or a gamepad. The game is full of innovative monsters which you're likely to enjoy and many levels which ""rotate.""Graphics:I have to say, I'm rather impressed with the vibrant atmosphere this game has. If you enjoy bright games, you'll love this. The chibi-style avatars are adorable enough to make you have to punch a wall to feel like a man again and the environment is surprisingly detailed. In terms of network-graphics, I'd say they did well enough to avoid graphical-lag - this, I can't explain through words so you'd have to play the game in order to get a feel of fluidity.Social:The player-base is small enough for you to socialize and gain deeper friends and wide enough to feel the game's population. Also, being recently implemented to Steam and Steam trading, it's a lot more convenient if you're a Steam gamer due to trade offers whilst offline and such convenient features - only way to get the feel for it is to actually play it and realize.Support:Their Spiral Knights Support is mainly based on actually mailing them. Their in-game support lacks and doesn't prioritize the most important aspects of so-called ""support."" So you can't really expect to get a hold of any ""support"" whilst in-game because it's not that convenient - only way is to contact them through email, which isn't so bad but could improve.Overall I give the game an 8/10 - which would've been better if it weren't for their bad tech ""support"" and I emphasize ""SUPPORT,"" not ""filter"" team.

												This is one of the games I played with a great community. Its unique concept is like none others. I'd definitely recommend this game. It has its ""dying phase"" but I'm really hoping that the Game Devs are still planning to update and put more content to the game. I'd purchase things that this game offer if it gets updated. ( SHOUT OUT: Paging Grey Havens, Please proceed to the Game Dev room now... )I know. It's boring if you're playing it alone. Make some friends, talk to strangers, don't be aloof. It's very addictive when you have people to share your moments with.Here's what I thought: > Artstyle - Its cute and very unique> Gameplay - Challenging. Well, not if you have good gears. Bottom line, its all about teamwork. Unless you like to play solo.> Music - Lovely music you got there bud. Its engaging.> Community - Its Great! That's why I love this game.> Players - I'd say 50 - 50. Some players are nice and friendly, some are not.> Concept - Can you name any game with the same concept? I can't. > Auction House - Oh my fudgy bars! Those are very expensive!> Supply Depot - Nooo! The trade market keeps on raising! Make it stahp! > Grinding - Aw man, this is a bad RNG. Need 'em orbs please!> Guilds - I don't know about you, but I love my guild. First and Last. > Wiki - Eh? Is the sidebar really down there? Hmm, care for a fix?> Steam Login - Why can't I login my Steam to Wiki page? That's crazy, man! > Servers - Oh my, why do I have a red dot? Mind if you guys put up some Asian servers? Please?> Patch Note - Oh come on!, Where the dang are the Patch Notes? I mean sure, you guys post updates on twitter... but....> DLC - I'd be fine if you make more of 'em DLC's too. Like maybe, a side story like OCH?> Price Boxes - Will you guys re-release Rageous Stuffs? I've been craving for them since I started playing...> Coliseum - Ah, no ones playing there anymore. Make some more PVP. Maybe like Capture the Ball? or Chess? or Maze?> Rank - Man, being a Vanguard ain't that good... What am I supposed to do now? Hoard stuffs? Collect gears?> Story - The stoy is incomplete. We all got stranded in Cradle. So, there's more content you can actually make here... Like maybe go to the moon? Well, why not?, Cradle has a moon right there in the Main Screen. And what about our homeplanet? our homeworld? What? they're just... gone? Still so many plot holes. And maybe you can have a story on why the Snabolax, Jelly King, Roarmulus twins, and Vanaduke keep on respawning each time we delve deep into the unknow parts of Cradle. Maybe because TIME is reseting? Cause why not, it is the Clockworks... get it? Here's hoping, like most of the Knights out there who still enjoys playing this game, that it'll live on for another 5 or more years. Because I know it's not abandoned yet. https://twitter.com/Cronus_GH/status/829819314475765760Good luck to the Devs - Grey Havens.Kudos for keeping this game alive at the moment!			",12,1,0,0,0,0,0

												This was one of my favorite games to play for a while and it got better once I put a little bit of money into it. However the sprite update ruined the game for me and I do not like the direction the game is heading.Pre Sprite Update 9/10It's very fun to explore and level up your weapons. The whole market and trading system was pretty good, especially if you're too lazy to get crafting materials yourself. To sum it up the whole thing was a fun experience for me. The only thing was the elevator costs. So if you run out of mist energy, you have to wait awhile for it to refill, but I guess that is the cost of it being ""Free-to-Play"" right?After Sprite Update 4/10The big problem of this update was the heat nerf. So now it's a pain in the a$$ to level up your weapons and armour. The actual sprites aren't so bad themselves, you get a little extra power against enemies. Before the update I bought a elevator pass, so when the update came they removed elevator costs so they traded in my pass for a bunch of crystal energy and other helpful things. But that does not make up for the fact that it will take a lot longer for a new player to level up higher. They added ""The Forge"", the new way of leveling up items, it is complete fụcking bụllshỉt. So now if you want to be strong and have high level armour, your going to have to pay money for fire crystals, otherwise it will take you a long fụcking time.Finishing comments:I've played this game for a few years and it was mostly worth it. But the devs fụcked up the game and my money I put towards it was a waste. So if you are a new player and/or if you are starting the game, it will take quite a while to get to a high level.(Note that the last time I played this game was about a year ago so things may have changed.)

												Spiral Knights, whilst not a perfect experience is enjoyable if you're willing to ignore an assortment of problems it has. To start, the gameplay is pretty good, semi–top-down shooter/hack and slash geared closer towards co-optional play that can be a good challenge at times. What bothers me most is how the game is handled i.e. updates which are flagrant cash grabs for mostly sub-par cosmetics. Very few good updates have occurred during my time playing, in fact when it comes to real updates they can take way longer than expected with one notorious example being the gunner update which took over a year after it's projected release date to finally be added to the game.Other complaints I have include: A dwindling player base makes it hard to progress late game without searching long times to gather a party, especially on the European region; notable grinding present late game in order to obtain good gear without micro-transactions; usually I don't have problems with micro-transactions but they are notably egregious compared to other MMORPG models; and finally the most enjoyable/challenging missions are DLC only, further separating player base for these missions alone.I used to love Spiral Knights, it had a quirky aesthetic, the gameplay was enjoyable and I can't begin to tell you how much I love the music. But as the community gradually declined the issues the game had became more apparent. If you have a group of friends willing to play then by all means, go ahead, I really wouldn't recommend starting now by yourself.			",810,236,5,120,92,7,118

												While the game is nice to play, there's 2 major problems with it.  If your playing from overseas eg. Australia, you will suffer lag non-stop. You could try and deal with it but it makes the simplest of enemies insanely hard to kill because of ""missed"" shots. The second is the whole Crystal Energy (cash cash) and Mist system.  If play this for free, you are extremly limited in both how long you can play and how quickly you can make progress through the game. Simplily dropping $20 into the ingame shop will skip half the game, and another $20 if you wanna skip the game all together.Do try it and see if you have a ball. If it isn't 100% your game, stop playing and check out something else.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Looked like a fun game that I've originally started playing to unlock the TF2 helmet :P but played it much beyond that. The general concept is fun but unfortunately it is too grindy, progression is tooo SSSLLLLOOOOOWWWW and the maps are all the same just randomly chosen from a pool of existing map elements / stages so is quite repetitive and doesn't offer that much outside of these, at least for my taste. Of course if you are into such things then it can be perfect for you but as I prefer more adventure and story content and less grinding and repetitive gameplay, I can not recommend it. As it is free to play you may give it a go and have fun with it until you become bored of it, maybe it is your type of game afterall... and even if not you can just move along after having your fun... and TF2 helmet. ;)			",44,7,0,6,6,1,18

												Fun game to play, hard to get into.Starting this game is much like any Free MMORPG; the low tier weapons, seeing everyone run around in shiny, powerful gear and having incentives to make your own character. After about a year of off and on playing, I got into the game more and more for the merchanting aspect. Here's where the problem lies, though. Three Rings (OOO) Is more focused on providing small bits of insignificant content raher than providing a substantial story to the game or anything larger than a few model remakes for events that dish out ""Prize Boxes"" if you buy the premium currency.Later on, people find out about unique variants, which is the main money sink for the game. So in order to get the best gear, you need to grind for hours just to get the 20 thousand Crowns (F2P Currency) just to get one.In the end, it's a fun game but there are much better games out there for a free to play fanatic.

												Yes you might be like looking at my time and that I am saying that this game is not recommended by me and you're like what the ♥♥♥♥ well I will tell you why. Well when I began playing this game you will have to do alot of grinding to save up crowns in order to get recipes, materials, Crystal Energy in order to upgrade your gear it was ALOT of fun I used to play all day long as soon as I got home I would be playing Spiral Knights because of the excitement of getting stronger, meeting new people having fun together and do a little roleplay together etc. It was possible to actually beat the game without spending any money cause as you can see there is alot of Free To Play games out there but they all will have their shop where you would add real money and purchase Items such as Team Fortress 2, Realm of the Mad God, Magicka: Wizard Wars and much more to be named and in one of the Spiral Knights update last year they made heating (leveling system for weapons/shields/armors etc) and crafting system much more difficult for your to be able to actually complete the game without spending any money and the thing with Spiral Knights is that when you start it okay, if you fall in love with it you will continue, you will make friends, you will make progress and when you do, you will not wanna quit because you've created bonds with people in the game which means that u will wanna go all the way to the end which means you will at some point waste money on the game and when you finish the game you might wanna add the people on Steam BUT HEY!! they might be WEBSITE USERS you know what that means you can't add all your friends on Steam to easily to contact them when you want, there is a possibility to add them on Skype, Facebook etc but most of them wont have that type of Social Media which will force you to KEEP playing the game to still be friends with them and if you do keep playing that game you will wanna continue becoming stronger which means more money wasting and if you're desperate to quit the game you're gonna have a HARD TIME it was soo difficult for me to quit the game because of all the friends I had on that game and insane progress I had but this will ruin your life quitting this game is like quitting smoking but it may be easy for others but it certainly was difficult for ME!!

												I'll start with the pros and move to the cons, as optimism is a virtue.+Helpful, patient admins.+Ingame soundtrack that has its own peculiar flair. It can be somewhat of an acquired taste, but overall the soundtrack is gud.+Really neat skyboxes. Though said skyboxes will turn your computer into a toaster if you have a crap-tier AMD graphics card. +Chibi artstyle. I've never been really scared by any of the enemies due to this, though a few have their creepy side, such as the spectral felines you'll find in haunted zones.+The community (ingame and on the official Spiral Knights Forums) is generally welcoming and helpful, though there are a few loud complaints about various things at times. Can hold decent, respectable conversations with other players.+Smooth character control using the mouse.+Makes you not want to kill the rare enemies that can occasionally drop special loot. This is something I don't see often, as it turns the killing-things cash-grab into a ""this thing doesn't hurt you; are you really gonna kill it?"" scenario.+Wide variety of armor and weaponry to create, although you have to work for it. +Every single obtainable item save for armor accessories has its own peculiar flavor text. These can be fun for trivia enthusiasts.+The developers will occasionally take ideas from the official forums pages and incorporate them into the game, though this can be a rare occurrence.+Lots of alliteration and a few puns here and there. Mostly in the names of different dungeons and the flavor texts of certain items.+The storyline is fragmented, but the shards of its canon are dynamic. Spaceflight from a genocidal war, a mysterious crash-landing on a celestial body of machinery and nature, an oligarchal dictatorship bent to its rulers' own twisted design, a tortured, fiery Duke of a smoldering kingdom, forever believing his realm is under siege...all of this is part of the world the player characters live in.+Sentient jelly cubes with mustaches+helicopter birds+tree physics have yet to make any sense, as the leaves aren't attached to the trunk. good stuff.+demons throw office supplies at you. Only the disgruntled overtime-workers use pitchforks.+I'm pretty sure that putting a rocket engine on a war-hammer is the greatest achievement weaponry has to offer.Now for the cons.-Development of the game has slowed to a crawl. Although the major updates are impressive, they come few and far between, and as such there hasn't been much to accomplish once endgame is reached. This is a major contention with players who lack a certain amount of patience.-Promotional ""costume"" items are produced more often than game updates. This, too, leads to negative feelings toward the developers, as the costume items can only be acquired using real-world funds. Though it does lead to a huge variety of player costumes and personalized outfits. I haven't seen a single other player that dresses their character the same as mine.-Many of the weapons have a certain niche in the game, but there is a significant quality fluctuation when it comes to how well the small group of most-effective weapons function as opposed to the great variety of others.-Few money-making stages. There is one particular endgame dungeon that is the most effective way to earn ingame currency sans trading, but as there are no other stages to rival its payout, playing the dungeon can become increasingly repetitive.-The comment sections on Steam for most of the promotional costume updates are a veritable maelstrom of angry players. Being a repeatedly-returning player requires extraordinary patience.-PvP can be difficult unless you're extremely good at it.Overall, if you play the game without expecting much new content to be released in a set period of time, it's a good 8/10. For those of you with less patience with the dev team, probably not the game for you. ",43,2,0,1,3,0,4

												Spiral Knights, even if it's one of those game's thats long old and isn't up to date, is still an enjoyable game to just mindlessly grind in. It's a good game to just play around in, exploring the clock works for some gold and rare materials just to slowly upgrade your stuff. Once you get past the threshhold of being stuck at around tier 2-3 items, the game becomes allot more accessible to you so you can fully explore the clock work. Oh and this game also has a PVP arena if you want to try out your weapons against others. That's pretty neat. Enjoy the game, and if you don't then there's no harm in having tried it out because its free to play. =p			",92,14,0,6,1,1,2

												Spiral Knights is a different type of RPG. You are a small knight who has crash landed on a strange planet and must get to safety. Once that is done you go through certain missions and delve into the clockworks, a massive underground mix of levels that are ever-changing. I have almost 700 hours into Spiral Knights because it was extremely intriguing and I would play 12 hours without even realizing it. However, the lack of content being added is saddening, especially when we get constant ""prize boxes"" for every 10 dollars we spend with our hard-earned money. Besides that point it can be extremely hard to level up your gear.  Going from Tier 1 gear to Tier 5 took almost 400 hours alone. However, this was before the missions gave you a free set of recipes and crafting orbs. The crafting orbs were what replaced Energy in crafting. Energy was about 500x harder to get. This game is VERY good with a group of friends (4 preferably) since the drops chances are higher and everyone gets their own loot. I do recommend this game because besides all the weak points, it is still very fun to slash, shoot, and spam bombs all around the battlefield. 8/10			",160,25,0,24,8,1,11

												Uggh...i wanted to like this game, i wanted it badly so that i can play it together with a good friend...I gave it a try, then another, and another and kept hoping that the game would get more interesting as it progresses...it didnt, the levels just got longer and not even a slight bit more thrilling. I might not have that much time on my record here but i feel like i've seen everything this game has to offer in the short time i've spent playing it...Seriously, the whole game is basically: open missions tab, start mission, go through the countless halls while unendingly hitting your left mouse button and avoiding some child level difficulty obstacles, finish mission, upgrade gear, repeat.

												Spiral Knights is a top-down TLoZ inspired MMO, where you go floor to floor down the Clockworks, the source of the worlds power. There are many different presets for floors, where you will find several different species of monsters ranging from slimes, wolves, robots, and Gremlins to kill and take their Crowns (currency), Heat (used to upgrade your gear), and materials. There are 3 different Clockwork tiers, with the difficulty and loot increasing as you get deeper and deeper into it. At first, you will only be able to go to the first tier and be forced to go back as you reach small towns in the Clockworks, as they serve as gates for the different tiers. As you progress in the story and upgrade your gear you will be able to access these towns and move on, with there being vendors along the way to sell you useful upgrade blueprints you cant get anywhere else. There are 4 main bosses in the game, with each of them giving tokens once you beat them, and when you get enough you can trade them for very good and useful gear, which very well may make up your arsenal when you approach endgame.The PvP is a control point mode, where you fight off the other team to take hold of 3-7 points for the longest amount of time. There are 3 different ""classes"" in PvP, Striker, Stealth, and Shield. Striker removes your shield for a jet boost which can get you from area to area very quickly. Stealth makes you invisible when shielding, with a small radar around you when you get close to someone. Shield amplifies your shield, making it reach around you, shielding your teammates inside it. Unfortunately you are not given any kind of gear for it, and there are not restrictions on what gear you can and cannot use. This means that those who have an extreme amount of money will use items with ungodly stats, which most can only hope to get withing a few months. The PvP is split into 3 tiers like the Clockworks, with each tier corresponding to your gear. Good luck finding a match with anything less than tier 3 Gear however, as it is extremely rare to see anyone not in the tier 3 matchmaking. Technically, this mode is not P2W, as you can buy all these items with Crowns, but it will take so long you might as well not even try. The meta is also quite bad, with only a few specific items being good, mainly a few of the Boss items, and status inflicting mist bombs. While it is possible to do well without these items, without health boosting trinkets, and ungodly unique variant weapons, you will have a tough time.Unless you have a friend or two who are already well off and have played for a good amount of time and is willing to play with you, I wouldn't even bother with this game. The devs have stopped caring about it completely, with all new content being simple reskins of cosmetic items. If you want to play Spiral Knights by yourself, be prepared to do most of it solo, and whatever you do, do NOT pay any money for energy, the games higher tier currency. This is a F2P MMO, so it only makes sense that there will be grind walls inciting you to pay real money (which unfortunately I fell trap to). The community is decent, however 90% of everyone you're going to see is people who have spent hundreds, even thousands of hours on this game from years back, who still feel obligated to ""play"" (aka sit in Haven (the hub world), for hours on end stalking the auction house).  Do I regret putting so much time and energy into this game? I wouldn't say so, as it has brought me many hours of enjoyment and a few short term friends along the way. However, at the current state it is in, I can't recommend playing it right now. Even now, I only ever boot up the game (which can take up to HOURS as the game doesn't update on its own, and only starts updating when you run the game, something that should have been fixed years ago) to check up on any season events going on. If you are new to this game, the first time you boot up the see Haven at dusk, covered in Halloween garb, or in a snowy wonderland at Christmas time, it is quite magical, and I've had some of the most fun just fooling around in Haven during then. For now though, stay away from this game. The population is dying and any friends you make will most likely be gone in only a few days, never to be seen again. If you do wish to play however, I can only hope you have a fraction of the fun I've had in my early days, and I wish you luck.			",28,3,1,4,3,2,2

												PROS: +Friendly and Helpful community. Playing with kids are quite enjoyable. It's a nice break from all the salty attitude in FPS games.+Abundance of good players who could carry you through harder dungeons (or, in the context of the game; Clockworks)+Friendly UI+You may conduct in-game trading for weapons and cosmetics. Steam supports it too.+Straight forward levels with challenges, puzzles, hidden secrets, etc.+Game offers annual events and daily extra missions for optimal varity in gaming experience+Free to play+Game admins will sometimes respond to player issues by hopping in-game with you. Very nice people.CONS:-The community may be friendly, but it is often hard to communicate with the occasional players who speaks a different language, due to the lack of region lock.-Although the game encourages variety in gameplay, the same events pop up every year with very minimal changes. This means that cosmetics are not as collectible as you think.-The game will try to steal money out of your pocket at every possible corner of the street: money to revive, money for fees for selling weapons at the Auction House, money to level up your gear, and etc. Not exactly Free to Play, is it?-The game allows trading, but never encouraged. You cannot trade away cosmetics which are worn, and you cannot trade away weapons you used without a ridiculous amount of ""Unbinding"" fee. -Game has variety in levels, but only a select few can earn you good profit without spending too much time. This forces some players to have a very narrow style of gameplay. These specific levels established the fundamental procedures to farm for money, and the lack of content overall bores the player easily.-Sometimes expected events are overhyped, which causes a general discontent amongst the players.So, is Sprial Knights a good game? Yes, but only borderline so. There may be a great deal of friendliness to the game, but the lack of player volume and the lack of new content only bores the player.After putting some extra time into this game, I can't help but feel that there's so much more that could be done to the game that may contribute to its possible success. It's been about 3-4 years since I've started playing this game, so please, don't get me wrong. I really enjoyed it while it was good to me. I felt alive. I felt energetic. I had friends and folks I could and want to play with. The community is quite friendly, the risk/reward system of levels are well balanced, and overall, I had fun. It was one of the most enjoyable and impactful games of my adolescence. The guild system was fantastic. You could always meet new people and play with them. There was a demand for companionship and sportsmanship everywhere. The User interface is fantastic. Things takes a while to get used to, but things are always there when you need then. The life I've lived in this game is the lovliest, and the love was the liveliest. But what happened? I don't know. I can't say for sure that this is a bad game, because it really isn't. I had loved it. Were my observations also my bigotry and prejudice? Did I grow up and move away from this game genre as a whole? Why don't you play it for a bit and tell me? I'm sure you'll love it just as much as I once had.			",27,2,0,4,3,0,5

												Spiral Knights: a game that has certian charms from an explorer to a competitive player's point of view. I for one, am a collector, though only about 1/5th of the time through the (almost) 2 years playing this game.Since the start, the game was sort of hard to grasp for FTPs who like to explore the depths and missions in the game, due to the mist limit going on. Nowadays though since August 8th, 2013, with the Battle Sprite release, more and more players could play without a toll limit. They have events and items on sale, sure, yet you won't need to participate in them if you don't want to. For those of you that are though, just remember you're very kind by helping them with developing more game features and helping out any problems that need to be fixed.There's plenty of features to go through in the game without events as it's going on: Player vs player with either team vs team capping with your own selected gear and weapons for the tier in Lockdown, or a 3D bomberman styled way to battle with bombs given out, either free-for-all or team vs team in Blast Network. There's also ways to hang around with friends and socializing with new ones as you play through the game. Lastly, the biggest feature of them all, is exploring and either helping out or solo throughout the depths of the Cradle. Many monsters currently, and eventually appearing along the way, will be a task to fight on normal, advanced, or elite mode (I personally almost ALWAYS do elite mode nowadays). You may overcome obstacles on the way, though if you need help it's not too bad to call for some friends or guildmates.By visual wise, I have to say: it's very artistic and charming in a way. The effects are very good and reminds me pretty much of Bomberman people with the players/NPCs (hence the mentioning of Blast network), who can dress up and wear gear that isn't just for bombing overall (You can use gear that goes along with being a swordsman, bomber, gunner, or a mix between).There's a community of knights to talk with, in game and out game, either meeting up or talking in the Forums on the website, which tells about what's going on lately. This MMORPG bases mostly around communication most of the time, either by a normal player or a Game Master. Don't take others opinions too personally (such as the biggest topics ""using Auto-Target, or AT for short, in the game""): Do what you feel is right and play the game like you want; Just don't go too far though by being too rude with other people please. Fighting negatives with negatives won't result with the best result.www.spiralknights.comAnyways, thank you for spending time with reading my review. As you play the game, soar through the planet of Cradle and be your own character and player, knight of Skylark. :)			",75,11,0,8,6,0,4

												Spiral knights is an enjoyable game that to be honest, I don't find pay to win at all. An excellent co-op game with a great community. It's not one of those games with EVERYBODY wanting to trade. It has everything I'd expect from a proper game. Pros:- Very useful and supportive community- Updates and events often- Has a forum which is useful - The guilds make life so much easier for players in need- Not a game that tries to grab your cash- Huge variety of weapons and gear to get and collectEventhough I nearly have 200 hours on this game so far, I'm not a vanguard. There's so much to explore in the dungeons and missions with your friends. If you're looking for a game that you don't want to pay for, something you want to have fun with some buddies, somewhere simple to get the hang of, this co-op game is the game for you. I'll definitely rate this game 10/10!  ",21,0,1,3,0,0,0

												It's got cutesy little graphics and running through a few zones is kind of fun but overall it's not worth the bandwidth to download it, and like any other online game in Steam, it's constantly updating alongside TF2 just bogging down your computer whenever Steam is running.  It might be a good first ""MMO"" for kid, but as an adult, there were a bunch of things that confused even me.  They use some kind of weird system that randomly changes dungeons around based on items you drop into machines or something.  There are way better hack n slash type games out there, and this one gets grindy fast.			",196,68,1,26,18,1,14

												I really liked this game, but it's time is coming to an end. The developers aren't adding any content, just costumes and accessories that you get from random chance from a box that you need to pay for to get. The only ways to get to the next tier are to ethier spend $20-$100 or grind for days in total.My playtime actually amounts to about 1100 hours, i played about 100 hours on my alt account and about 100 on Newgrounds.EDIT: The game has switched over to a new company formed by some of Three Rings' former employees. Currently, the premium boxes are not being sold anymore, but it's still much of a paywall in terms of progression. If Spiral Knights further improves, I will change my review.EDIT-2: Nope, the game is going to hell. Straight downwards to hell...			",85,8,1,8,6,0,0

												   This game is amazing, trust me, I've played it since 2011. I've gone through hard times, and good times. This game is a bit harder on Veterans now, and rewards new players with many free things, which I don't find fair, but that's not my decision to make. If you don't have this game, you need it. If you love MMO's, get it, RPG's, get it. This game is a must have for a fan of either of those. There are many different armors to use, from using swords, to guns, to bombs, and even some event weapons. The costumes are amazingly designed, and playing with the right people can lead to domination.    The DLC, Operation Crimson Hammer, is also amazing. It provides a new boss, new missions, and exclusive weapons. I've played since 2011 and still haven't gotten all of the exclusive items from this. Because everything in the DLC is a challenge, or a cake walk.   Everything in this game depends on your gear, play your cards right, and you can win almost anything.			",1,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Been playing this game for a very, very long time. I got it near when it just released, and I was very impressed and excited about it. However, since I can't give numeral or decimal ratings, I have to choose what I think of the game now: I just can't recommend it. I'll tell you why my love has been watered down as we go.You and many other robotic knights crashed on a mysterious planet. This is no ordinary planet; the massive underground is filled with massive machines and gears that are constantly shifting levels. It's sometimes gloomy, sometimes cheery. It is inhabited with many monsters and gremlins who don't want you to explore. This place is called the Clockworks. In its center is your only hope of escape: the energy from the core.GAMEPLAYNewbies get to customize their character with various cosmetic armors and ascessories. You can change your knight's color, which affects your eye color and any parts of armors that allow change. You can also change their height.By default you start with Proto gear, which includes an armor (this covers your body), a helmet, a shield, and two weapons: the Proto Sword and Proto Gun. You are taken through a tutorial that teaches you how to kill meanies and the beginning of your story. Following the tutorial are beginner missions with AI companions to give you a taste of the game and its story before you go on your own. These missions are pretty easy to do and reward you with more weapons to help you on your journey. At the end, you are taken to Haven and you get the Proto Bomb, which is the last type of weapon (swords, guns, and bombs). Haven is located at the surface and is where the knights research and train.More missions can be done later when you are ready. These too will give you rewards. Complete a set of missions to be ranked up and move on to the next set. Ranks allow you to use better gear. Gear is ranked in stars like a movie would be rated. Most weapons can be upgraded to higher levels. Some ranks require you to have a full set of gear of a certain rank for you to continue to the next and to allow you to go down more tiers. Tiers are chunks of depths with sharp difficulty turns. There are 3 tiers in all. Missions can be replayed again and again as much as you want. You can also independantly delve down the clockworks.There's two currencies in this game (I know what you're thinking): Crowns and energy. Crowns is earned in the Clockworks or by selling things. You use them to buy equipment from shops or you can trade them for energy. Energy is used mainly for reviving yourself if you die or for buying things in the Supply Depot. The Supply Depot is where you get to look at all the things you cannot get because you got no $$$ in your wallet. Energy can be traded for crowns and bought with real money (mhm, you see the picture now).You can delve the clockworks solo or with 4 player co-op. To beat each level, you have to reach the elevator at the end of each level, which you can use to either continue going down or go back up. There's many areas to explore each level, and you can find materials to ""alchemize"" new weapons or upgrade weapons. You only have one emergency revive, so be careful! You can buy sparks of life to revive you again if you need to with energy, which are available in the Supply Depot to buy. Sometimes you will run into a set of levels with a boss at the end. You will seldom run into the same level twice, as the levels change constantly at set times. The elevators give you a hint on the type of level it will be by the picture and color of the picture displayed on the screen on it. For example, a haunted fortress themed level would be a castle tower with either purple or red. Purple would be a little generic, and red will usually mean the Scarlet Fortress levels. Further information on the level ahead is given to you when you go down, such as the name of the ""series"" (I call more specific themed places like the Scarlet Fortress [a haunted, castle-like level] a series) and an area name (Firestorm Citadel: Smouldering Steps).Near the end of the game comes the Shadow Lairs. The Shadow Lairs require a Shadow Key to enter. One key grants access for everyone in the party. These are boss levels with massive difficulty changes that make even the beginner's boss a challenge for a full party of 5 star players. On top of that are more powerful monsters and enhanced bosses. There's one for each boss. Each Shadow Lair opens the core little by little.PvP is also a thing here. In the coliseum, you can pay 200 crowns (which is extremely cheap for most players) to play Lockdown or Blast Network. In Lockdown, you can be one of three classes with their own unique abilities that replace your shield (Guardian has a massive shield that protects allies) on two randomly colored teams. All your gear can be used they aside from your shield, but their level goes down to level 1 until you're done playing. You win by capturing and controlling control points. Blast Network is Bomberman. Nuff said.The game was really fun and the boss runs were wonderfully done, but there's two evil beasts: GRINDING FOR ALL ETERNITY AND DLC. Beginners will have a blast with the game until later in the game, where upgrades are harder and take longer to do. Your gear can level up and become stronger with ""heat"" which acts like experience points. However, you can't just breeze through and max out your gear because they can only actually go up a level when they're at full heat and you have enough fire crystals. This is magnificent part is called ""forging"". There's special fire crystals for each star gear, the better ones being harder to find. 4 and 5 star fire crystals are extremely hard to find, and you need frikkin tens of them depending on the level. Even then, you have the option to use less fire crystals for a lower chance of forging or using a crapton at once to confidently move up a level. Unless you have a massive horde of crystals, you'll probably want to go with the 100% chance option all the time. Even worse, 3 to 5 star gear *require* that you level up your gear to a certain level. 5 star gear requires you to max them out (level 10 is the max), and 5 star gear is *always* slightly less strong than their 4 star counterparts until you can level them up enough for them to actually be better aside from a good charge attack, which almost never changes. It takes me about ONE MONTH or more of collecting materials, leveling up gear, and grinding the same boss levels over and over for money and loot just for ONE 5 star piece of equipment. Guess what the Supply Depot has? 5 star weapons for sale for energy. Remember what I said about occasional gear requirements in missions? R.I.P. your wallet.Guess what else? Shadow Keys cost a lot of energy. That means you better find an efficient way to earn money or pull out your wallet just to beat the game with a couple of friends. When you have nothing else to do but the Shadow Lairs, you can enjoy grinding for 600 years or lose the roof over your head. Another thing: events. Events and prize boxes. I don't need to say anything else about these. It's a tiny bit like the vicious IAP that ruins almost every mobile game you love.GRAPHICS, UI, AND PERFORMANCEGraphically, the game looks great. The gear, environment, and overall art style is really neat. The UI has no problems. As for performance, the game runs perfectly on my 5 year old Dell laptop with no upgrades on low settings. It appears to be well optimized. If I had a newer computer, it would be perfect. No strikes off here.There you have it. A great game with painful grinding. I give this game a 6.8/10, and I don't recommend it because I don't like being enslaved in grinding for years or PC games + mobile IAP. I'd also like it if I could actually do some cool stuff aside from the Shadow Lairs and getting gear as a Tier 3 player.			",26,4,0,0,2,0,1

												This game is great and free to play? That makes it good right, well yes the gameplay and artistic style is great but I would not consider it to be great when it comes to story and replayability. This game is an MMO and is updated quite often yet there are many things wrong with it. It's a grindfest and forces you to believe that the game is longer than it actually is, once you become a vangaurd there really is nothing interesting to do. Sure you can participate in events and aquire all the weapons. But what use will those have if you already completed everything the game has to offer. There is dlc sure but I was not satisfied by it, the only reason I finished it is to get the rewards.Let's be honest, the game is not bad and has very little wrong with it. But the biggest crime this game commited is that when you understand the games cycle you will find that this game. Is really boring, the game entertained me and kept me busy. But it didn't make me want to come back to it after I finished it. There was no reason for me to care, I would come back once in a while to find that nothing had changed. I do not think this game is bad but everything comes with flaws. Do not let this review stop you from playing the game, it truly is a fun backup game when you're bored and want something different. But do keep in mind that it is not perfect just like every other game. 6/10I am sorry if this review has bad grammar or is filled with spelling mistakes, I'm swedish and have always had problems with learning new languages, I think I got the point across though.

												Alright so, i've played this game since july 2012, back then the game was so full of life and the community was so competetive and fun. Back then, there were regualary scedulded updates and so much fun content. After a while, ( easing into 2014) the updates started to slow down and befour we know it we were stuck waiting a entire year for one content update that was hyped up waaaay to much. if this was 3 years ago i would have gave this game a thumbs up but right now, the game is just a shell of its former self.

												Let me start by saying steam needs to incorporate a sideways thumb for the ""it's not that I don't like you, you're just not my type"" games. I tried this game a few year ago (2011 maybe?) and decided to give it another go recently.  This game still hit me in a weird way with pros that could be seen as cons, and in my opinion the cons that maybe could be seen as pros.  For instance, it uses a slow replenishing energy system which is depleted with almost EVERY action you take from using items in the world to crafting to runining dungeons (con) but hey, maybe people won't spend their entire day inside playing games (pro)? Let us do the list thing.PROS--I love the zelda games, almost to the point of fighting for human/machine marriage equality, and this game's style reminds me a lot of earlier games.  This made me all warm and tingly inside.-There aren't any set roles in the game, the holy trio does not exist.  Everyone can do the dps thing, tank if needed and by the gods hopefully grab the insane amounts of health that drops to keep themself alive.-The graphics are bright and cartoony, which I'm not usually all for, but it seems too many games now are trying to see how dark and bleak they can make the environment, this seemed kinda refreshing.-The combat is fast paced and fun.  Being able to switch between a gun and a sword when ever I felt like gave me the ability to strategize. (Not that strategy is needed, the game is laughably easy)CONS- (some can be seen as pros depending on how you look at it)-Ingame voice chat.  My god i hate ingame voice chat. If i wanted to hear your whiney, prepubescent voice I would join a real  voice chat program and listen to you there.  I have a feeling it was implemented to help players organize and easily communicate a strategy (again haha strategy), not to bewail that every person in the randomly genterated group doesn't have the map memorized. (which was me sometimes... What? I like exploring damnit!)----actually had a kid during a dungeon yelling at this player to hurry up and run to the portal so we could continue. You could feel the anxiety of the lost player and the pure hatred of the player rushing other along, i mean his mom was going to be home from work in 8 minutes, he HAS to finish this dungeon before that!  The best part was his squeeling COOOME ON as the other player and I decided to go retrieve our lost dungeon brother.-----The energy system. the free to play version gives you a small pool of energy that is used for every single thing you do in the game, so it depletes pretty quickly and has a slloowww regen rate.  Of course, you can use real currency to pay for more energy or pay insane amounts of in-game currency for it.-Grinding. Once you get past the T2 dungeons, you will be grinding your way from there on out.  Which is a painful experience with the energy system inplace. ""Well, there is my 20 min of grinding for the day, ill be back tomorrow.""			",148,26,0,30,3,0,17

												This game is really great. Lots of fun, lots of weapons, lots of enemies, lots of different game styles to choose from.This games follows the rule of 3. There are 3 types of weapons (sword, gun, bomb) to choose from. 3 types of damage, 6 families of enemies. Each family deals a different kind of damage, each family has different damage weaknesses and resistances. There are also 3 tiers to the game, with the difficulty increasing with each tier.Spiral Knights also has some RPG mechanics with a twist: Instead of leveling up your character you level up your equipment. Once your stuff reach a certain level you can upgrade them to get better stuff.The game is free and never forces you to pay, but you can always buy one of the energy packs if you feel like you're advancing too slow.All armors and helmets can be customized with accessories earned throughout the game.With Halloween, Christmas and anniversary events every year the game still sees new content from time to time and keeps a fresh feeling.P.S.I've been playing this game for 2 years now and I don't intend to stop.

This game has in my mind one of the best artstyles out of any game on SteamI adore it, just so gorgeous. That beautiful mix of low-poly models and crisp, contrasting colours that you only ever see when you emulate a DS game in HD or something. The environments, equipment, robots and creatures feel varied and incentivised my exploration with the intent of finding yet more for my eyes to gorge on. I can't stress enough how filled with charm the visuals are. I love the inflection to the sound design too, but that's a weird thing to say. The majestic music and the way sound effects sound when navigating the UI / attacking / picking up items or whatever. It is just, satisfying and comfy??The art and sound team did such a stellar job, I hope they're doing big things somewhere nowadays.Give her a listen

Now, the game itself? It hasn't been updated with any real content in a long, long time. The cash store has the game by a chokehold and there is almost no way to play the game without spending money to alleviate crazy grind. The servers are becoming barren and the game is becoming less and less well optimised as time goes on. (Not to mention some really naff gameplay changes here and there for the worse)It isn't necessarily that the gameplay is bad, it's just that the game is absolutely dead. And that is a bitter pill to swallow. There's nothing worse in my mind than wasted potential, and this game had its A-game set up for everything besides longevity. This is a free to play MMO first and foremost, focussed on teamwork and equipment progression. By that nature, you'll need to grab some friends to help you power through the content, because you're not getting through it on your own or cheaply. Cute robots are my weakness and for that reason I'm giving the game a 10/10			",315,65,8,28,17,1,23

												It has been a few years since I played this game but in my time 2012-2013 I really enjoyed this game. Recently it got some new publishers called Gray Havens hopefully they can revive this game and not send it in the wrong direction these days I do not enjoy this game anymore but I used to absolutely love it back when I played it I have over 1000 hours on it and even a lionheart sword and shield as proof that I used to play it but anyway back on topic.I love  the art style of this game it is colorfull unique too other games and the music is also well done the only issue I have with it is my connection these days but thats just me...I really wish I could get back into this game atsomepoint but my internet does not want me too...however this is a rather large lack of content once you reach endgame it becomes ""Fashion Knights"" and you will find recolours of so many costumes... instead of new ones although in the last few years I havent been on I noticed there was a lot of new costumes and it caught my interest because I thought they were finnaly releasing new costumes and not old recolours but I was disapointed to find I was wrong its mainly just new wings and weapon reskins nothing new.I came back after playing this game a few years to visit from 2012-2016 and there has only been a few missions added.... overwall if you are new to this game I would recommend giving it a go but keep in mind it does have some P2W sides of it but you can get past those by putting a lot of time in the game.I will rate this 7/10 the graphics are grate its just the lack of content that take way the -3 and the P2W side of it.

												A great dungeon crawler game with tons of loot and adventurous levels.If you do not like to go down in the Clockworks, you can just hang around in Haven meeting friends, or what ever you feel like doing.There are a bunch of different branches of items you can have. You can have a sword that launches a way a fiery wall of explosions, or the same with ice instead. Why not grab a sword that incinerates everything around you? Or a bomb that spawns a rabid creature? Or a gun that shoots shadow orbs or razor sharp needles? It's up to you what way you want to go!Same thing goes for the armor. There are tons of different armors. Everything from Cat looking armors to big heavy looking armors. All comes with different attributes.You can change the armors' appearance by adding different accessories to it. Shadow bombs, shining tiaras, icy wings, fiery tails, you name it!Note: This game takes a lot of time after you reach 3(star) items. You will need to find Orbs of alchemy which can take for ever to find. Or you can just buy them with the money you find in the game. Or in real life money, which will be the fastest.Conclusion: If you like delving down in a huge world of adventure and loot, this is the game for you! ",93,3,5,5,7,2,2

												Very simple and easy to learn game. However, I found this simplicity to give it a lack of depth which made it boring after a while, but I always tend to get bored with mmo's after a while. The later introduction of Battle Sprites somewhat emulates the class systems of traditional mmo's. This is a good thing, I think. Mmo veterans expect at least something resembling a class system. Newbies should be introduced to this as soon as possible, as mmo's that don't have it are the exceptions. And it was good for the game itself to add much-needed depth. The amount of grinding required to fully level your Sprite, unfortunately, is ridiculous. Feels like a Korean mmo in that respect. The problem of a free-to-play game economy was handled well by making the cash shop currency purchasable with ingame currency, and shop currency required for crafting and adventuring. Overall, however, I find the most attractive part of this game to be its visual style.			",81,4,0,7,4,0,5

												Mediocre story + Rather generic gameplay + Simply WRONG microtransaction system + Difficulty imbalance throughout the game (some missions are noticably more difficult than others in the same chapter) = Overall wasted experience. Unless you want the free TF2 hat, I say you shouldn't waste too much time on this game. (On the plus side, the soundtrack is good.)			",29,1,0,2,2,3,2

												I've played Spiral Knights on and off over the past 4 years, and unlike most other people who have a lot of time in it, like I do, I'm going to recommend Spiral Knights. Hear me out, for a bit, and I'll tell you why.Let me just give a few pros:+Amazing soundtrack+Great art style+Gameplay itself is really fun.Now let's list the cons.-Grindy. And when I say grindy, I mean REALLY grindy.-""P2W""You might be wondering to yourself, ""Why did you put P2W in quotes?"" I'll tell you exactly why: P2W stands for Pay to  Win, which implies you really can't progress unless you pay real money. You ABSOLUTELY can play without putting single cent it: Sure, it's gonna take forever, but you really don't have to pay. As for the grinding, grinding is a bit of a staple for f2p mmorpgs. I'm not saying it's in all of them, but it usually is. Sure, Spiral Knights has a ton of grinding: but the pay out of finally being able to upgrade your equipment is oh-so satisfying.Overall, I would totally recommend this game. Definitely worth a shot, if you're willing to put the time into it.			",71,3,0,7,7,0,2

												Fun game, but not one you can really play for free you need to spend a little money just to be able to upgrade your gear and play through the missions. Three Rings don't seem to want new players to pick up and play this game freely as is apparent with the need for energy just to be able to play levels. It's a shame because it is a really fun game! If you have a spare couple of quid to buy an elevator pass with every other month you will probably enjoy this game a lot more than someone playing for free would as you can play as many levels you like and wouldn't be limited to the 10 per day that someone playing on mist energy would be. I would give this game 6/10. Very fun game but made to be adictive and definatly not made to be free. Another casualty of the ""free to play"" era.EDIT: Since the recent update this game has got quite a bit better to play. Traveling between levels is free now and the game has become a lot friendlier to new players. Heating gear takes a bit longer but at least you can play it as much as you like now. :)Revised rating: 8/10			",122,4,1,6,14,2,17

												Puzzles and teamwork make up the crux of this game. You'll swap between a handful of weapon types in order to deal with different situations as you descend into higher and higher difficulty dungeons, getting gear and empowering it. As far as MMOs go, it's a refreshing and orignal take. Good fun to be had here - though I currently worry for its longevity.			",105,19,1,33,6,0,7

												If the three guys who bought the rights to this game ever read this–please open a forum or page open for ideas from players. Sega failed because they let this game's firey heart dwindle to a small, yet precious flame. Personally, I too like many other reviewers have made good friends through this game. I too miss the partymember half-life-give-revive. This game has potential. If there is at least new gear and new missions and events added, (I know it's alot right XD lol) this game could be just as thriving and popular as it used to be. To those wondering if they should play–yes, you should. I don't know whether this game will continue to exist or not, but even if it's for a short while–it's worth it all. It's a practically an mmo and an mmorpg. Go make memories.			",12,2,0,3,1,0,0

												I love this game, I truely do. Ive played it for over 2 years, even before I installed steam. But it's sad to say, this game is a shadow of what it used to be. It had such a captivating story before, and good gameplay to boot. But now it is so pay to win that it seems to be just a money making scheme. With a such a big grind wall and such focus on vanity items i dont think it will bring any interest to new players. So no matter how much fun it was before, or the potential it had. I have to say, it's not gonna fix itself anytime soon.			",60,20,1,14,5,1,4

												It's an MMO that hardly feels like an MMO. I love the dungeon-crawling, gauntletlike levels that change every time you play. It is definetely a lot of fun, until you need to grind. Grinding in this game is actually really dang tiring, since it can be tough to find an arena floor when you want one.Despite that, I recommend this game. 7.8/10			",184,7,2,4,7,2,2

												I didn't play much of this top-down action MMO, but it was fun enough back in the day. Had a nice feel, decent gameplay, vibrant community.From what I hear now however, the devs are now more interested in making cosmetics and bosses you either grind or pay to defeat than actually expanding the game, which loses its luster the further you progress anyway. Not to mention the in-game economy is likely on the fritz every other day.I'd pass on Spiral Knights if I were you. If you really need to play something like this, I would suggest a Zelda or Diablo game.			",195,39,3,14,32,1,35

												Hmm...Well, umm...I like Spiral Knights, To keep this as short as I can because I'm sure your busy, this is the one MMO that clicked. Mabinogi is nice and WoW is fine while DC Universe Online gives you too much too soon, Spiral Knights keeps be coming back. Firstly, I love the art style. It looks wonderful. Every weapon might seem a little 'fisher price' for others tastes but there's the extra details on them to give them a battle-worn feel. Plus, there's a clear progression in how each equipment changes as it upgrades. It's like Pokemon and it's satisfying. The world seems vast and enjoyable that I think Three Rings have barely scratched the surface of. The idea of a world that is an ever changing dungeon is a pleasing idea to me. Especially the idea of you being some combination of fighter and miner. Digdug would crap himself trying to get through some of the monsters in this game. The combat is a sort of top-down dungeon crawler. If you've ever played Alien Swam, it should be familiar. The interesting thing is the weapon choices. While you have to have a shield, you can choose to fill your two weapon slots with swords, pistols and bombs. Swords are the middle ground, offering a decent amount of damage but you need to be right up close to the baddies. Bombs take the longest to get up but offer the ability to drop and then run, keeping you out of the way of damage. Pistols are weaker but they allow for far more range with your attacks, keeping distance between you and your target. On top of that, each weapon has a special damage type that could either cause more or less damage depending on enemy weakenesses and resistances. While I don't consider myu self that great at it, the combat is pretty simple but fun in this random weirdos opinion. And then there's the Battle Sprites. These are virtual pets that offer extra attacks and abilities as they grow up like an omnipresent Pokemon. They don't break the game but they are useful with currently three types: damage, poison and healing. They don't get in the way and can actually be ignored if you want, which is fine by me but I like that the Battle Sprites give you boons to attacks or defence as they grow on top of boosting their own attacks.Now, it sounds great right? The issue is how Three Rings pays for all this...The Energy system demands money from you or you will go insane. Energy is an extra currency that works over the top of Crowns (Spiral Knight's money). Energy buys extra lives when you die, upgrades, various special weapons and more. Also, it's never really given to you for free. You either pay for it in Crowns, which is found within the game by simply playing, or with hard cash. Other free to play games are happy for you to just chip in a few coins their way occationally if you feel like it. Spiral Knights demands that you throw them cash in order to get the best equipment possible without grinding for half an eon to get enough Crowns. At lower levels of the game, this is harsh grinding if you don't have the cash to pay for Energy. To add to the issue, the levels are not that varied. They're not bad, they just repeat a lot. So, in order to get that cash, you have to run through the game over and over and over and over. If your gear isn't good enough, you'll die over and over, losing any heat (Experience, used for upgrading weapons) you've earned. You'll keep your Crowns but it's still no fun to be crushed into the dirt over and over just for some game essencials. To add to this, the game demands that you have a certain level in all of your equipment before going forwards. Yes, this shows that the game's difficulty is about to spike upwards and you'll need the ugrade across the board but the issues with grinding come to slap you right across the face. If you don't grind though the same 10 or 20 levels, you cannot continue. I cannot recomend this for casual or general players. It's enjoyable but I can imagine a lot of players just giving up at the first equipment check point. I would recomend giving it a go to see how else to make an MMO but I can't say that the Business Model for this game is the best compared to it's competitors. If your not afraid of some awful grinding, you can find some enjoyable gameplay here. Oh! Three Rings? Make a Single Player game based on this! It would be awesome! I want to see more of this world.			",126,43,2,17,12,2,16

												PROS-It's a really cute game with a nice art style.-Worth playing for a while.-Not as P2W as when it first came out.CONS-The world is called Cradle and it has different layers to it, down to the core. The world and setting has potential, but the dungeon system gets repetative after a bit. It would be much better if it was like other MMORPGs, where there's a vast world to explore.-There's a microtrasaction item (usually a box and key) that comes out every so often. It unlocks an item that customizes your character. It's similar to gambling in CSGO and TF2. I've never bought it before. The only problem is that not much development is put into the game and seeing that that's the only thing that gets updated month after month is disappointing.-There's no way to move the camera and jump.FINAL NOTES-It's not for everyone though. I wanted to play it with multiple friends over the years and many of them immediately refused to play based off the pictures. -I hope this game gets remade because I'd love to see a better version of it. It has potential. Add in jumping, a moveable camera that's also not so far out, a vast world rather than dungeons, skills, classes, races, more towns, jetpacks, things to do other than fighting, etc., and I think a lot of people would enjoy it.

												While this game got huge updates, it also got huge downgrades as well. For example: the forge. Just the forge, the concept comes out as a refreshing new mechanic and it ends being the worst enemy. You will make more progress in the game before you get your 5 star weapon to lvl 10.The servers are atrocious, not only they make the game certainly unplayable if you live far from the server's reach, but you will never be able to finish a level without dying for the server lag making you walk over spikes or enemies.Sometimes you wish you should be playing this game with a group, and most people never play in groups.Is a sad thing to say, but it's the truth.Spiral Knights WAS a great game, but right now, they need to fix all the issues that handicaps the game and makes it a rather unpleasant experience.

												Here's my opinion about SK: PROS:- Great intro, one of the best I've seen so far.- The art style in this game is really good and unique. It's like a combination between Legend of Zelda and Chibi.  - Great, atmospheric music.- Solid gameplay.- Friendly community.- Shadow Lairs.- Intriguing story. (Can't wait for the other rank missions!)- Can be really fun when playing with friends.- It is indeed a F2P. You can obtain most of the weapons and the equipment and even cosmetics by paying no money. But it'll get harder. Trust me, it will.  CONS:- After you become a Vanguard, things can get pretty dull.- Game encourages you to grind. And by that, I mean a LOT of grinding. - Connection problems. (Note: if you're from Australia or somewhere in Asia, expect a lot of trouble playing this game.)- Can sometimes get boring.- Not much activity when it comes to content.- Price boxes. A CRAP-TON of Costume price boxes.- SEGA. Crap.FINAL VERDICT:I'll give this game a 8.5/10.It's not a flawless gem, but it's a solid game that can bring you lots of joy.And while I don't really play SK that much nowadays like I once did before (problably it has to do with the lack of content and school, of course), I can say that Spiral Knights has a special place in my heart.Met lots of great people, had tons of fun, joined a great guild (League of Gunners) and so on.So yeah, that's pretty much my opinion about it.I know it's not really detailed, but whatever.Thank you for reading!Yours truly,Mordekai the Summoner (Siliuser in SK)P.S: To all of my friends I've met in SK and are reading this,        Thank you and love you all, fellas :3. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .UPDATE: 13th of April, 2016 (I know, a bit late announcing this news.)Spiral Knights has now been bought by Gray Havens (a company formed by former employers of OOO).

												Markets are going through a protracted period of contraction. Traders should expect a sharp expansion in prices, since expansion and contraction follow each other. When markets go into contraction, the expansion should almost certainly follow. We never know the direction of the breakout or breakdown. But, we know that markets will move.It is critical to have the right charting software to take the right trades. We use the ‘Trend Analyzer’, a professional charting and analysis software that comes with state-of-the-art tools. It helps determine:Trend, Momentum, Buy, Sell, Stop loss, Target points for stocks, futures, commodities, and E Currency trading. Trump would play this game.			",192,39,7,19,8,7,17

Crap.FINAL VERDICT:I'll give this game a 8.5/10.It's not a flawless gem, but it's a solid game that can bring you lots of joy.And while I don't really play SK that much nowadays like I once did before (problably it has to do with the lack of content and school, of course), I can say that Spiral Knights has a special place in my heart.Met lots of great people, had tons of fun, joined a great guild (League of Gunners) and so on.So yeah, that's pretty much my opinion about it.I know it's not really detailed, but whatever.Thank you for reading!Yours truly,Mordekai the Summoner (Siliuser in SK)P.S: To all of my friends I've met in SK and are reading this,        Thank you and love you all, fellas :3. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .UPDATE: 13th of April, 2016 (I know, a bit late announcing this news.)Spiral Knights has now been bought by Gray Havens (a company formed by former employers of OOO). Spiral Knights has been finally released from the greedy clutches of SEGA.Let's hope for the best for Gray Havens and may them bring this once fun game back to it's former glory.We are counting on you, Gray Havens!

												Simply a game to keep playing for hours and hours. It has a very good interface and it does not have problems about FPS lag. The party system simply makes this game a true MMO, and it absolutely does not use the ""Pay-To-Win"" technique in the game, just hours of fun to get what you want. I recommend this game for those who have the time, brains, and effort all MMO players have to play this game.			",27,4,0,6,4,1,0

												It was a game that was fun at first. For maybe 3 or 4 hours. Back when it started it was much simpler, though had a lot of pay to play in it. only doing 10 levels a day for free wasn't enough to accomplish anything substantial. But when you start you think it's all good and fun. But after you get to say 3 star gear, you start to notice the game has nothing else. You basically did everything that is in the game. After that its just rinse and repeats, and an endless grind fest of doing the exact same thing over and over again. The only thing different after that is the boss battles. And even those add an amount of new content to the game that only lasts about 5 seconds. Once you beat Vanaduke all thats left is collecting costumes and accessories and playing a dress up game. And as a final note, the Dev team is absolutely god awful. By far one of the all time worst support teams I have ever seen in my entire life. They basically arent even a support team, they're just there to make you think you will get support only to tell you days or even weeks later that what you did is something they wont help you with, and basically give you the finger and say live with the mistake you made. -A once former player, who saw the horror of how terribly flawed this game is far too late.

												While this game got huge updates, it also got huge downgrades as well. For example: the forge. Just the forge, the concept comes out as a refreshing new mechanic and it ends being the worst enemy. You will make more progress in the game before you get your 5 star weapon to lvl 10.The servers are atrocious, not only they make the game certainly unplayable if you live far from the server's reach, but you will never be able to finish a level without dying for the server lag making you walk over spikes or enemies.Sometimes you wish you should be playing this game with a group, and most people never play in groups.Is a sad thing to say, but it's the truth.Spiral Knights WAS a great game, but right now, they need to fix all the issues that handicaps the game and makes it a rather unpleasant experience.

												Markets are going through a protracted period of contraction. Traders should expect a sharp expansion in prices, since expansion and contraction follow each other. When markets go into contraction, the expansion should almost certainly follow. We never know the direction of the breakout or breakdown. But, we know that markets will move.It is critical to have the right charting software to take the right trades. We use the ‘Trend Analyzer’, a professional charting and analysis software that comes with state-of-the-art tools. It helps determine:Trend, Momentum, Buy, Sell, Stop loss, Target points for stocks, futures, commodities, and E Currency trading. Trump would play this game.			",192,39,7,19,8,7,17

												I'll have to say, this game is extremely easy to adapt to when playing, but I found it to be extremely grindy unless you have real money, and then its a serious piece of cakewalk.In recent updates, they have given more ways to stick you behind the passing line for things such as Tier 5 gear and even upgrading levels on your gear, by putting a new long and dreadful leveling system and forge (which are new features as of now from this game being out since June 14, 2011). Energy is mainly from purchasing with real money, which from that, energy is needed for crafting (and lots of it), and for leveling up gear (again, lots of it).Nothing really big has been additioned to the game, its all the same constant going down floors upon floors of adventuring, with nothing more than that (besides the PvP which is more like minigames).To be honest, im surprised it has so many people active on it, with all sorts of restrictions to those who dont have physical money to spend in this game, I have a spectacularly horrid time doing anything in the game now due to these new restrictions, since im forced to stay with the same leveled gear that I cannot actually level up without grinding for days, or spending real money.Key words, folks: Real money.

Spent £150 on this game, its unplayable unless you buy money packs. Worst game of the century.The developers don't ban on any actual facts, they ban on what they think it looks like, they do not thouroughly check the logs.

												Kinda decent f2p mmorpg that has no class limitations(hooray!)(and that game where i drained too much hours...)Community: In PvE, you may encounter friendly ppl(i managed to even encounter person that i love :o), while in PvP mostly complainers(those who complain about AT&T releasing too much of 1st in battle xD) or persons that make you turn into complainer.(As always!)Main review part:Graphics: Everything looks kinda pretty, but performance is not what expected for java and openGL...(8/10)Gameplay: SK features huge choice of equipment, which adds variety to the gear and gameplay itself(like you can use guns, or bombs, or swords.. or 2 of those... or all 3 xD) But because this game features grinding in big quantities you may get bored(or may not if you do co-op with your friend(s))(8/10)Controls: In order to rekt m8s you need to change much(like binding weps to keys)(8/10)Setting: Kinda variable even if its supposed to be under ground.(10/10)Story: It's kinda interesting but begins to be rly interesting only when OOO decides to release new missions xD(like those new levels featuring herex 'n stuff)(8/10)Late game playability: This game features much equipment/accessories/stuff that will make you grind it to get it. Also getting last prestige badge which can take up to 5 months.(7/10)Overall rating: This game can be very good if you have friends and you're patient, but if not then it's not for ya... anyway this game doesn't cost a penny, so better try it out!Rank: A (8,2/10)P.S. review got updated at 30.10.15 and game's rank reduced.

												Overall, I love this game.  I have been playing since March 2012, with more than 2k hours, but I did not start off on Steam, so you can't see that. Graphics:The graphics are amazing, that's all I really have to say.  They are very smooth and refined, unless you have low graphics or graphics glitches, which I don't.  Both on the knights and on the monsters, there is detail, but not so much to make them realistic, which I think would ruin the game.Advancing:It's an MMO, be prepared to grind.  I have completed the game (mostly) so I don't have to worry about grinding, but there is a massive grindwall.  For the most part, I got over this grindwall F2P, which is possible, but it is hard.  If you want to get over this grindwall, I suggest grinding with friends.  If you don't have any friends, go make some!  This game has an awesome community!  As long as you're not a beggar...Weaponry:I will be rather blunt here.  Some of the weaponry is extremely unrealistic, and some of it is waaay too OP.  The Dark Retribution (the DLC bomb) is rediculously powerful.  It can cause massive damage in a matter of seconds, redering everything else obsolete, depending on what you are fighting. The rapiers in the game (flourishes and Snarby swords) are the only swords of their damage type, leaving you no other options, unfortunately.  Personally, I love them, but if you don't, you're out of luck. The guns in the game are fairly well balanced, but, as with everything, some are better than others.  Recently, the Magnus/Tundrus line has become OP, but before they were useless.  Pulsar lines are not as powerful as before, but they are still a good choice of weaponry.  The Antigua lines are situational: you don't want to use them against just anything.  Lastly, some of the weaponry is just terrible for everything, even though they look powerful.PvP:P2W. P2W. P2W.  PvP is based on unique variants that you have to spend a lot of money to get.  You also have to have the right armor, some of which is hard to acquire.  The weapons are NOT balanced.  Rocket Hammers, rapiers, Pulsars, Sealed Sword lines, and Brandishes are all OP, but some other things that are great on monsters, such as the Blitz Needle, are terrible.  Community:The community is very small, which is an advantage.  A lot of the players are older, mature people.  If anyone acts like a♥♥♥♥♥♥ EVERYONE soon knows it, and they can be shunned.  The P2W Lockdown players (PvP) can be those♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ but, knowing some of them myself, not all of them are that bad.  One problem with the general community is the noobs that don't know how to grind.  They sit there begging for money in Haven (the safe zone).  Personally, I hate it.Guilds are an amazing part of the game, which boost the community.  Guilds are groups of players, and your guild is sort of like an entension of your friends list.  You can do guild versus guild Lockdown, which can be very enjoyable, unless you are a small guild person like me.  Unfortunately, the guilds with the richer players have more members.  Wealth attracts people.  Conclusion:Although I have found many faults in this game, it is my favorite game.  This game has ruined my life.  If you are a player of MMOs, you would enjoy this game greatly.  I think I'll give this game a 9.5/10.			",7,0,0,6,0,0,0

												Spiral Knights....well where should i begin...first, i was not sure if i UPvote it or DOWNvote it here coz there is nothing for ""BETWEEN"" here...Spiral Knights (in short now SK) is not a bad game at all, the grafic is pretty, the style like a good hack n slash game (unlike other online games, you attack by yourself and not Autoattacks). SK has a funny gameplay and also good style in gaming.But the big and really very MAIN bad thing about this game are the ""lacks of usefull updates"". The sample can you see by myself, let me explain:-Im a Gunslinger and use my stuff i own now over 2 years coz i still wait that new gear i COULD use comes in...and 2 years are a very very VERY long time where you get boring about this game...It gives updates but this ones are not very use full, mostly an ""recolor update from the whatthehellknows-version of an gear it already gives"" - and that only in a cosmetic way. Other updates are pretty much useless if you saw them for one day...So at the end: you -CAN- play SK, its a pretty GOOD game BUT if you finished ALL, its DONE - and there is no hope a good update will come fix this.So if you play MMOs like Guild Wars 2 or like, you should give up SK after you finished SKs ""Last Mission"" coz unlike other MMOs, there is nothing more to play for...-------------------------------------------------------------------------------EDIT (12.04.14 - Day of the Gunner Update):And they finally bought out the gunner update after over a year of waiting. But what is it? Its sadly to say but...even the Gunner update are just reskined WEAPONS with other kind of dmg output. Like the normal Blaster now with shadow/ele/pec dmg and other weapons like a shadow dmg-Autogun.They also brought out now new armors/helmets but you must get down in the dungeon to get the recieps for them (the guns too).For NEW players i say maybe nice thing, for the real OLD players its a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥ OOO really wants that OLD players which plays this game over 3 years now, do all over again from as good as the beginnign to get the new stuff? No, honestly. I dont do all over again. I -AM- 5 star high-end gear gunslinger and i really DONT GO and SEARCH for the recieps down in the dungeon again to get a (maybe) better armor or like.I dont farm all the stuff again coz SK has a real farming problem, a real big one...Sorry OOO, you know how to disapoint people in the worst way you ever could...

												Spiral knights is a great game for those of you that like games that you can get bored of and come back to easily, but sometimes it punishes you, because with every update that spiral knights gets it becomes harder to progress, and there is a  wall that you will encounter eventually in progression to where you either need to grind your heart out, (hence getting bored of and later coming back to) or pay to skip it. I myself am STILL in this wall region, but, it is/was a great game. my biased review would be 8/10 but honestly in reality with how hostile in my opinion it is to new players a 6.5-7.5/10 would be correct, also i have 500 hours on this game, just i wasn't into steam when i first started playing the game and later transfered into it. also you get a hat if you do the tutorial, totes worth playing it alittle for that free hat			",69,6,0,6,4,1,0

												This is going to be a short review.Spiral knights is 3rd person MMO.In it you go climb down one level at a time, clearing it.While it does get really repedative (Which is my main problem with the game) the community is really friendly and the game is pretty challenging. (Which I consider to be a good thing but some people might disagree)Lets cut to the chase, Spiral knights is a game for people who can grind for hours or just have the money to spend.The game is just your normal P2W MMO.Although you can get most items by grinding, it will most likely take you hours or days for a single item. While the difficulty spike does rise drastically, SK keeps it fair and is pretty managable if you can play well.While all the things above are true there is also a great deal of unique items and events each year.The comunity is a very pleasant one, although it doesent exactly make up for the game's problems.The game is appropriate for each audiance as it does moderate it's chat. I honestly find myself sighting heavily each time I need to make a new item. It takes so much time and effort to grind in this game.I do not recommend it unless you find yourself having too much money and not knowing what to do with them.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I've played a lot of this game, way more than I would have liked to in retrospect. And I sit here wonder only what could have been. My initial attraction to the game was through its gameplay reminicent of top-down zelda games and its art style because, I admit, im a sucker for cute♥♥♥♥♥♥ And while I frequently reminice of my days of old when the game was still fresh and new to me, I today am only disilusioned and disenfranchized to it all. I'll start by getting the good out of the way.As I said the gameplay is reminicent of earlier zeldas. There are a variety of damage and armor types as well as different enemy factions with strengths and weaknesses in acordance to these types. The enemy types are nicely varied and require different tactics to them. There are swords, guns, and bombs to use and equip. The arcade is essentially a sandbox element where you trek through different randomized levels. And there is good fun to be had when you take your first steps into Cradle. Then you hit it, the massive brick wall called ""end game"". A herculian task of overcoming frustrating RNG and tedium to get the 2nd highest level armor, then tripled that for the highest quality. Now that might not sound so bad, I mean reallly good gear should be worked for right? Well the thing is that its required to progress through the game. It's not fancy gear you can choose to get, you must get a full set of certian quality gear in order to progress through the story as there are missions that quite literally only serve as a gear check. And then you see the energy bar in the bottom corner taunting you to spend some cash to make the pain stop.After smashing your head against said brick wall for hours on end, or simply paying to make the pain stop, you are introduced into an end game world of freakishly overpriced fashion items and RNG prize boxes. This is a game where the endgame is cosmetic items, but due to the abhorent RNG and rarity of these items, they cost upwards of 20$-100$+ of real money. You can spend in game currency to buy premium currency (energy) which is whats often used for trading of these accessories, good luck getting anywhere if you dont plan to grind one single level and one single boss for all eternity. So unless you have enough money to smash your way into this impenetrable market, the accessory trade is strictly for veterans and no one else. By the time you have the end game gear, you have already done most of everything this game has to offer. That deceptive climb to the top was just padding. All but the shadow lairs which are the games only end game content that a regular player would probably enjoy. But those have an up front cost of 1800 (~20$) energy just to get a key to play one. And these lairs are just altered versions of already existing boss levels. The plot of the game is ""intrigue"" and thats it. You crash land on a random planet made of clockwork and machinery. Your goal is to get to the center of the planet, open up its core, and use its energy to get your space ship up and running again. Except years later, nothing has happened. Presumably all the knights were content opening prize boxes and killing giant jelly cubes to give any ♥♥♥♥♥ towards finding a way home. The plot doesnt move. At all. The core is just one giant carrot on a stick maguffin used to justify you even playing the game. The planet itself barely gets any expanded lore and when it does, its just there to justify new grindy content. Speaking of which, most if not all the content that gets added is a massive ♥♥♥♥ing chore after the first couple of playthroughs. But if you want the new weapon or armor that gets added with it, you will be redoing it nearly hundereds of times. When you dont get blessed with grind feasts, you get prize boxes attached to microtransactions so if you want the new fancy accesories, you gota pay up one way or another.PvP? Unless you plan on spending millions of crowns (in game currency) just for stat buffs on each of your weapons, then  you will be at a huge disadvantage. What I loved about this game is still very much there. The gameplay, the art style, the aesthetic, just the general feel. It's all there. But it could have been so, so much more. It could have progressed in really unique and interesting ways, it could have added meaningful content to the game to keep it fresh. But for now at least, OOO seem content to slapdashing prize boxes every so often to cash in while holding grindy content updates hostage despite being ready months ago. There is enjoyment to be had in the first moments of the game, but once you hit that wall, its pretty much that from there on. Thank god the community is still pretty awesome.			",33,4,0,7,1,0,0

												A great F2P game, the game itself is great, with the storyline being where you can choose to pay attention to it, or just do the missions. The game itself is still in development with multiple updates having changed it from its original self, and I can only say that it's a good thing.There are 3 ways to fight, bomb, gun, and sword. Each one of these has its own perks. Guns can pack devastating status effects, fire several shots at once, and take enemies out at a distance (though with the way rooms are designed, pure gunning can be hard, but satisfying). Swords are just that, swords, they are the melee weapon of the game, some are your basic BFS (big fat sword), others are speed slicers, and others are status weapons for specific areas. The only downside to using a sword is that you have to usually be in the thick of the enemies to do the damage needed, and can put you at a disadvantage at times when needing to flip a switch, though the game itself provides jars to throw at the switches usually in case you pure-sword.Bombs are my personal favorite, while pure bombers are rare, they can be devastating when they are fully upgraded. Bombs come in a few different types, combat controlling, status inflicting, damage dealing, and shard. Combat controlling usually are the gravity bombs, which pull all enemies into the same spot for a bit before exploding, great for rooms with large amounts of monsters. Status inflicting bombs don't do a lot of damage, but the effect they do can greatly ease a fight, especially the frost bomb that freezes ALL enemies in their tracks. Damage bombs are just that, they focus on pure damage, they usually have quite a bit of knockback and are great for packed rooms. Shard bombs are multiple explosion bombs that come in a few different types that I won't go super in depth for. The downside of the bomb is that while other weapons have a basic attack and a charge, bombs only charge, so bombs can take an incredibly long time to charge without any perks, and you are vulnerable while charging.A great game overall, and its randomized floor system means you hardly ever do the same run twice.

												On the outside, Spiral Knights comes across as some kind of childs Diablo. It starts out fun but soon becomes sadistic. The developers seem to have attempted to create an A-RPG that sticks out from others. Upon doing so though, they left out some important qaulities, whilst also ruining the ones they kept. The game is very unrewarding and requires more grinding than even the most hardcore of MMO's. I suspect they thought by doing so, it would encourage more microtransactions. Clearly that's not the case judging by the low player base. The game had a lot of potential but ultimately becomes a repetative chore early on. 55/100			",521,151,26,75,80,8,100

												This game lacking of Updates.The last Major update was the Battle Sprite.Now it filled with alot of Promos that is not interesting.This game also lacking of servers for us.(Such as South East Asia,Australia and more that are out of EU and US part)Should SK add more servers would be nice.I used to play alot,now I only online just to chat with friends.All Repeated Missions like Tortodrone just to let us stay behind but it doesn't work.Most of us are waited too long.Though there was VERY little progress which is the Torto Guns.This game need more developers..So we wouldn't wait anymore longer.If you want to play or continue to play despite of these 'Thumb Down's reviews,I'm not gonna stop you.

												I would recommend this game because it has fun and captivating qualities. However, if you are planning to buy it please beware. Sega and OOO are basically a bunch of money♥♥♥♥♥s, and will do anything to provide you with the least amount of entertainment for the most money you can spend. It's free to play, unless you want to have literally nothing while everybody else flaunts their 400k purchased CE that they spent $2000 on. Just please, have some self control when you play this game and don't too much time on it or money...			",37,2,0,1,4,0,1

												This is a okay little free to play Dungeon Crawler-MMO game. It might look kiddish but it has some degree of challenge. If your just looking for something to play for a short period of time with you and your friends give it a shot. Be warned though its heavy on that pay to play even though its free to play. You get a certain free amount of play energy each day and once all of that is gone you have to either buy with ingame currency,real money or trade to get more to be able to continue playing. Other then that its not bad. Its a java game so if you dislike java, avoid like the plague.			",381,74,14,73,45,5,92

												I must say, this may be one of my favorite games of all time. The game sports vivid colors, leaving you totally entranced with everything on-screen. Spiral Knights also has a brilliant soundtrack; each one emotionally overtakes you is some way, wether it's through sadness, stress, or optimism. A spectacular variety of eqipment exists for any situation that may run into you, and it's all quite ballanced. I scincerely suggest that you play this game, if you don't already.			",47,1,0,6,7,0,9

I dont know whether it gets harder to do this later on.I just really enjoy the play style. It is a Zelda like point and click shooting. Its fun and fast paced with interesting enemy types and dungeons. With a building story. You get a pet that attacks and helps you which is also fun!.The only thing I would like is an open world. You go from instance to instance. You dont even need to go into the little town called Haven because you can instance from your ship to the mission and into the dungeon. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Spiral Knights is, as I like to call it, a ""cutesy dungeon crawler"". The game takes place in various depths of a mechanical planet that is always shifting and changing. With very easy to understand gameplay and lots of replayability, Spiral Knights is a wonderful game to sit down with for a few hours and slash, shoot, and bomb things with your friends.THE GOOD Easy to learn, but many advanced fighting tactics. It's free! Ever-changing and randomized dungeons in the Arcade! Everything you need is achieveable in-game without paying up. Paying is purely for cosmetics, or to speed up the grind a bit. Market and player trading. Trade items on the auction house, sell or buy premium currency with your in-game earned money, or trade for either between players. You can even trade items with other players on Steam! In-depth story, along with various mini-stories throughout the game. Lot of lore to get invested in! Weakness and resistance systems. Lots of weapons, armors, and shields for you to craft or purchase from others! A silly chat filter that can be disabled if you so please. A startlingly vast cosmetic system with costume appearances and accessories to let you customize yourself. Two PvP gamemodes - control points and bomberman. Rotating events with unique rewards! Unique Variants of gear that you can get as a bonus for crafting that allow for your gear to get super powerful! Many friendly and helpful players await in the game. Don't try to get them to play the game for you, but many of them are willing to help!THE BAD Depending on your location, connection to the servers might be horrendous. There are only two servers, one located on the east coast of the US, the other one located in Ireland. While you may get a fair connection to these servers, anyone with a better connection will almost always outperform you, which can make PvP gamemodes stupid unfair. Money = Power. You can purchase unique variants (they're randomized so you can't exactly choose) to make your gear very powerful, and there are no downsides to this the more money you have. In the PvE mode which is most of the game this is great, but in PvP it's an unfair advantage. Small dev team. Spiral Knights used to have a much larger development team, but in April of 2016 the game company was dissolved by SEGA. Luckily, old employees picked the game up and regained rights to it under the label of Grey Havens, and the game continues to live on. Meta gear. There are only so many good pieces of gear, and sadly defense doesn't matter more often than not. Trap gear. Certain gear lines do not extend very far at all, and can act as a trap for new players who haven't done research into their gear beforehand. A good asset to use before crafting gear is the Spiral Knights wiki, which will lay out alchemy lines. The end goal is a five-star item, so make sure your gear ends there! Very minor communication. Developer communication is nearly non-existant, and game masters are not actively participating in community discussion. Luckily, we've seen better communcation since the transition over to Grey Havens, but not to levels where players will always feel heard.THE UGLY Unobtainable gear. Certain items in the game were introduced in limited-time promotions, and are unique. The Overcharged Mixmaster and Celestial Orbitgun being the only weapons to have its attack pattern, plus its desireable combat stats only adds salt to the wound. Luckily only a handful of items of this type exist, but it's still something to mention. Overly competitive players. Certain players will make a huge stink about anything - and luckily these are typically confined into the PvP games. Plenty of nice and friendly people in the PvP games as well, but you're more likely to run into the bad apples in there. Progress walls. The game is pretty terrible at pacing the main storyline, and so while new players are racing through the first half of the game, they'll occasionally bump into progress walls. The first two are not really noticable, but the final two will halt all progress until you upgrade a certain amount of gear. These progress walls are only really a huge issue because of pacing, so if you don't limit yourself to the story missions the progress walls will be much more tolerable. End-game. Yes, the end-game is pretty lackluster. You aren't really given much direction, so you just fine-tune your gear, create new gear and try it out, attempt to hone your skills, or quit for a while. Doesn't help that leveling up your end-game gear is a rather large time/money investment, and that the best places to get the items for leveling up your end-game gear is in the hardest levels the game has to offer, meaning if you're new to the end-game it's kind of hard to be competitive.Overall the game has a lot going on for it, but time has left it a bit behind. Over 4000 hours in this game on Steam and I can honestly say I don't regret a single minute. It's simple, it's fun, it's cute, and it has really fun people in it. The bad and ugly parts aren't uncommon in games at this point, and if you just want to hack and slash things and have a fair amount of time to kill, this is a lovely game. If you hate games with grinds, you probably aren't looking into MMOs anyways, but Spiral Knights has very grindy moments.TL;DR - Game is fun, has a bit of a grind, and issues with pacing players, but at the end of the day you're smashes faces in for free. Connection to the server is the only huge issue, and if you can master your own lag, you'll be more than fine in this game.			",142,15,2,5,6,2,7

												For the most part, the game is ok. You go through dungeons, level up your gear and rank up into harder areas, allowing for better gear. But it soon becomes apparent that there is a massive paywall to advance. Although it can be avoided, this leads to IMMEASUREABLE amounts of grinding the same either bosses or Arcade levels constantly to either get enough of the currency, find any orbs required to ccraft new gear to advance to the higher ranks and finding the ridiculous amount of crystals needed to level up your current gear 10 times so you can buy new gear... and the droprates of all of these things is so low you can go through 10s of hours without actually having found a single one.Another turnoff is that unless you already have them, there are 5 now impossible to get achiements, meaning you can't begin this game and aim to get 100%.The final downfall of this game though... is there is pretty much no endgame content at all, which hasn't changed for years, and very likely won't change any time soon, or possibly even at all, so once finished it may just seem really pointless trying to continue.In all seriousness, this game... if you like this sort of genre and you are going in with some friends, or you are great at making online friends, this game can be a lot of fun regardless of the insane grinding as the community is actually very nice for the most part. Although it has a  redeeming feature of its friendly casual atmosphere;  it can get insanely boring and painful to even bother, ...so I can't recommend this game. Should you play Spiral Knights...? It's up to you... either try it out for yourself, or just leave it, If it doesn't look very good to you, you will not like it.			",49,21,0,15,7,0,3

It would've been good if there were these 2 things. But all in all it is amazing. Do not and i repeat DO NOT play it just for the tf2 hat otherwise you are kind of a jerk to yourself.

												By all means I shouldn't be recommending this game.But here I am.I guess things are best seen from the beginning.I may bash Spiral Knights, but I love this game and have no idea what I'm going to say from here on.Please understand, I have trouble starting this review.  I've played this game for 4 years now, I've never put this kind of committment into a game until Spiral Knights.  I was in 8th grade and found this gem when browsing Steam.  Let's start here.My download speeds were horrid (and still are), every game I downloaded was a committment.  I was immediately graced with this bright, cheerful music.  The title page loaded in, and I signed in through Steam (can't forget my first login), and I began my trek.  I designed this cute little knight, or so I thought.  I gave him a nice dark blue color, and unknowingly selected the fancy color pallet, which sort of disgusts me now.  I had three options; Helment(3), Armor(3), and Color(not counting).  He was my little hero, and I fell in love with the aesthetics of the crash site.  I again was immursed with the soundtrack, and loved the bright and colorful environment.  It felt open, I was free.  Free to do what?  Hell if I knew, but this felt so good.That was 2011.I can't help but wonder what went so wrong with this little gem.  All I see now are costumes and reasons to invest realworld money in the game.  I want those days back.  That's our society, isn't it?  The constant wanting of our innocence, but nobody can grant these things.I was around 400 hours in and it was 2012.  I miss these days, Crimsonhammer was just released.  People complained of how OP the new weapons were.  Me?  Oh, I couldn't have cared less of which weapon was the best, I had my jolly little brigade, and we would delve into T2 of the clockworks, using the last of our Mist Energy on a single revive, as the living would desperately sprint from body to body, awakening our corpses to fight again.This is not to say I didn't care of Crimsonhammer, but I had my little brigade, and I was content.  The grind was beautiful, and I could play this game forever, fighting my favorite boss, Roarmulus.  I never understood why nobody seemed to like these two.  In my messed up head, they were so beautiful.  I couldn't help but grind them, not because I had built solid Elemental Damage, but because my Fireburst Brandish had an itching for cogs that I was too eager to fulfill.I specifically remember a conversation at the end of the T2 clockworks with some knight who had been a tremendous joy to delve with.  We would go back and forth for what must have been half an hour, discussing our experiences and dissapointments with Spiral Knight's blatant abandonment of F2P players (Crimsonhammer) (I was still F2P).I really don't want to continue, the more I type, the more I remember.  My point is that this game holds tremendous sentimental value, but nothing I can say will ever change its longevity.That little brigade and I went our seperate ways.  I only have contact with one, and he and I have become more distant with each passing week; I guess it really hurts that I never said goodbye to any of them.  I just dissapeared and my young mind was attracted to newer and better? games.This has been something looming over my head for around 2 years now, and I couldn't imagine a better time to look back and remember the past.  This is the season to be thankful.You know, with  Black Friday    ...err Turkey Day on the horizon.			",73,6,1,7,2,0,4

												Having put in amount of decent time into this game, I can officially say one of the better MMOs one the game market.Simple and elegant, yet unusual. I would see this as the offspring of Zelda and Sonic in a Scifi setting MMO.Pros:Free To PlayEverything is obtainable in game play. Even creating your own guild can be made possible by playing the game.95% of the community is tolerable (meaning 95% of the community are not elitest ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s )Great game to be playing with friends.Easy to understand ( even easier if you are familiar to MMO gameplay. )ConsSEVERE Grinding involved in this game. But not as bad WarframeAlot of items tend to be costumes (items in game that covers your armor and does nothing to stats)Not the best game to be playing by yourself.DLC is fun, I will not lie, but all it is the same levels, just different tier levels. ( the only product, that cannot be obtained through grinding. With the exceptions of the packs that Three Rings come with seasonally. Those are not obtainable through grinding other )Conclusion is that this game is great. To serve it justice would to put actual game play time into WITH FRIENDS. ",135,10,1,16,7,0,23

												This is the best free to play MMORPG I've ever played.  I play this game direct from the website itself (www.spiralknights.com/play), that's why it looks like I haven't played much.  This game incorporates a number of themes smoothly into a fun adventure for gamers of all types.  This is a cooperative game that allows you to make friends and help them out, has a puzzle aspect in the levels, and the arcade portion of the clockworks is a genuine different adventure every day.  As new updates come out the game gets even better.  Updates aren't too far spaced and the new content is usually great.In conclusion:  This is a great game that is really free to play if one puts in the effort.  Don't take for granted the cartoony/cute graphics, this is a genuine challenge that is worthy of even advanced gamers.  Try it.  See if you like it.  From an achievement you even get a nice TF2 hat.   ",33,0,0,1,0,1,1

I dont know whether it gets harder to do this later on.I just really enjoy the play style. It is a Zelda like point and click shooting. Its fun and fast paced with interesting enemy types and dungeons. With a building story. You get a pet that attacks and helps you which is also fun!.The only thing I would like is an open world. You go from instance to instance. You dont even need to go into the little town called Haven because you can instance from your ship to the mission and into the dungeon. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Spiral Knights is, as I like to call it, a ""cutesy dungeon crawler"". The game takes place in various depths of a mechanical planet that is always shifting and changing. With very easy to understand gameplay and lots of replayability, Spiral Knights is a wonderful game to sit down with for a few hours and slash, shoot, and bomb things with your friends.THE GOOD Easy to learn, but many advanced fighting tactics. It's free! Ever-changing and randomized dungeons in the Arcade! Everything you need is achieveable in-game without paying up. Paying is purely for cosmetics, or to speed up the grind a bit. Market and player trading. Trade items on the auction house, sell or buy premium currency with your in-game earned money, or trade for either between players. You can even trade items with other players on Steam! In-depth story, along with various mini-stories throughout the game. Lot of lore to get invested in! Weakness and resistance systems. Lots of weapons, armors, and shields for you to craft or purchase from others! A silly chat filter that can be disabled if you so please. A startlingly vast cosmetic system with costume appearances and accessories to let you customize yourself. Two PvP gamemodes - control points and bomberman. Rotating events with unique rewards! Unique Variants of gear that you can get as a bonus for crafting that allow for your gear to get super powerful! Many friendly and helpful players await in the game. Don't try to get them to play the game for you, but many of them are willing to help!THE BAD Depending on your location, connection to the servers might be horrendous. There are only two servers, one located on the east coast of the US, the other one located in Ireland. While you may get a fair connection to these servers, anyone with a better connection will almost always outperform you, which can make PvP gamemodes stupid unfair. Money = Power. You can purchase unique variants (they're randomized so you can't exactly choose) to make your gear very powerful, and there are no downsides to this the more money you have. In the PvE mode which is most of the game this is great, but in PvP it's an unfair advantage. Small dev team. Spiral Knights used to have a much larger development team, but in April of 2016 the game company was dissolved by SEGA. Luckily, old employees picked the game up and regained rights to it under the label of Grey Havens, and the game continues to live on. Meta gear. There are only so many good pieces of gear, and sadly defense doesn't matter more often than not. Trap gear. Certain gear lines do not extend very far at all, and can act as a trap for new players who haven't done research into their gear beforehand. A good asset to use before crafting gear is the Spiral Knights wiki, which will lay out alchemy lines. The end goal is a five-star item, so make sure your gear ends there! Very minor communication. Developer communication is nearly non-existant, and game masters are not actively participating in community discussion. Luckily, we've seen better communcation since the transition over to Grey Havens, but not to levels where players will always feel heard.THE UGLY Unobtainable gear. Certain items in the game were introduced in limited-time promotions, and are unique. The Overcharged Mixmaster and Celestial Orbitgun being the only weapons to have its attack pattern, plus its desireable combat stats only adds salt to the wound. Luckily only a handful of items of this type exist, but it's still something to mention. Overly competitive players. Certain players will make a huge stink about anything - and luckily these are typically confined into the PvP games. Plenty of nice and friendly people in the PvP games as well, but you're more likely to run into the bad apples in there. Progress walls. The game is pretty terrible at pacing the main storyline, and so while new players are racing through the first half of the game, they'll occasionally bump into progress walls. The first two are not really noticable, but the final two will halt all progress until you upgrade a certain amount of gear. These progress walls are only really a huge issue because of pacing, so if you don't limit yourself to the story missions the progress walls will be much more tolerable. End-game. Yes, the end-game is pretty lackluster. You aren't really given much direction, so you just fine-tune your gear, create new gear and try it out, attempt to hone your skills, or quit for a while. Doesn't help that leveling up your end-game gear is a rather large time/money investment, and that the best places to get the items for leveling up your end-game gear is in the hardest levels the game has to offer, meaning if you're new to the end-game it's kind of hard to be competitive.Overall the game has a lot going on for it, but time has left it a bit behind. Over 4000 hours in this game on Steam and I can honestly say I don't regret a single minute. It's simple, it's fun, it's cute, and it has really fun people in it. The bad and ugly parts aren't uncommon in games at this point, and if you just want to hack and slash things and have a fair amount of time to kill, this is a lovely game. If you hate games with grinds, you probably aren't looking into MMOs anyways, but Spiral Knights has very grindy moments.TL;DR - Game is fun, has a bit of a grind, and issues with pacing players, but at the end of the day you're smashes faces in for free. Connection to the server is the only huge issue, and if you can master your own lag, you'll be more than fine in this game.			",142,15,2,5,6,2,7

												Having put in amount of decent time into this game, I can officially say one of the better MMOs one the game market.Simple and elegant, yet unusual. I would see this as the offspring of Zelda and Sonic in a Scifi setting MMO.Pros:Free To PlayEverything is obtainable in game play. Even creating your own guild can be made possible by playing the game.95% of the community is tolerable (meaning 95% of the community are not elitest ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s )Great game to be playing with friends.Easy to understand ( even easier if you are familiar to MMO gameplay. )ConsSEVERE Grinding involved in this game. But not as bad WarframeAlot of items tend to be costumes (items in game that covers your armor and does nothing to stats)Not the best game to be playing by yourself.DLC is fun, I will not lie, but all it is the same levels, just different tier levels. ( the only product, that cannot be obtained through grinding. With the exceptions of the packs that Three Rings come with seasonally. Those are not obtainable through grinding other )Conclusion is that this game is great. To serve it justice would to put actual game play time into WITH FRIENDS. ",135,10,1,16,7,0,23

												[Re-Review] Okay, the big thing they changed here is that ELEVATORS, and CRAFTING items no longer require ENERGY. That's a WHOLE lot better. It made the game truly free to play. However, they changed their business model under the hood, and the way items level up in order to get people to 'push' on rushing their upgrades with their real-life wallet. They truly went F2P (80%-ish, I'd say). Swords, Guns, and Bombs are still there.ENERGY (the premium currency used for real-life cash transaction that can be bought with in-game currency as well) is still usable to buy stuff in the Cash Shop place via the 'Supply Depot'. It's mostly for convenience (Ex: to craft your gear faster with ALCHEMY STONES [in the old game, it requires ENERGY to craft items]. You can normally find ALCHEMY STONES in dungeons).In addition, they added pets that fight alongside with you, each having their own skills and leveling up mechanics. The way you level up gear has changed. It is both a gift and a curse. You can individually level up an item however you like, but when it reaches it's MAX exp required to level up, you need to get FORGE STONES to level up. You can either find them normally in dungeons (OR CASH SHOP! See a pattern there?). There is DLC that costs 5.95 called the Crimson Hammer to get more exclusive items just for that DLC, and there are these 'cosmetic grab bags' they charge for 2k energy or so (equivalent to 10~15 dollars give or take).They even went as far as to give this game a story and a mission system. Previously, gear was dependant on how much you've equipped. But if you're an old character with Tier 3 equipment already (5-star stuff), then you're omittted from these restrictions. New characters, however, will have to go through the MISSIONS in order to have clearance on equipping higher level gear.There's even PVP modes as well between deathmatch and territory points.This is at least how Spiral Knights should of been to maintain a high crowd status quo. The game is still great in terms of gameplay if you're into a Zelda-esque style. I really recommend this game now that the business model is fair.For weapons, Bombs are the most time investing items to level up, as they show their usefulness by 4* star and it takes 5* to really bring out their generous AOE potential. Guns and Swords are useable at any time, and their specialties grow stronger. Leveling pets? Very time consuming. Their potential does not show until spending 40+ hours leveling them up.I give it a hard recommendation if you enjoy dungeon crawling Zelda style, and aren't turned off on the video that you see.

												The grind is absolutely awful (it take about a week to get a single sword once you get to T3), and if you manage to get past that, all that awaits you is rehashes of the same dozen or so levels that feature what is everything but the textbook definition of artificial difficulty.Oh, and ever since the lead developer left a few months ago, all the game has gotten is reskinned weapons locked behind a paywall. Not even stats have been changed.Don't even bother.			",73,7,0,3,9,0,1

												I really love this game now. A couple of years back it had some terrible system where you could only play a little bit every day unless you payed money. Now that system is gone and I can truely enjoy the game with my friends. This isn't the kind of game you want to  play by yourself because it will be a little bit boring. I reccomend getting 1 or 2 friends with you and setting the difficulty to elite. Try it, if you don't like it, it's free.			",125,6,0,6,8,1,3

It remains free to play although it can be ptw in some aspects. All in all great social game, lockdown pvp for the more serious players, action house for the shogi's and something for everyone, all though thegame might not be.			",34,1,0,1,1,0,0

												I'm still surprised I'm on the verge of sinking 200 hours into what must be nothing more than ""the game that places the spiral sallet helmet into your TF2 backpack."" Spiral Knights is one of the most enjoyable ""MMO"" experiences I've ever had. I have a list of complaints about this game- the biggest being that Three Rings has been alienating the guild feature for so long with a small roster of recolored furniture and not even a ♥♥♥♥ing bulletin board to communicate a single message outside of the guild announcement. Also the fact that the game, despite appearing in our Steam inventories, somehow does not boast the ability to place a ♥♥♥♥ing single item in our Steam showcase (for a game that relies heavily on cosmetics, this is unacceptable).But I'm going to give you the most unbiased, quickest review I can give this game. I can absolutely see why people don't enjoy it, but the idea of a top-down ""Zelda"" (although it would help to have more puzzles and hazards) MMO is so appealing to me, I can't resist. The crafting system is fair and allows for a lot of replay value in the fact that you are pretty much never done ""needing"" equipment (or costumes, for pea♥♥♥♥♥). Not sure how I feel about the fact that an alternate currency, ""crystal energy,"" can be bought for such a significant amount of crowns and a low amount of cash. I love having a guild, decorating it, and inviting users to enjoy the game alongside us- even though the guild feature is seriously lacking in some departments and the people at Three Rings need to take a ♥♥♥♥ing clue but I'm willing to forego this for the sake of bringing you what you need to know. The game updates once a month (sometimes twice), and these are actually pretty significant updates by the way (they tend to bring back ""events"" here and there for the users to enjoy). The music is alright, not a huge hangup of mine. Gameplay might seem redundant to some people, but there are lots of ways to keep it fresh (I recommend playing with your friends or randoms at all times in order to do this), but a little detour by yourself doesn't hurt.I haven't dabbled in the arena or anything like that very much it all (it really doesn't interest me at the moment). From what I can tell, a lot of the lategame is spent doing old missions or playing the arcade mode in order to secure crowns and crafting ""orbs"" which appear randomly in the dungeon chests- and allow you to upgrade your equipment. If you're going to play this game, you need to look at the wiki at some point and decide your armor early. Despite the fact that the game draws a lot of attention to the wiki, I believe there should be some kind of projection ingame that tells you what you need to expect pursuing each armor path (but the hall of heroes does help (they don't neglect this idea as much as I spin my yarn)).I see a lot of enjoyment in this game and I believe there is a lot of potential as well. If you're on my friend's list or see me booting it up at any point, I encourage you to do the same. Three Rings manages to still pay attention to their fans- despite what you may think for a game of this background-prestige, and, from what I've seen, create polls to decide on what changes should be made in the longterm. A big reason I play this game is because of the aesthetic of it- it's a very cute game. Reminds me of circa 80s RPGs like Final Fantasy or Dragon Quest in the fact that you play as tiny armored creatures of some kind. Give the game a chance, though. If you see this, hit me up: my username is Pode (same as here), and I'm the guild master of ""The Trojan Express.""			",99,19,1,10,4,2,10

												This game is a good starting position to new PC gamers or someone who's looking to get into RTS games (Real Time Strategy).It is fairly fun if you don't play much RTS but it gets old quickly and well if you are 15 or over then this game is probably not to your taste, it is how I put it a ""kiddy game"" and you would be better off starting at league of legends.I give this game a thumbs down and would rate 2 stars.If you would like to see a video on it please click the link

												20/05/2012 C.E.This is a game for all people. Its main aim is teamwork, as you can do anything alone in this game, but it would take MUCH longer. For example, doing a level by yourself would take 30minutes, but with others helping, it would take 10 minutes instead. I really recommend this game, except for the part where elevators charge you to use them.20/07/2014 C.E.This game now sucks. Ever since the main developer (Nick) left, the events have all been recycled constantly. With no new ideas, the game is stagnating faster than ever before. The only new updates are purely cosmetic modifications. (Quite less recently, a new system was introduced to make heating gear a little more complicated, but it was still mostly straightforward, until 5* crystals were made impossible to farm, forcing players to rely on energy more and more.)Also, OOO refuses to port to Steam for Linux, cutting off many of its own players. The game's suckiness has reached an all-time low.			",125,28,3,12,10,1,17

												This is a great game for anyone who's never played it before. It's casual so everyone can enjoy it, but offers a sense of progression. It's an absolute blast if you have friends to play with. If you like the idea of a 4-player Legend of Zelda, give this game a shot. It's truly free-to-play now, and you don't need to spend money to progress. PvP can be insanely fun but does require a big time investment. The game mechanics are very simple but offer a lot of room for skill growth (reactions, etc.)That said, I've played this game since it came out on beta in early 2010 and there have been zero progression updates to the game ever since SEGA acquired them in late 2011. The same final boss that appeared in 2010 is still the same final boss in 2014. The ""final gate"" that was locked to players in 2010 is still locked. The ""hardcore"" content is simply recycled dungeons and locked behind a bad paywall, but luckily you never have to touch it. The game has basically devolved into a cycle of minor updates with no progression content, and a bunch of cosmetic items. Hats. And more hats.The fact that it's coded in Java is also a huge problem, as there are some fundamental issues with the code that make the game poorly optimized. The biggest problem is Java having to dump its memory every time it reaches the memory cap, causing the game to occasionally stutter as Java does this, even on beast computers. See these threads: 1. http://forums.spiralknights.com/en/node/128492. http://forums.spiralknights.com/en/node/2188I recommend this game especially if you have friends to play with. It'll offer a solid hundred hours of enjoyable, challenging fun. But if/when you get to the end, don't expect them to add any more progression content... because they won't, and haven't since 2010.

Swords, Guns, and Bombs are still there.ENERGY (the premium currency used for real-life cash transaction that can be bought with in-game currency as well) is still usable to buy stuff in the Cash Shop place via the 'Supply Depot'. It's mostly for convenience (Ex: to craft your gear faster with ALCHEMY STONES [in the old game, it requires ENERGY to craft items]. You can normally find ALCHEMY STONES in dungeons).In addition, they added pets that fight alongside with you, each having their own skills and leveling up mechanics. The way you level up gear has changed. It is both a gift and a curse. You can individually level up an item however you like, but when it reaches it's MAX exp required to level up, you need to get FORGE STONES to level up. You can either find them normally in dungeons (OR CASH SHOP! See a pattern there?). There is DLC that costs 5.95 called the Crimson Hammer to get more exclusive items just for that DLC, and there are these 'cosmetic grab bags' they charge for 2k energy or so (equivalent to 10~15 dollars give or take).They even went as far as to give this game a story and a mission system. Previously, gear was dependant on how much you've equipped. But if you're an old character with Tier 3 equipment already (5-star stuff), then you're omittted from these restrictions. New characters, however, will have to go through the MISSIONS in order to have clearance on equipping higher level gear.There's even PVP modes as well between deathmatch and territory points.This is at least how Spiral Knights should of been to maintain a high crowd status quo. The game is still great in terms of gameplay if you're into a Zelda-esque style. I really recommend this game now that the business model is fair.For weapons, Bombs are the most time investing items to level up, as they show their usefulness by 4* star and it takes 5* to really bring out their generous AOE potential. Guns and Swords are useable at any time, and their specialties grow stronger. Leveling pets? Very time consuming. Their potential does not show until spending 40+ hours leveling them up.I give it a hard recommendation if you enjoy dungeon crawling Zelda style, and aren't turned off on the video that you see.

												Don't be fooled. This game might have a cute and coloful look but what makes it a true gem is that it requires skill to master and plenty to keep the challange going while the COOP aspect adds infinite replayability. This is a true action game with one of the best combat systems I've come across. It feels balanced with enough variety to keep it interesting and engaging, but with enough simplicity to keep it from being unnecessarly bloated like many other games with weapon/armor upgrades end up feeling. Every enemy is fought differently and certain weapons work best against them. With all the different specialization routes like buffing up on armor, gunning, bombing, slow swords, fast swords, knockback techniques, precise shielding and dozens of different enemies on screen, it is truly rewarding to master.Although this game can be played exclusivly solo, the thing that really makes this game never-ending is the COOP. Technically it is a MMO but parties are limited to 4 players that must work together with different strategies to complete levels. Like any other game, it does have shortcomings, most notably the steep learning curve pertaning to making and using the variety of gear that is available, However, if you enjoy challanging action games with plenty of upgrading and COOP, you should absolutely must give this a try.

												20/05/2012 C.E.This is a game for all people. Its main aim is teamwork, as you can do anything alone in this game, but it would take MUCH longer. For example, doing a level by yourself would take 30minutes, but with others helping, it would take 10 minutes instead. I really recommend this game, except for the part where elevators charge you to use them.20/07/2014 C.E.This game now sucks. Ever since the main developer (Nick) left, the events have all been recycled constantly. With no new ideas, the game is stagnating faster than ever before. The only new updates are purely cosmetic modifications. (Quite less recently, a new system was introduced to make heating gear a little more complicated, but it was still mostly straightforward, until 5* crystals were made impossible to farm, forcing players to rely on energy more and more.)Also, OOO refuses to port to Steam for Linux, cutting off many of its own players. The game's suckiness has reached an all-time low.			",125,28,3,12,10,1,17

												[Re-Review] Okay, the big thing they changed here is that ELEVATORS, and CRAFTING items no longer require ENERGY. That's a WHOLE lot better. It made the game truly free to play. However, they changed their business model under the hood, and the way items level up in order to get people to 'push' on rushing their upgrades with their real-life wallet. They truly went F2P (80%-ish, I'd say).

												I won't write a super long and informative review, so let's boil it down.Spiral Knights turned a new leaf a year or two ago and it wasn't so much a moneysink, as of now you don't have mist energy, lifts are free, and crafting costs aren't ♥♥♥♥ing insane like they used to be. Everything is cute, so in contrast to other hack-n-slash games this is great if you're a squeamish person. I, personally am not and I prefer to have my enemies twitching with blood gushing out is a reward by itself. Combat is a bit slow, but incredibly fun, especially with a party because the game attempts to swarm you with enemies, and it's cool to personally smack each and every one of them with your sword, bomb or gun.The thing that got on my nerves the most in this game are overspecialization of weapons. Each enemy does different types of damage, Elemental, Piercing, and shadow, and you can find yourself screwed if you show up to a level full of shadow damage dealing enemies with elemental Armour, and you're much more vulnerable. The weapon damage system is similar, enemies can either be very good at resisting a damage type or very weak to it; making weapons tremendously more situational and will cause you to grind more just so you can be the jack of all trades. The game as it is now has basically turned into Team Fortess 2 in the dress-up aspect except the game's content and enjoyment comes to a stop in a certain point because the development team doesn't feel like making actual new content and resorts to making Spiral Knights endgame a big dress up.A good multiplayer hack-n-slash that's being held back by major flaws.

												Spiral Knights is an AMAZING game. I've played it and I have made so many good friends. After playing it for a few years, I have found my virtual family. :) Go ahead and give Spiral Knights a try! ~KzaneEdit: So as I have said before, Spiral Knights is an amazing game. However, the game is pretty much done now. I find it really sad that such an amazing game is going to waste. After Nick, one of the main developers, left two years ago. That's pretty much where the game went down hill.Every where you go now, it's almost empty. And as I have said before ""I've made so many friends."" I can no longer even talk to them since they quit the game. Each and every day, I would be excited to wake up, excited to log on and hang out with my friends I've made on here. Now, it's just me and one or two friends online (that are in the same guild that is).I hate to see the game that I've spent so many hours... So many years on just die.(Sorry if I didn't make sense up there. I kinda jumped around. ._.)But, I will still continue to play it...			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The game looks fancy.

												In short, if you liked Alien Swarm, you'll definitely like this. It has more focus on melee weapon combat than guns, though. At least, melee weapons tend to be more effective at killing.It's quite fun; all free, except you can only play 1.5-2 hours per a day for free (not including mist tank gifts). Well, 1.5-2 hours of being in a dungeon fighting monsters. You can be in the game buying/selling/chatting as much as you want.You can get over the time limit by going through dungeons and getting crowns (the ingame currency) and trading them for energy (which lets you go into dungeons to get more crowns).Anyway, you should at least try it!

It's free, but you will have to pay money for fast updgrades OR spend a lot of time to farm crowns and fire crystals.5 star certification is the REAL PAIN.Some advices:1) Always play on ""Elite"" difficulty2) Do not use and grade ""sock"" weapons and armor - calibur, blaster, shield, helms, etc - use bonus damage and stat stuff instead.3) If you miss some material for crafting - always check auction house first, sometimes you can find what you need there for cheap price instead of farming arcade gates4) Always farm in solo - monsters will be weak and you will get desired minerals for your spriteHope it will help you.Thanks			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												My friend introduced me to this game during December of 2012 while we were over at a birthday party and I was immediately hooked. There was 5 of us present and we all played this game for hours without pause. However, that was four years ago. Right now, I don't really play this game as much as I did before mainly because I've pretty much exhausted this game, however it's still a great game to play with friends just because of how fun it is. It kept me entertained for about 2 years and that is pretty impressive.(yes I did spend money on this game, mainly for cosmetics)			",43,4,0,0,4,0,3

												The prices aren't bad starting off but eventually they become absurd and pretty much ruin it for anyone unwilling to give in to the whole pay to win aspect of the game. The gameplay isn't bad though and the wide array of available weapons improves things. Unfortunately, I can't reccomend this game due to the previously mentioned problem, the prices. They destroy the game's leveling system. Good luck getting any tier 3-4 items in a reasonable amount of time.			",37,2,0,4,1,0,0

												To this day, Spiral Knights remains one of my favourite ""go-to"" casual play games in terms of adventure-style games. I think it's time I re-reviewed it.Gameplay at it's coreThe core aspect of any game. The gameplay type involved is a dungeon crawler, top-down view, adventure-style game. Think Legend of Zelda, in a mix of Four Swords coupled with Phantasy Star (Albeit very loosely)It has an interesting perspective, being not overly puzzling, but challenging at places and very atmospheric when it wants to be. Every battle tends to feel slightly different from your last one in some aspect.Unfortunately, there's one flaw with all this; The game's optimization is rather subpar. As a result, lag spikes do tend to occur at a semifrequent basis. It's unfortunate, considering the game is quite stellar otherwise.Gameplay-wise, the score is a 8/10.Artistic designThis game has a rather unique art style. It doesn't seem to stick to one general area, rather being more spaced out in several different directions at once.The players themselves, the Knights, are a good example of this. You begin as a knight who can look serious or cheerful, in a dark or vivid colour, that's either blacklight or neon, accented by vibrant pastel colours or murky, metallic styles. They look like those little figurines you can get, and can come in either plush, clay, or metal materials.The Clockworks themselves do a nice little background job, themselves. Each level seems sculpted to fit the design of the level and the family that lives within them. One family, known as Fiends, lives in an office-type scenario, with glyphs sometimes strewn about. Lighting wherever appropriate.9.5/10 with this one, only because on rare occasions, you get odd-looking pieces that don't seem to belong.Music CompositionWhoever came up with the music scores did an excellent job setting the mood for the area players are in. This is most noticible in boss levels, and tends to come to one of the most engaging boss themes I've ever heard. And this game's been released for quite a few years now.10/10 because I really don't see - well hear - any flaws with this one.Start to finish Gameplay ExperienceUnlike the core gameplay experience, this is how it can be, from start to finish, at a reasonable experience.Unfortunately, this is the only category where I feel it tanks at. It's nice and smooth at the start, as you typically get everything you need easily enough and can progress. When you hit about Knight or Defender level, however, that's when you start to see the reason as to why the game isn't as popular as it was or could have been.The main issue is the energy costs associated with acquiring the gear you need to progress. When I first began playing (This was one of my first Steam games), the energy system was Mist and Crystal energy. It took 10 energy to go down a floor. This is where my gears started to grind just a tad. That basically meant that, unless you had a bottomless wallet, you couldn't really play...unless you had an elevator pass.However, while the new system is better, it's not by much. Yes, there's no more elevator costs, at all, but there's now Orbs of Alchemy, which is the main reason why people stopped playing.I say it's better, however, because of how easy it can be to simply get a bunch of energy, especially now. You need 3 orbs of alchemy of a certain type to progress in the game. The one minor thing with that is the people don't seem to realize it's the same costs as before, it just takes an extra step, sometimes mitigated entirely if your luck is good enough to get all 3 orbs of alchemy while you get the 200 or so Energy you need for your weapons.Further, you need only ONE of your weapons at the star requirement (In the example above, 3 stars) to proceed, not the other one, two, or three. Overall, to get all 5-star gear, you either need to get very lucky, or cough up 3200 energy for 12 Eternal Orbs of Alchemy. Which, thanks to the drop system, is very unlikely you'll need to cough up all 3200, if even half that. Besides, some of the orbs appear as mission rewards.That being said, it's still a grind, thanks to the heat system rework and needed Fire Crystals to get the weapons up to the levels needed to progress. That's where I say not by much in terms of how better it is, but it's still not as bad as people think. One word of warning: Go full-out or you may find yourself experiencing Final Fantasy Luck Syndrome.6.75/10. As a side note, you can get 100 energy for a set number of crowns, which you'll likely get in 1 or 2 runs of the number of floors, anyway. It's honestly easier to get crowns than you might think.Overall EnjoymentIt's a real shame this game gets the hate it doesn't deserve. In fact, I think it's fair to say this is an underrated gem. Of course, every game has it's flaws, and I pointed out perhaps some of the major ones, the two big ones being optimization and the grind to get to Vangaurd rank.However, this game has some very fun moments, and at no point do you feel underwhelmed when someone brings in their 5-star gear to your party of 2-star equipment. That's the beauty of it; the game is balanced so no one weapon tends to feel super-souped up over the other, rather just gets the job done a tad faster.The only other complaint I have is that missions tend to be slow for release. But if that just means they have tweaks to them, or want to make sure everything runs smooth (See the Gunner Update), then I don't care how long I have to wait, personally.Overall score: 8/10. A definite recommendation of mine. This might not be for everyone, of course, but if you like what you see, download it and give it a go. The grind isn't as bad as everyone makes it out to be, though it is intimidating at first, and when it runs, it's mostly smooth sailing from start to finish.			",126,17,2,25,7,1,11

												It's free to play, but that doesn't automatically makes it a bad game. Instead, it's actually a pretty enjoyable game RPG style with a kind of dungeon crawler gameplay, with awesome soundtracks from the good old SEGA and neaty graphics.Why am i not recommending it then?Simply this game has been left in its state for years. Yes, there are some ""events"" for various holidays, with the same contents repeated every year, and always, ALWAYS new costumes/accessories/cosmetic armors, which are actually the only things being updated in the game. Stuff that must be bought with real money (like every free to play has to live with) that don't really give the game that replayability or wish to continue on in the game, because, we can also say, that there's also a cool simple story behind the game itself, but its simply half-done and the last gameplay-wise update has been done 3 years ago as a paid DLC.Now i don't want to blame the fact that, if you want more dungeons, you'll have to pay a classic DLC to unlock it, but after that you have the story of the game still left at half, because the game itself has not been updated nowadays, and you have basically wasted money by buying a piece of puzzle to your puzzle set that is missing many more pieces.Technically there are still some issues and bugs related to the internet of the player, since you need a stable connection to play and possibly decent one, even if you want to play by yourself in a kind of ""singleplayer"".Same goes for little graphical glitches, but i'd be surprised if there weren't any.Of course there is also like almost any free to play game something you can have to help you in the game, if you spend real money on it. Or at least you can buy stronger gear and weapons needed to progress in the game with cash, instead of in-game currency. Or some services to further improve them.Overall this was a pretty good game, but i personally feel this game is slowly dying as it seems the developers have left the game in its state, just adding some cosmetics to milk some more cash whenever it's possible.It had such potentials, wasted in lots of microtransactions.

												This is one of my first and the best MMO I've ever played. You start out as a knight who just crash-landed onto a mysterious planet called Cradle. On the quest to return home, you delve into the unknown depths of Cradle, meet new friends, fight against darkness. Sometimes,  a jerk scams you, that hammer spam crushes you, the frustrations of others discourage you. But don't give up just yet. My friends and I came accross each other as strangers, in the end we become family. One day, you'll realize that home is not that far away, home is where the heart is.This game is truly a F2P game. So don't hesitate to give it a try. Sometimes you'll hear about a place called Lockdown, just stay away from that place till you're ready (to hear people whine, brag, flame, etc.) Let the spirit of adventure guide you to the very end.

												I thought this game would be fun for my husband and I to play together.  Turns out, to play together you must be guild-mates.  To create a guild, you have to have crowns and energy.  The ONLY way to get energy?  Buy it with real money.Energy will also buy you items to make your in-game weapons and armor better.  I hate pay to win games!{ I added this next paragraph a month or so later.}The Spiral Knights developers told us it may have been a glitch that day but we haven't tried again because we're playing the hell out of AirMech and Alien Swarm.

												This game is for the hardcore player and it rivals Darksouls in it's difficulty.The good:Once getting the hang of the fast paced combat and learning the moves of the special infected this team based survival game really starts to pull you in and can provide hours of fun. In the multiplayer mode you can play as the special infected against other human players, this really lengthens the game.If you enjoy pay to win games, I strongly recommend having a try at this game.The bad:Though when getting hit you lose all your rings and have to re-collect them as apposed to a proper health system.

												This game is for the hardcore player and it rivals Darksouls in it's difficulty.The good:Once getting the hang of the fast paced combat and learning the moves of the special infected this team based survival game really starts to pull you in and can provide hours of fun. In the multiplayer mode you can play as the special infected against other human players, this really lengthens the game.If you enjoy pay to win games, I strongly recommend having a try at this game.The bad:Though when getting hit you lose all your rings and have to re-collect them as apposed to a proper health system.

												The game was great a few years back it really felt like a zelda link to the past dungeon like game, then it turned into PVP bomberman series and the energy limit cash grab made it so you can only play it a few hours a day, after all these updates the game has expanded but died off and made the game worse.

												started playing sometime after beta. it was pretty fun with friend , although some of the massive grindwall is not that forgiving unless you are prepared to spend some cash for what they call crystal energies. but theres a new update that pretty much removes the energy system, but still leaving the crystal energies as some sort of currency. the new crafting system is ridiculous, extremely disgusting giant paywall. sure they make it so you can go to dungeons for free (it used to cost energy too) but now this game is a huge time waster with little pay off. it was still forgivable back then since i understand this game is free 2 play, but forcing such a shady business practice just puts people off. a lot of my clan mates and friends retire pretty much around after they put up the new system. happy at first until we found out that leveling just 1 weapon will take ridiculous amounts of time because of the ""heat system"" that they also changed.graphics are cute and great. story is meh but its a free2play game so story is not what you are looking for, although its quite interesting to see some of the lore i this game, but theres not much as of the last time i played this game.combat is pretty much a top view hack n slash, reminds you of zelda which what got me in this game in the first place.there are lots of weapons in the game and they all look pretty cool, but utillity wise they are all pretty much not that good until you get them to max rank. music is surprisingly good but i only like a handful of them. they tend to reuse the same track for multiple maps.this game is actually pretty decent if only they didnt go too far with the pay-wall.as of now the system is gigantic waste of time unless you dish out some cash. wouldnt recommend this right now			",121,21,0,14,7,0,13

												This is your basic Pay to Win crap.  I couldn't even play a mission with my wife because I didn't want to spend money on anything yet.  Which means yes, if you're planning on downloading this to play with a friend, you need to spend real money to be able to do so.  Or you could grind for 7,800 'crowns' just to trade for 100 'energy'.  Energy is the bane of this game's existence.  If you haven't figured out yet, energy is what you buy with real life money. The game mechanics themselves are fun, but the Pay 2 Win (in this case, pay to even play with a friend) aspect really killed the game for me.Grade: D This game had much potential, but the P2W aspect ruins it.  Not to mention the trolls and spammers.  One person was walking around just begging my friend and I to trade and spamming requests...I traded once with him, my friend didn't...but this guy didn't relent.  He just kept on trollin': running around us, spamming chat and trade requests.  This and one other person were in the Arcade.

												Spiral Knights is a highly unique action based MMORPG unlike any other. It draws heavily from the top down Zeldas but throws a lot of other things into the mix, such as Bomberman. With a good progression system, lots of unique weapons, interesting pets, and simple systems, it's a plain great game. Sadly, there's little balance to be found in the game and the developers aren't quite in touch with the community. The community is pretty friggin' great, however. The devs wouild gain a lot from listening a bit more to it.The game used to be much more pay to play but since half a year ago (summer 2013), it's truly free to play. The great majority of pay to play content comes in the form of promotions that cost Energy. Energy can be bought for real life money or the in game currency, ""crowns"". Thus, there's no real life money barrier between any player and pay to play content, which mostly consists of purely cosmetic items directed to end game players.Another thing I truly like about this game is the art style. The characters are space marine knights with colourful armours and really cool weapons. There's also no sex-appeal involved. Characters don't even have anything that tells you whether they are men or women and that is probably one of the things that contribute to a community with so very little sexism.Spiral Knights is truly a beautiful piece of art so stop reading this review and go play it.

												Fun?  Yes.Grindy?  Yes.Better with friends?  Yeah.Spiral Knights is a MMORPG which came out of the gate rocky, being like most korean mmo's where it was more 'pay to win'Thankfully they fixed that.  So the game is pritty fun but it gets repeditive even with the shifting floors, and it never felt like it made and impact.But i do indeed love the pet system.  It was fun to have a little battle pet fighting alongside you as you delved down with others to fight hoards of monsters ready to eat you.Hey, its free to play, give it a shot, cant say its a bad game just grindy and kind of repeditive.(Also, the skins and box deals are kind of BS)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I do not play MMORPGs, so it's special when I say I play Spiral Knights. It's kept extremely simple, which makes it a great casual game that I can pick up and drop off without intense involvement. This is a good pizza-and-mouse game, meaning you can play one-handed due to the simplicity of the controls. It's a nice, calm, relaxing game, with stretches of tension and frustration. It's FtP, so there's limits on how much you can do in a 24 hour span, which kind of helps keeps me from seeing the limitations of the campaign missions. The skirmish missions are always different, but to clear a campaign, you must fight the same enemies on the same map. It has a difficulty spike in some areas. I love the visual design, and the music is an awesome combination of eight-bit and chill. Some of the collecting and trading aspects are difficult, as it isn't always easy to find someone who will buy what you want, even though it is extremely easy to buy items from others at the sub-ten tiers.  8.5/10.

												This game is good at first but when you get near the end it gets very repetitive and boring. The absoulte worst part is the fire crystals. Fire crystals are used to level up your gear but at higher levels it requires so many and the best ones are rare so it takes forever to get enough. Oh, and if you fail the gear level up process the crystals are lost forever and you just wasted them. I just cannot recommend the game like this.P.S.

												I've heard everything regarding what this game is just like, from Diablo to Crystal Chronicles to Four Swords Adventures and more (okay, I can't vouch the Diablo one is true). However, as repetitive as it can be, the game certainly knows how to keep things fresh, and for being less than a year old it's got plenty to enjoy before new stuff comes in. And voice chat makes EVERYTHING better.			",216,41,2,32,13,2,15

												While the artstyle of the game is rather appealing to me - a refresing sight in a sea of dominance of uniform grey... everything, in videogames - the game suffers on many, many other fronts.Gameplay is simplictic, progression based on your gear only ( no skills, or skill trees just gear split into tiers ) - nothing special or really interesting.Music quickly gets very repetitive and so widely advertised ""changing enviroments/levels"" are pretty much a lie - there are few presets into rotation, you can learn the maps, very, very quickly.Features like upgrading your gear are made into an irritating grind, with no real point to it.Game can provide some entertainment, but you really have to really get into it to stay for long.If you do - brace yourselves, the lag is coming.Lag issues make this game unplayable at best, turning it into irritating tale of walking into a wall because OOO are quite obviously cheaping out on the servers.If that doesn't show that this game is slowly dying, then I do not know what will.

												If you live in a country far away from where the servers are located, this game would be perfect for testing your patience and anger management.* Think you dodged a rocket?

Let me use the first weapon for you!* Ran over retracted spiked floor? Nope, let me take some life off you for good measure* Finished your 2 strike combo attack? Let me repeat that last swing for you so you can get hit during the animation while not doing any damage to the monsters!* Have a personal ADSL2+ connection that averages 11.5Mbps and have thrown money at the game? Thanks, we will gladly take your money, here have some extra lag.But that is ok because if you die, you can use spark items to revive. Ran out of life sparks? Sure, no problem!

												If you are looking for a fun to play game with cute characters and such, this is the game for you. This game focuses a lot on the co-operative play together with online users to clear dungeons and levels. It seems to be a very good place sociallise to other players but the other players barely speak much.You start off as playing for free and the adventure of you advancing through the multiple randomly generated levels of the underground to train and get materials and coins. The game has a very apealing toony style, from the infrastructures to monsters to the characters you are using. It all seems fine and dandy as you were expecting to reach high levels and be stronger than ever, until there is a level wall. This is the moment when you will realise that this game is sort of like a ""pay to level up more"" game, and not totally free if you are to complete your quest for the ultimate levels. In conclusion if you are looking for a game that you can team up with online players and fight along side with them with the cutesy environment and characters, then this is the game for you, but be prepared to spend a little cash to advance your levels as the game progresses.For me, I personally do not recommend this game since I first thought it was a full free to play and complete game. It shocked me that I would have to pay to continue levelling up, that totally killed the mood. Although it is a money making strategy through online games, it would have been better that they do not ambush players with that strategy and told them about it from the start.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The ADV orbs? yeah They go for 6,000 $ in the game and you get 500 - 1,000 $ for one map, and each map/level takes 10 - 25 min on av. so maybe the NPC should sell them. Just a tip			",29,4,0,4,2,0,2

												I decided to review this game because I played extensivly and I have a feeling I can write a review based on my knowledge. Anyways this is my first review so if I make some sort of mistake let it slide.So this game is Spiral Knights, a MMORPG that has a kinda in depth story, the story goes as follows apparently you are in a ship it's attacked, its about to blow up and you and all of your shipmates land on the Clockworks where monsters and creatures live in some hostile but some friendly. Spiral Knights also has a rank system which grants you the ability to make and weild/use better equipment. They are 10 ranks each with their own quests. But a big turn-down though is that sometimes there is a Hall of Heroes quest which requires you to have _ * Equipment...All of it. This leads to grinding for materials and Orbs of Alchemy, different types. Sometimes you can get stuck in this game because of this so the only choice you got is to save up those orbs. you are gonna need at least 15 orbs of whatever type to make the armor alongside other materials. However you eventually get this creature called a Battle Sprite which can help you fight but it wont attack by itself with default attacks, in fact it doesn't have a default attack which means you are responsible for any losses you have which can be a pain if you suck. Luckily it is pretty fun in general. Leveling up your Battle Sprite so it's stronger, getting new armor, weapons and sheilds, doing a quest for the first time, finding rare items. But it all boils down to do you like MMORPG's in general. My ending note is this, Spiral Knights can be fun (and in some casses addicting) but it is much more fun with friends and when you are part of a guild. Either way making Armor and weapons aren't that fun and grinding can really be annoying but the amount of fun I have in each quest backs it up, if anything I think the best part for me is my Battle Sprite... Since this doesn't really have a rating system (Kinda but not really) I would give it a rating of 7/10. Its fun if you like RPGs and Doing quests and MMOs so. If you like these things I reccomend it, it is free so go for it if you wanna.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

NOTHING. Keep that in mind. Keep your pockets deep.I don't truly recommend the game, but I have fun with it. Great soundtrack, mildy addictive.Do play.			",160,6,2,12,2,0,0

												While the game is old, with updates over the past year the game has become much more free-to-play friendly than it use to be. Elevators are now free and there is no longer a Mist bar, meaning endless dungeon crawling for everyone. Leveling weapons is different, now requiring a specific item depending on the * of weapon. While hard to find at times, it is still possible to find the required item in Prize Boxes in through the dungeon. The newer updates the game have put the focus back on exploration and spending time in the Clockworks and learning the game at your own pace, not buying everything with real world money and just spending time in pvp. I have sunk easily 1000+ hours over the course of my time playing Spiral Knights and it will always be one of my most favorite games ever because of all of the memories I have made through the 3 years I have been playing.

												Spiral Knights is a great game. Great story mode and I adore the graphics. Not many games have 3D cartoon-ish graphics to them, but there is one problem. . . Spiral Knights is dying and I don't want this game to die. My cousins told me that once you finish the story mode there is nothing else to do. So what I suggest is that you should expand the story mode and add new items. Back in  2012 Spiral Knights was popular, but now the population has decreased to 500-300 players. I'm begging the developers to please expand the story mode. Make an update that adds an more to the story mode. I really want to experience that feeling again when my cousins would call over Skype and we'd all play Spiral Knights, but because we finished the story there was no point in playing Spiral Knights anymore. Please expand the story mode and maybe add new items to the game. It's a big thing that I'm asking for, but there are many games out there that expand their story and keeping it fresh. The community is dying and I don't want this game to die yet. Please expand the story and add new items to the game. Keep things fresh and new.			",34,0,0,2,1,0,0

												Spiral knights is (for me) a very enjoyable game. Before you dive into it though, I must warn you it might be addicting for some. The game has graphics which make the game look cute but amazing at the same time, and the soundtrack always fits prefectly with it. Some people might argue there might be no point in playing once you get full 5* gear and all the stuff. Lately (about a month ago) I found that was wrong. That is because you can always RP or invent games within the game, like what the arsenal podcast did. I think this is an amzing game, but be wary to not get addicted to playing it. So I recommend this game, but not too much so you won't get addicted.			",8,2,0,2,2,0,0

												Personally, I can't say much of this game. I quit the game almost early, because there was a broad storyline I could almost not follow, and the layout of the screen almost confused me at times. When I did understand what I was supposed to do, and (rarely) why, I would enjoy the heck out of myself. The graphics are still amazing for the game, but for myself ( who doesn't like when my UI is cramped) the game got boring quick. It quickly reminded me of my first days of WoW, and how I quit after a week of trying to get used to the cramped screen. Would not reccomend for anyone who is not used to the RPG feel of a cramped screen, but if you like a cramped screen, but would enjoy a more smooth and sci-fi graphical scene, this game is for you.

This game is basicly a child-friendly dungeon crawler that is easy in the beginning but once you get to the arcade things get real! One of my friends and I almost BOTH died on the arcade levels. Also this game has potential in my eyes. So in conclusion I give this game a 6/10.			",32,7,0,3,2,1,1

												I'd thought the game was a bit sleazy in its restrictions through the use of Energy back before it was acquired by Sega.Now I long for the day to have the game returned to a point when it was still worth playing! As a grandfathered in player, I was what seems to amount to the new concept of ""Rank 5"" or so, though I'm now forced to do unchallenging missions to collect the materials necessary to level up my equipment -- which I can no longer do after they turned the ""Heat"" mechanic from an XP track for gear into a 60% chance of outright failure to level-up with a rare item cost.After some 20 missions blitzed through last night, I still don't have the special ""rarity"" items to level-up my equipment, which has been stuck at whatever level they were at back when I'd left the game before.I could buy them off the auction house, sure, but now that the entire game has been unhinged, new equipment is either unsable (my rank is too low, where before there was no such limitation that I can recall), impossible to find (as there's no real benefit to selling what you can obtain by simply grinding for the mission handouts), or impossible to afford (as with 15,000 C, I can barely afford the 2-star gear I already own).If that wasn't bad enough, nigh everything can be obtained with Energy -- the magical, in-game currency you can buy with real money.  The game will even blithely remind you as you peruse your available missions.  Want a 5th copy of this silly shovel weapon?  It's yours for the low, low price of 60 Energy!It's the most transparent attempt by Sega to exploit the playerbase of a once-passable and admittedly clever Sci-Fi BMUP dungeon-crawling RPG to milk as much money as possible.I cannot in good faith recommend a game like this.  This isn't even the ""freemium"" the old game used to be; it's just downright disgusting.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

It is unfortunate, because this game was fun, until about 3/4 of the way though, then it turns to a sopping mess of♥♥♥♥♥♥ desperatly trying to re-collect itself in the form of a solid, playable game. But it ultimatly fails. Very sad when a game that has so much potential is wasted on a♥♥♥♥♥♥Dev team and a really ♥♥♥♥♥♥ game engine.I would not recommend this game to anyone looking for a deep investment, like one would actually want out of an MMO. However, the game is free, so give it a shot. Maybe you'll find a way to enjoy it.			",83,5,1,8,5,0,4

												This is game now just a conveiluded mess. At one time I would rememend it but as it stands now I can't in all good fith recommend this game. The damn thing used to be simple but then they added accessories the game had begun to lean towards the way of ingame currency being worth something since it the igc could buy Crystal energy something of a premium. The devs boned their own economy to the point where getting ce would just be a waste, and added a conveiluded upgrading system. They messed with the gamepad controlls to be unplayable I used to just setup an external game pad to handle the game and the new ""pets"" keybindings are so fkin out of place. Tbh I wanted this game to be good this game should have 2 yrs worth of content but no this game has been ransacked by damn accessories, prize boxes and god damn cosmetic outfits. Plus the bloody game is based around farming vana for friggin CR. From what I hear their adding new guns to the game, content which was delayed by two months odds are this content will be delayed untill summer of 2014 because of the devs have a way of doing that. Hell just ask around how long it took them to add pets.			",73,11,0,13,2,0,1

												While the artstyle of the game is rather appealing to me - a refresing sight in a sea of dominance of uniform grey... everything, in videogames - the game suffers on many, many other fronts.Gameplay is simplictic, progression based on your gear only ( no skills, or skill trees just gear split into tiers ) - nothing special or really interesting.Music quickly gets very repetitive and so widely advertised ""changing enviroments/levels"" are pretty much a lie - there are few presets into rotation, you can learn the maps, very, very quickly.Features like upgrading your gear are made into an irritating grind, with no real point to it.Game can provide some entertainment, but you really have to really get into it to stay for long.If you do - brace yourselves, the lag is coming.Lag issues make this game unplayable at best, turning it into irritating tale of walking into a wall because OOO are quite obviously cheaping out on the servers.If that doesn't show that this game is slowly dying, then I do not know what will.

												If you are looking for a fun to play game with cute characters and such, this is the game for you. This game focuses a lot on the co-operative play together with online users to clear dungeons and levels. It seems to be a very good place sociallise to other players but the other players barely speak much.You start off as playing for free and the adventure of you advancing through the multiple randomly generated levels of the underground to train and get materials and coins. The game has a very apealing toony style, from the infrastructures to monsters to the characters you are using. It all seems fine and dandy as you were expecting to reach high levels and be stronger than ever, until there is a level wall. This is the moment when you will realise that this game is sort of like a ""pay to level up more"" game, and not totally free if you are to complete your quest for the ultimate levels. In conclusion if you are looking for a game that you can team up with online players and fight along side with them with the cutesy environment and characters, then this is the game for you, but be prepared to spend a little cash to advance your levels as the game progresses.For me, I personally do not recommend this game since I first thought it was a full free to play and complete game. It shocked me that I would have to pay to continue levelling up, that totally killed the mood. Although it is a money making strategy through online games, it would have been better that they do not ambush players with that strategy and told them about it from the start.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is too much of a grindhouse in order to progress. Sure such grind can be rewarding in the end but for this game it isn't. I understand that they need an income seeing it is a free to play game afterall but making some items needed to craft better weapons and armors very rare when you can buy it all when convert your real cash into ingame currency (energy)? While you can buy energy with your ingame money but the ratio conversion is too high. What's more is that the ingame cash can be used for many things like extra loots, challange etc which normally you cannot access to without having energy.Unless you're in a guild or with good friend to co op with, this game is lonely and a struggle.

												This was a good game.As most other reviews mention, yes, this used to be a fun game.Now? It's plain bad. VERY bad. Think as bad as Runescape and you aren't far.(On a side note, are all MMO games programmed in Java cursed to be bad?)Sure, you may be thinking ""This is an angry rant, not a review"". Well, let's see...In the past, there was a thing called Mist Energy (Mist = Free, Crystal = In-Game or Real Money), up to a max of 100 at a time. If you don't play the game and didn't come across the concept in the reviews, Energy is used for the main aspects in the game. While it restricted daily playtime for free players, it encouraged cooperative gameplay, which, in turn made the community overall a nice bunch.Nowadays, you get to play as much as you want (there was a 10 Energy fee for entering levels),but everything else is slow and tedious to do. Take crafting for instance; Previously, you crafted things with Energy. It took a chunk of time, but it was pretty doable until higher levels. Today, you have to get ""Crystals"" to craft items.They are paid with energy or found, but are: If playing levels, as rare as a cold glass of soda in a desert If buying with in-game currency, a 3-weeks-average grindfest to craft an item If buying with real money, an ""I am rich"" showcase of your many 5-star itemsAnd then comes the forge system. You see, you need heat (too!) to improve your weapons, and there are up to 10 levels of heat. Previously, heat level raised automatically (ala level up when you have enough exp).Currently, heat levels are increased when you provide ""Embers"" to a forge. The main flaws of this system are: They suffer from the same problems of Crystals Forges are only found outside missionsTherefore, you lose many potential heat levels while searching for Embers.And now, *drumroll*...UPDATES!The updates are many, but few can be actually called updates. You may be wondering what do I mean by this. Well, most updates are cosmetics which have little to no effect on gameplay. 99.99% of those are silly recolors of 5 star items or costumes, which cost either a zillon coins or $100 of your local currency. The major updates are seldom released (the most recent having been released 4 months ago), with the majority of them being missions or equipment, with gameplay changes being perjudicial (well, only making elevators free helped players).Not to mention that none of them added to the main storyline. That's right, folks! When the main storyline is over, you have little or nothing left to do.Let's talk about the miscellania of content here: PvP and Shadow Lairs.PvP? Craft a 5 star weapon with attack speed and damage UVs (read: modifiers), suit yourself in an armor with similar modifiers (now you know why everyone runs around in wolf costumes) and you are ready to go. Enough said.Shadow Lairs? I have to admit, now that looks like something fun to do. Problem is, you need Shadow Keys to enter and a lot of Sparks of Life (used to revive) for this, both being ridiculously expensive. And, except the Shadow Key, that goes for all your fellow party members (you'll definitely want to have a full party before entering). This is the ultimate challenge in the game, but as such, it is the ultimate money sink (aside from crafting, that is).Now, if you want to play the game anyways, I won't stop you. But remember this: There are many better games out there, don't waste your time on this one unless you like seeing knights in shiny armor and impressive weapons while having a crappy semi-automatic laser pistol and that armor you managed to craft after 2 months of grinding.

												I am just going to throw in my 2 cents.I played this game before and was pretty hardcore about it back in that time. Tried multi-box farming and other ""non-normal"" way to make money before the patch that removes energy requirement on elevator. So you know I am not those casual players with less than 20 hours game time who will be shouting ""omg this game is so fun so cute, play it and you will never regret"".The gameplay was fun, but grind wall hits me hard after about 20 hours of gameplay--just like almost every other free-to-play game out there.For example, in order to do higher level content, you can:1. play this game everyday for an hour for 2 weeks so that you accumulates enough mats which could upgrade your gears2. forget about life, forget about work, grind countinously and get those gears in a single day3. swipe your card and purchase gears directly from the in-game auction houseI quited playing seriously simply because the game was not rewarding enough based on the time I invested in this game. But I still log back in once in awhile just to listen to the music and slash some enemies.Recent patches are always cash-oriented, which, for sure, increase the grind level of this game in general.In conclusion, Spiral Knights is a medicore F2P game. Gameplay is interesting and unique, but it requires serious grinding to get anything you want. I would recommend playing it casually--explore the world, try out new things, and log off. If you want to play this game hardcore, it will be very repetitive, frustrating, and time-consuming.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												UPDATE: Three Rings Design went under (quite the shocker, I know) and had the game transferred to Grey Havens, a team of ex-OOO employees who took over with no limitations from Sega on what they could and couldn't do. Sounds like the game will actually recieve content updates, right? Well, at first it kind of did, a few steps in the right direction, a bit of polishing and bug fixes, simple stuff. But just when the playerbase was starting to regain their faith in the game, the dreaded box promos returned, and returned again. The game went from a possible state of ressurrection to right back down the same exact ♥♥♥♥ing pattern of ""updates"" that players are sick to death of.Having played this game for over 3,000 hours on Steam alone (about another 50 or so before the Steam release) I can say this game is nothing like it used to be. It's basically a MMO dungeon crawler inspired off of The Legend of Zelda and to be quite honest it has some serious potential, and still does.Unfortunately the developing company (Three Rings Design or ""OOO"" for short) was bought out by Sega at one point and since then, the game started to decline. This decline quickly turned from bad to worse once its lead developer, Nick Popovich, resigned from OOO to pursue a living as an indie game developer. Before his resignation he had announced some major changes to the game that would be very welcoming to players both new and old and this was about 2 years ago. To this day, only a small fraction of these changes have been implemented into the game and production of new content has virtually ceased.Any updates that come to the game come in the form of prize boxes, only purchasable with real cash and contain accessories and costume pieces that provide no benefit whatsoever other than ""Wowie I got the same helmet I already have 38 others of but now in a slightly different shade of red."" Every time a ""new"" prize box is released which at this point is almost every 2 weeks, it's nothing more than a simple change of colors for the exact same items. And the cherry on top of this whole ordeal is in the off-chance that these boxes contain an item never before seen with unique stats (such as a shield or a weapon) they have insanely low drop rates and pretty much force you to spend hundreds of dollars on boxes for a small chance at it or purchasing it from another player who will more than likely have a price tag on it large enough to make you cringe.Personally, I find the game's PvP community to be the most toxic I have ever seen, comparable to League of Legends. This is just my experience, though. The game's PvP system is a whole other wall of text I could spend days writing about.Other than those points, I still find the game quite enjoyable to play when I have some friends to play with, and I also livestream it on Youtube every now and then which brings some of what's left of the game's good part of the community together for a good time, which is my goal. With friends to play with, the game is still pretty decent if you can get past its broken crafting system. Most veterans that have been around this game since its beta days would really hate to see it get shut down, but with the dev team leaving everyone in the dark and not saying anything about what they intend to do in the long run, it has left most of us to believe that the game's days are numbered.TL;DR Do I recommend the game? Yes only if you have friends to play with or want to try something new. As far as sticking around and playing actively, don't even bother unless things pick up with the people in charge behind the game and its development shows signs of well... actually being developed. But in its current state, the game's future does not look too bright so if you're looking for a new MMO to get into, steer clear of Spiral Knights (for now)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Spiral knights is (for me) a very enjoyable game. Before you dive into it though, I must warn you it might be addicting for some. The game has graphics which make the game look cute but amazing at the same time, and the soundtrack always fits prefectly with it. Some people might argue there might be no point in playing once you get full 5* gear and all the stuff. Lately (about a month ago) I found that was wrong. That is because you can always RP or invent games within the game, like what the arsenal podcast did. I think this is an amzing game, but be wary to not get addicted to playing it. So I recommend this game, but not too much so you won't get addicted.			",8,2,0,2,2,0,0

												While the game is old, with updates over the past year the game has become much more free-to-play friendly than it use to be. Elevators are now free and there is no longer a Mist bar, meaning endless dungeon crawling for everyone. Leveling weapons is different, now requiring a specific item depending on the * of weapon. While hard to find at times, it is still possible to find the required item in Prize Boxes in through the dungeon. The newer updates the game have put the focus back on exploration and spending time in the Clockworks and learning the game at your own pace, not buying everything with real world money and just spending time in pvp. I have sunk easily 1000+ hours over the course of my time playing Spiral Knights and it will always be one of my most favorite games ever because of all of the memories I have made through the 3 years I have been playing.

												Spiral Knights is a great game. Great story mode and I adore the graphics. Not many games have 3D cartoon-ish graphics to them, but there is one problem. . . Spiral Knights is dying and I don't want this game to die. My cousins told me that once you finish the story mode there is nothing else to do. So what I suggest is that you should expand the story mode and add new items. Back in  2012 Spiral Knights was popular, but now the population has decreased to 500-300 players. I'm begging the developers to please expand the story mode. Make an update that adds an more to the story mode. I really want to experience that feeling again when my cousins would call over Skype and we'd all play Spiral Knights, but because we finished the story there was no point in playing Spiral Knights anymore. Please expand the story mode and maybe add new items to the game. It's a big thing that I'm asking for, but there are many games out there that expand their story and keeping it fresh.

												So much I love the astetics and the mechanics on this game there are just two things that kills it for me and it should kill it for you.#1 customization!While you can ad some glitter on your armor it is always bound on your armor and it is hard to retrieve! Why not saying ""Hey you can ad so and so many things to your armor or take it of as you please. But if you want to wear more than x things than you have to pay for slots"" which would also result in a far better customization Menu, and would bring allot more depth into the game and still would keep that buying or earning option, just in a not so rediclues way.#2 Difficulty!While this doesn't matter to everyone the most of you it does. It is rediclues easy. Up until this point I was walking allone! Allone! In a 4 Player Coop Game! Unlike Borderlands never be meant to play Alone! In the Hardest Difficulty! And I got easily trough! Only the boss figts where a bit tough so second hardest dificulty! What the frick? After 20 Hours? Nothing?So much I would love this game, this kills it for me!. There is no reason to play it anymore. And I was really enjoying it at first and was planning in spending a little money on it. Pfff!.			",171,48,2,20,18,3,36

												Oh how far we've fallen... I've been playing this since 2010 and while there have been massive improvements, there have been massive failures.  Every update ends up requiring multiple shutdowns and restarts, latency has gone from annoying to game runing in several places, and once you've done everything once there really isn't anything more.  There have been no new levels, monsters, bosses, or anything for almost 2 years.  When this was new it was absolutely amazing and for new players it will be very fun.  But for those who have been around for a while it just doesn't do it anymore.  New weapons are great but if you're shooting at the same monsters over and over again in the same levels, it gets pretty boring after a while.  To be sure, you'll get hundreds of hours out of it, especially if you minimally pay and do it through old fashioned work.  But don't expect to stick around for years at near the same level of excitement.			",90,18,0,4,2,3,10

												I would not recommend playing Spiral Knights as the MMO's in-game economy is quite poor and declining in energy which is the game's resource for essentially doing anything to progress your character whether proceeding through level elevators, revival, crafting items or equiptment, ect. This results in making a game with very simplistic game mechanics revolving around cooperative play not nessecarily worth the immense amount of grinding for progressing into later levels. Or considering the game is free-to-play you could use your real life currency for energy or crowns, which with the disestablished market place makes the game pay to win in many respects. The sole experience relies on your character's equiptment which again is difficult to account for, and the equiptment choice is minimal with not a lot of unique choice lacking depth.

												After spending enough time to get a feel for the game, this game feels like it belongs on a mobile platform. Definitely has a generic, hollow feeling. Sort of feels like a Pay to Win type game, but others might have a different opinion. Not a ""bad"" game, per se. Just a little dull and monotonous. Perhaps something like the criticisms of Destiny. Yeah. I went there.Positives are that I sometimes got vibes of Phantasy Star Online, but those moments were very, very rare, and probably based soley on the fact it is a sci-fi shooter associated with Sega.I'd recommend this game if you want to play Mobile tier games on a computer, via Steam. If you don't want that, I'd defnitely not reccomend this game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Never, EVER go near this game. IT has caused me an unbeleavable ammount of pain. STAY AWAY!!!!It is very much pay2win oriented, since resurrecting in the dungeons uses up energy and you only get roughly 100 per day (and each time you revive, it's cost doubles, so first it's 10, then 20 then 40, etc.).It is absolutely imperative that you live a maximum of 7 feet away from their servers, otherwise you'll have to predict enemy movement before they even telegraph it. Same goes for your own actions as you'll see your own sword pass through enemies unless you time it juuuuust right.If you DO decide to play this, remember: your shield is TOOL to be used often. Use it's pushing ability to scatter surrounding enemies away before they strike (again, have to time it right or you'll get hit despite having your shield up).Not recommended.			",154,11,0,5,3,0,12

												Ah, Spiral Knights. How can I keep this recommendation within the character limit. Well, it's a free-to-play action-based MMO, but it remains free-to-play due to a mechanic that allows only so much playtime each day. And if you get addicted, which you will, you need to at least buy a monthly pass, that's basically required to enjoy the game anyway, unless you only have an hour or two to play each day anyway, in which case this is a perfect system for you. The game starts out easy, the controls are very simple, and they recently added an optional tutorial/questing system, which makes it even easier to start playing. However, things get insanely challenging later on. Bullet hells, spike hells, fiery helly hells. There are even special areas made just to be cruel hells. Admittedly it gets easier once you become experienced and know what to expect, but there are still areas that are basically impossible to progress through solo. This game will teach you how to use a shield, I'll say that.UPDATE:I'm changing this recommendation from positive to negative. This game is dying. A year ago, this was an underappreciated gem of an MMO. There was new content being regularly released for free that drew you in, and then while you were here there were cosmetics and boosts that you could pay for if you wanted to. This is how the free-to-play model should work, content that draws you in and keeps you playing while simultaneously not being locked behind a paywall and being open to anyone, whether they pay or not. And for the most part, this model still applies to new players who haven't experienced all the content yet.But the new content updates that comprise the backbone of this model have long since died off. Promises were made and never kept, the lead developer upped and left, and a noticeably large chunk of the playerbase has died off due to boredom. It feels like a lot of drive and inspiration has been lost and Three Rings thinks it can fill this void with shiny ""new"" reskins and repeating event content and hope that no one notices while they try to piece everything back together behind the scenes, IF they're trying to piece everything back together behind the scenes, maybe they aren't. It's been over a year now and there are STILL a bunch of unfixed problems and bugs related to the sprites update that was released just before everything fell apart.Examples: Some minerals have no purpose and get stuck in your inventory; sprites have a level numbering system that makes no sense, the ""true"" max level is some number over 100 that the game doesn't tell you; the only way of knowing that you've reached this ""true"" max level is that your sprite glitches out and stops accepting levelup food; and there are quite a few balance issues with pet abilties and ultimates, some are even outright bugs themselves.(Seraphynx's Violent Heart Attack ultimate causes targets enchanted with Heart Attack to explode. Sounds cool, right? It does until you realize that the explosion does almost zero damage even in tier three and is really only good for breaking blocks. And the alternative ultimate, Iron Heart Attack, has a chance to drop defense orbs that maybe cushion half a pip's worth of damage, also in tier three. Take your pick between useless and more useless. In fact, just stay away from Seraphynx in general, its first ability has a deceptively large hitbox combined with a maximum hit limit per enemy that makes no sense, its second ability is very unreliable and might not even have an effect at all, and its third ability has too small of a radius to be useful in the team setting that it's meant to be useful in and has only enough health for one, maaaaaaybe two hits for everyone and not per person, it's mostly just for running over traps that you're too impatient to wait for. Hell, the other non-defense-oriented sprites have BETTER individual defensive abilities than the defense-oriented sprite, because the defense sprite is meant for providing defense for the whole team, yet the balance just isn't there to actually provide reliable and worthwhile defensive abilities for multiple people simultaneously, it's better if everyone just brought their own Flame Barrier and Shadow Cloak buffs and went from there. Unless you just like shiny cosmetic kittens, of course.)Phew.My point is, these things are acceptable for a month or two after a big update, not a year, and the fact that so little has changed to make the game better in that time tells me that they've probably stopped caring about Spiral Knights altogether. If you're new to the game you will have all sorts of fun in everything that's been established already, but don't invest too much into your future here, at the rate things are going you won't have much of one.

												Spiral Knights is your average MMORPG made 95% less cramped; instead of infinite players going through the same dungeon, there are only 4 at most per party.While the game could get a handful more people by being updated with new content on a more regular basis, at its Core it's a fun and stylish game about cyborgs(?) whacking swords and shooting hand-sized bullets at animals, robots, demons, and all sorts of fantastical monsters as they try to find a way out of an incredibly complex and artificial planet they got stuck themselves onto (Spoiler Alert: they're still stuck on it).Also cool TF2 hat is cool.  :3All-in-all, worth the download and a place in your library.

												A charming, Zelda-inspired, online RPG. Beautiful art style, great soundtrack, good progression, with fun PvE and PvP. This is a great game in my opinion, and while it might not be for everyone, it is definitely a 'must-try'.There is quite a grind mid-game, but it's just enough grind to make you WANT to spend some money, but not so bad you HAVE to spend. There are not as many end-game dungeons as there should be, but you can go back to previous missions with scaled down stats (with slighty less payout). The developer (Three Rings) constantly creates new events, with new levels, and usually new costumes armor sets. These incremental updates provide new stuff to do while you wait for the next big level update.Customization in this game is HUGE, with 'costume armor' sets, and accessories to put on your armor (though you can only afford them towards end-game). It's insane how many different armor combinations you can make. I've played over 1000 hours, and even I can't remember every one!PvP will provide hours of fun, but at times can be overrun with PvP elitists (trust me, that's no fun). The ""FreeToPlay"" system is set up really well, and has greatly improved in a recent update (so if you played it a while ago and hated it, try it again). Currency earned by play is called ""Crowns"", and currency that you pay real money for is called ""Energy"". At any time, Crowns can be traded for Energy via the in-game energy market (thus paying real money is completely optional). Of course Energy is more desirable, but when trading with other players, they usually don't mind if you pay in Crowns. You can buy energy to speed up your progression, but is by no means neccessary to reach end-game. I have bought Energy a few times myself, but they were mostly to buy costumes or to pimp out a costume with accessories.I think my hours spent playing this game tell how fun it is. I love this game, and I would play it at the slightest mention of a new update or event.It's free, it's fun, and truly FreeToPlay, what more do I need to say? Play it NOW...!    (and if you don't like it you are a heartless scrublord)			",39,0,1,5,3,0,0

The game may require some grinding at the end but exept of that it deserves a chance for people to play it.			",15,1,0,0,0,1,0

Yeah ok, first things first. It's not dead. It's a small but alive population so don't go around saying it's a dead game.Now that's out of the way, I just want to say: It's a really good game but it's corrupted with the whole P2W aspectSure there are some frusfrations like grinding and the overly done crafting system but the gameplay, atmosphere and visual is just so appealing. The crafting system is kinda annoying what with you having to go to dungeons over and over and over so you can get that one material you know need but the dungeons themselves are kinda cool and each has their own themes. Oh and when I say dungeon? I mean underground depths.You descend deeper and deeper into the earth's core as you progress through the dungeons and you will need to get better gear as things proceed but it's decently balanced. Thing is the P2W thing is just really tempting. You need that one more material? One more coin? One more whatever to do whatever it is you are doing? HERE'S SOME OFFER IN YOUR FACE JUST TO TEMPT YOU. If you resist it though, it's really irrelevant tbh. It's not like you use the P2W money to revive yourself when you are dead and if you are not skilled enough to stay alive for a long time, especially with the lag it has due to the lack of servers and maintenance, you have to restart from the beginning or anythingI love this game and I do recommend you to download and give this game a try. It's free and it's good, what's the harm really? Except the cancerous P2W system ",140,14,0,15,5,0,4

												Okay this game I didn't like from the start because it had a membership system. And I didn't want to get sucked into that and waste all my money on it. It wasn't even that much to start with. Basically I just went around spamming attack and running around and picking up loot. The loot you get from basic missions has no value. Like NO value. The Tutorial felt rushed and it took me about half 'n hour to figure them all out. The custimization in it didn't seem seem too good either. All the cosmetics looked the same to me. But in games like TF2 or Payday 1 and 2 the cosmetic items look very differnt and unique. So I justed stopped playing when I got to the part when I have to pay or else it's close to impossible. There were also a leveling system I think with xp. But there didn't seem like there was much of an award for leveling up. 2/10			",81,9,0,6,7,1,2

												Decent game... HOWEVER maximum of 100 Energy per day and each mission requires 10 Energy to do... so about 10 or so missions before you run out of energy which won't allow you to play any more.That is very disappointing.* Note they did fix that issue, however the lag issues in this game make it hard to play without dying way too often even with a super internet connection.

												The game seems fun and playing with my pro friends made it pretty easy. I just don't reccommend it to anyone who plans on gaming with a controller, the lack of optimization and having to personally map every single button is a chore. Even after mapping the gamepad there is no way to map a key to open options menu. If you're gaming with Mouse/Keyboard: Try it out, Gamepad: Don't bother.			",33,7,0,11,2,1,10

												Gameplay feels boring and repetative very soon. Ingame payments are the way this game makes its money, so basic ""show me the money"" applies. You can run around the game and waste your time collecting something that you think will move your character forwars, in stead of paying money for a quick route to finishing line, which keeps on moving on. This seems old too quickly and seems like a one trick pony did it's purpose. And then you want to remove it and a bit regret the time wasted, that's not easy after all.Items that the game gives to you cannot be removed or transferred by steam account so there they stay and seem to be impossible to remove and only after reinstall of the game and removal of all in game accounts can every trace of the game removed from your steam account. So remember to do that or you end up downloading it back again one day just to remove it.			",109,23,0,7,8,0,13

												When I started this game, I was young and innocent. I just wanted to buy Rome-Total War(tm), to enjoy the salutations of the people. How naive I was. Spiral Knights is an eldritch land, tugging at the edges of your soul until it gets hold of a jagged piece and rends you to the core, leaving naught but a torn, gangrenous wound in its wake. Any foolhardy traveller with the intention of tasting the Elysian nectar they believe this game to be, beware. For this is no nectar, but a venus flytrap, waiting, readying its gaping, ravenous maw to snap down upon your head. Stare long into the abyss, and the abyss will stare back into you, into your soul until it is nothing but its smoldering core. With these, my dying curses, I entreat ye, do not trust this abomination. They, the fallen, all said ""Its just to get another game"", I said these words as well, and I find myself here, hollow, not the man I once believed I was. Overall, 7/10 it was ok I guess.

But it ultimatly fails. Very sad when a game that has so much potential is wasted on a♥♥♥♥♥♥Dev team and a really ♥♥♥♥♥♥ game engine.I would not recommend this game to anyone looking for a deep investment, like one would actually want out of an MMO.

												Ok so, I have played this game for so many hours even before when I had steam. When I officially got Spiral Knights for steam, I had already like 4 star armor. Honestly, this game has gone to♥♥♥♥♥♥ There are only THREE tiers! Tier 1 : A Boss Named Snarbolax Tier 2 : Jelly King / Queen and The Romolous Twins Tier 3 : Vanaduke . Now , if you want to buy gear in this game THATS A ♥♥♥♥ING PROBLEM!! Everything is SO overly priced! This game is F2P but the game ♥♥♥♥in BEGS you to use real money on it. I used to play this with my friend and it was fun, but it has gone to complete and utter♥♥♥♥♥♥! You need to keep grinding the same ♥♥♥♥ing levels for who the ♥♥♥♥ knows how many times in a day to get ""rich"". I will just go right out and say it, if you are not rich or you arent at least a gamer girl, You will find it SUPER hard to get ANY online friends. Sure if you are 5 star you can pickup a guy that is 1 star or a newbie as a friend, but here me out, HE/SHE WILL ♥♥♥♥ING BEG YOU FOR MONEY NON-STOP. Now if you actually get a ""girlfriend / boyfriend"" and they are lower star than you,  THEY WILL ♥♥♥♥ING BEG YOU TO DEATH FOR CROWNS.  Now I keep saying Stars and Crowns and let me explain. Crowns are the in-game money and Stars are like a ranking for gear in-game. SERIOUSLY I have been playing this game for 5 years min. And taken about 3 years of a break. Why? BECAUSE THE GAME IS SO ♥♥♥♥ING GRINDY ITS NOT FUNNY ANYMORE. I SWEAR, WHEN YOU GET TO TIER 3, ALL YOU WILL ♥♥♥♥ING DO, IS GRIND VANADUKE, CAUSE IT FIVES YOU ABOUT 8K + EVERY LEVEL BUT IT IS SO ♥♥♥♥ING BORING!! You try to change it up a bit a do Snarbolax or Jelly King / Queen but I promise you that you WILL go back to Vanaduke cause being rich in-game is SO important , you WILL regret it!! Basically, what I am trying to say here, you probably should not play this game if you are not willing to pay in-game money.			",54,5,0,4,2,1,0

												UPDATE: Three Rings Design went under (quite the shocker, I know) and had the game transferred to Grey Havens, a team of ex-OOO employees who took over with no limitations from Sega on what they could and couldn't do. Sounds like the game will actually recieve content updates, right? Well, at first it kind of did, a few steps in the right direction, a bit of polishing and bug fixes, simple stuff. But just when the playerbase was starting to regain their faith in the game, the dreaded box promos returned, and returned again. The game went from a possible state of ressurrection to right back down the same exact ♥♥♥♥ing pattern of ""updates"" that players are sick to death of.Having played this game for over 3,000 hours on Steam alone (about another 50 or so before the Steam release) I can say this game is nothing like it used to be. It's basically a MMO dungeon crawler inspired off of The Legend of Zelda and to be quite honest it has some serious potential, and still does.Unfortunately the developing company (Three Rings Design or ""OOO"" for short) was bought out by Sega at one point and since then, the game started to decline. This decline quickly turned from bad to worse once its lead developer, Nick Popovich, resigned from OOO to pursue a living as an indie game developer. Before his resignation he had announced some major changes to the game that would be very welcoming to players both new and old and this was about 2 years ago. To this day, only a small fraction of these changes have been implemented into the game and production of new content has virtually ceased.Any updates that come to the game come in the form of prize boxes, only purchasable with real cash and contain accessories and costume pieces that provide no benefit whatsoever other than ""Wowie I got the same helmet I already have 38 others of but now in a slightly different shade of red."" Every time a ""new"" prize box is released which at this point is almost every 2 weeks, it's nothing more than a simple change of colors for the exact same items. And the cherry on top of this whole ordeal is in the off-chance that these boxes contain an item never before seen with unique stats (such as a shield or a weapon) they have insanely low drop rates and pretty much force you to spend hundreds of dollars on boxes for a small chance at it or purchasing it from another player who will more than likely have a price tag on it large enough to make you cringe.Personally, I find the game's PvP community to be the most toxic I have ever seen, comparable to League of Legends. This is just my experience, though. The game's PvP system is a whole other wall of text I could spend days writing about.Other than those points, I still find the game quite enjoyable to play when I have some friends to play with, and I also livestream it on Youtube every now and then which brings some of what's left of the game's good part of the community together for a good time, which is my goal. With friends to play with, the game is still pretty decent if you can get past its broken crafting system. Most veterans that have been around this game since its beta days would really hate to see it get shut down, but with the dev team leaving everyone in the dark and not saying anything about what they intend to do in the long run, it has left most of us to believe that the game's days are numbered.TL;DR Do I recommend the game? Yes only if you have friends to play with or want to try something new. As far as sticking around and playing actively, don't even bother unless things pick up with the people in charge behind the game and its development shows signs of well... actually being developed. But in its current state, the game's future does not look too bright so if you're looking for a new MMO to get into, steer clear of Spiral Knights (for now)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Oh how far we've fallen... I've been playing this since 2010 and while there have been massive improvements, there have been massive failures.  Every update ends up requiring multiple shutdowns and restarts, latency has gone from annoying to game runing in several places, and once you've done everything once there really isn't anything more.  There have been no new levels, monsters, bosses, or anything for almost 2 years.  When this was new it was absolutely amazing and for new players it will be very fun.  But for those who have been around for a while it just doesn't do it anymore.  New weapons are great but if you're shooting at the same monsters over and over again in the same levels, it gets pretty boring after a while.  To be sure, you'll get hundreds of hours out of it, especially if you minimally pay and do it through old fashioned work.  But don't expect to stick around for years at near the same level of excitement.			",90,18,0,4,2,3,10

												In regards to Spiral Knights, I feel a heavy bit of nostalgia for Phantasy Star Online for the Dreamcast from this; be it the music, art style, or overall Sega feel. It's a candy coated, charming, and light action-rpg that I get an itch for when I'm away from it for a few months. However It's a grind for gear, and there's not much in the way of customization or variety unless you play everyday in copy-cat grind-y dungeons, or shell out real money. Which, I believe, the game deserves.  The paywall feels like it hits as soon I as get in a groove, and snaps like a rubber band. I eventually come back, though, for the tight gameplay and charming design. So yah, play it.			",164,47,1,25,8,2,17

												After spending enough time to get a feel for the game, this game feels like it belongs on a mobile platform. Definitely has a generic, hollow feeling. Sort of feels like a Pay to Win type game, but others might have a different opinion. Not a ""bad"" game, per se. Just a little dull and monotonous. Perhaps something like the criticisms of Destiny. Yeah. I went there.Positives are that I sometimes got vibes of Phantasy Star Online, but those moments were very, very rare, and probably based soley on the fact it is a sci-fi shooter associated with Sega.I'd recommend this game if you want to play Mobile tier games on a computer, via Steam. If you don't want that, I'd defnitely not reccomend this game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Never, EVER go near this game. IT has caused me an unbeleavable ammount of pain. STAY AWAY!!!!It is very much pay2win oriented, since resurrecting in the dungeons uses up energy and you only get roughly 100 per day (and each time you revive, it's cost doubles, so first it's 10, then 20 then 40, etc.).It is absolutely imperative that you live a maximum of 7 feet away from their servers, otherwise you'll have to predict enemy movement before they even telegraph it. Same goes for your own actions as you'll see your own sword pass through enemies unless you time it juuuuust right.If you DO decide to play this, remember: your shield is TOOL to be used often. Use it's pushing ability to scatter surrounding enemies away before they strike (again, have to time it right or you'll get hit despite having your shield up).Not recommended.			",154,11,0,5,3,0,12

												Good game, however, the energy system is the worst free to play system I've ever seen in a game, basically you can play for free, but you can't do anything without energy which you need to buy. 100 Mist energy is the maximum energy a free to play account has which equals to five quests. Mist energy regenerates 1 energy each 13 minutes. The worst part being that if you die in a quest(instance) you need energy to revive, if you don't spend that energy, you go back to town and that 20 mist energy you paid for the quest, is now gone and you made 0 progress within the game. And if you buy crystal energy (the one that doesn't regenerate) you have only what you've paid for. I'd rather pay 50 bucks and play forever (until a DLC/expansion comes out). And don't tell me that this game is worth more than 50 bucks because it isn't. If I want to play something worth my money I would rather choose something like Guild Wars 2.Good things about this game? The co-op is very enjoyable, the ranking system is fun, the arcade system is basically an (almost) endless mode of instances and crafting could be better, a little complexity here and there won't hurt.Rating (from someone you don't know/care about) = 5/10.Hell, not enough energy to rate higher.

												I have played this game from its beta period and I previously reviewed it on April 24, 2013. Back then I stated that this was an ""okay"" game; worth some of your time but many of the additions made it rather annoying to play (mist energy I'm looking at you).BUT since then, I have come back to the game just recently and I have to give a pat on the back to the devs. No more wait-till-the-next-day-mobile-phone-gaming-crap. Vast improvements to the crafting of items and forging encourage you to keep playing. And the graphics are still pretty good, even today. This game has had a terrible past as oldies like me know. Having to wait for your energy to recharge and boring ""NEW BOX!"" patches being the only thing that was being added, as well as inflated crystal energy prices (anybody else remember them at 2000-3000 per 100?) used to make this a very ""meh"" experience.

												Personally, I can't say much of this game. I quit the game almost early, because there was a broad storyline I could almost not follow, and the layout of the screen almost confused me at times. When I did understand what I was supposed to do, and (rarely) why, I would enjoy the heck out of myself. The graphics are still amazing for the game, but for myself ( who doesn't like when my UI is cramped) the game got boring quick. It quickly reminded me of my first days of WoW, and how I quit after a week of trying to get used to the cramped screen. Would not reccomend for anyone who is not used to the RPG feel of a cramped screen, but if you like a cramped screen, but would enjoy a more smooth and sci-fi graphical scene, this game is for you.

Now, no f2p mmo would be complete without in-game purchases with real money (don't know the term for it :P), but you don't even really need to do that! It's just for the people who want to build things faster and get a little jumpstart on their Knight.

												This game is too much of a grindhouse in order to progress. Sure such grind can be rewarding in the end but for this game it isn't. I understand that they need an income seeing it is a free to play game afterall but making some items needed to craft better weapons and armors very rare when you can buy it all when convert your real cash into ingame currency (energy)? While you can buy energy with your ingame money but the ratio conversion is too high. What's more is that the ingame cash can be used for many things like extra loots, challange etc which normally you cannot access to without having energy.Unless you're in a guild or with good friend to co op with, this game is lonely and a struggle.

Posted: September 26, 2014
												This was a good game.As most other reviews mention, yes, this used to be a fun game.Now? It's plain bad. VERY bad. Think as bad as Runescape and you aren't far.(On a side note, are all MMO games programmed in Java cursed to be bad?)Sure, you may be thinking ""This is an angry rant, not a review"". Well, let's see...In the past, there was a thing called Mist Energy (Mist = Free, Crystal = In-Game or Real Money), up to a max of 100 at a time. If you don't play the game and didn't come across the concept in the reviews, Energy is used for the main aspects in the game. While it restricted daily playtime for free players, it encouraged cooperative gameplay, which, in turn made the community overall a nice bunch.Nowadays, you get to play as much as you want (there was a 10 Energy fee for entering levels),but everything else is slow and tedious to do. Take crafting for instance; Previously, you crafted things with Energy. It took a chunk of time, but it was pretty doable until higher levels. Today, you have to get ""Crystals"" to craft items.They are paid with energy or found, but are: If playing levels, as rare as a cold glass of soda in a desert If buying with in-game currency, a 3-weeks-average grindfest to craft an item If buying with real money, an ""I am rich"" showcase of your many 5-star itemsAnd then comes the forge system. You see, you need heat (too!) to improve your weapons, and there are up to 10 levels of heat. Previously, heat level raised automatically (ala level up when you have enough exp).Currently, heat levels are increased when you provide ""Embers"" to a forge. The main flaws of this system are: They suffer from the same problems of Crystals Forges are only found outside missionsTherefore, you lose many potential heat levels while searching for Embers.And now, *drumroll*...UPDATES!The updates are many, but few can be actually called updates. You may be wondering what do I mean by this. Well, most updates are cosmetics which have little to no effect on gameplay. 99.99% of those are silly recolors of 5 star items or costumes, which cost either a zillon coins or $100 of your local currency. The major updates are seldom released (the most recent having been released 4 months ago), with the majority of them being missions or equipment, with gameplay changes being perjudicial (well, only making elevators free helped players).Not to mention that none of them added to the main storyline. That's right, folks! When the main storyline is over, you have little or nothing left to do.Let's talk about the miscellania of content here: PvP and Shadow Lairs.PvP? Craft a 5 star weapon with attack speed and damage UVs (read: modifiers), suit yourself in an armor with similar modifiers (now you know why everyone runs around in wolf costumes) and you are ready to go. Enough said.Shadow Lairs? I have to admit, now that looks like something fun to do. Problem is, you need Shadow Keys to enter and a lot of Sparks of Life (used to revive) for this, both being ridiculously expensive. And, except the Shadow Key, that goes for all your fellow party members (you'll definitely want to have a full party before entering). This is the ultimate challenge in the game, but as such, it is the ultimate money sink (aside from crafting, that is).Now, if you want to play the game anyways, I won't stop you. But remember this: There are many better games out there, don't waste your time on this one unless you like seeing knights in shiny armor and impressive weapons while having a crappy semi-automatic laser pistol and that armor you managed to craft after 2 months of grinding.

												I am just going to throw in my 2 cents.I played this game before and was pretty hardcore about it back in that time. Tried multi-box farming and other ""non-normal"" way to make money before the patch that removes energy requirement on elevator. So you know I am not those casual players with less than 20 hours game time who will be shouting ""omg this game is so fun so cute, play it and you will never regret"".The gameplay was fun, but grind wall hits me hard after about 20 hours of gameplay--just like almost every other free-to-play game out there.For example, in order to do higher level content, you can:1. play this game everyday for an hour for 2 weeks so that you accumulates enough mats which could upgrade your gears2. forget about life, forget about work, grind countinously and get those gears in a single day3. swipe your card and purchase gears directly from the in-game auction houseI quited playing seriously simply because the game was not rewarding enough based on the time I invested in this game. But I still log back in once in awhile just to listen to the music and slash some enemies.Recent patches are always cash-oriented, which, for sure, increase the grind level of this game in general.In conclusion, Spiral Knights is a medicore F2P game. Gameplay is interesting and unique, but it requires serious grinding to get anything you want. I would recommend playing it casually--explore the world, try out new things, and log off. If you want to play this game hardcore, it will be very repetitive, frustrating, and time-consuming.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Good game, however, the energy system is the worst free to play system I've ever seen in a game, basically you can play for free, but you can't do anything without energy which you need to buy. 100 Mist energy is the maximum energy a free to play account has which equals to five quests. Mist energy regenerates 1 energy each 13 minutes. The worst part being that if you die in a quest(instance) you need energy to revive, if you don't spend that energy, you go back to town and that 20 mist energy you paid for the quest, is now gone and you made 0 progress within the game. And if you buy crystal energy (the one that doesn't regenerate) you have only what you've paid for. I'd rather pay 50 bucks and play forever (until a DLC/expansion comes out). And don't tell me that this game is worth more than 50 bucks because it isn't. If I want to play something worth my money I would rather choose something like Guild Wars 2.Good things about this game? The co-op is very enjoyable, the ranking system is fun, the arcade system is basically an (almost) endless mode of instances and crafting could be better, a little complexity here and there won't hurt.Rating (from someone you don't know/care about) = 5/10.Hell, not enough energy to rate higher. Sorry.			",28,4,0,5,5,0,5

												Background ethos: I have a playtime of 55:07:28:52, linked is an alt account. I've been a customer of OOO since 2007. I 'jumped ship' from Y!PP to this game in 2012.This game is a hard sell. It is fun, vibrant and is both simple enough to pick up, and compelling enough to not put down. 2 years ago, I would say that once you get over the mist system, it's an excellent game I hope to see grow to be even better. 2 years later, I cannot reccommend this game wholeheartily due to the missteps it has taken. There is no getting past the top-heavy 'first act' of the game, restricting leveling system, redundancy-by-proxy mission system, and lack of an endgame.These decisions and the overall lack of content to explore being added in any fashion sour the game experience for me. While the game remains something I come back to, I can no longer tell my friends to try it out, and I won't tell you, reader, either.			",32,4,0,7,9,1,11

As a result, I've decided that I'm definitely not going to be playing this game again.

Eine Story mit wirklichem Sinn konnte ich bisher noch nicht finden aber bei den meisten Online-Rollenspielen kommt es ja darauf eh nicht an. Wenn man es mit Freunden zusammen zockt oder überhaupt mit netten Mitspielern dann hat es durchaus einen Sucht-Faktor.

												A great game to play if you're looking for something where you can aim for the highest ranks or items. The combat system is very simple and easy to use for new players. PvP and Dungeons/Missions are included in the game so you'll be able to choose what type of path to choose in the game. PvP is probably most recommend when you're done with all Missions or if you at least have experience with combat. And the game has different weapons you can have such as swords, guns and bombs. You can either choose to have one each out of the three or just focus on one type of weapon. Very fun game overall.			",64,10,1,4,6,0,3

												Play this game.It's a dungeon crawler MMORPG with a dash of zelda inserted for good measure. The old 'free' mist energy may have been scrapped, but so have energy costs for elevators and alchemy. In short, buying energy with real money is now a shortcut, not a necessity. It's perfectly possible to play through the entire main game (i.e. the 'rank' missions) completely free.There are no 'character levels', but your equipment gains 'heat' (basically exp), and after a certain amount is collected, you can level it up via the forge. Weapons 'evolve' through alchemy, and new weapons can be crafted via alchemy.The main game has you play as a knight who completes various missions which revolve around exploring what is known as the clockworks and fighting various monsters there. Rank missions involve you exploring 2-3 levels of the clockworks each time, whereas using the arcade lets you explore more freely - once you've done enough rank missions, you can go from 'depth 0' to 'depth 29' in a single run.The levels within the clockworks get progressively harder as you go deeper, and there are four main bosses to kill (as many times as you want) - and that's not including the difficult 'shadow lairs'. I feel that there's an emphasis on teamwork throughout the game (working as a team to complete missions makes it easier and you still get the same drops) and somewhat on player skill later on (even with excellent equipment, you'll still die if you're bad with a shield).It should be said, however, that if you don't wish to fork out any cash for energy, then you may find that the grinding required to advance throughout the game may prove too repetitive and boring - experienced MMO players probably won't suffer from this issue, however.Overall, I'd say this is a great game for those who enjoy MMOs, exploration and adventure.

I liked the old schoolish  over head action rpg goodness...but pay to win crap.. oh yea the stuff about my ex..well this was once again one of the few games at the time that her crap mac could run or were available on mac that i could own or was free so i played it too much.

												Absolut cooles Spiel, kann ich nur empfehlen. Die Grafik ist zwar nicht überwältigend hat aber irgendwas an sich und passt irgendwie doch zu dem Spiel. Ich denk ma das Wort ""knuffig"" trifft es am ehesten. Ansonsten macht es einfach nur Spaß. Eine Story mit wirklichem Sinn konnte ich bisher noch nicht finden aber bei den meisten Online-Rollenspielen kommt es ja darauf eh nicht an. Wenn man es mit Freunden zusammen zockt oder überhaupt mit netten Mitspielern dann hat es durchaus einen Sucht-Faktor. Einfach mal kostenlos installen und antesten, da kann man nichts falsch machen.			",79,33,3,22,16,1,33

												Playing for free in Spiral Knights can be summed up thusly, Grindan: The Grindaning. To even upgrade your equipment, you have to go through the same level repeatedly for a slim chance that a rare upgrading ingredient might drop, or you can grind for money and buy another type of premium currency to buy the ingredient. Pets are useless, especially in the first 30 levels where they have a lack of skill points. The storyline is just an excuse for your characters to go grind some more in the dungeons. You can also spend real money to skip all that grinding and get to the good stuff, like weapons, boss fights, and accessories.Otherwise, it is a nice little rpg with weapon trees, good controls, cute pets, costumes, accessories, trading ingame premium money, and all that classic junk you would expect from a mmorpg these days. Even if grinding is a large part of the game, 7/10 would reccomend again.			",114,9,0,5,7,0,4

												I've recently realized that this game satisfies a lot of my completionist tendencies, sort of like smaller games 'Upgrade Complete' and 'DLC Quest'. Not to say that Spiral Knights plays anything like those two - it's very much it's own animal. Essentially, I'd call the game a fast-paced adventure in dungeon-running, where the monsters spawn intent on ruining your day and your reflexes and gear are all you've got to defeat them. And gear - oh, the gear. You gather materials from the monsters you beat in the dungeons, and craft them into bigger and better weapons, armor and accessories. Which you then use to become stronger, rank up, and wreck more monsters. Plus, everything you craft appears in wonderful detail on your character: a nice visual nod to all the work you do. All this makes it that much sweeter to jump in, party up and make the Clockworks beg for mercy.			",222,77,4,62,15,3,37

												I've been playing this game, on and off, long before it was released on Steam, since beta.  I played opening release weekend, late March 2011.  One of my characters has over 85 1/2 days of play time on it, thats 2000+ hours.Great casual game:  +s, cute graphics, good music, great if you liked the Legend of Zelda games from NES, SNES, very simple combat style relative to most games.-s, little content; especially end-game, no raiding (more than 4 player, player versus AI content), limited pvp options.  Story is weak.If you're a casual player that can only log on for less than an hour to two hours a day to play, you'll find lots to do in this game without it feeling too grindy.  If you have more time to play than that per day, you'll get bored of this game relatively fast.			",1,0,0,5,0,0,0

												A great game to play if you're looking for something where you can aim for the highest ranks or items. The combat system is very simple and easy to use for new players. PvP and Dungeons/Missions are included in the game so you'll be able to choose what type of path to choose in the game. PvP is probably most recommend when you're done with all Missions or if you at least have experience with combat. And the game has different weapons you can have such as swords, guns and bombs. You can either choose to have one each out of the three or just focus on one type of weapon. Very fun game overall.			",64,10,1,4,6,0,3

												This is a great In-Dev game! Can't wait for the alpha...1. Servers - Can't move due to the location of the server or the count of players afk...2. Wep Switching - The inability to switch a weapon because im still clicking and the lag, which I cannot tell where I am at on (could be 300, could be 3000, DOES NOT SAY), is kind of annoying when your using a gun then you've got 5 melee on you, switch, nope still shooting, oh look your dead.3. In-game stores are off-putting with the fact that alot of top-end gear is on market for 'energy' which can either be bought at a varying amount of 'crowns' (average 7000c->100e) which would require hours on end of farming to buy or using real money on an FTP game.I just can't play this.

												Spiral knights is (for me) a very enjoyable game. Before you dive into it though, I must warn you it might be addicting for some. The game has graphics which make the game look cute but amazing at the same time, and the soundtrack always fits prefectly with it. Some people might argue there might be no point in playing once you get full 5* gear and all the stuff. Lately (about a month ago) I found that was wrong. That is because you can always RP or invent games within the game, like what the arsenal podcast did. I think this is an amzing game, but be wary to not get addicted to playing it. So I recommend this game, but not too much so you won't get addicted.			",8,2,0,2,2,0,0

												Fun?  Yes.Grindy?  Yes.Better with friends?  Yeah.Spiral Knights is a MMORPG which came out of the gate rocky, being like most korean mmo's where it was more 'pay to win'Thankfully they fixed that.  So the game is pritty fun but it gets repeditive even with the shifting floors, and it never felt like it made and impact.But i do indeed love the pet system.  It was fun to have a little battle pet fighting alongside you as you delved down with others to fight hoards of monsters ready to eat you.Hey, its free to play, give it a shot, cant say its a bad game just grindy and kind of repeditive.(Also, the skins and box deals are kind of BS)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is great if you want a 3D Rpgish game. It has a good art style, mostly not laggy, and is pretty fun. And its made by SEGA, it being good is saying something. The game does get grindy later on at about 3* and 4* items, but its still pretty good.I recommend it to anyone.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I have only recently linked my Spiral Knights account to steam, this is why it says i have played very little. I have played 200+ hours off steam.Spiral Knights is a very well designed and addictive mmo, not exactly the most complex one ever, but a excellent game never the less. It has had many changes during the time i have played this game that can change elements of the game completley, some good, some bad, but not bad enough to stop me playing.PROSA Great Variety of EnemiesCustomisation optionsLevels (depths)WeaponsAreasCharacters (Npcs)Players (online)MissionsOther FeaturesCrafting systemGame modes (Lockdown, etc)Guilds (clans, groups)Great bosses and boss battles (Snarbloax, Vanaduke)(Fairly new) Sprites (Pets that can fight with you)Beautifully designed Stages and areasAmazing soundtrack (availible on Itunes and Spotify)Runs pretty well on non-powerfull PC's and LaptopsAnd much more i have probably missedCONSMay take a while to get/craft/upgrade items (not so much now after a big update)Levels may get repetetive (not in my opinion)Some missions can be very difficult (but optional)Probably a few points i have missed but this game hardly has any bad points.One of if not my fave game (ever)9/10   ",82,12,0,4,7,0,3

												This game is fun until tier 3. Then it just gets grindy. Half of the time spent in this game is with my friends grinding things out trying to get the next set of armour, If you like that this is the game for you. This was still very fun while we played it. Great game, but just a little too grindy for my taste.			",57,5,0,8,8,1,17

												I do not play MMORPGs, so it's special when I say I play Spiral Knights. It's kept extremely simple, which makes it a great casual game that I can pick up and drop off without intense involvement. This is a good pizza-and-mouse game, meaning you can play one-handed due to the simplicity of the controls. It's a nice, calm, relaxing game, with stretches of tension and frustration. It's FtP, so there's limits on how much you can do in a 24 hour span, which kind of helps keeps me from seeing the limitations of the campaign missions. The skirmish missions are always different, but to clear a campaign, you must fight the same enemies on the same map. It has a difficulty spike in some areas. I love the visual design, and the music is an awesome combination of eight-bit and chill. Some of the collecting and trading aspects are difficult, as it isn't always easy to find someone who will buy what you want, even though it is extremely easy to buy items from others at the sub-ten tiers.  8.5/10.

												Graphics - 8/10 - Shockingly Stunning - The game has a lot of equipment that draws a different look here and there, and lots of outfits and pieces to deck you out... But there's a feel, something about the game manages to pull out a cartoony, fun, adventurous look that just makes you want to play more and explore despite it's instance system.Gameplay - 8/10* - Spectacular~! Note*: Simplistic at best, hack and slash, kite and run, reminds me of a MOBA but an adventurous and rpg'like form. Kinda lacks in a sense for auto-combos which isn't customizable (Assign'ed based on the item).Community - 5/10 - Lacking~!? The community is lacking; I try to communicate, ask for help and furthermore and rarely if anyone ever communicates.Customization - 8.25/10 - Just play and you'll understand, You can change nearly anything to really own your ""Spiral Knight"", however sometimes forced to wear certain items due to stat limitations. A lot of the custom pieces to add to equipments cost a penny, or hard to get. Colors are there, only thing I see lacking is patterns that can be added (They have patterns, but locked on specific items/labeled items).Replayability 7.25/10 - The game got me hooked pretty well, but some reason I cannot find a reason to come back. After playing 3 hours straight, and 2 more sessions of an hour and a half.. I stopped playing, I assume it's cause at one point or another it feels too ""Starter RPG-Game"" to me, but nonetheless it's a notable game and I'd recommend it to all ages of my family and friends.Overall 7.3/10- ""Great Game"" - I feel what dropped it's rating is the sole-fact it's so simple to pick up, it's so easy to play, and accomodates everything you'd expect in a RPG.. However, it lacks a open-world, the discovery factor; Or something else such as a unique system of any sort to bring something new to the table to truly ""Cling onto you"".However the game does what it's supposed too- Very fun as it does, and can drag you on for endless of time if you don't watch that timer.

												Very addictive game. First impressions were childish and ""why should you play it, whats the point?"".Second opinion were issues with the controls, which means sudden death. But you actually have an endgame nowadays. Somthing to aim for.I think you do have to pay for additional equipment slots to get all achievements, but I am not sure. Maybe you can get the upgrades during gameplay, but I havent seen that so far.Awesome soundtrack.2015-01-01			",6,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Spiral Knights is a throw back to old school action rpg platformers, and in my opinion is most similar to the Zelda franchise (Zelda 4 swords adventure in particular). The core gameplay is casual but also fun and addictive. The graphics, while certainly nothing to brag about, are more than adequate to provide a smooth gaming experience while not looking too outdated. The music is both melodic and reminiscent of the good old 8bit days. There are some minor lag problems due to the games use of UDP protocols and because of the limmited server size, however, the game is still in ongoing development and there's no reason to think these issues won't be rectified in the future. All in all I'd recommend Spiral Knights to anyone and give it a 4/5 rating.			",114,10,0,16,7,0,11

												So Spiral Knights... I played back in ye olde days before the steam release. For quite a while actually. months of playtime, possibly half a year. I went through the hell that was the CANT LOG IN phase in the game, stopping me from playing for a couple of weeks, which really killed me. That event seriously injured the game, and if I remember, wasa caused by some hacking over at Sega (but dont quote me on that). This little paragraph was just a backstory to what I've been through with this game, just to let you know that I LOVE this game, or atleast used to more than I do now, so the actual review is down below... One last thing, I have not played this game in over a year, but I've looked at the update logs and such, so I atleast know what's happened.Alright, the pros of this game. The gameplay itself is basic, but not mind-numbingly boring. You move around, attack, pick things up, dodge, etc. Better than most MMO's today, with all that clicking on something to blindly attack whatever bull. The art style of the game is quite nice. The soundtrack...boy, I REALLY like the soundtrack, one of my favorite things about this game. The community (in-game, why this is will be said later...) is probably one of the best things about this game. I made many in-game friends playing this game, some in particular were very nice and cool. And as I see in other reviews, Im not alone. The shop that drives the economy is the auction house, where you can put things up for crowns (currency). There are npc vendors, but I'll be honest, no one uses them, unless they have something unique.Alright, now the bad stuff, the stuff I really hate to see. In the old days of Spiral Knights, there was mist energy. It regenerated quite slowly up to a maximum of 100. Elevators in the game were used to continue on through the levels, but cost 10 energy to use. So that's basically 10 levels a day, maybe around 12 if you use it at specific times. Crystal energy is considered the premium currency in this game, since every f2p game ever has to have one. But on one fateful day, mist energy was removed, but elevators are now free to use. This was a very smart decision, I thought, except when the rest of the update was revealed. Originally, to craft things, pretty much the only way to get high tier gear, you used energy and materials dropped from enemies. You would also pick up heat for your gear, which is used to level it up and make it better. But then, they added Orbs of Alchmey and Fire Shards. Orbs weren't that awful for me, but only because the game requires you to have a certain level weapon in order to craft the next tier of weapon. With the new fire shards, you had to have a specific fire shard, and depending on the amount you used, would show a percentage that the heat level up would be succesful. So you had to have lady luck on your side unless you want to potentially waste all your crystals on one of 10 heat levels (the max). Basically, the game became a grindfest for orbs and shards (and I didnt mention that lower grade shards cant be combined to make bigger shards, but bigger shards can be smashed into smaller ones. BUT you had to have the recipe to do that, which was given to you when you completed the gear check once you had all the same tier gear. Ex: Full tier 4 gear check, you go through, you can now get tier 5 gear. You get a recipe for smashing tier 5 shards, the ones you need, for tier 4 shards, the ones you USED to need. The system is very broken, and I dont think its changed at all.)Before missions, there was the arcade, a place where gateways led to branches of levels, and players could influence which levels showed up in next weeks gates. This was were you went to actually PLAY the game. That always struck me as interesting. But when the missions came out, you could just skip all those levels and go straight to the boss levels, the main reason people were going down certain gates. Sure, it saved time and wasnt as much as a pain to get there, but missions literally KILLED the arcade. I dont see anyone there anymore, even though it still exists. I just feel it takes some exploration out of the game.But what about the crystals? Now they're used for feeding your pet, which you get through a line of missions. Everyone freaked out at this since every MMO must ALWAYS have pets. When they came out, you could choose a mini dragon that shoots fire, a phantom ghost that shot out caustic needles and could go invisible, and a cat. You know, just a  cat that flies around. Guess which one no one ever picked...(the cat). Thing is, once I got my pet, I used him some, leveled him up a bit, but I always forgot about him. I never used him as often as he was intended, even though when I did remember him, he did help some. Doesn't this show that we have come to not need pets? We played the game to work as a team of knights traversing through the unknown depths of an alien planet, cut off from the rest of our home. Now its more like pet simulator.And last but CERTAINLY not least, the new updates. I looked at over 30 update logs within the past year or so. All but about 2 had ACTUAL content. The rest of them were just adding limited time reskins of cosmetics, that cost money to get. This is just sad...  this isnt tf2.Ok, so I sound like I dont like this game right? Well, I dont like what its become. I liked it before, (except for the elevators becoming free, that was the best thing ever) where it was actually different from other games. Like I said, I love this game, and I hate to see it die like this.TL;DR (because i'll be honest, this review is frickin long) The game is fun, enjoyable, and all around a cool experience, although its taken some turns for the worst. I wouldnt want to see this game die, since it seems to be bleeding out right now. But overall I give this game a 7/10, or if nostalgia is added to the equation, 8/10. This game is a fantastic f2p, and I recommend it to anyone who is willing to try it out. Do note that the bad things kick in later in the game. You can enjoy the game starting out up til then.Thank you for reading, and I hope you enjoy Spiral Knights.			",26,1,0,1,1,0,2

												This game is one of my very favourites. Essentially you are a Knight. With a sword, sheild and armour. And a gun and a bomb. This game is all about going through levels, trying to reach the centre of the planet, and as you do, the enemies become harder to beat and the levels take more skill and better geat to survive. There are some reused levels but that makes it feel familiar and it makes it easier to navigate. (though there would be different enemies and in different places) This game also has some puzzle elements too. there is also a PvP mode called Lockdown, which is fun, but I personally don't like it, as you have to have really good geat to even stand a chance. There is another PvP mode called Blast Network, which is just like bomberman and doesn't require good gear or weapons, as it doesn't affect gameplay. There is a bunch of character customization and HEAPS of weapons and armour, and a bunch of other stuff I couldn't think of straight off the top of my head... so give it a go!			",14,1,0,0,0,0,0

												Before we begin, I have a bunch more hours into this game, but just played off of steam. (400-something)Bragging about my low amount of hours ingame aside, this game is kind of like TF2. Not in the sense of gameplay, but in the sense of new content. That is, there isn't much new stuff happening. The last new weapons were added in 2014. Since the players control energy prices, energy has gone up to around 11K crowns, which is very difficult for newer players to obtain. Heck, the original developers of the game aren't even there anymore. That being said, I sincerely enjoy and recommend this game. Why? Read on...Graphics are good, especially for a 2011 700MB game.  The enemies are designed to have clearly choreographed attacks, not to make it easy, but so you can learn how to dodge, time, and intercept attacks. The enemies get harder the farther you go, so learning those moves early on can save you a bunch of sparks of life later on. The point is that this game isn't just a point-and-click fiesta, but has decent amount of skill involved. I have never encountered a cheater or hacker, and the community, in my biased opinion, is one of the better ones out there. Grinding is a large part of the game, but the arcade levels are random and always different. (Unless you replay the same one 6 times because the treasure vault is right th-oops) This grinding does take a long time, and if you go to the recipie vendor, and he doesn't have your recipie, tough luck. gotta do the levels again. But you obtain loot and shinies along the way, so at least you get those should your recipie not be there. Another thing this game has is character. The weapons are cool, there's a ton of different armors, shields, and weapons, AND HATS. The levels are fun, and not too repetitive, and finally finding that Sacred Grizzly Pathfinder helm recipie is... well, I don't know. I'm still looking for that one. :) But crafting weapons after finding the recipie and leveling it up makes you feel pretty good, and getting that new sprite perk is always cool.Remember how I said new content was slow? It is. not gonna lie. However, it has been inproving. Grey Havens, the new guys, have been doing a pretty good job fixing stuff and adding small new things into the game. (I spent far too many crowns at the Slime Casino) Now would be the time to try the game out rather than 2 years ago, in terms of content. They have yet to add new levels, or anything big to the game yet, but I think they're gonna do fine. Once you complete the campaign (which is fairly long, including required grinding for stuff) you still have guilds, acades, and more to do. In summary, Spiral Knights is a fun 3rd person MMO that's free to play, has a good community, and will certainly keep you busy for a while. While there isn't an incredible amount of new stuff to the game, it's slowly getting there, and Grey Havens does care about the game. AND THERE'S HATS! ",8,1,0,0,2,1,0

												Being a fan of RPG games, I started playing SK with an open mind.. when I started I wasn't too sure how much I would enjoy the gameplay, but after a while (and a few rank-ups and gear changes) I really started enjoying Spiral Knights.Based on a Micro-transaction income model, this Free-to-play RPG is exactly what is says. Free-To-Play.Meaning, you CAN play for free.. but a lot of the beginning grind can be removed with a few small purchases of the ingame ""Energy"", which can help you develop your gear faster and start earning more of the ingame currency, ""Crowns"".Saying that, the game CAN be completely Free-to-Play if you choose. Be prepaired to run some of the lower levels quite a lot as you try and rank your gear up.I would recommend researching different types of weapons and armor in the game. At the beginning you are provided a large variety of weapons via Missions, which reflect the different weapon types, and different variations of each weapon (Swords, Guns and Bombs).-Pro's:Easy going, Fun, and the community is generally very friendly.-Con's:can take a little while to get started, and at the beginning earning Crowns can seem very difficult. this is all part of the learning curve of the game, and any necessary purchases in the game will correlate to the mission rewards that you get. If you don't waste your crowns when you start, then you will be fine... But it's very important to not waste crowns on useless things you do not need at the beginning.Overall, I have played SK for around 2 months now. I started playing standalone, and then switched my account to the Steam version. I managed to reach the highest rank, Vanguard, and STILL enjoy playing the game. That's a hard thing for a game to achieve in my eyes, and I believe they have been successful with this.			",88,11,1,17,5,0,24

												I, like many reviewers, played this game for the first time back in 2012, when updates were common, parties were full, and Mist Energy was a thing.  Due to various circumstances however, I stopped playing for quite some time.  It wasn't until recently that I got back into the game, and I haven't really gotten much farther in the story.As I mentioned in my review previously, I think battle sprites are a welcome addition, much like the removal of Crystal Energy.  The big points in my previous review still stand.However, that's not to say I don't have any issues with the game.  I think more levels and more weapons are necessary.  Perhaps a new weapon class?  No idea.  I am also of the opinion that Heat Crystals are a problem.  There are two solutions I can see.  Either drop them entirely, or at least make them more common.  My helm has been sitting at level 7 for at least a month of near-solid play.  I don't mind Alchemy Orbs, but Heat Crystals need some work.The game needs some tweaks, but it's still pretty good.  It's worth a try at least, and hey, it's free.  Why not?			",120,39,2,15,12,4,16

In this game you play as a knight taking on missions trying to recover lost valuables that have been lost when your ship had crashed. This game is an online game. Interact with others and make friends. Team up with people around the world or with your friends to take on missions. Level up your gear to take on harder levels.

												First off: This is honestly the best free-to-play game you will find on Steam.The graphics are intuitive and maintain the perfect balance between realism and cartoonishness. The community is incredibly nice and supportive (hello, Dota 2?) and the possibilities to play with others are endless.One of the best things about this game is that even if you replay a mission over and over again, the scenario and map you are put into is never the same. There's an infinite number of possible map layouts for every mission, and the missions always have something different that makes that certain mission special and unique. Another major plus is that it requires no grinding/farming to achieve the highest level, and even once you have the best gear and have completed all of the regular missions, there's still so much you can do. There's room to have up to three games on one account so you can always start anew, and if you really think you've accomplished everything there is to accomplish on one game, you can always delete it and start again, opening up another new world of possibilities and game-changing decisions to experiment with.Being a Youtuber (PeaceOfMined), the guild and party options are incredibly useful and fun to record on, especially with the voice-sync (although it is kind of slow). The armor and sword combinations are endless, and with the battle sprites and all the different skills and compositions in one party comes a feeling that you're playing the perfect blend of Spiral Knights and League of Legends, where you have all the abilities and attack possibilities of League, and along with it have the intuitive control system, open-world feeling, and extra attacking options of Spiral Knights, as well as the manual team composition and chatting system.One last thing is the addictiveness of the game itself. I'm a full time student as well as a musician, Youtuber and athlete. What you may notice is I seem to have more hours on record than would seem possible with a schedule like that. I agree. Spiral Knights is a very addicting game. If you have a steady job, be prepared to leave Spiral Knights for a week, as you won't like it one bit.Me: Mom can I take a short break from my homeworkMom: Sure you've been at it for three hoursMe: *opens Spiral Knights*Mom: (seven hours later) Are you done your homework yet?

												Before we begin, I have a bunch more hours into this game, but just played off of steam. (400-something)Bragging about my low amount of hours ingame aside, this game is kind of like TF2. Not in the sense of gameplay, but in the sense of new content. That is, there isn't much new stuff happening. The last new weapons were added in 2014. Since the players control energy prices, energy has gone up to around 11K crowns, which is very difficult for newer players to obtain. Heck, the original developers of the game aren't even there anymore. That being said, I sincerely enjoy and recommend this game. Why? Read on...Graphics are good, especially for a 2011 700MB game.  The enemies are designed to have clearly choreographed attacks, not to make it easy, but so you can learn how to dodge, time, and intercept attacks. The enemies get harder the farther you go, so learning those moves early on can save you a bunch of sparks of life later on. The point is that this game isn't just a point-and-click fiesta, but has decent amount of skill involved. I have never encountered a cheater or hacker, and the community, in my biased opinion, is one of the better ones out there. Grinding is a large part of the game, but the arcade levels are random and always different. (Unless you replay the same one 6 times because the treasure vault is right th-oops) This grinding does take a long time, and if you go to the recipie vendor, and he doesn't have your recipie, tough luck. gotta do the levels again. But you obtain loot and shinies along the way, so at least you get those should your recipie not be there. Another thing this game has is character. The weapons are cool, there's a ton of different armors, shields, and weapons, AND HATS. The levels are fun, and not too repetitive, and finally finding that Sacred Grizzly Pathfinder helm recipie is... well, I don't know. I'm still looking for that one. :) But crafting weapons after finding the recipie and leveling it up makes you feel pretty good, and getting that new sprite perk is always cool.Remember how I said new content was slow? It is. not gonna lie. However, it has been inproving. Grey Havens, the new guys, have been doing a pretty good job fixing stuff and adding small new things into the game. (I spent far too many crowns at the Slime Casino) Now would be the time to try the game out rather than 2 years ago, in terms of content. They have yet to add new levels, or anything big to the game yet, but I think they're gonna do fine. Once you complete the campaign (which is fairly long, including required grinding for stuff) you still have guilds, acades, and more to do. In summary, Spiral Knights is a fun 3rd person MMO that's free to play, has a good community, and will certainly keep you busy for a while. While there isn't an incredible amount of new stuff to the game, it's slowly getting there, and Grey Havens does care about the game. AND THERE'S HATS! ",8,1,0,0,2,1,0

												Love this game!It has pretty cool vibrant and almost surreal like scenery, the robot characters are also a different but fun aspect. Personally I really having the option of completing quests solo or with others and on different difficulties. The quests can be repetitive at times, yet there will always be something that will make them fun. Tutorials explain everything well and controls are really simple. If not for anything else, just check it out for the chubby little bird/chicken hybrids which are everywhere. Seriously, they're super cute. Would totally recommend this game to anyone!

												A hidden gem among the f2p genre. The unique graphics, great soundtracks, and the slash and hack combat system makes this a fun game alone or with friends. The only problems with the game is the fact that the game is literally never updated anymore after the lead developer Nick left the team. Also, the endgame is horribly boring and the only thing left to do is to look prettier with costumes or go play PvP. The fun in the game is the journey to endgame, not reaching endgame. I highly reccommend to play the missions and arcade with friends otherwise it could get a bit boring.			",120,15,3,19,9,0,31

												If you are into MMOs, or are interested in getting into one, definitely give Spiral Knights a try.Many MMOs follow the same format, consisting of endless numbers of ""fetch"" or ""collect"" quests, where all you do is grind against monsters, hoping that they will drop the item you need progressively more ridiculous amounts of.In Spiral Knights, there actually is a good amount of variety in the available missions. The story also provides a healthy amount of cutscenes if and text if you are looking for that. Missions typically involve you progressing through a dungeon littered with enemies and different types of square voxels of differing types (ex: wall voxel or explosive voxel). There are sometimes gates that require you to pick up a key (you cannot attack while carrying it) and bring it to the padlock in order to open it. You might also have to pick up a pot object and throw it at another object in order to clear obstacles, allowing for further access into a dungeon.The combat and controls are pretty easy to become familiar with. Left click to attack, right click to use your shield. Holding the attack down allows you to charge up your weapon (a gauge will appear). You may also use the mouse wheel to alternate between weapons. There is a dash/evade mechanic you can execute by holding shift and pressing right click. The dungeons can become fairly challenging if playing solo, however, it is still viable if you are careful and do not rush right into enemy spawns. The rewards from completing missions and item drops are reasonable. The loot automatically is attracted to your character like a magnet, so you do not need to click on dropped items.Aesthetics are nice, the dungeons and enemies are decently detailed. Like many MMOs, there can be a lot of clutter in the interface, especially when you first log into the game and access the game hub - you will need to get used to this orientation if you have not played many MMOs. The minimap can be expanded to cover the center of your screen by pressing B (do not press tab, that brings up the character stats/info panel), however, be advised that the border of the map is a bold blue, making it noticeably difficult to play while keeping the minimap expanded (compared to games like Path of Exile, or Diablo, where the minimap is translucent enough for you to see most things easily.Overall, the game seems pretty fleshed out, with quite a bit to do. Definitely recommend trying it out if you are interested and/or not already playing other MMOs  (or have the extra time to spare). ",250,88,0,51,38,2,49

												While this game has been recieved rathe negatively by the general public, if you like dodgy space shiz and an overall rather random experience, then this game is quite a good choice for you. I found that while the backstory was very well supported throughout the early game, it could have been used more frequently throughout the later parts of the game as the ""bosses"" of the tiers seemed to have little relevane to the game itself. So if you're a tickler for hardcore RPGs and intense storylines, maybe disregard this game as a viable option.However, the charming thing about Spiral Knights is the deep multiplayer capabilities. While there is a rather small 250 friend limit (which I easily capped within a few days), the ability to join a guild and ""chillax"" in your guild hall is rather fun part of this game. Personally, I am crap at the game's actual gameplay but continue to play it for the simple reason to connect with randoms across the globe.Overall, as a gamer I would rate this game a 2/10.However, as a human being I would give it an 8 for my love of the Spiral Knights community.

												A really fun FTP Zelda-like adventure game. While unfortunately the game only allows you to play 10 levels per day (each level costs 10 ""Energy"", and you have a max of 100 Free energy) the 10 levels is usually enough for a run of the Clockworks, and the difficulty level is placed just right - the game is difficult without being cheap (mostly), I honestly feel challenged as I go up to face the Jelly King with my party (2 3-star people, including myself, and 1 5-star person)Highly recommended, even if the game can be a serious cash grab at times.. although with how enjoyable it is, I'm considering pouring money into it myself.

												So apparently this game went down the drain in player count, heard it was better in legacy versions. Rewriting this!Pros:- Vast storyline full of surprises- Sci-fi themedCons:- Numbers are forbidden in character names.- No content updates for over a year- Devs are trying to feed us with prize boxes containing weapon reskins- Too damn big player subdivision- PvP is almost nonexistent- Progression almost impossible (I ended up forever at Knight rank)Conclusion is, this game is 90% dead. Give at least one more content update or everybody will leave. Remember that I played Puzzle Pirates when it was the best game,  now Steam stats show it is dead.			",27,8,1,1,1,1,6

												Long ago. 3 years ago, on Aug 27, 2011. I was but a young lad. young, naive, perhaps innocent. In the new world of Spiral Knights. Spiraling down a chasm of confusion and curiosity, I was finally brought up with a recommendation to Spiral Knights. Filled with swords, pistols, shields, parties, dungeons, and list of items The game Spiral knights(SK) from recollection memories during my first journey through it's dungeons and game-play nearly three years ago. Was enjoyable to say the least.If you for one second can imagine an down graphics to appeal to the ages of 7-13 then probably this game is for you. If your into friendship and co-op through dungeons facing monsters with your trusty pistol or sword and shield, then perhaps this game is for you. However, I digress. S.K. proved to be something that is beyond the average you normally see. Imagine yourself a kid, after the game boy era, the ps1 era, the xbox era, and you have an era of mmo games. Granted, mmo's have existed since probably before the age of 2001 with WoW at its center. The mmo S.K. is to be honest short lived game, pulling your slightest attention for the smallest of seconds through promotions with Team Fortress 2. Such was the case for me when I ashamedly downloaded this game for another TF2 hat promo from S.K. Enjoyable in the sense, that I alone played by myself seeking for riches and glory. I didn't expect much, and that is proven by my hours spent on this game. Later on, I played with my friends together in a typical fashion of dungeon crawling and killing bosses. I'd compare SK to Torchlight, however both games are entirely different and this review isn't about a comparison.It's about telling you my experience. As long as you have friends that back you up in this free to play game. You can literally have a good time. There is a grinding system, but only if you devote many of your efforts to getting the best equipment or the best item for you as soon as possible. Though, in my case. I tried to go for higher quality items, but found it too troublesome to do so. Instead I focused on having fun delving into dungeons with friends in co-op. Laughing so hard when we die because of a stupid mistake like getting stuck in a trap. Or perhaps giving cheers for everyone when we all completed an item set or finished a boss. If you like playing short-to-play games for free, and having fun with friends I would definetly reccomend this game for you.After-all it's not often a studio would go so far to diversify itself for Triple A-A-A games in a Free-2-Play manner. Or would they?(Original Post, Aug 27, 2011) Old score 7.29/10 (Re-edited Post Feb. 6, 2014) New score 7.3/10(Score is based off how much I enjoyed playing the game)			",131,16,2,17,6,0,22

												Love this game!It has pretty cool vibrant and almost surreal like scenery, the robot characters are also a different but fun aspect. Personally I really having the option of completing quests solo or with others and on different difficulties. The quests can be repetitive at times, yet there will always be something that will make them fun. Tutorials explain everything well and controls are really simple. If not for anything else, just check it out for the chubby little bird/chicken hybrids which are everywhere. Seriously, they're super cute. Would totally recommend this game to anyone!

												So apparently this game went down the drain in player count, heard it was better in legacy versions. Rewriting this!Pros:- Vast storyline full of surprises- Sci-fi themedCons:- Numbers are forbidden in character names.- No content updates for over a year- Devs are trying to feed us with prize boxes containing weapon reskins- Too damn big player subdivision- PvP is almost nonexistent- Progression almost impossible (I ended up forever at Knight rank)Conclusion is, this game is 90% dead. Give at least one more content update or everybody will leave. Remember that I played Puzzle Pirates when it was the best game,  now Steam stats show it is dead.			",27,8,1,1,1,1,6

It is in a better shape and a brighter future now that its in the hands of another company. Enjoy the game its fun and i hope this new company is great			",83,4,0,5,1,0,3

												Before we begin, I have a bunch more hours into this game, but just played off of steam. (400-something)Bragging about my low amount of hours ingame aside, this game is kind of like TF2. Not in the sense of gameplay, but in the sense of new content. That is, there isn't much new stuff happening. The last new weapons were added in 2014. Since the players control energy prices, energy has gone up to around 11K crowns, which is very difficult for newer players to obtain. Heck, the original developers of the game aren't even there anymore. That being said, I sincerely enjoy and recommend this game. Why? Read on...Graphics are good, especially for a 2011 700MB game.  The enemies are designed to have clearly choreographed attacks, not to make it easy, but so you can learn how to dodge, time, and intercept attacks. The enemies get harder the farther you go, so learning those moves early on can save you a bunch of sparks of life later on. The point is that this game isn't just a point-and-click fiesta, but has decent amount of skill involved. I have never encountered a cheater or hacker, and the community, in my biased opinion, is one of the better ones out there. Grinding is a large part of the game, but the arcade levels are random and always different. (Unless you replay the same one 6 times because the treasure vault is right th-oops) This grinding does take a long time, and if you go to the recipie vendor, and he doesn't have your recipie, tough luck. gotta do the levels again. But you obtain loot and shinies along the way, so at least you get those should your recipie not be there. Another thing this game has is character. The weapons are cool, there's a ton of different armors, shields, and weapons, AND HATS. The levels are fun, and not too repetitive, and finally finding that Sacred Grizzly Pathfinder helm recipie is... well, I don't know. I'm still looking for that one. :) But crafting weapons after finding the recipie and leveling it up makes you feel pretty good, and getting that new sprite perk is always cool.Remember how I said new content was slow? It is. not gonna lie. However, it has been inproving. Grey Havens, the new guys, have been doing a pretty good job fixing stuff and adding small new things into the game. (I spent far too many crowns at the Slime Casino) Now would be the time to try the game out rather than 2 years ago, in terms of content. They have yet to add new levels, or anything big to the game yet, but I think they're gonna do fine. Once you complete the campaign (which is fairly long, including required grinding for stuff) you still have guilds, acades, and more to do. In summary, Spiral Knights is a fun 3rd person MMO that's free to play, has a good community, and will certainly keep you busy for a while. While there isn't an incredible amount of new stuff to the game, it's slowly getting there, and Grey Havens does care about the game. AND THERE'S HATS! ",8,1,0,0,2,1,0

												This game is one of my very favourites. Essentially you are a Knight. With a sword, sheild and armour. And a gun and a bomb. This game is all about going through levels, trying to reach the centre of the planet, and as you do, the enemies become harder to beat and the levels take more skill and better geat to survive. There are some reused levels but that makes it feel familiar and it makes it easier to navigate. (though there would be different enemies and in different places) This game also has some puzzle elements too. there is also a PvP mode called Lockdown, which is fun, but I personally don't like it, as you have to have really good geat to even stand a chance. There is another PvP mode called Blast Network, which is just like bomberman and doesn't require good gear or weapons, as it doesn't affect gameplay. There is a bunch of character customization and HEAPS of weapons and armour, and a bunch of other stuff I couldn't think of straight off the top of my head... so give it a go!			",14,1,0,0,0,0,0

												Being a fan of RPG games, I started playing SK with an open mind.. when I started I wasn't too sure how much I would enjoy the gameplay, but after a while (and a few rank-ups and gear changes) I really started enjoying Spiral Knights.Based on a Micro-transaction income model, this Free-to-play RPG is exactly what is says. Free-To-Play.Meaning, you CAN play for free.. but a lot of the beginning grind can be removed with a few small purchases of the ingame ""Energy"", which can help you develop your gear faster and start earning more of the ingame currency, ""Crowns"".Saying that, the game CAN be completely Free-to-Play if you choose. Be prepaired to run some of the lower levels quite a lot as you try and rank your gear up.I would recommend researching different types of weapons and armor in the game. At the beginning you are provided a large variety of weapons via Missions, which reflect the different weapon types, and different variations of each weapon (Swords, Guns and Bombs).-Pro's:Easy going, Fun, and the community is generally very friendly.-Con's:can take a little while to get started, and at the beginning earning Crowns can seem very difficult. this is all part of the learning curve of the game, and any necessary purchases in the game will correlate to the mission rewards that you get. If you don't waste your crowns when you start, then you will be fine... But it's very important to not waste crowns on useless things you do not need at the beginning.Overall, I have played SK for around 2 months now. I started playing standalone, and then switched my account to the Steam version. I managed to reach the highest rank, Vanguard, and STILL enjoy playing the game. That's a hard thing for a game to achieve in my eyes, and I believe they have been successful with this.			",88,11,1,17,5,0,24

												what can i say about spiral knights, well when i first so this i thought it was some wierd adventure where you had to find kony and then slowly beat off his chocolate log but then when i pressed that play button in my library i felt a tingle in my balls that spread to my pens and as the intense high octane fueled game advanced into its latter stages my♥♥♥♥♥♥♥just grew and grew until it rivaleed that of a horse, now i must say having this is slightly wierd as normally its around 0.72 inches but then to grow to 18 inches well i was hit with surprise and awe that a game would make my rod that large so i thought ik lets find some random person and jack off of course this may be unexpected but so was my ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ for anyone who knows the black mamba they know a big load but myne was in comparison to that of the japanese tsunami i could feel it pulsating like death, afterwards my balls fell off and i got back to a 0.72 incher, of course the only logical explantion is that spiral knights is actually super viagra so anyone with a erectile dysfunction or a small one like me get it and be forever massive.

												A hidden gem among the f2p genre. The unique graphics, great soundtracks, and the slash and hack combat system makes this a fun game alone or with friends. The only problems with the game is the fact that the game is literally never updated anymore after the lead developer Nick left the team. Also, the endgame is horribly boring and the only thing left to do is to look prettier with costumes or go play PvP. The fun in the game is the journey to endgame, not reaching endgame. I highly reccommend to play the missions and arcade with friends otherwise it could get a bit boring.			",120,15,3,19,9,0,31

												First off: This is honestly the best free-to-play game you will find on Steam.The graphics are intuitive and maintain the perfect balance between realism and cartoonishness. The community is incredibly nice and supportive (hello, Dota 2?) and the possibilities to play with others are endless.One of the best things about this game is that even if you replay a mission over and over again, the scenario and map you are put into is never the same. There's an infinite number of possible map layouts for every mission, and the missions always have something different that makes that certain mission special and unique. Another major plus is that it requires no grinding/farming to achieve the highest level, and even once you have the best gear and have completed all of the regular missions, there's still so much you can do. There's room to have up to three games on one account so you can always start anew, and if you really think you've accomplished everything there is to accomplish on one game, you can always delete it and start again, opening up another new world of possibilities and game-changing decisions to experiment with.Being a Youtuber (PeaceOfMined), the guild and party options are incredibly useful and fun to record on, especially with the voice-sync (although it is kind of slow). The armor and sword combinations are endless, and with the battle sprites and all the different skills and compositions in one party comes a feeling that you're playing the perfect blend of Spiral Knights and League of Legends, where you have all the abilities and attack possibilities of League, and along with it have the intuitive control system, open-world feeling, and extra attacking options of Spiral Knights, as well as the manual team composition and chatting system.One last thing is the addictiveness of the game itself. I'm a full time student as well as a musician, Youtuber and athlete. What you may notice is I seem to have more hours on record than would seem possible with a schedule like that. I agree. Spiral Knights is a very addicting game. If you have a steady job, be prepared to leave Spiral Knights for a week, as you won't like it one bit.Me: Mom can I take a short break from my homeworkMom: Sure you've been at it for three hoursMe: *opens Spiral Knights*Mom: (seven hours later) Are you done your homework yet?

												I love this game. I really do. I've called it 4-swords the mmorpg, because that's what the gameplay feels like. The variety of weapons is fun, and I like how your character doesn't level up- it's all in the gear. The visuals are beautiful and it's not the dreaded ""standard fantasy world"" setting that so many mmorpgs fall into. the music, too, is fun, and the game presents a decent challenge.However, this game has gone downhill. The grind for items is downright awful, and the economy is tanking fast. The playbase is dwindling, and the devs clearly do not care about this game anymore. I wish it was different, because this game was so fantastic and so fun, but the extreme amounts of grinding on repetitive levels has killed all the fun. With a heavy heart I cannot recommend this game.			",129,12,2,16,8,2,16

												This game is the first one to get me hooked on for more than 100 hours. It's a very fun Action RPG to play with your friends, with various elements reminiscent of the The Legend of Zelda series, it has a huge variety of gear and equipment. The downfall is that it's rather become some sort of Pay-2-Win because the requirements to create or upgrade stuff is huge, but you can literally get almost everything for free if you are willing to take your time.8/110 would get 1HKO'd by sanic in Lockdown again			",58,15,1,11,3,1,2

In this game you play as a knight taking on missions trying to recover lost valuables that have been lost when your ship had crashed. This game is an online game. Interact with others and make friends. Team up with people around the world or with your friends to take on missions. Level up your gear to take on harder levels. This game does not demand high system requirements to run. Overall a fun and interesting game to play.			",18,1,1,0,2,0,0

												Oh, this game...Spiral Knights is probably one of the biggest reasons for me sticking around on Steam, or at least venturing out to try new games. I've met so many great friends over the years, and while I havent played much at all in a while, since sadly the game is slowly dying, I still am so glad for all the time and money I put into it. The game starts off very cheerful and fun, and later gets much more dark and serious with the story (which sadly isn't finished. On another note, this game also inspired me to write a story about my own knight).Now, as much as the game has its flaws compared to newer, more popular MMO's, it's still my favorite and I would recommend at least giving it a try. It has changed so much from the when it was first released, most of it for the better, and it can be a great way to find more friends, not to mention getting a hat in Team Fortress 2.All in all, I'd try giving the game a try, especially if you have time to kill and dont mind grinding			",138,13,2,10,5,1,14

												If you are into MMOs, or are interested in getting into one, definitely give Spiral Knights a try.Many MMOs follow the same format, consisting of endless numbers of ""fetch"" or ""collect"" quests, where all you do is grind against monsters, hoping that they will drop the item you need progressively more ridiculous amounts of.In Spiral Knights, there actually is a good amount of variety in the available missions. The story also provides a healthy amount of cutscenes if and text if you are looking for that. Missions typically involve you progressing through a dungeon littered with enemies and different types of square voxels of differing types (ex: wall voxel or explosive voxel). There are sometimes gates that require you to pick up a key (you cannot attack while carrying it) and bring it to the padlock in order to open it. You might also have to pick up a pot object and throw it at another object in order to clear obstacles, allowing for further access into a dungeon.The combat and controls are pretty easy to become familiar with. Left click to attack, right click to use your shield. Holding the attack down allows you to charge up your weapon (a gauge will appear). You may also use the mouse wheel to alternate between weapons. There is a dash/evade mechanic you can execute by holding shift and pressing right click. The dungeons can become fairly challenging if playing solo, however, it is still viable if you are careful and do not rush right into enemy spawns. The rewards from completing missions and item drops are reasonable. The loot automatically is attracted to your character like a magnet, so you do not need to click on dropped items.Aesthetics are nice, the dungeons and enemies are decently detailed. Like many MMOs, there can be a lot of clutter in the interface, especially when you first log into the game and access the game hub - you will need to get used to this orientation if you have not played many MMOs. The minimap can be expanded to cover the center of your screen by pressing B (do not press tab, that brings up the character stats/info panel), however, be advised that the border of the map is a bold blue, making it noticeably difficult to play while keeping the minimap expanded (compared to games like Path of Exile, or Diablo, where the minimap is translucent enough for you to see most things easily.Overall, the game seems pretty fleshed out, with quite a bit to do. Definitely recommend trying it out if you are interested and/or not already playing other MMOs  (or have the extra time to spare). ",250,88,0,51,38,2,49

												Spiral Knights is really fun as you're progressing through the mission system. The gameplay is nice, the controls are simple, and the stat system is understandable. Three Rings puts heavy emphasis on co-op play, and it is certainly far more fun with more people.Problem is, Three Rings updates the game slower than molasses going uphill in January with crutches. The only thing that can keep you hooked to the game is a desire(and the money) to do the Shadow Lairs, or a desire to play PvP and the money to be able to do buttshit in it. The only thing that can diversify equipment is a random Unique Variant system, and if you don't have the luck or money to get the best UVs, you might as well not play PvP at all.Still, Spiral Knights is amazing for a F2P. Just don't get overaddicted to it like I did, because once you hit the endgame, you'll be there with nothing to do for a month.			",125,16,1,17,9,0,22

The servers run pretty well, many people are playing, and the game is just all-round fun, Besides PvP. My only complaints are that some levels spring up in difficulty and that the spawnrate for orbs of alchemy is too low, It's super hard to get them. (besides missions)			",29,0,0,7,0,0,0

												Alright I'd like to begin this review with a reminder of how long I've played this game. 744 hours! Dang! So I've played this game from 2011 to like 2013 ish. The reason why I quit was because there's this natural barrier that prevents you from putting more hours into this game. What i mean by this is that when you reach to level 4 or 5 gear, there's going to be a TON i mean a TON of grinding. Like im talking about hours and hours of grinding. This basically deterred people from playing this game in general after that. For most people that reach this point just go striaght into PvP however i can say that the Pvp mechanics is great and all but there's no real incentive for poeple to pvp besides the fact that you get cosmetics or recipes for weapons you have to grind even more for.so to sum up:pros: good mechanics: pretty good graphics: good amount of weapon and armor choice: feels like a good rpgcons: :extremely repetitive: extremely time consuming: community is pretty much dead (<1000) : extremely grindy especically with the new system they implemented: updates are all just money grabbers, no real add ons to the game			",60,2,4,4,2,0,3

												Onco upon a time, I lved this game. it was fun, I spent lots of time in it, and I had fun. I started for the free hat, stayed because I liked it. Then the game got an overhual and pretty much went to pot. I think the nail in the coffin is the forge system. When a game manages to surpass Runescape for being overly grindy, you know you've done something wrong. This game has, for some reason, been taken off my library, but I can't be bothered to care or even take a peek back inside. All it takes is a quick search to see the game is going nowhere fast and will die off. Give it a try if you REALLY want to, at least for the free hat, but don't spend a dime here, it isn't worth it.			",153,28,0,22,15,2,17

												You're constantly fighting an uphill struggle in this game, this game had so much potential and only limited itself with the energy system. A lot of people feel like this is easily averted, it is, if you are willing to spend a lot of time either playing the Marketplace or crafting items to get the money in order to get more energy. Everything you do requires energy and that's a big flaw, it's like Farmville, you get many small doses of rewards backed by a refresh timer and it just interupts the flow of everything. Ultimately they want you to spend money to buy energy, or somehow grab enough cash to convert into energy which as I said, mostly requires playing the marketplace, and for those who want a clean way of accomplishment then tough luck! That being said, combat was fun and the dungeon crawling aspects were top notch, for the short while I played this game it was a blast, I loved the item system and I liked the fact that you made everything your own through dedication. still though.

												F2P co-op action-rpg that's fun and easy to play in short bursts, but quickly shows its shallow and repetitive nature. I really like that the battles are real-time, you can defend against or dodge enemy attacks and that player skill and knowledge of elemental strengths/weaknesses become vital later on. Your gear levels up instead of your character by acquiring heat from killing enemies.  It takes Crystal Energy ($) to level up gear among other things, so without a lot of grinding it's hard to stay F2P.  On the bright side the game recently made traveling on the elevators to and within dungeons free. End game has been the same for a long time.  Don't expect new content very frequently. Do expect promotional cash shop ""dress up"" crap to pop up all the time. All optional of course, but it just shows you it doesn't take long to suck the game's content dry when you can't find people to go on missions with you because they're all standing around town trying on their halos, wings and twinkly auras.

												Spiralknights is a really fun and addicting game.. for a few days.. then it just sits in you steam library taunting you. If any game could be criticised for microtransactions, its this one. And for a begginer is is really difficult to understand what to do. I stoped playing the story mode after the 10th mission and just played arcade mode until I got board of the game entirely. I don't recomend this game for long term fun. BUT its free, so go in play for a month then look back at my review and see how I was right!what's my final verdict?I don't know.. I can see how this game COULD have been a long term alternative to going outside, but it failed at keeping me engaged. I didn't care about the characters, the item crafting was confusing. I have to say NO.			",34,10,0,2,4,0,1

												Mostly finished.Public nowNow don't get me wrong, Spiral Knights USE to be a good game until they made it a real free to play. It is quite obvious that the developers wanted as much money as they could get, so they added Spark's of life, and those heat things that level up your weapons, and made the elevators free just to remove the good co-op in the game. (No shared coins, can't revive party members) God. Why. I actually enjoyed the co-op and even contributed to the game and bought things with money, that won't be happening anytime soon again, unless they fix this terrible new co-op, and new free to play feature)There are still *some* good things in the game, but it is beaten down by the new features. The art style is great, and well done. The fighting is fun, or use to be fun until they removed reviving. The weapons have their own up's and downs, balancing most out. Some things are set up nicely, but the new features do ruin them. There is an auction house to buy things that you want when you can't get them, but have the crowns to get them. That is really all I can think of.The bad features? Well all of the new features. The ""mini"" monsters. Those things are devils and will ALWAYS kill you. No reviving, little co-op. Coins aren't shared in levels anymore. Sparks of life which cost energy to buy. No more mist energy. Elevators are free, and addition that came with the new features, which means no more elevator passes (I liked the elevator pass system, changed the game into a non-free to play, but now it is a complete free to play, and you can't get out of it). New heat system where leveling up weapons requires crystals which cost money too. Gaining heat on your weapons was hard enough, and now there is a CHANCE for it to level up when you use crystals (Unless you use a load of them which costs even more money)?! The repetitive arena levels and the missions to get to new tiers are really useless. The old tier system was better where you would have to go through a group of levels, not boring missions, and have the correct armor and weapons.As an old player, I DO NOT recommend this game, it was hard enough before, and now they made it even HARDER.

												First of all when I started playing this game, it was fun. I met some great friends and have a few of them on Steam. The best moment I had is when I reached Vanguard. Now I really don't like this game anymore. I find it a waste of time. All you do in Spiral Knights is the same things everyday that players do. Players just do the same things everyday in this game. Play the same levels everyday. Grind for crowns, orbs, heat, materials everyday.Spiral Knights has lots of bugs and glitches. It really annoys me!!! Makes me so angry! How can an enemy hit you when you block like 1.5 seconds before getting hit. Such a glitch. Wheel Launchers, Trojan's attacks, Lumber's attack are the most glitchy. All the sprites abilities are bugged. Now the monsters on Prestige Missions, I find them OP. When you get hit you lose halve of your health if you have no Vitapods. I think that's ridiculous! The worst Prestige Mission is one with Devliites. Those are my worst monsters and you have to fight hordes of them and they are just too powerful.I'm also sick of Promo Boxes. It's a waste of money just to buy a costume for you knight.To level up your 5 star equipment all the way to level 10 is almost impossible without having to spent hours grinding for Radiants. Otherwise you can choose to buy with energy which is not worth the value. Let's say you are going to spent $10 for 3500 Energy. 50 Radiants cost 800 energy. In total you will get 200 Radiants with 300 energy left. How many times can you level up a 5 star equipment?  Like only 2 times after like level 7!! That's a real waste of money.The servers are poor as well and my Internet connection is fine. The lag is the worst thing in this game. While you are lagging you have no idea what's going on. You see you knight standing but the others are running out of the map. Next moment, DEAD!!! The players also complain at you for not moving or fighting but you are lagging so it's can't be your fault. The worst lag in this game is during a Vana run.Winterfest is a nice event but the missions.... the missions lag sooo badly. It almost impossible to do them.The community in this game is okay but meanful as well. They would only be meanful if you don't do anything but if you lagging, it's can't be your fault. Some players are very nice in this game but there a very few of them in this game. Here's somebody that was rude to me on the first minute of 2015 in my country time. Beezum: ""HAPPY NEW YEAR!!!! The other player: ""Shut up Beezum it's still 31st here!""Beezum: ""Don't tell me to shut up!""The other player: Don't act like a 5 years old!Beezum: It's 12am for me on 1st Jan 2015.Did he have to tell to shut up? NO!!!! That was so unnecessary and rude.The story has as well is also messed up. They still haven't opened the core. Will they ever open core? Probably never!Please never agree with players that say Spiral Knights is the best game ever! It's totally not. It only get like over 1,000 players in-game peak everyday. It's okay to only play the prestige missions everyday on SK or if you play the game once in a while but I don't do that. I would never recommend this game to any of my friends. It's a time waster and has to many bugs, glitches and has little content.			",22,1,0,0,3,1,7

												A rather nice F2P game, you'll find the beginning kinda hard and grind crowns takes a lot of time.Once you're 4-5 stars the fun starts with some really challenging missions.One of the bad point of the game is that once you finish the "" story mode "" and the DLC missions, you've nothing left to do.Well this game kept me entertained for more than 1k hours, so give it a shot, really.Also, why dont you stop releasing crates nobody cares about and add more stuff already ?

												I find it a lot of fun, though a bit of a grind-fest later on. You rely on rare drops and quest rewards to make higher-level equipment and equipment diversity can limit your progress. Do some forum reasearch.Good game now that you don't have to pay elevator/mission fees - all gameplay mechanics  are obtainable with a bit of classic rpg grinding.			",44,4,0,3,0,2,2

												Nah, this game used to have great quality, even now u'll find it entertaining in  the first 50 - 100, maybe 200 hours. The gameplay, art style, music, this game has it all. But there're many major problems, mostly from its developer:+ First, this game is very item-reliant. Items are also extremely unbalanced, u'll find details in other reviews.+ Soon the game will become quite repetitive, and it's not anything like Mario or Zelda.+ 2 years; if not more there wasn't a _single_ update.+ Any constructive comments will be ignored/banned/silenced. No matter how calm/polite you are. Their community managers are active, but they will just try to act cute.+ For matured gamers, this game has many cute kids. But that comes along with many arrogant, ill-mannered teenagers.+ And that's just to name a few.So in general, if u have good friends & are looking for a good co-op game to play once in a while, this one is for you. But if u look for something to stay with, then dont. Absolutely, dont.			",23,3,0,4,1,0,6

												I get the same response out of my friends about this game as I do with Runescape, it's stupid, it's like a cartoon, it's for kids. The same stupid comments and hate towards such a simple and artistic game. It plays like diablo and controls quite well when you try to move and shoot with your blaster. Enemies aren't too ahrd to run from and the AI isn't always brain dead. It is a fun and simple game that I think everyone should try. Good RPG 8/10			",204,10,0,15,5,2,12

												Mostly finished.Public nowNow don't get me wrong, Spiral Knights USE to be a good game until they made it a real free to play. It is quite obvious that the developers wanted as much money as they could get, so they added Spark's of life, and those heat things that level up your weapons, and made the elevators free just to remove the good co-op in the game. (No shared coins, can't revive party members) God. Why. I actually enjoyed the co-op and even contributed to the game and bought things with money, that won't be happening anytime soon again, unless they fix this terrible new co-op, and new free to play feature)There are still *some* good things in the game, but it is beaten down by the new features. The art style is great, and well done. The fighting is fun, or use to be fun until they removed reviving. The weapons have their own up's and downs, balancing most out. Some things are set up nicely, but the new features do ruin them. There is an auction house to buy things that you want when you can't get them, but have the crowns to get them. That is really all I can think of.The bad features? Well all of the new features. The ""mini"" monsters. Those things are devils and will ALWAYS kill you. No reviving, little co-op. Coins aren't shared in levels anymore. Sparks of life which cost energy to buy. No more mist energy. Elevators are free, and addition that came with the new features, which means no more elevator passes (I liked the elevator pass system, changed the game into a non-free to play, but now it is a complete free to play, and you can't get out of it). New heat system where leveling up weapons requires crystals which cost money too. Gaining heat on your weapons was hard enough, and now there is a CHANCE for it to level up when you use crystals (Unless you use a load of them which costs even more money)?! The repetitive arena levels and the missions to get to new tiers are really useless. The old tier system was better where you would have to go through a group of levels, not boring missions, and have the correct armor and weapons.As an old player, I DO NOT recommend this game, it was hard enough before, and now they made it even HARDER.

												First, I'd like to say that I've played 507 hours of this game[tinypic.com] in the downloadable client, so please don't take my 1.4 hours on record too seriously.The PVE gets boring and repetitive after a while, given that there are very few missions are worth doing save for advancing in the questline. However, it does last for some time(around a hundred hours) and for that bit is is a delightful experience. If that's all you're going to do, I suggest you play another game.The best part of this game is... dressup. I'm not going to lie. Development on this game for the most part has been centered on creating more and more costumes for players to use, and other things like PVE and general gameplay has been left behind. With that in mind, costumes are now cooler and better looking than ever, and surpass other aspects of this game. This opens up many opportunities for players. Here are some examples of costumes I've been using:1[i.imgsafe.org] 2[i.imgsafe.org]Another great part of this game is the social aspect. Players in this game are often kind, helpful, and interesting individuals. If you get in a large guild of any kind, you could treat this as a medium for general chatting and socializing.Maybe you're wondering what I did in those 400 hours that I didn't spend doing PVE. Well, I was trading. Trading is a fun experience, especially reselling. All of my equipment and costumes came from buying items(specifically 5* sprite food) at half of what it's worth and selling it at market price. I've spent days on end simply just zone chatting various different offers, and while eventually I got bored with it- it was wonderful while it lasted.All in all, I suggest you play this game. Don't let the negative reviews get to you, there is very little harm in trying out a free to play game.			",163,18,0,16,15,0,14

												If you have friends who are willing to play this game with you, then ignore this review and play the game.Although I only have very few hours on this game, be assured I had much more before I had steam and I downloaded this game from the internet. It's golden time was in the spring of 2013 when people really enjoyed spending all their mist energy (ancient version of crystal energy which charged throughout the day/night and was used for the elevators in the levels) and then going to haven to trade all their loot. In the summer of 2013 a big update came along which changed the UI and the supply depot (kozma used to sell cobalt-azure stuff instead of everything, very useful) and also introduced the mission system and the forge system. It also made trips to the clockworks free so mist energy was removed from the game. Although many players liked this, most didn't because it meant the game had lost it bare-bones feel by replacing it with missions and CE purchases and grinding which ruined the game. Before this massive update, when starting the game you had to customize your character, do the basic tutorial and cross the chasm into haven, from there you were left to explore the rest of the game with the help of those who already knew. After the update, missions led to the trashy lore with razwog and other crappy characters as opposed to finding out yourself. The missions meant that visiting the clockworks was child's play and took away the dark souls difficulty to getting recon modules and finding out about what the game was about. Before the update, to buy exclusive and special items, you had to either find them yourself from boss tokens or trade at the AH for them, afterwards you could buy them more expensively from the supply depot with used to be home to the azure tree which was only available from kozma and the AH. AH prices boomed and became unpopular due to the supply depot, people could find and beat bosses by using the missions which eventually led to the tier system being demolished (the tier system was a system in the clockworks which prevented new players from farming too much and meant that it was at least possible for the tier 3 player to be able to spend his mist energy on the levels they want to farm). The forge system meant players had to constantly grind and forage the clockworks for pointless rocks which level up items, which led to players getting fed up and buying it for real money as opposed to just looting the clockworks the hard way and levelling up your items as you went along, which meant it was easier to build and buy new items. Lockdown and Bomber was introduced which was pretty pointless except for guildwars and general showing off items, after the clockworks were deemed unusable, people turned to lockdown and bomber which now is 99.99% of the game. The devs gave up after half the community left by the end of the year. No new items were introduced anymore, just the same old specials being rerun after that. Also, pointless costumes being introduced. The lore was ruined, the bare-bones feel was taken away, people didn't need or want to trade anymore and PVP was the only way out. People who couldn't keep up or wouldn't keep up decided to leave along with the devs who bailed on the game with the money they made. By mid 2014 there were only 10% of what used to be the amount of people playing. International servers were empty and 'active' guilds only had 2-3 players. The game as of the end of 2015 is now dead, there are only around 200 people playing at midday which is the peak of people online at the same time. For anyone new or old who doesn't have any friends willing to play SK along with them, leave this game alone, the devs killed it.			",47,7,3,6,4,1,4

												A while back I used to play it a lot. This was way before I even had a Steam account. Or maybe I just didn't play it on here. But after a few years, or maybe more, the game has lost what it used to be. Most negative reviews can explain it in detail, but what I am saying here is that many players who played the game before things like missions and pets knew how fun and exciting it actually used to be, as it wasn't about grinding or paying to get items, instead it was more about teamwork and parties going as deep into the dungeon as they could before dying or running out of energy.Sadly the game lost what it used to be, though it's music and art remains to be some of the best I ever had seen in games. If it ever were to be revived in another game, hopefully they would be able to get the original developer working on it again, as if I recall he is what made the whole game feel magical.

If your computer dont crash, The game will. I Dont reccomend this game due to the issue but all in all im sure it would be a great game IF and WHEN the bug was fixed, So in conclusion, The bug is the only issue with the game being unplayable.

												Installed it. Played for 10 hours in one sitting. GG.It's a really addicting arpg/hack n slash. If you're a fan of those genres, install the game. Yes, it's reptetitive, but it makes up for it in the battles(in my opinion). It's fun to block, dodge and kite enemies around on the harder levels. The art is really amazing, and the variety of gear I've seen so far is awesome. If you're not a huge fan of mmos then you can play this game entirely solo or you can open your instances to public groups. Overall a very fun game that I can't wait to play more of!

												Now, I don't usually write reviews for games, I stick to playing them. But this game is just way too good to not review it. Keep in mind that this is my first review and if you see something out of place, just ignore it.Now then. I was always a fan of dungeon crawler games, games such as Dungeon Hunter (for the iPad). This game fits very well into this category. Most dungeons are desigened beautifully, and the Boss battles at the end are innovative and fit well with the theme of this game. Most items can also be acquired without spending too much money, and each item has it's own uses, strengths, and weaknesses Though I still love the bombs. The story line of the game is also well thought out and extremely detailed. If you haven't played this game, and you should, for your sake the spoilers of the storyline are going to be set as spoiler text. You can mouse over it if you wish to read what it says. The games story starts off by telling you that you are stranded on an alien planet with new fauna and flora, and immediatley throws you into a tutorial. Now, I don't know about you but I LOVE when the tutorial and the story get mixed together. Any how I am going to stop talking about the stroy since it is best if you experience it for yourself.The games weapons are plentiful, and are again, well designed and innovative. You can upgrade your weapons as well, in a way similar to Dungeon Hunter 5. I am going to finish by saying this game is beautiful, and I see a lot of other reviews talking about it using promos to keep alive, and such. The game has a huge fanbase, and even though it is doing that, it is still worth playing. People are saying money needs to be spent because it is a pay to win game. Not really. Most of the items are available without paying. I definetly recommend this game, especially to fans of the dungeon crawler genre. Thank you for reading my review.			",53,11,0,6,12,0,3

												Game summary:-you don't level up, your gear do from 1 to 5 stars, after investing stuff to transform it :)-all your gear means a helm, an armor, a weapon (but can carry up to 4), a shield, 2 trinkets and a pet with a collar. In your stash you can have more armors, helms, etc  :)-you start from surface and via elevators you go underground levels (very small areas, like 3 minutes of walking from edge to edge). ""Highest"" depth was 29 last time I played. That is the end. Then you go out and go again same route or another to earn extra money or just because you are too bored and there is nothing else to do  :)-it has missions. You can redo most of them, meaning clearing some depths again.-very fast your gear will be at maximum level. Then you can gamble your in game money (that can be obtained also with real life cash) to get extra options on your gear, like poison defense low, medium, etc, or maximum - meaning better than smaller versions but still not too much :)   This fun part translates into playing the deepest levels again and again and again untill you have enough money to gamble thirth option on a item. Then you do it again and again and again, becauselast time was a rubbish option and you gamble again to replace it hoping for a maximum :)-after a while, even gambling for options is over, when you did the deepest missions so many times that you know where to wait every monster before it spawns. All your party members, friends and guild mates are also in same situation. Now it's time for the cosmetic investments :) A moustache or a pair of glasses, or maybe a feather or an antenna. You may do this earlyer, investing your money in a glowing necklace instead of a better armor. This way you look cooler while you lie dead on your back  :)-OK, now you have everything. Er... well... you do some more runs from top to deepest level. You earn money... Then... you sell some materials..for more money :). Sometimes devs invent new accesories. They drop from boxes that can be buyed with real money. If you buy the box and drops something you don't like you can sell it in auction for in game money. This way other players can have the thrilling experience of wearing a pipe with a brand new yellow, unlike the green, grey and brown that existed before the summer promotion :)-You start the game. Hm... Nothing new, except the guild leader message to donate more money to the guild to pay rent for guild rooms :)   Your trinket and weapon slots expired, but you buy them again for 1 month each. You do a run with 2 beginners to help them untill they abandon the run and leave you alone at depth 4 :). You try to join a party at biggest boss: Vana, that drops the most expensive tokens. Here you can show off how good is your gear and how impressive you refined your devastating skills. Hi hi :)  Except you can hardly find anyone playing anymore... what happened to the guys?-You start the game... Same old guild message... No guildies online... 1/86 friends online... What to do now? You look at auction, but you have everything. You are bored of all the missions and all levels that you know like the back of your hand. Maybe you do one for old times sake.  It used to be fun before. Exit game disapointed.-Start game. Look around. Do nothing for 5 minutes, because there is nothing to do. You are too bored of killing the same wolfs or zombies that you killed tousands of times. Exit game after 10 minutes withot doing anything.-Start the game... Look around few minutes... Nothing there... Hm... Hm... Exit game. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I recommend this game for the following reasons:Positive:-Great range of monsters to fight.-Difficulty settings are good to re-do missions.-The speed and graphics of the game run smoother than I thought.-Gives you a broad and unique selection when picking your character.-You can create multiple characters (this helps when your bored with your previous ones)-Love the friend system. So easy to go to friends instead of complicatedly finding them.Negative:-Crashing at some points, sometimes when completing a floor on a dungeon and when I click to choose the reward it crashes.-The community isn't the greatest for me. I know this isn't a problem with the game itself, but the community DOES lack in kindness.-Not a good range of weapons in the store. All they do is improve on the weapons that you get on a level (e.g, the Zapper. in the store there is 2 other versions of it and both give more impact on 'Shocking' the enemy. This doesn't really cut it's deal with the money.) When I was new to the game I payed £6.99 for a gun that A. I can't use until rank 8-1 and B. Doesn't do anything different.-Make it clearer about the ranking when buying things from the store. Possibly restrict people from buying the guns or swords etc. until they reach the rank, a warning on the top isn't good enough.In the end, I do recommend this game. Even though I wasted some money, it's a good game to just play with your friends. Not many games have the friending and party systems, love the uniqueness of this game.~Demonic ",46,4,1,2,1,2,2

												Spiral Knights is a extremly fun 3rd person Hack and Slash game where you play as a race of Cyborgs that Crash on a distant planet. The story like isnt the best but it makes it back up with a amzing Art Design, great soundtrack and a Perfect multiplayer. The players are great and up to this point i havent found any bugs.The Friend sytem really makes it easy to just hop in a mission with your friends and take down to baddies.The monsters in this game are amazing and gives you a wide range of diffrent thingys to battle. One thing i love is your Sprite, the Battle Sprite is a small creature you gain what help fight of monsters, the Sprites all have diffrent powers and help in diffrent ways. You can not olny level up your sprite though, they are loads of cool loot you gain through out the game what really make you character strong, sneaky, fast or even magic. You can go to the auction house and sell or buy gear for great prices.While i am on about prices the game is 100% free to play, yes you can buy this thingy called Energy but there is ways of using in game cash to buy i to so you will never need to fork cash out. The one downfall out the game is that at nearly every point in this game you will be reading a peice of text, one thing i think they should add is voices so we dont need to click through pages upon pages of text.So over all i will rate this game 7/10 becuase there is a few things they need to fix but i really enjoy the missions within the game.

By running though the clockworks and creating new armour you can experience an all round great game that is playable for all ages. The game is constantly updating with new fun things to do, so even after 700+ hours you won't get bored. Not to mention that it is free to play. So what's there to lose by trying it out?

												I still recommend this game, although I enjoyed the older versions much more.This game was once a unique masterpiece.  Everything just worked.  The prices, the balance, and especially the content.  Then the updates got worse.Buggy, hardly-tested updates were released, one after another, each one taking away from this game's uniqueness.  For example, just about every monster in the game has been ""nerfed"" to oblivion.  Fighting the monsters was once a challenge.  You could expect that construct to turn to face you when he attacked.  Instead, watch as he swings at the air and accomplishes nothing.  Nowadays, the only challenge is avoiding the hazards that the latency loves driving you into.The economy.  Originally, the energy prices were decent.  Then, they spiked up to ridiculous prices.  Once this game was brought to steam, the prices basically reset.  Then, the prices slowly began to increase past the once thought to be insane price.  Updates increased and decreased the prices, but one idea sure did it.  Flash sales on accessories which do nothing except make you look shinier spiked the prices past the ten thousand mark.  Now, the prices just go as they please, usually always too high for players just starting to accomplish anything.  While energy isn't as crucial as before, it's still worth mentioning the economy.And finally, the game's content itself.  What was once a beautiful, unique work of art became a shadow of it's former self.I'll start on the UI.  The old one was perfection.  It fitted the classic style of this game, and along with most of the glory in this game, was laid to rest.  In the year or so I've played after the GUI update, I can say I still never figured out most of it.  While the new UI wasn't popular, it still made it into the game, and remains to this day.As I mentioned earlier, each type of monster had the difficulty toned down on them.  This made the game itself a lot less challenging, taking some of the fun out of it.A lot of of updates were simply promotions at this point.  Costumes and accessories which had no effect on gameplay could be obtained through boxes the player had to buy.Not too long after this, the game basically changed entirely.  While the new UI stayed, the crafting system received a complete overhaul.  Energy wasn't the main component in actual gameplay anymore.  Elevators were free.  Crafting advanced gear was free.  The game was free.  While it was always ""free-to-play"", Spiral Knights had run mostly on energy before this, and new players wouldn't be able to accomplish much at the very start.  Now, new players could progress.  This was a step in the right direction.Some new updates showed up, including some eerie content, and a festive Holiday update.  An update geared toward gunners is also still in the works.Despite all of the bad things I have said, this game isn't bad.  It's just terrible compared to the old days, and I'll always try to remember Spiral Knights for how it once was.  A treasure.  A unique land of fun.A legend. ",91,6,2,4,7,2,3

												While the game itself is not bad, the distribution model is terrible. In essence, it is a pay-for-time model. Some 'free time' is given per day, but make no mistake, this game is anything but free and with enough time spent on it, you will feel the crunch of the system.			",141,22,2,22,11,0,22

												First, I'd like to say that I've played 507 hours of this game[tinypic.com] in the downloadable client, so please don't take my 1.4 hours on record too seriously.The PVE gets boring and repetitive after a while, given that there are very few missions are worth doing save for advancing in the questline. However, it does last for some time(around a hundred hours) and for that bit is is a delightful experience. If that's all you're going to do, I suggest you play another game.The best part of this game is... dressup. I'm not going to lie. Development on this game for the most part has been centered on creating more and more costumes for players to use, and other things like PVE and general gameplay has been left behind. With that in mind, costumes are now cooler and better looking than ever, and surpass other aspects of this game. This opens up many opportunities for players. Here are some examples of costumes I've been using:1[i.imgsafe.org] 2[i.imgsafe.org]Another great part of this game is the social aspect. Players in this game are often kind, helpful, and interesting individuals. If you get in a large guild of any kind, you could treat this as a medium for general chatting and socializing.Maybe you're wondering what I did in those 400 hours that I didn't spend doing PVE. Well, I was trading. Trading is a fun experience, especially reselling. All of my equipment and costumes came from buying items(specifically 5* sprite food) at half of what it's worth and selling it at market price. I've spent days on end simply just zone chatting various different offers, and while eventually I got bored with it- it was wonderful while it lasted.All in all, I suggest you play this game. Don't let the negative reviews get to you, there is very little harm in trying out a free to play game.			",163,18,0,16,15,0,14

												I find it a lot of fun, though a bit of a grind-fest later on. You rely on rare drops and quest rewards to make higher-level equipment and equipment diversity can limit your progress. Do some forum reasearch.Good game now that you don't have to pay elevator/mission fees - all gameplay mechanics  are obtainable with a bit of classic rpg grinding.			",44,4,0,3,0,2,2

												A delightful, free-to-play game that plays like a combination of Zelda mechanics and Gauntlet gameplay, settings allow for equal enjoyability of single player and multiplayer, and the game never really forces or heckles you for cash. It's very stylish and responsive, with a newly designed mission *every day*, alongside a mechanics-enforcing core Story Mode, and a randomizable Arcade Mode with shifting themes, a variety of settings that give a variety of objective strategies, and of course, is all about stylish customization. Masterfully brilliant, and accessible from casuals to masocore players (Elite difficulty is made with 4 competent players in mind, so playing through that with one? Doable, but good luck!)Some resources may seem obscured by currency barriers, but enough 'crowns' (the coins you collect in the level) can add up to enough, or you can usually get the resources themselves by playing Story Mode chapters. Very infectious soundtrack, as well. Just a pure delight, assuming you have a good broadband connection.			",323,31,3,34,8,1,13

												A fantastic game that once you have put time into, becomes very addictive. By running though the clockworks and creating new armour you can experience an all round great game that is playable for all ages. The game is constantly updating with new fun things to do, so even after 700+ hours you won't get bored. Not to mention that it is free to play. So what's there to lose by trying it out?

												I still recommend this game, although I enjoyed the older versions much more.This game was once a unique masterpiece.  Everything just worked.  The prices, the balance, and especially the content.  Then the updates got worse.Buggy, hardly-tested updates were released, one after another, each one taking away from this game's uniqueness.  For example, just about every monster in the game has been ""nerfed"" to oblivion.  Fighting the monsters was once a challenge.  You could expect that construct to turn to face you when he attacked.  Instead, watch as he swings at the air and accomplishes nothing.  Nowadays, the only challenge is avoiding the hazards that the latency loves driving you into.The economy.  Originally, the energy prices were decent.  Then, they spiked up to ridiculous prices.  Once this game was brought to steam, the prices basically reset.  Then, the prices slowly began to increase past the once thought to be insane price.  Updates increased and decreased the prices, but one idea sure did it.  Flash sales on accessories which do nothing except make you look shinier spiked the prices past the ten thousand mark.  Now, the prices just go as they please, usually always too high for players just starting to accomplish anything.  While energy isn't as crucial as before, it's still worth mentioning the economy.And finally, the game's content itself.  What was once a beautiful, unique work of art became a shadow of it's former self.I'll start on the UI.  The old one was perfection.  It fitted the classic style of this game, and along with most of the glory in this game, was laid to rest.  In the year or so I've played after the GUI update, I can say I still never figured out most of it.  While the new UI wasn't popular, it still made it into the game, and remains to this day.As I mentioned earlier, each type of monster had the difficulty toned down on them.  This made the game itself a lot less challenging, taking some of the fun out of it.A lot of of updates were simply promotions at this point.  Costumes and accessories which had no effect on gameplay could be obtained through boxes the player had to buy.Not too long after this, the game basically changed entirely.  While the new UI stayed, the crafting system received a complete overhaul.  Energy wasn't the main component in actual gameplay anymore.  Elevators were free.  Crafting advanced gear was free.  The game was free.  While it was always ""free-to-play"", Spiral Knights had run mostly on energy before this, and new players wouldn't be able to accomplish much at the very start.  Now, new players could progress.  This was a step in the right direction.Some new updates showed up, including some eerie content, and a festive Holiday update.  An update geared toward gunners is also still in the works.Despite all of the bad things I have said, this game isn't bad.  It's just terrible compared to the old days, and I'll always try to remember Spiral Knights for how it once was.  A treasure.  A unique land of fun.A legend. ",91,6,2,4,7,2,3

												If you have friends who are willing to play this game with you, then ignore this review and play the game.Although I only have very few hours on this game, be assured I had much more before I had steam and I downloaded this game from the internet. It's golden time was in the spring of 2013 when people really enjoyed spending all their mist energy (ancient version of crystal energy which charged throughout the day/night and was used for the elevators in the levels) and then going to haven to trade all their loot. In the summer of 2013 a big update came along which changed the UI and the supply depot (kozma used to sell cobalt-azure stuff instead of everything, very useful) and also introduced the mission system and the forge system. It also made trips to the clockworks free so mist energy was removed from the game. Although many players liked this, most didn't because it meant the game had lost it bare-bones feel by replacing it with missions and CE purchases and grinding which ruined the game. Before this massive update, when starting the game you had to customize your character, do the basic tutorial and cross the chasm into haven, from there you were left to explore the rest of the game with the help of those who already knew. After the update, missions led to the trashy lore with razwog and other crappy characters as opposed to finding out yourself. The missions meant that visiting the clockworks was child's play and took away the dark souls difficulty to getting recon modules and finding out about what the game was about. Before the update, to buy exclusive and special items, you had to either find them yourself from boss tokens or trade at the AH for them, afterwards you could buy them more expensively from the supply depot with used to be home to the azure tree which was only available from kozma and the AH. AH prices boomed and became unpopular due to the supply depot, people could find and beat bosses by using the missions which eventually led to the tier system being demolished (the tier system was a system in the clockworks which prevented new players from farming too much and meant that it was at least possible for the tier 3 player to be able to spend his mist energy on the levels they want to farm). The forge system meant players had to constantly grind and forage the clockworks for pointless rocks which level up items, which led to players getting fed up and buying it for real money as opposed to just looting the clockworks the hard way and levelling up your items as you went along, which meant it was easier to build and buy new items. Lockdown and Bomber was introduced which was pretty pointless except for guildwars and general showing off items, after the clockworks were deemed unusable, people turned to lockdown and bomber which now is 99.99% of the game. The devs gave up after half the community left by the end of the year. No new items were introduced anymore, just the same old specials being rerun after that. Also, pointless costumes being introduced. The lore was ruined, the bare-bones feel was taken away, people didn't need or want to trade anymore and PVP was the only way out. People who couldn't keep up or wouldn't keep up decided to leave along with the devs who bailed on the game with the money they made. By mid 2014 there were only 10% of what used to be the amount of people playing. International servers were empty and 'active' guilds only had 2-3 players. The game as of the end of 2015 is now dead, there are only around 200 people playing at midday which is the peak of people online at the same time. For anyone new or old who doesn't have any friends willing to play SK along with them, leave this game alone, the devs killed it.			",47,7,3,6,4,1,4

												A while back I used to play it a lot. This was way before I even had a Steam account. Or maybe I just didn't play it on here. But after a few years, or maybe more, the game has lost what it used to be. Most negative reviews can explain it in detail, but what I am saying here is that many players who played the game before things like missions and pets knew how fun and exciting it actually used to be, as it wasn't about grinding or paying to get items, instead it was more about teamwork and parties going as deep into the dungeon as they could before dying or running out of energy.Sadly the game lost what it used to be, though it's music and art remains to be some of the best I ever had seen in games. If it ever were to be revived in another game, hopefully they would be able to get the original developer working on it again, as if I recall he is what made the whole game feel magical.

												If you have friends who are willing to play this game with you, then ignore this review and play the game.Although I only have very few hours on this game, be assured I had much more before I had steam and I downloaded this game from the internet. It's golden time was in the spring of 2013 when people really enjoyed spending all their mist energy (ancient version of crystal energy which charged throughout the day/night and was used for the elevators in the levels) and then going to haven to trade all their loot. In the summer of 2013 a big update came along which changed the UI and the supply depot (kozma used to sell cobalt-azure stuff instead of everything, very useful) and also introduced the mission system and the forge system. It also made trips to the clockworks free so mist energy was removed from the game. Although many players liked this, most didn't because it meant the game had lost it bare-bones feel by replacing it with missions and CE purchases and grinding which ruined the game. Before this massive update, when starting the game you had to customize your character, do the basic tutorial and cross the chasm into haven, from there you were left to explore the rest of the game with the help of those who already knew. After the update, missions led to the trashy lore with razwog and other crappy characters as opposed to finding out yourself. The missions meant that visiting the clockworks was child's play and took away the dark souls difficulty to getting recon modules and finding out about what the game was about. Before the update, to buy exclusive and special items, you had to either find them yourself from boss tokens or trade at the AH for them, afterwards you could buy them more expensively from the supply depot with used to be home to the azure tree which was only available from kozma and the AH. AH prices boomed and became unpopular due to the supply depot, people could find and beat bosses by using the missions which eventually led to the tier system being demolished (the tier system was a system in the clockworks which prevented new players from farming too much and meant that it was at least possible for the tier 3 player to be able to spend his mist energy on the levels they want to farm). The forge system meant players had to constantly grind and forage the clockworks for pointless rocks which level up items, which led to players getting fed up and buying it for real money as opposed to just looting the clockworks the hard way and levelling up your items as you went along, which meant it was easier to build and buy new items. Lockdown and Bomber was introduced which was pretty pointless except for guildwars and general showing off items, after the clockworks were deemed unusable, people turned to lockdown and bomber which now is 99.99% of the game. The devs gave up after half the community left by the end of the year. No new items were introduced anymore, just the same old specials being rerun after that. Also, pointless costumes being introduced. The lore was ruined, the bare-bones feel was taken away, people didn't need or want to trade anymore and PVP was the only way out. People who couldn't keep up or wouldn't keep up decided to leave along with the devs who bailed on the game with the money they made. By mid 2014 there were only 10% of what used to be the amount of people playing. International servers were empty and 'active' guilds only had 2-3 players. The game as of the end of 2015 is now dead, there are only around 200 people playing at midday which is the peak of people online at the same time. For anyone new or old who doesn't have any friends willing to play SK along with them, leave this game alone, the devs killed it.			",47,7,3,6,4,1,4

												A while back I used to play it a lot. This was way before I even had a Steam account. Or maybe I just didn't play it on here. But after a few years, or maybe more, the game has lost what it used to be. Most negative reviews can explain it in detail, but what I am saying here is that many players who played the game before things like missions and pets knew how fun and exciting it actually used to be, as it wasn't about grinding or paying to get items, instead it was more about teamwork and parties going as deep into the dungeon as they could before dying or running out of energy.Sadly the game lost what it used to be, though it's music and art remains to be some of the best I ever had seen in games. If it ever were to be revived in another game, hopefully they would be able to get the original developer working on it again, as if I recall he is what made the whole game feel magical.

												A delightful, free-to-play game that plays like a combination of Zelda mechanics and Gauntlet gameplay, settings allow for equal enjoyability of single player and multiplayer, and the game never really forces or heckles you for cash. It's very stylish and responsive, with a newly designed mission *every day*, alongside a mechanics-enforcing core Story Mode, and a randomizable Arcade Mode with shifting themes, a variety of settings that give a variety of objective strategies, and of course, is all about stylish customization. Masterfully brilliant, and accessible from casuals to masocore players (Elite difficulty is made with 4 competent players in mind, so playing through that with one? Doable, but good luck!)Some resources may seem obscured by currency barriers, but enough 'crowns' (the coins you collect in the level) can add up to enough, or you can usually get the resources themselves by playing Story Mode chapters. Very infectious soundtrack, as well. Just a pure delight, assuming you have a good broadband connection.			",323,31,3,34,8,1,13

												The game is fun and harmless until you get to about 3-4 star equipment then it becomes a massive grind, and if you have no one to do your rank missions with you it is very hard to solo them. The best gear you can get is only obtainable by buying the equivalent of 5 dollars worth of Energy to get a key which unlocks the Shadow Lairs. To level your equipment you have to gain a ridiculous amount of heat (exp) to level them and when you cap it the items heat you can't move to the next level of the equipment unless you get lucky with the RNG Fire system. Fire can be found by playing the game or you can buy 50 fire for real money... You basically pay to level up late game, it's ridiculous. (Unless of course you want to grind the same levels again and again.)Overall:It's a fun game to an extent, but it loses it's charm after countless grinds through arcade mode just to get to a boss and gain tokens or hope you get the correct material drops.

												Spiral Knights is a good game if you like this style of game. It has a wide variety of levels, enemies and challenge levels. It is great to play with friends or just other people who are online. There are some great features including tiered weaponry and armour, vendors to buy and sell your stuff for a set price, an auction house where players can sell and buy each others' stuff, guild groups and more. I really like how monsters and weapons are divided into groups so that each group of monster is weak to a certain group of weapons. You can play set 'rank missions', daily rotated 'prestige missions' or free-play style 'arcade missions'. Also has some good events and respective items that can sell for a lot outside of those events. However, do beware that this game can become quite addictive and a player often ends up 'grinding' for loot. this can take a lot of time and become rather frustrating and I think this is what turns most people off.Overall, I'd rate it a 7/10 because of these flaws mentioned that make you want to buy ingame currency.

												Firstly, I have clocked hundreds of hours in this game (many before I linked it to Steam), so please do not think I dislike this game for no reason.The biggest problem with the game is the lack of content. Once you reach the end of the missions it all becomes very stale and pointless. There are very few updates that actually add proper content outside of time limited events in the game. (There has been no actual permanent content in 2014 so far). Every 2 weeks or so they add in time limited grindy lockboxes that you pay real money for a CHANCE to get a cosmetic item. Most of these lockboxes are reskins of existing content ingame, but rarely new models are used that could have been proper content in the game. It is extremely grindy to level your gear, and all you need to know is that it uses a punishing P2W system, with high paywalls to craft your weapons and armor. You can craft gear without paying money, but it takes an extremely long time. You can convert the normal ingame currency (Crowns) for the currency you pay real money for (Crystal Energy, or CE). The game has a real time fluctuating economy, and the rates of conversion change from time to time. They intentionally pump the game full of lockboxes with reskinned content to make the rates of conversion very high. The game has barely changed since its release in 2011. The only thing that I like about this game now is the art style and mechanics.The game has PVP, and I do not recommend it at all. It is broken and the PVP community is incredibly toxic. The devs also never respond to anything on the forums and cannot take constructive criticism without victimizing themselves.			",40,6,0,6,2,0,0

												Very bad game, PVP is always terribly unbalanced even without massive waves of leaving players, often it ends in one full team of over leveled enemies vs 2-3 (or even one) noobs. Single/coop play is VERY repetive, all weapons and armors feel alike and social features are non-existant. Mechanics are very simple, laggs are quite a problem in coop. Less in PVP, but than again pvp is rarely a challange - either you loose terribly or you win without any effort. PLAYING THIS GAME EQUALS WASTE OF TIME (like no other).			",434,75,9,98,66,1,99

												The game is fun and harmless until you get to about 3-4 star equipment then it becomes a massive grind, and if you have no one to do your rank missions with you it is very hard to solo them. The best gear you can get is only obtainable by buying the equivalent of 5 dollars worth of Energy to get a key which unlocks the Shadow Lairs. To level your equipment you have to gain a ridiculous amount of heat (exp) to level them and when you cap it the items heat you can't move to the next level of the equipment unless you get lucky with the RNG Fire system. Fire can be found by playing the game or you can buy 50 fire for real money... You basically pay to level up late game, it's ridiculous. (Unless of course you want to grind the same levels again and again.)Overall:It's a fun game to an extent, but it loses it's charm after countless grinds through arcade mode just to get to a boss and gain tokens or hope you get the correct material drops.

												Spiral Knights is a good game if you like this style of game. It has a wide variety of levels, enemies and challenge levels. It is great to play with friends or just other people who are online. There are some great features including tiered weaponry and armour, vendors to buy and sell your stuff for a set price, an auction house where players can sell and buy each others' stuff, guild groups and more. I really like how monsters and weapons are divided into groups so that each group of monster is weak to a certain group of weapons. You can play set 'rank missions', daily rotated 'prestige missions' or free-play style 'arcade missions'. Also has some good events and respective items that can sell for a lot outside of those events. However, do beware that this game can become quite addictive and a player often ends up 'grinding' for loot. this can take a lot of time and become rather frustrating and I think this is what turns most people off.Overall, I'd rate it a 7/10 because of these flaws mentioned that make you want to buy ingame currency.

												This game is great. For an Ftp, it has lots of depth and you can get tons of gameplay hours out of it. If you ever get bored playing other games, it's really easy to get back into it which is a very noteable quality to the game. There are so many different types of weapons and armors to suit the way you like to play, and you can switch out different weapon types if you're just getting bored of your usual style.    I also love the soundtrack, especially the boss theme. The only big negative thing I have to say about the game is that at times it can be a little annoying to get money, and you may end up doing the same mission over and over just to get enough.  There are even prestige missions that change daily, as well as arcade missions where you won't need to stop the fun until you reach the core. (Which could take a very long time!) There are also 3 DLC quests that come in a bundle available on the steam store that give access to unique and otherwise unobtainable gear items. Go download SK, and get your free hours of fun!

												I don't even care about the story. Like others have mentioned, I see this as an arcade game through and through. In my opinion, the biggest replay value comes from the desire to upgrade your equipment but also expand your arsenal. And that's no easy task. In order to upgrade or forge equipment you need certain materials that could take days to find. Literal days. But there's a lot of satisfaction seeing how your 5 star equipment crushes enemies that once crushed you. And just generally playing the game is fun. I always feel it's a battle of tenacity, trying to see how long you can really survive. It's kind of fun being the last one alive in your party, desperately battling through enemies to avoid letting your friends down. And if you aren't the type to be motivated by upgrades, there's a lot of cosmetic stuff too you can buy with in-game currency. If you're willing to grind enough. I'd definitely recommend at least trying the game. It's free, I logged 100 hours easily, and it's a lot of fun.			",120,7,1,6,7,1,9

												I had an inventory tab for this game for quite a few years with seven items. It didn't bother me much until I hit the inventory limit lately and I couldn't find a way to get rid of it since the items weren't even tradable. Solution:1. Install the game again (I know, ew.)2. Remove all the knights you have (Right there after you download the updates. Yes, updates after a fresh install.)3. Remove the game from your account with the new feature (Support -> Remove product, etc.)The inventory tab disappeared along with the items.The review is negative because I remember the game as boring, tedious and not much of a challenge. In addition it left me with a burden of some untradable items that I couldn't get rid of without installing it again.			",472,84,15,82,94,5,103

												This game used to be amazing back in the day. Now? not so much. Here's why:The main reason is the incredibly laggy servers. Even in the EU server, the connections seem poor. Enemies and players alike will experience tons of rollback which will lead to some very cheap deaths from retracting spikes and the like. The lag makes swords basically useless as the long ending frames of the swing combos, coupled with the lag of the servers, will make you not shield in time and take a hit (possibly from several enemies at once), and trust me, many a Sparks of Life were lost because of this. Essentially this ends up forcing you to either only use the first swing of your sword's combo, which will neuter your damage output, or completely give up your sword altogether and just use the gun to deal damage while kiting enemies, which I have found to be the best strategy.The pets are cool and all, but mostly useless for the first few levels, and since I was already almost mid-game when they were added, I really don't use mine at all.At least they got rid of the Candy Crush-esque energy elevator system, I guess. Even though sometimes I find myself wishing I could go back to those days.			",84,4,6,7,4,2,5

												Oh Three Rings, where shall I begin with this game of yours...When I first played it, I enjoyed it immensely. I spent money on this game frequently, not because I wanted a certain item, but because I wanted them to develop it more, I wanted to help towards better graphics, new weapons and armour. I believed they could make this popular if they tried, but they didn't.Three Rings have fell victim to one of a game developer's top predators: laziness and greed. For the past year the only 'updates' are just recolours of existing items. There are no new, fresh levels or missions, no new weapons, no new armour, just a different colour of the item you already have. As you play through the game you'll first notice how repetitive the level designs are and eventually you get to the Vanguard rank (which isn't too hard to do if you're dedicated like I was) and you realize there's pretty much nothing for you to do anymore. No exclusive levels or missions for Vanguards, no nothing, the game sort of says ""Yeah, good job completing me. I guess you can go now"". You're stuck with prestige missions which, like everything else, are just repeated. Due to this and the lack of any sort of significant update (if you can even call them updates at this point), most players have quit. Three Rings have have caught on to this fact, they want to put as little effort into updates in an attempt to wring out any extra cash you have, or at least that's my only logical explaination.As it stands today, I'm severely dissapointed.

												The word gay arrived in English during the 12th century from Old French gai, most likely deriving ultimately from a Germanic source.[1] For most of its life in English, the word's primary meaning was ""joyful"", ""carefree"", ""bright and showy"", and the word was very commonly used with this meaning in speech and literature. For example, the optimistic 1890s are still often referred to as the Gay Nineties. The title of the 1938 French ballet Gaîté Parisienne (""Parisian Gaiety""), which became the 1941 Warner Brothers movie, The Gay Parisian,[7] also illustrates this connotation. It was apparently not until the 20th century that the word began to be used to mean specifically ""homosexual"", although it had earlier acquired sexual connotations.[1]The derived abstract noun gaiety remains largely free of sexual connotations, and has, in the past, been used in the names of places of entertainment; for example W.B. Yeats heard Oscar Wilde lecture at the Gaiety Theatre in Dublin.[8]SexualizationUsage statistics from English books, according to Google Ngram Viewer.The word may have started to acquire associations of immorality as early as the 14th century, and had certainly acquired them by the 17th.[1] By the late 17th century it had acquired the specific meaning of ""addicted to pleasures and dissipations"",[9] an extension of its primary meaning of ""carefree"" implying ""uninhibited by moral constraints."" A gay woman was a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, a gay man a womanizer and a gay house a brothel.[1]The use of gay to mean ""homosexual"" was in origin merely an extension of the word's sexualised connotation of ""carefree and uninhibited"", which implied a willingness to disregard conventional or respectable sexual mores. Such usage is documented as early as the 1920s, and there is evidence for it before the 20th century,[1] although it was initially more commonly used to imply heterosexually unconstrained lifestyles, as in the once-common phrase ""gay Lothario"",[10] or in the title of the book and film The Gay Falcon (1941), which concerns a womanizing detective whose first name is ""Gay."" Similarly, Gilbert and MacDermott's music hall song of the 1880s, ""Charlie Dilke Upset the Milk"" – ""Master Dilke upset the milk/When taking it home to Chelsea;/ The papers say that Charlie's gay/Rather a wilful wag!"" – referred to Sir Charles Dilke's alleged heterosexual impropriety.[11] Well into the mid 20th century a middle-aged bachelor could be described as ""gay"", indicating that he was unattached and therefore free, without any implication of homosexuality. This usage could apply to women too. The British comic strip Jane was first published in the 1930s and described the adventures of Jane Gay. Far from implying homosexuality, it referred to her free-wheeling lifestyle with plenty of boyfriends (while also punning on Lady Jane Grey).A passage from Gertrude Stein's Miss Furr & Miss Skeene (1922) is possibly the first traceable published use of the word to refer to a homosexual relationship. According to Linda Wagner-Martin (Favored Strangers: Gertrude Stein and her Family (1995)) the portrait, ""featured the sly repetition of the word gay, used with sexual intent for one of the first times in linguistic history,"" and Edmund Wilson (1951, quoted by James Mellow in Charmed Circle (1974)) agreed.[12] For example:They were ...gay, they learned little things that are things in being gay, ... they were quite regularly gay.—Gertrude Stein, 1922Through the mid 20th century, the term ""gay"" commonly referred to ""carefree"", as illustrated in the Astaire and Rogers film The Gay Divorcee. (See detailed discussion in article.)Bringing Up Baby (1938) was the first film to use the word gay in apparent reference to homosexuality. In a scene in which the Cary Grant character's clothes have been sent to the cleaners, he is forced to wear a woman’s feather-trimmed robe. When another character asks about his robe, he responds, ""Because I just went gay all of a sudden!"" Since this was a mainstream film at a time when the use of the word to refer to homosexuality would still be unfamiliar to most film-goers, the line can also be interpreted to mean ""I just decided to do something frivolous.""[13]The word continued to be used with the dominant meaning of ""carefree"", as evidenced by the title of The Gay Divorcee (1934), a musical film about a heterosexual couple.Shift to homosexualBy the mid-20th century, gay was well established in reference to hedonistic and uninhibited lifestyles[9] and its antonym straight, which had long had connotations of seriousness, respectability, and conventionality, had now acquired specific connotations of heterosexuality.[14] In the case of gay, other connotations of frivolousness and showiness in dress (""gay apparel"") led to association with camp and effeminacy. This association no doubt helped the gradual narrowing in scope of the term towards its current dominant meaning, which was at first confined to subcultures. Gay was the preferred term since other terms, such as queer, were felt to be derogatory.[15] Homosexual is perceived as excessively clinical,[16][17][18] since the sexual orientation now commonly referred to as ""homosexuality"" was at that time a mental illness diagnosis in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM).In mid-20th century Britain, where male homosexuality was illegal until the Sexual Offences Act 1967, to openly identify someone as homosexual was considered very offensive and an accusation of serious criminal activity. Additionally, none of the words describing any aspect of homosexuality were considered suitable for polite society. Consequently, a number of euphemisms were used to hint at suspected homosexuality. Examples include ""sporty"" girls and ""artistic"" boys,[19] all with the stress deliberately on the otherwise completely innocent adjective.The sixties marked the transition in the predominant meaning of the word gay from that of ""carefree"" to the current ""homosexual"".In the British comedy-drama film Light Up The Sky! (1960) directed by Lewis Gilbert about the antics of a British Army searchlight squad during World War II, there is a scene in the mess hut where the character played by Benny Hill proposes an after dinner toast. He begins, ""I'd lke to propose..."" at which point a fellow diner, played by Sidney Tafler, interjects ""Who to?"", suggesting a proposal of marriage. The Benny Hill character responds, ""Not to you for start, you ain't my type"". He then adds in mock doubt, ""Oh, I don't know, you're rather gay on the quiet.""By 1963, a new sense of the word gay was known well enough to be used by Albert Ellis in his book The Intelligent Woman's Guide to Man-Hunting. Similarly, Hubert Selby, Jr. in his 1964 novel Last Exit to Brooklyn, could write that a character ""took pride in being a homosexual by feeling intellectually and esthetically superior to those (especially women) who weren't gay...""[20] Later examples of the original meaning of the word being used in popular culture include the theme song to the 1960–1966 animated TV series The Flintstones, whereby viewers are assured that they will ""have a gay old time."" Similarly, the 1966 Herman's Hermits song ""No Milk Today"", which became a Top 10 hit in the UK and a Top 40 hit in the U.S. and included the lyric ""No milk today, it was not always so / The company was gay, we'd turn night into day.""[21] In June 1967, the headline of the review of the Beatles' Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band album in the British daily newspaper The Times stated, ""The Beatles revive hopes of progress in pop music with their gay new LP"".[22] Yet in the same year, The Kinks recorded ""David Watts"".[23] Ostensibly about schoolboy envy, the song also operated as an in-joke, as related in Jon Savage's ""The Kinks: The Official Biography"", because the song took its name from a homosexual promoter they'd encountered who'd had romantic designs on songwriter			",107,16,0,14,31,0,22

												The game is fun and harmless until you get to about 3-4 star equipment then it becomes a massive grind, and if you have no one to do your rank missions with you it is very hard to solo them. The best gear you can get is only obtainable by buying the equivalent of 5 dollars worth of Energy to get a key which unlocks the Shadow Lairs. To level your equipment you have to gain a ridiculous amount of heat (exp) to level them and when you cap it the items heat you can't move to the next level of the equipment unless you get lucky with the RNG Fire system. Fire can be found by playing the game or you can buy 50 fire for real money... You basically pay to level up late game, it's ridiculous. (Unless of course you want to grind the same levels again and again.)Overall:It's a fun game to an extent, but it loses it's charm after countless grinds through arcade mode just to get to a boss and gain tokens or hope you get the correct material drops.

												Spiral Knights is a good game if you like this style of game. It has a wide variety of levels, enemies and challenge levels. It is great to play with friends or just other people who are online. There are some great features including tiered weaponry and armour, vendors to buy and sell your stuff for a set price, an auction house where players can sell and buy each others' stuff, guild groups and more. I really like how monsters and weapons are divided into groups so that each group of monster is weak to a certain group of weapons. You can play set 'rank missions', daily rotated 'prestige missions' or free-play style 'arcade missions'. Also has some good events and respective items that can sell for a lot outside of those events. However, do beware that this game can become quite addictive and a player often ends up 'grinding' for loot. this can take a lot of time and become rather frustrating and I think this is what turns most people off.Overall, I'd rate it a 7/10 because of these flaws mentioned that make you want to buy ingame currency.

												Firstly, I have clocked hundreds of hours in this game (many before I linked it to Steam), so please do not think I dislike this game for no reason.The biggest problem with the game is the lack of content. Once you reach the end of the missions it all becomes very stale and pointless. There are very few updates that actually add proper content outside of time limited events in the game. (There has been no actual permanent content in 2014 so far). Every 2 weeks or so they add in time limited grindy lockboxes that you pay real money for a CHANCE to get a cosmetic item. Most of these lockboxes are reskins of existing content ingame, but rarely new models are used that could have been proper content in the game. It is extremely grindy to level your gear, and all you need to know is that it uses a punishing P2W system, with high paywalls to craft your weapons and armor. You can craft gear without paying money, but it takes an extremely long time. You can convert the normal ingame currency (Crowns) for the currency you pay real money for (Crystal Energy, or CE). The game has a real time fluctuating economy, and the rates of conversion change from time to time. They intentionally pump the game full of lockboxes with reskinned content to make the rates of conversion very high. The game has barely changed since its release in 2011. The only thing that I like about this game now is the art style and mechanics.The game has PVP, and I do not recommend it at all. It is broken and the PVP community is incredibly toxic. The devs also never respond to anything on the forums and cannot take constructive criticism without victimizing themselves.			",40,6,0,6,2,0,0

												Well my previous review on this game wasn't that satisfying so I made another one.I've never thought that I would have to rate this game AGAIN, but it turns out that I have to. Spiral Knight, you start of by making your character. Then you spawn in a garden (I think) and then you kill some ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s. Yeah thats the whole game. It's like a circle. Spawn --> Quest --> Kill. And that's the whole game, also you can craft some stuff that will help you only for the next battle and every time you craft them you lose money so it's like 1000 Crowns (Money in the game) for a gun (Level 2). Also where do you put the Crowns, in your player's♥♥♥♥♥♥Ok now let's talk for the players and how bad they are. The players in this game are just BAD. Communication = 0 because they are all just 7 - 9 years old. They always go for the kills they never protect you or anyone else.Customization is BAD you buy the same♥♥♥♥♥♥over and over.And also its like Dota 2. You see your player from 100 miles away :).And YES I played the game only for the TF2 hat.Also Please don't say ""OH, OH YOU RATE DOWN DIS GAME IMMA GONNA RATE DOWN YOUR REVIEW"" If I am right with what I said you should probably find this review helpful.I give this game a 2/10			",27,1,0,1,1,0,0

Spiral Knights is said to be dying since one of the lead developers quit, but it's still a fun game. There are a few bugs here and there, but the game itself is still completely functionable.

												I haven't been playing for a long time, I started in March 2016, but I'll give you guys the gist. Spiral Knights is said to be dying since one of the lead developers quit, but it's still a fun game. There are a few bugs here and there, but the game itself is still completely functionable. Like most communities, the SK community has the obnoxious, young teenage group, and the helpful bunch. Overall, it's an addicting game, but it can be frustrating sometimes.			",5,2,0,0,0,0,1

												When you look at the amount of hours I've spent on this game you might question why I don't recommend the game. Well, there is a plethora of reasons.1)PvE is absolute garbage in this game. There is pretty much no challenging content. Sure a mission might get you once or twice but once you know what's going on it's easy peasy from there. This hinders replayability value substantially. It wouldn't be a problem if the game had massive amounts of levels all of which payed out decently to be worth your time but no, it has one mission which must be done for money otherwise you're wasting your time. 2)Serious balance issues. Many weapons/armours are rubbish and completely avoided most of the time. Now you might be thinking that every mmo has tons of weapons which are rubbish and the good weapons are the rares which are difficult to obtain. Well you'd be thinking of a normal mmo. In this game there is no such thing as rarity as far as a weapon goes. Each weapon is obtained in the same way as another and it is not based on random drops, it is based on you crafting them. No luck involved either(unless you're aiming for variants, I'll touch on those later). So, why is the majority of the weapons/armours useless ? Cause the developers can't be arsed to fix them.3)Developer. The developer of this game is one of the absolute worst. They don't even put out updates or even reach out the community. All they do is put promos into the game(essentially cosmetic items you need to pay for) every 2 weeks which half the time actually end up breaking some of the game.4)This game has quite a lot of pay to win elements. It isn't really a big issue in PvP because it is largely based on skill there(and thank god) but there is still pay to win elements meaning you can theoretically buy gear which makes you quite a bit better than your enemy(can take more hits to kill you, faster attack speed etc) which should not be in a pvp game!5)Servers. This game has awful servers and that's coming from a guy who has single digit ping on the EU server and only double digit ping on the USA server. I'm not sure if it's the actual servers or the net code that the game has but either way, the game has some serious connectivity problems. I obviously don't expierence those(most of the time) but many, many others do. In fact this game is usually a battle of the ping rather than a real fight.6)Horrid optimisation. Based on Java, nuff said. There's many more reasons that this game just isn't worth your time while there are other games out there however if you do decide to play the game there is only a handful of things that this game is worth playing for.1)PvP. Even though it has many issues it is still a pretty fun PvP expierence. 2)Community. One of the best communities ever. Made so many friends in the game.3)Kind of gimmicky mechanics which can be interesting for a short while. 4)Actually good combat system unlike every mmo.---Reviewed by the best Spiral Knights player 2014-2015, rip Tempas.(just kidding, best one is Maiso, go ask him for tips on how to play lockdown!)

												This game started very good and ended up getting bad as i progressed in the game. I have good experiences but also a few bad ones which eventually made me quit spiral knights.I started playing together with a friend just to try it out but as we progressed i eventually came to the conclusion that it was a fun game so i got into it. During my plays i kept hitting several walls though. My first problem was the repetitive level design which started to look the same the more i played it. I dismissed that problem eventually in favor of the story line but my biggest problem was levelling the armor and weapons, the higher tier i get the harder it becomes to get the crafting materials thus more tempting it gets to purchase what items you need from the store with real money. You can't progress the storyline unless you level up your armor at least 5 times at set points in the story line.This means you either have to grind insane amounts of levels and trade a lot of it with others in order to get the amounts of ingame currency or do it the easy attractive way and convert real currency such as dollars pounds or euros at the ingame store to energy used to buy weapons and armor at prices which eventually equals the price of a full new retail price of a game if not more. The transaction options didn't sit very well with me either, You can either pay by credit card which is pretty normal here on steam for people aged 18 and over but here's the thing. You can pay by text message as well. Just give the ingame store your cellphone number and they send you a message, You agree and they make money from the message you send. What do all the kids walk around with these days? They all have cellphones that the parents gave them and that text message transaction option will make it very tempting for underage kids to make the mistake by going overboard with their cellhpone without the parent's consult. I'm not too fond of this kind of practises. I had much fun with this game and that won't be forgotten but the more i played the more downhill it went. I abandoned it when i reached the 4 star armor cap and i'm fine with it. The only thing i will miss is the helpful community that this game has. It saved my bacon more than once.Still, don't let all this discourage you from trying it out. This game is free to play and you can download this game for yourself whenever you like and form an opinion based on your own experiences. That is something i can recommend.I hope my info has been helpful to you.All the best!(s.i.e)			",171,41,1,15,21,2,17

												One of my alltime favorite games, Spiral Knights has been fun and addictive the moment I got it.I met some great friends in this game throughout years.What else is there to say about Spiral Knights other than pure greatness, but i think SK is slowly killing it self with the P2W(Pay to Win) element.What this game needs is more content to keep the current audience interested and to give the new players interesting story and gameplay.Pros:-A great MMORPG to start with-Even though the plot is hidden the game gives you some clue about what is going on which forms a rather interesting and somewhat dark story.-The overall friendly community.-It provides a tougher difficulty for more skilled players.-A mass variety of weapons,swords,equipment,armor... for you to choose.Cons:-Sometimes the levels feel the same and boring.-Minor bugs-Pay to Win which breaks the point of playing the game and gives a disadvantage to people that grind for resources.-Some times the game crashes for no aparent reason, not sure if its just my pc but it happends on my new one too.That was my review of Spiral Knights i hope you enjoy the game as much as i do.

												Big piece of hell, annoying to play.I have to wonder if a large scale Javascript-coded game was ever functionnal, because about everything in this hump act unbelievably odd, making it rather unfun and tedious.The main problem is that the game lags/stutters a lot, and I mean A LOT.  Not a constant lag, but instead everything loads during gameplay (I could safely guess that's the case).  For example, if an enemy attacks, the game stutters to load the damage and/or attack graphics, same goes whenever a new enemy appears.  This gets very annoying during the middle of combat, where you need finesse, which is impossible due to the said stuttering.  It also does the same whenever you open up any menu, which is again very grating, and ruins the flow of the game.The worst cases are when stuff ""teleports"", so as myself, who by then didn't know I was going to appear right before enemies that also just appeared on the spot.  Attack range seems nonexistant, since I would avoid attacks, but get hit full blast, even with the shield up.Have to precise that I've been playing solely in singleplayer, so these problems aren't even from online lag, which I'd say would be even worse.  I highly doubt these issues would be a computer problem, I can't recall anything this bad, even Dark Souls's Blighttown would be proud of this game.To be a bit fair, even though it's free to play, it doesn't shove microtransactions in your freaking face à la Realm of the Mad God, and it still remained ""fun"" when it decided to work right.  Who would have guessed?  A free game that could've not sucked, as the developpers had an ounce of care, even the art style's fresh.I wish I could've also cared about some of the mechanics, such as the crafting and leveling, and I do like the idea of a planet made of many alien worlds' parts, but I just can't care enough if these problems keep happening.

												The game itself is actually very fun. Yet it still demands your attention, and focus when you fight enemies throuout the game. Up to the point were when youre at rank 1-5 you notice a real difforince in the difficulty from the start, like any other game, or maybe im just slacking off. I would recommend this game to people who like RPGs, or just people who have a lot of time to kill, and wants to bash a lot of slimes, wolfs, zombies, elemental monsters, mech-knights, giant robots, phantoms, rats, epic bosses, possesed stone statues, office demons, ect. in the face with a veriety of bombs, swords, sheilds, and guns whale using power-ups like: a range of air-strikes, pills that cure effects, health pills, elemental viles that explode on contact, calling in some back-up, along side your new pet made out of power, lightness,or darkness that also shoots fireballs, beams of light, or darts of darkness. All whale getting to the center of the planet to discover the unknown sorce of strange power.Overall i would say that this game is stunning.			",64,16,0,6,5,0,3

												Not a bad little game, it has the look and feel of playing one of The Legend Of Zelda games.  Plus has a few silly elements thrown in.  Not bad if you enjoy simple RPG type games as unlike other games you don't gain xp to level yourself up but instead you level up your weapons/gear!  Which is an interesting twist, :-)			",630,245,25,79,25,5,103

												It's a pretty simple game, save the world, be a knight, be adventurous. I always loved that sort of games and I still do. It's much múch better with friends because of the fun you can have and believe it or not: teamwork. Some monsters are hard to kill on your own and it's always handy to have a friend next to you :) Too bad somehow this game doesn't work for me on Steam anymore, but I still play it from the official Spiral Knights site. It ís free to play but you need 'Energy' to buy certain stuff. You can gain Energy by buying it with 'crowns (the currency)' but it does take a while. Still, if you play it for fun, it won't hurt.Overall a really fun game and really recommended if you want to hang out with your friends or just be adventurous. :)Score: 8/10			",34,3,1,3,3,1,2

												After trying it out a few times, it didn't really grab me, but now having played it with friends it is a charming little dungeon romper with enough RPG elements to keep you coming back daily. For those who don't want to pay to play, you can only really play for 2 hours max a day (less if you die alot or want to do alot of crafting) as everything costs ""energy"". Free players get 100 to start with which you spend on using the lifts in the Clockworks to descend into your dungeons, at it recharges at 1 energy every 13 mins, so a total of 22 hours for a full recharge, however the micro transactions are quite cheap, but you could easily spend hundreds of euros/dollars on this game.Well worth playing if you want a bit of casual fun, with a rather addictive undercurrent.

												An awesome little casual Zelda-style Hack&Slash RPG. There is a surprising amount of depth in the play, manifesting mostly in the way you handle your shield, but also coming in to play when modifying your loadout to deal with various different levels and bosses. More friendly than ever to try out with the removal of energy costs for playing, I'd highly recommend giving it a shot.			",116,81,2,20,9,0,26

												this is a good game if you dont mind spending hours farming or grinding for in game money just to buy 1 item off of someone else. You could always go the pay to win route to if your that person. all in all game is time consuming and not for the new mmorpg players who can't be bothered with spending a lot of time on something.

												This game is amazing, despite it's simple looks, there is a lot of depth in it. The story is well done if a bit uncreative and the gameplay is just fantastic. All in all, great game, it can most certainlly provide you with hours and hours of fun, just like it did to me.			",51,6,0,9,1,0,0

												Hello all, and I hope you read this... (btw I didn't entirely play this game on steam, so that's why hours are kinda short)Like all the other negative reviews in this section, Spiral Knights is dying. It was an awesome game before, but it seems so empty now. It was an awesome game that I loved to sit down and play on, and I loved the atmosphere. Sadly, this game is a Pay 2 Win game that is rotting.I wish I could experience the game that I used to love, but sadly I cannot reccomend it now.All of those positive reviews are mostly newbies who just started, and they only list things like ""10/10"" or ""Great game, check it out""Goodbye, Spiral Knights			",16,3,0,1,3,0,0

												This game requires cooperation and achieved the promise of being the greatest knight of all.Sega and Valve teamed up to bring this to Steam.A free Spiral Sallet will be yours for use in Team Fortress 2 if you reach the 1st Clockworks Terminal.Having lots of fun with allies.

												The bonuses in UVs are miniscule, the game gets boring after a while, everything is extremely grindy, and the game overall is 'meh.' The loot drops suck, the game is abandoned, and the community is toxic. Play if you want to waste time.			",18,1,1,2,1,0,2

												A very interesting game. It's a unique idea and put together quite well. However I find it to be quite difficult in spots. Some missions take way too long to be able to complete. I don't feel as though the missions you do prepare you for some of the missions in future. You end up playing endlessly for a single item, then getting bored after doing the same thing over and over again.I recommend it simply due to the fact that it's quite fun and enjoyable when you play this game with friends. If you have help, this game can be fairly easy, but alone it gets boring and annoying.			",111,9,6,17,6,1,9
