												3 hours into EVE and I have a name, a great looking avatar and some photo ops for the ages.  I know how to undock my ship and set a course.  NOTHING will hold me back now and I will rule this universe in no time.34 hours into EVE and I swear to christ I am still doing tutorial missions, trying to figure out all the differnet angles to make money and do stuff in this damn game.  To fan the flames I have people wanting to do stuff with me, and I'm like ""I AM STILL DOING TUTORIAL MISSIONS""...""LET ME LEARN"".42 hours into EVE and I have no idea what I'm doing but I still keep playing.  I told my friends to ♥♥♥♥ off for now.109 hours into EVE.  Holy♥♥♥♥♥♥I just realized how many ♥♥♥♥in parts you can have for your ships.  There has to be some sort of build guides for these things.  This is way too overwhelming.165 hours into EVE and I still feel like a new guy and I've never been the new guy for so long.  I wonder why they call this a game when clearly it belongs in Office 365 Enterprise.  Then I realize this wouldn't be EVE without being so ... detailed...  I still have no idea what I'm doing, but I keep playing.207 hours into EVE and I realize I have to get into the 4 day trainings in order to get my hands on a mining barge which are really the only way to go for serious mining...still playing.219 hours into EVE and I start telling one of my friends about how this is so up my alley.  He responds with ""Oh god, here we go, don't push your excel sheet on me"".  I respond immediately with, ""First let me say I dont ever recommend you play it so ♥♥♥♥ off cause you arent good enough for it"".  First sign of addiction is getting defensive...223 hours into EVE and I'm so happy that my brother came out of retirement to play.  He is old school.  I immediatley see the advantage to working with other people, most specifically with someone who has 3 accounts and can haul your ore back and reprocess it at 73%...I kind of want to keep playing.274 hours into EVE I stopped ♥♥♥♥ing around and finally managed to focus on mining.  I got my first barge outfitted with strip miner IIs and my haul has increased over 10x.  I love this game and I want to keep playing.319 hours into EVE and I realize that I am only 1 day and 19 hours in skill training away from a Gallente Battleship.  I get excited and read up on which one I should get in preparation into some PVP action.  I realize I want an Amarr Battleship instead.  ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥it.  3 days of training added.   Somehow I still find myself wondering when I will actually start ruling this universe.356 hours in and I finally purchased a GTX 970.  I get pumped and go into EVE's settings and ramp everything up to the highest settings.  I don't see any difference...367 hours and I just learned a lesson in the vicinity of 185 million isk.  I am not invincible.  Just because I can finally fly a Battlship doesn't mean I should start flying a Battleship.580 hours and I'm STILL training up Astrogeology (12d) AND Mining Barges to lvl V (18d).  I'm starting to wonder if these big barges are worth the 30 days of training time.616 hours and I just finished training Mining Barges to V.  I don't even want to mine anymore.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Warning: Do not buy this game on Steam.Buy it from the officail website: http://www.eveonline.com/The game itself is amazing, but the way it is integrated into steam may result in you getting screwed over with no support from Valve.I purchased this game which came with a free month. Then I bought an extra three month subscription. Everything played fine until three months in when I went to play Eve and the game had uninstalled itself. I tried redownloading it and it said I couldn't do to my subscription not being up to date. I emailed Valve about the issue and their response was that they only handle billing and to email Eve Online for support. I emailed Eve, and they responded that my account is still active for 1 month and that I should be able to play. I tried playing from the official Eve Online client but it wouldn't allow me to log in from my steam account. I emailed valve again explaining the situation and forwarding them Eve Onlines support email. I then waited a couple days for them to respond only for them to come back with a canned response:""We apologize for the delay.Support for this title is provided by the original developer or publisher. Please refer to the following article for more information on contacting the support team for this title:Title: EVE OnlineLink: http://support.steampowered.com/kb_article.php?ref=6573-GZXN-7027&tpg=1""No solution was ever reached and I lost the time I paid for. My account cannot be recovered because its associated with steam and not the official client. This is hands down the worst experience I have had on steam and the last time I use steam to buy any subscription time for a game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I have been playing Eve: Online for just over four years now, and hopefully this review can be of some help to those deciding if they really want to dive into the game.First: Eve is a complex game. It has a really steep learning curve for new players, although the devs have been working hard to make it a little more newbro friendly. The have added a lot of new fancy tutorials that did not exist when I started. This is definitely a big plus if you are brand new. However, do not expect them to teach you everything. This game is beyond expansive, and you will get lost in the complexity. However the newbie channel chats, forums, and sometimes even local chat can be a big help. DOn't be afraid to ask questions. Usually someone is more than willing to answer.Second: Eve is not always a nice place. One of the first things you should know, as many people as there are out there willing to help you, there are just as many willing to take advantage of you. Whether that takes the form of stealing your stuff, killing you, or picking on you, it can, and will happen. Take every offer of help with a grain of salt, or if it is a business deal, be especially careful. This kind of behavior is completely legal in Eve because it is a sandbox. The creators don't regulate anything that does not violate the EULA. It's pretty much anything goes here.Third: Playing Eve solo sucks. Some people do it, but it's lame when you do it that way. Eve was built to be a social game and a social experiment. After you finish the tutorials, I highly suggest joining a player corporation. As a new player, I highly suggest joining a newbro friendly corp like Eve University, Pandemic Horde, or Red vs Blue. Eve Uni will teach you anything you want to know about Eve, and Horde and RvB are PvP oriented if you want to jump into that niche. Fourth: The skill training happens in real time. That means skills will continue to train even when you are not logged on. Also as a result, it can take a really long time to train certain skills. Playing for four years, and I have only recently started getting into capital ships. Do not expect to jump right in and be awesome at the game. You will fight and struggle and die, a lot. However, Eve is one of the most satisfying games ever if you stick with it. You don't have to have all the skills to be good, and you don't have to train everything. Just be patient with the progression and stick with it. If you are looking for the instant gratification of a shooter or action game, you best look elsewhere. Eve is a game that lends itself to the longview, and definitely has a delayed gratification factor. Fifth, and finally: Eve is awesome. Whether or not you like it is usually dependent on your personality, but regardlesss of whether or not you like it, it is an impressive world that the devs have made. Its a living, breathing community that makes its own story. Players decisions can affect thousands of other players. The market is run by the players, and wars between massive player coalitions shake both individual players, and the player driven markets. The PvP is the most exhilirating I have ever encountered, and I still get an adrenaline rush when taking ships into battle. (I'm very much PvP centered, so I have done quite a bit.) Eve is unlike any MMO you have ever played, or ever will play. It is singular, and I think you should at least give it a shot. If you don't like it, that's okay. It's not for everyone. If you do though, it can be a very rewarding experience and you will make some great friends. Have fun and fly dangerous!P.S Here is a link for a 21 Day trial. It will connect you to my in game toon Jodah so you can contact me there as well if you have questions.http://secure.eveonline.com/trial/?invc=3ee33351-66f6-4f70-bb57-881b91ec1473&action=buddy ",26,1,0,9,25,0,8

												As of right now, April 2016, there is a big conflict in Null Security space. Alliances on both sides of this conflict are currently recruiting a lot of new players into their ranks, so if you ever wanted to try EVE Online out; Now might be the best time to do so.The game is now free to play, but I would still suggest using my buddie invite link found in my profile description here on steam. It will give you 250.000 skillpoints upon account creation, which is a good few days worth of skill training and can be pretty useful for anyone who wants to get into the game :)EVE Online is a very time consuming game but it can be very rewarding as well, depending on what you do with your time in-game. It has been said many times before but still rings true: The game is only as boring as you make it. It's a sandbox game and therefore very open-ended, it doesn't hold your hand after you're done with the tutorial.I'd recommend you head over and do the career agents after the tutorial. It'll give you free ships, skillbooks and items to get you started. It also provides you with a small taste of the things you can do in-game like; Mining, industry, Missions and exploration. For a new player I'd recommend doing exploration to get ISK. It is very profitable in low sec. and null sec. and definetly better than mining. I would also recommend you to find a corporation (Guild) that is 'newbro' friendly. Playing EVE solo is possible, but more likely to burn you out before you get into the game, joining a corp. that has a like-minded playstyle will increase your enjoyment and let you learn from more experienced players at the same time.One last thing: You are never truly safe in this game unless you are docked. You can be killed at any time, anywhere. I'm not trying to scare you away from the game, chances are you won't be ganked until you are several months into the game. I just want you to understand that you should NEVER fly anything you can not afford to lose. It should be obvious, but some people still do and then complain about it, don't be that guy. If you didn't know it already, you lose your ship and everything on it once you get killed. That includes cargo as well, so don't move anything extremely expensive.EVE Online is a game that requires time to learn and patience to master, hope to see you in-game! o7TL;DR The game is what you make of it. Everyone has a different experience with it.Edit: Trail -> Trial			",254,51,6,46,32,3,52

EVE ONLINEIt can be a great game with countless hours of enjoyment.. But it can also be a giant waste of money and time.. And more than likely, something you will not play for more than few hours, or weeks ever.As someone who's played Eve for the better part of 9 years. I've done practically everything at one point or another. Been in giant alliances and fought wars against russians. Got bored of industry and planetary crap, did the whole small corp pvp, stealth bombers and black ops. I've lived in 0.0, did the whole wormhole life and pve side of the game and quite honestly I just simply don't care for it [the game] anymore as a whole.The game itself has changed... (honestly) very little.The ""expansions"" CCP launch every year, do offer new and decent content (Usually). However, MOST of the content CCP provides for EVE is not something every player see's or experiences.And as such, I've known many players who basically experience NONE of the new stuff provided in expansions, YEAR AFTER YEAR. and are, more or less, playing the exact same game from 4 - 5+ years ago.There is a very real problem with EVE that I will get into in just a bit. But what EVE succeeds at ... it does... Pretty well.It's a decent game if you have people to play with, people who know what they are doing. If you are able to join a decent corp.If you have no friends, or no one to play EVE with, it's normally an extremely lackluster experience, very boring, and very very lonely. EVE can also be very harsh. You can get scammed, lose all your assets, and lose hundreds or thousands of dollars worth of items in game.I knew a person who after playing the game for a month, bought a bunch of plexs. Who then undocked, and was then blown up. He lost about $300~ worth of plex. Needless to say, he quit the game shortly after.EVE, for the most part, is a very ruthless game. You need to play it almost in the mindset of something like an even more hardcore dark souls. Expect to die, or lose your ship. Don't fly stuff you can't afford to lose, don't put all your eggs in one basket. Plan our what you're doing, where you're going. Know what you are doing, before you do it. Which, can be a little much when you are starting out.I've known a lot of new players, and have helped a lot of new players with the game.But, there are a lot of misconceptions. Mostly thrown off by CCP themselves, with how they portray the game... And there's a lot of unknowns and things that you just will not get your head around till you've spent a lot of time/money in the game (For the most part).I've known plenty of people who spent months trying to get a certain ship, only to find out.. That ship was not what they expected, and they were extremely dissapointed and wound up leaving the game due to it. It's depressing to work for a carrier for many months, then to finally get it and realize.. Oh, you can't actually really use it unless you have other people or accounts to play with. There's a lot of aspects in the game that are awesome, however... They (Honestly) are not executed well imo.Over the years, instead of EVE changing them to make them better. They've stuck with their somewhat flawed design in ways that has left a lot of people basically... In the dust. It keeps the regulars, but for the most part... A lot of other people just can't stick with it.A lot of things in EVE really just are not designed that well for a solo player in specific scenarios. And generally, for a new player starting off... That is how it's played. Which is AWFUL. Then there's the dissapointment people get when they realize, they can't do what they thought they could. Or what they want to do. This is a hard limitation of the core game design.EVE is a game for groups of people. If you play by yourself, you will almost certainly be bored out of your mind more than likely. You will more than likely quit the game within the first few hours.EVE is just not good at that, and probably never will be.Don't get me wrong, I love EVE. I always have, even though I have a lot of problems with it. I still play it to this day. I've had numerous accounts over the years and it's still something that I usually come back to for a few months every expansion. Then drop off, of course once I realize there's still nothing there for me.Most people I knew that were hardcore into EVE and used to nolife the game, have never played it again.. There's usually two types of EVE players. Those that love it, and play it all the time. And those that play it, hate it, and never play it again.I'm a bit of an odd one stuck in the middle but oh well :PI hope that one day CCP can actually change some of the things that HOLD eve online back from being the best it can be. But I know that will probably never happen, I still enjoy seeing and hearing about the fleet fights, watching the killboards, and playing every now and then but... EVE can get extremely stale for a lot of people, and that's why even people who love it might never come back.Honestly, would I reccomend EVE? Not really because MOST people (Once again, talking about in general) do not like it, and have a real hard time with the game.There, of course, are people that love EVE and eat it up like there's no tomorrow. Great, but for most people.. It just isn't worth it.That said, if you are interested in trying out EVE let me know. You can use my referral here.http://secure.eveonline.com/trial/?invc=5a39485a-ae65-4ede-b4dd-deb8fd7a1da8&action=buddyYou will get extra game time than creating a normal trial account (21 days vs 14).So you have some extra time to train skills, try out stuff. Anyone is welcome to ask me any questions they might have. I'm always happy to help new people! My in game name is ""Cilayin""			",349,49,5,30,27,2,42

												Been playing this game for a long time, and it has come a long way.Of course any game has its ups and downs, and this game is no different. But i will say that this is a true ""SandBox"" game. Can work you butt off for a ship, and the next day lose it. But then you have the community to fall back on, Everyone is willing to help just as long as you ask. I will recommend that whoever buys and plans on playing, that you have ALOT of patience. This is a skill training base game, and the skills help alot, but get completed over time. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												As an old MMO player of DAoC, WoW and UO, testing a game like EVE Online was a rather huge step for me, however I quickly learned that EVE is nothing like I expected.The game is completely controlled by players in every aspect. Everyone is playing on one major server and even though that might seem like it's insane, there are times where you will find yourself all alone in the universe.You start as a new pilot with an endless list of things you can do in the world, you can become a miner, a pirate, a warrior, a corp leader and many more. You can make yourself the richest in the game or just feel like destroying other people to annoy them and steal their cargo. You can build the largest corp or have a group of friends just mining and having fun.Everything is your choice, there is something to do for everyone.EVE is not like other MMO´s where you can just log in and play for 10-15 mins and log out, EVE takes a lot of dedication and time to master, the largest ship possible to fly takes 2 years in real time to just be able to fly and even longer to be able to use all its functions. Although your skills train even when you´re offline, if you want to be the best and the most powerful get ready to spend a lot of time in this game.All in all a great game and a great MMO that stands out, don´t let the monthly fee scare you away from trying as you can use in game money to buy monthly game time if you are rich enough, this won't happen after a month or two, but I did make it happen after my 3rd month and never paid since with Real Life money.

												ranquility. I've always puzzled at the name of EVE Online's single server. It's an ironic moniker to lend to a world where hundreds of thousands of players jockey for resources, scheme, spy, and blow each other up. On that one server, wars wage in perpetuity. Scammers ply their trade outside crowded space stations. Fortunes are made and lost amid the bustle of a full-fledged economy. None of it feels particularly tranquil.And yet, Carl Sagan once noted that from space, Earth--for all its chaos--is nothing but a pale blue dot. So it goes with EVE: step far enough back from CCP's sci-fi massively multiplayer online game, and a picture of tranquility begins to emerge. Ten years of steady growth. The recent release of a 20th free expansion, Rubicon. Throughout all, consistency of vision, commitment, and support. It's no small achievement in the winter of the massively multiplayer online role-playing game, when young games are born, live, and die, all in World of Warcraft's shadow. In the face of such competition, EVE's languid pace would seem a detriment, and yet, like the universe, EVE is ever expanding outward.EVE cultivates an appreciation for scales, vectors, and inertia, because it makes their mastery a matter of life and death. The game supports a healthy variety of pursuits, including nonviolent options like building, trading, or mining, but at some point almost all players must hazard a jaunt around EVE's tangled network of interconnected solar systems. Each system is a room of sorts connected by stargates that act as metaphorical doorways. They're spacious chambers, big enough to fit planets, asteroid belts, and space stations with a few trillion miles to spare, but danger always has a way of finding you in EVE. If you're lucky, it'll only come in the form of pirates or warring fleets that open fire on sight. If you're unlucky, it'll be a scammer, spy, or saboteur playing EVE's tacitly sanctioned metagame against you.Conflict runs tangential to even the most pacifistic careers in EVE. After all, it's easier to maintain a lively spaceship market if players are always blowing each other up. But when things come to blows, it's actually a tidy affair. Ships can be piloted by clicking about in space, but most actions in EVE hinge on more mechanical commands like ""maintain distance"" or ""warp to"". It's a math-oriented system that hinges on numbers like distance, radii, and acceleration. Once the enemy has been targeted and the keys for weapons have been pressed, battles ebb and flow according to who can dictate range as their ships circle. Large-scale battles are as chaotic and complex as any sci-fi war scene, and skirmishes are thrillingly staccato. Victory in either is less a product of reflex than of strategy. The prelude to war--proper equipment, communication, teammwork, and patience--is usually the deciding factor. As often as a good fight seems to find the unwilling in EVE, it can prove elusive for those seeking it out. For every minute of battle or plunder, there are hours spent as prey eludes capture, as fleets circle and dance to the reports of their forward scouts.Indeed, EVE's pace is glacial indeed...right until it isn't. A dominant alliance might hold a third of the world in an iron grip for ages, until a spot of corporate espionage dispels it into the digital ether overnight. An interstellar bank could compound every investment it's entrusted with for years, until it suddenly absconds with billions. The universe's first Titan-class ubership may be a world-beater, until it's destroyed because the pilot chooses an inopportune moment to log off. They're the kinds of stories that make headlines outside of gaming circles, the kind that EVE is uniquely equipped to tell. Whether you're speaking to the allure of exploring EVE's vast universe, the machinations of its political scene, or even the prospects of the game's next expansion, that capacity for upheaval is a draw unto itself.What's refreshing about EVE is how much of that change is user-driven. Player characters in the game are canonically immortal, their consciousness tied to clones that are awakened whenever they find themselves on the wrong end of the metaphorical photon torpedo. So-called pod pilots are the movers and shakers of the EVE universe, and enjoy a privileged position as mercenary demigods (consider for a moment the level of desperation that would drive a non-player character to enlist under a commander who, by definition, never goes down with the ship, and you'll begin to grasp the morbidity of EVE's lore). What gets moved or shaken is a matter of taste. It might mean battle, as a soldier or pirate. It might mean cleaning up after said battles, and pawning the salvage. Or it might mean moving goods from one place to another, and shaking whenever outlaws start eyeing your loot. Each endeavor can be pursued in the name of EVE's four hawkish NPC empires, a smattering of lesser powers, or the great host of player corporations.Picking what banner to fly is always an important decision in an MMORPG, but in EVE, the decision can make or break the experience entirely. Should you have no allies, the vast reaches of space can be brutally lonely and unforgiving. Sure, there are hundreds of space stations to rest in, nominal communities strewn about the network of solar systems that dot EVE's pointillistic map. But though the game now allows you to walk the interiors of these structures, there's little humanity to be found inside. NPCs are still just portraits in the interface that proffer textual missions. Other players are just smaller portraits in your chat feed. The resultant sense of disembodiment impinges on every interaction in EVE, and it helps to explain the popularity of extra-game forums and meet-ups. Absent a few friendly faces, it's just not that easy to make regions with names like The Bleak Lands or Stain feel like home. Go figure.Actually, Stain seems like Shangri-la compared to 0FZ-2H. That's the naming convention of zero-security systems, which fall outside the protection of NPC guards, and where EVE's player alliances battle for control of the game's open territories. Zero security also sees CCP's most brilliant and nefarious contribution to player-versus-player gameplay: regions, and the distribution of resources therein, are asymmetrical. Zero-sec space tempts with its more lucrative opportunities, but making the trip means leaving the safety of the empires. Inequalities exist among the lawless regions, too. The imbalance creates further incentives for players to band together, if only for the express purpose of evicting those ahead of them at the table.Asymmetry must be in CCP's mission statement somewhere. It's certainly visible in the designs of EVE's spaceships: intricate, inventive crafts that range in scale from small yacht to small state. Asymmetry colors the use of those ships as weapons, too. At first blush, the more expensive, upper-echelon crafts seem overpowered. That perception holds true, until you develop an appreciation for asymmetrical warfare. There are no restrictions--mechanical or moral--on the size of fleets corporations can bring to the field, and with enough cheap frigates and cruisers, most foes can be felled. Barring that, there's always sabotage, as legitimate a tactic in EVE as any.Big, expensive ships are also big, expensive targets, either for rival corporations or pirates that operate on the fringes of high-security space. Being blown up might not mean as much if you just wake up in a distant clone vat, but it can take a serious toll on your supply of ISK, EVE's currency. Ships that get destroyed are gone for good, along with all the expensive and rare equipment they've been kitted out with. That can include PLEX, an in-game item that represents real playing time in EVE (and a viable alternative to the game's $9.99 a month cost for dedicated players), meaning some losses can hurt a player's real walle			",173,17,6,23,39,2,21

												Crack is less addictive. Crack will probably also keep more of your social life intact. Crack might also be less destructive to your manners, behaviour, integrity and general well-being. EVE turns decent people into sociaopathic outcasts in a couple of days.If you have to choose between EVE and Crack, choose Crack.You'll thank me latero7(Eh, who am i kidding. Get in there.)

												EVE Online is, in my honest opinion, the only MMO truly worthy of consideration.The problem with other MMOs is, players have no real, long-lasting impact on the game world. That boss you just killed? He's going to respawn in 2 minutes to allow for the next group of players to complete that quest. And so most MMOs are a tedious grindfest of fetch quests and uninspired raids in which every player is but a puppet in a world devoid of life, just running around on endless errands that go nowhere.EVE is not like that.EVE isn't a game: it's a sandbox. A hypercapitalist simulator. The players make the rules, they enforce them, and they break them. The consequences are real. Mistakes are costly, and death is permanent. The learning curve is steep. Very, very steep: more than 300 hours in, I still feel like a noob. But whether I'm mining on my own in a low-security area of space, or exploring a wormhole in search of a quick buck, or speculating on the commodity market, or trying to gain some notoriety in a remote outpost along with a rabble of scoundrels, I know that danger is lurking around the corner, and that I can't afford to let my guard down.The friends you make in EVE are real friends. The ships and cargo you lose are worth real money.But like a wasp in a hive, you feel like you contribute to the collective. And while a single wasp sting is only a warning,  the swarm is a sight to behold.			",321,43,13,39,22,4,43

												I have been playing EvE on and off for 6 years now. Do I like it? Yes. Would I recommend it? No.EvE is an exercise in humility. If you join now or at any point in the future, don't expect any satisfaction from this game.The trailers are made to make you believe that you can change something - the news broadcast about the battle of B-5RB are making your mind imagine things that just aren't here.EvE is not a Sandbox - it is a multiple choice point & click adventure like those ""make your own adventure"" books you read when you were a child. There is nothing new to be discovered, everything has been done by someone before you and better to the point where it is almost mandatory to use third party websites to fit your ship, mine, produce, explore or do anything in this game.You will not stumble upon a miner in distress in your first week and join his buddies fleet to see a large battle - if you venture into the PvP space you will be blown up either by the pirates or his reinforcements. Chatting to any of those groups will make you a target.PvP comes in three major varieties.Solo PvP revolves around finding a mark that you can take without any difficulties. If there is a chance that an engagement could let you lose your ship, you don't engage. For a new players this means that you will never get in any PvP you can win.Gang PvP revolves around finding a mark that your gang can take without any difficulties. If there is a chance that an engagement could let you lose your gang, you don't engage.Fleet PvP is just two massive blobs colliding. Most fleet battles are decided by who gets the drop on whom - since fleet battles tend to last for more than 10 minutes, a little tactics can be put into it with reinforcements.The Sandbox that is often quoted is nothing more than a tech tree with premade options. Ships, Modules and everything you make has been made by a very restrictive system of blueprints that allow no individuality. Any two ships with the same name will look the same, behave the same and do the same until you fit them with modules with the same attributes.So in conclusion this is EvE: You grind your♥♥♥♥♥off in the same missions or same mining belts for days on end, waiting for your skills that are based on real world time to learn to finish learning. Nothing you will do will have any impact if you haven't been playing this game for years, shelling out a quite high monthly fee for a somewhat dated game.EvE is the ultimate in waiting simulators. Get a better game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Day One: The locals seem to be hostile, they are very distant and untrusting. I have roamed around the land of New Eden looking for friendly life, but yet I have found none.Day Two: I have started to communicate with a small group of locals that have allowed be to begin a trial to test my worth, they give little support and observe my actions carefully.Day Three: The trial has proven to be hard, I must kill an innocent miner and take his property back to  the leader of the tribe. I warped in near him and pretended to mine, soon he accepted me to not be a threat and I launched my attack. I shot repeatedly until his ship had blown up, then I looted the wreck and returned to my tribe.Day Four: The tribe held a feast in honor of my passing of the trial and I was greeted to the feast with a chant of ""ONE OF US! ONE OF US!""Day Two Hundred Thirty Seven: The tribe has named me king, and now I rule with pride and honor, I lowwered the tax rate to 1% and gave jobs to the less fortunate in the tribe. All seems to be going well.Day Seven Hundred Twenty One: I went out to mine in order to gain some money for the tribe, which has now grown in strength and controls over five stations. About ten minutes into the mining a friendly ship warps into the belt, he seems to be new to the land of New Eden and I pay no mind to him. Ten minutes later I am locked onto and soon destroyed, in the distance I can hear the faint chants of ""ONE OF US!""			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Alright, let me start by saying EVE: Online is the best game I have ever played period.After over two years of playing the game, I've decided that its time to write a review.  Through the many years of my life, I have played things like COD, Elder Scrolls, Civilization, the Total War series, Halo, and really every mainstream game out there.  EVE: Online is better that the all of them combined.  The wonderful thing about the game is quite simple: You can do ANYTHING. Games like Skyrim (And don't get me wrong, I LOVE Skyrim) Say that they're open world and that you can do whatever you want, but thats not really true.  You can't build your own cities, you can't form your own guild, you can't choose not to be the Dragonborn. EVE, on the other hand, is truly open to you.  You can play the game like you would WoW, and just get into a combat vessle, fit it with several thousand different turrets, modules, drones and fighters, and then go and blow someone up. Its possible, too, to never leave your starting space station, and instead decide to trade space stocks and sell space sodas. You can decide to be a hauler, where all you do is buy a big spaceship, and get paid by people to carry their stuff. You can even treat it like an offline game, and just play the PvE aspects of the game!In short: You can do anything you want.The other great thing about EVE, is that there is one, constant server supporting every player in the entire world.  What does this mean? It means that what you do, nomatter how small, WILL affect EVERYBODY FOREVER. As I write this review, there are 19,499 people playing on this one server.  This means that I can right now log on and talk to, blow up, ally with, and trade with 19,499 other human beings. There are some people who play the game that are leaders of galactic empires.  A few names of said empires are the Neutral Coalition, Phoenix Federation, Circle of Test, and the hated, WW2 Germany-like RedSwarm Federation. All of these alliances, you must understand, are all made up of people.  These people are lead by one (or more) other REAL people.Some Pro's of the Game:-Can be played however you want it to be.-Very few bugs (as to be expected in a 13 year old game)-AMAZING graphics-Real economy-Many player-lead Nations-Countless player-lead Corporations-Company that has made the game has made nothing else. They have focused on keeping this wonderful game updated-Can play this instead of studying for an AP economics test - will have the same effect.Con's-There is a group of evil religous fanatics known only as the CODE. They will hunt you down and kill you. Beware.-You need a calculator-Takes about 3 months to get used to the controls (google ""EVE: Online learning curve"" Right now.   Why are you reading this, you should be opening google.)-Skill training is annoying, but not terrible.Ok, to adress the concerns of some of these noobs who have decided to hate this game:One very elequent quote by SixNineSix is as follows:Highly advise to not start this game.Those that play, are there to stay, and WILL NOT ALLOW ANYONE NEW TO come into the game. The community is TOXIC, to the point that every person a new player encounters is about 98% chance they are going to burn you. Beautiful game to see but the problem is getting anywhere to see it without being wasted by some control freek sitting at a gate ganking n00bs, taking what little bit they have. Just leave em alone. Game is dying anyway.This person has said that the community is ""TOXIC."" and that us old-timers will try to kill every new player we can find. I can assure you, this is FAR from the truth.  There are some who wish harm to everybody (they're known as ""The Code"") but they don't target noobs. There are many different ways of protecting yourself from them including joining a different corporation, or just paying into their extortion. Alternitavly, DON'T FLY YOUR MINING SHIPS THROUGH LOW SECURITY SPACE WHEN YOU'RE A NOOB!!! He then goes into his rant about how the game is dying.  I would argue the opposite. Since the game's release in 2003, there have been countless new players coming into the community.  I have seen countless players who've begun the game withing the last few months, and until that 19,499 players logged in count drops to the point of no return, i'll stand by my beliefs.Next wonderful quote from Recluse:Well, let's say you're making 22 jumps to the main trade hub to get some stuff sold, and along the way, you jump into a gate that has an army of 20 pirates sitting there waiting for someone like you with a couple billion ISK worth of goods, they open fire, destroy your 1.5 billion ISK ship, along with your 4 billion ISK worth of products. Why? Because this is a PvP game, because you don't have a choice, there is nothing you can do once you get to that point.Ah, the classic noob rage post...  Let us start by asking a question: Is this game realistic - the answer, as argued previously, is yes.  So is there a chance that a convoy of ships passing through dangerous waters may get robbed? I'd say yes. Would the convoy be robbed is it was under armed guard by several space battleships? Probably not.  Remember: Eve online is the most realistic game out there on the market. The game is ALL players, and all players want to win. So if a player is a pirate, he'll want to win WITHOUT getting blown up. This is why you hire a bunch of nice mercinaries who think that the way to win is by helping other people for nice, shiny money to protect your spaceship. In EVE, Logic rules.Anyway, please try to ignore the countless rage posts of those guys who just can't take a loss with a cool head. In EVE, you're going to die at least once during you're first month. You're going to either steal something on accendent, decide that you're ready for low security space mining, or you've walked away from your screen while your expensive noobcraft is floating outside of CODE's secret hideout. Its going to happen. There are just some people who can't get over it. We all know that guy.Summary:EVE online is amazing. If I went on to describe every aspect of the game, I would not have enough time to actually play EVE after this update is FINALLY finished downloading... This game is great, and is updated almost three times a month. In a few days after the writing of this update, EVE Online will become free. I do reccomend, however, buying the fully subscribed version for at least a month, just to see what the game is like. PLEASE NOTE: DON'T BUY THE GAME OFF STEAM!!!!! IT'S A WASTE OF CASH! GET IT OFF OF THE EVE WEBSITE FOR FREE!Thank you for reading this LONG review,Fathis Dren, CEO and Founder of Cybus Heavy Industries, an Eve Online corporation			",28,3,0,14,11,0,20

												I played EVE Online, and it was amazing!  So why do I NOT recommend it?  The game is more than a little overwhelming, and, clearly, in order for the game to really pay off, you need to be able to dedicate major time to it, or, you will waste your subscription, and just die, left on your own in the middle of the cold cold space.  Is that what happened to me?  Almost.  I have a full time job, a beautiful wife, and other interests... .  I am convinced you can't have all those things in your life and successfully play this game.  I wish I could.  So for me, and those like me, I don't recommend spending your money and time on this, unless you have enough room in your life for this beast.  In its place, I recommend the X series.  You can ""save"" your game, have a life, and load it, and pick up where you left off... and not worry about dying and losing it all, because Life called and needed some of your focus.  In the future, perhaps I will find a way to manage these commitments so EVE Online is do-able, but for now, hopefully this review, about an awesome game, saves a few players some time and money.On a side-note, if this game ever provides a subscription for life service... you will likely see me on it, from time to intermitent time.

												I love this game, but i don't recomend it.For the sake of Steam ratings, i will give this game a thumbs up, but i will never tell someone they should play this game. No other game exists of EvE's type. There are no rules, no levels, no instructions, no paths. You get a ship, a little bit of ISK (currency) and its up to you to make your name known. Im an explorer, a hacker, and an archeologist. I make my money scanning down data and relic sites in Wormholes, avoiding other (more well armed) players in my trusty (and expensive) Astero frigate. Its fun, ive made freinds and enemies.  If you are thinking about diving in, dont. Put a foot in at the shallow end and look up some guides. Read up, watch some videos. A very small percentage of players get to participate in those massive fleet battles you hear about on the News. The social atmoshpere makes it hard to start off, and if you fly solo you will get bored and quit. Find a good group, stay social, and dont fly something if you can afford to buy ten. o7			",75,3,0,16,9,0,24

Don't expect a constant fun time once you start playing though; EVE takes a hell of a lot of work and time to get anywhere, and you'll only get somewhere if you're lucky. Unless you're willing to devote months of your life to this game (which mostly will end up being used for skill training and monotonous isk farming), find friends and blow up ships. That is the best way to legitimately enjoy the game.Two pieces of advice:-Don't mine, it requires so much time to make money, and after a month or so, you'll realize that training for an Exhumer was a waste of time.-Get into null/lowsec as soon as possible. Fit up a nooby frig, watch a few PvP vids, and get going. It's really beneficial to overcome the ""nullsec jitters"" early on, and it's worth losing a cheap frig or two to accomplish that.

o7 o7 Warning! Opinions ahead, I reserve the right to be disagreed with in an amicable fashion. o7 o7 I cant recommend this game. it is a profound time sink, and has a really niche player base with very little payoff for more casual players. I played for about a year and i found myself waiting for the game experience to become fun, but it never did. the space combat is unforgivably boring, which as far as im concerned is a deal breaker. the ship designs are bizarrely ugly too, and it constantly tempered my desire for new ships. i care less about aesthetics than combat, but playing this i was forced to stare at my ship for virtually the entire playtime, so i would have been happier if i actually liked how my ships looked. the skill system was pretty much hands-off, you just had to wait for hours or more commonly days or even weeks to get a miniscule increase to a particular skill, and it never felt rewarding to max a skill out, just on to the next skill, a numb grind.i realize that many people would cite the massive battles that occur as a counter to my assertion that the combat is boring, but these huge battles are infrequent at best, and due to the in-game economy being so closely linked to real world cash value, these battles could very well cost you more than a few wrecked ships. most of the time youll be battling human or a.i. controlled pirates/bandits in small time skirmishes that serve only to highlight how uninteresting the combat usually is. i keep a book by my computer for when im downloading programs or whatever, and i found myself rereading the entire Song of Ice and Fire series while engaged in combat or mining, both primarily rely on the same skill set of moving the mouse icon and occasionally clicking buttons. i also grew to mistrust the company CCP and the community of this game, although im sure there were lots of decent human beings amongst them. the biggest problem i had with the community happened when i first started playing. the leader of one of the most prominent corporate alliances had shown up to a livestream drunk and called out a player by his real name and asked his followers to grief this poor, totally innocent guy. the leader said during the livestream that he wanted the player to actually commit suicide irl, and the big bad leader was marshalling his ingame forces to ""make it so"".this despicable behaviour was reprimanded with a slap on the wrist, a mere 30 day suspension from their little ingame council, and as far as i know, nothing more was done. there seemed to be a lingering resentment towards players who choose to pve or mine or whatever, and i read more than a few forum posts that were more like essays on how the elitist players are right in how they grief players who choose to mine, likening them to worse than mindless drones that deserve to die over and over. it felt like i was reading the manifesto of a sociopath, rather than a reasoned sensible opinion.there is so much more to say, but i cant realistically place all that i have to say in a single review, who would be interested in reading it?

												After playing for a couple of months (not Steam version, because the Steam launcher was giving me troubles) I  don’t recommend buying it at this time — June 2014 — due to the overall impression I’ve got. Read the details below and be prepared if you want to buy the game.Preparations before playingI know it is a game but if you don’t prepare properly, you will regret it. Or you will quit the game much earlier. A free trial for 14 days is available to anyone. Any Eve Online player can send you a link for a free trial for 21 days. You can choose to pay the subscription or enter the CD code from a starter pack at any time. Your trial time will not disappear. Your paid time will just be added to the trial time. So always start as a trial. No need to waste 14-21 days.PvP sandboxIt is a sandbox game. Unlike theme park games where gamers can interact with what developers have created to have fun, in sandbox games you have to create your own fun. The PvP (player versus player) component of the game clearly outweighs the PvE (player versus environment) component.Not a solo-friendly gameChoosing your race or bloodline is not very important. Stats are the same. Only for role players it is important. Caldari area has the largest trade hub in the game at the moment. You start the game as a member of an NPC corporation. You can join a player-run corporation at any time. Learning the game alone is difficult. Join the corporation Eve University or some other corporation that is friendly to new players. Having a mentor to ask stupid questions is very handy.Character attributesVery important. A new character is given three character attribute remaps. You can use them to tune five attributes of your character in quite a wide range. Every skill requires a primary attribute and a secondary attribute. The amount of skill points you have in a specific attribute determines the speed of “learning” a particular skill. Benefits of the primary attribute affect the skill learning speed in full while benefits of the secondary skill give half as much speed. A new player gets two bonus remaps and one regular one. Once you spend them, your next remap will be available only one year after! These attributes are important only for learning. Nothing else.Skill systemNever train rank V of a skill unless it opens up another skill that you want. Rank V is designed for perfectionists only!Unlike other games in Eve Online you cannot accelerate your character levelling by putting more personal time and effort into it. You can only install implants that give bonuses to your primary attributes. They vary from +1 to +5 attribute points. These implants speed up levelling. Implants + properly maxed attributes for specific skills are vital. Besides, if you buy any starter pack, you get a cerebral accelerator that gives a massive boost to attributes for a short time like 14 days (+9 to each attribute), 35 days (+3) or 7 days (+17 or 19, I don’t remember). The accelerator works for characters younger than the specified age. The effect will stay with you between the time you inject it and the time you reach that age. After that you cannot inject it.Unless you are a genius and know the game inside out you must get the program EveMon to plan your character progression. Eve Online is spreadsheets in space and takes a lot of calculations. It is not for impatient people, who want to do everything the game has to offer in a couple of months. A properly skilled character can take a year to get.One thing is good, however. The game has a skill queuing system. You learn skills while offline as long as your subscription time is paid. The queuing skill clearly outlines when your skills get learned.Security levels of solar systemsEvery solar system has a security level. 1.0 is the highest one and 0.0 is the lowest one. The range from 1.0 till 0.5 is called highsec. In highsec space police (aka CONCORD) will interfere if you fire upon or get fired upon without a war declaration. In this space you are kind of safe. The range from 0.4 till 0.1 is lowsec. Police will not interfere although the personal security ranking of the player, who commits a crime, will drop. If it is too low, such players will be hunted down by police upon entering highsec space. 0.0 is the null security space or nullsec where no rules apply but what you make. Don’t go there unless you are prepared.User interfaceThe back end of the game is much more than what you are used to in any other game. You will see how much ISK (in-game currency) you spent or gained every time. You will be able to see every trade between you and some other character. Lots and lots of text. Lots of text as tutorials at the start of the game. Some people complain that it looks like you accept a lot of license agreements.Space simulator?UPDATE http://community.eveonline.com/news/dev-blogs/quick-give-me-manual-control/Until recently you couldn't fly using WASD. Double-click on empty space and you will fly in that direction. Or choose a marker from the overview (a list of objects that exist around you in outer space, five tabs max, mind-blowingly customizable), right-click and choose Approach or Warp or something. The game has a lot of right-click and choose an option stuff. Practically core gameplay.Graphics and soundThe game was released in 2003. It has been updated since but still doesn’t look too good. For instance, with all settings on max and shaders at low it will look its best. Music is okay but I wish it had soundtracks similar to music from The Swapper. Sound effects are nothing to write home about.Game developmentThe game development looks slow. CCP, the development studio, seems to pool all the human resources together and then use them on various projects when a need arises. CCP has a record of promising features and not delivering them. Coming from other games where every expansion offers a tonne of content, I cannot say that Eve Online expansions offer a lot. Probably because game developers don’t stick with CCP for too long.CCP also seems to suffer from being too ambitious and from the lack of a clear and integral vision of how their games should develop. Google “CCP world of darkness” or “CCP Incarna” to learn about the game developer’s PR failures.Other playersThey are the people you will interact with all the time. They can play the game for different purposes. Beware that scamming in the game is allowed. You cannot open a ticket and get anything restored. Read what you pay for carefully.The veteran players of Eve Online consider the game a game for elite gamers and the attitude can be felt easily on the forums. In the game the attitude is mostly friendly. However, they expect those, who want to continue playing the game after trial, to put effort and time in learning the game properly.Those, who want to play it right nowGo for it if you have a buddy in a corporation that does a lot of PvP. You are likely to participate in fights from day one. You will lose your ships a lot but the corporation is supposed (ask whether your corporation does it) to reimburse newbie ships since they don’t cost much for veteran players unless you lose the ships in particularly stupid ways.Go for it if you are reading the text much time later and the game has improved by a lot. The things I’ve learned about the new industry UI in Eve Online in summer 2014 is a promise of a better future.			",113,5,3,19,10,0,17

												What not to expect: Massively Multiplayer Mass Effect, ""Different"" Elite.What to expect: Skyrim In Space.The game is hilariously big, to the point that playing over the years to perfect an aspect of it will still leave you with several others unexplored.It's a sandbox. You have a ship and a handful of money. Now go out there, and make yourself something.So, the ""Hype hype hooray"" parts you probably read about:Yes, you can shoot someone in the face (well, ship) and you can be shot in the ship.In fact, you can do that even in the ""safe"" zones, if you pull it off right.Yes, you can join someone's corporation, gain their trust and rob them blind.Yes, you can create a ponzi scheme.Yes, you can lie, scam and get rich this way.Yes, you can become an industrial ""god of spreadsheets"", manufacturing everything someone else may need to continue their adventure.Yes, the game has an amazing lore! It's well hidden. Go find it.Yes, CCP is supporting it. Hell, they're actually updating graphics up to modern standard - including new models for ships.The gritty:- You will be getting an alt. And you will likely be dualboxing your main character, and your alt. Certain things in the game are better if you have two different pilots. Say, a pirate and his trusty scammer alt.- You will not be handed a big battle right off the bat. In fact, the grand battles are spectacular, rare events. Participating in one in a role that you like to fill is an experience of its own. Many fights are resolved in small skirmishes.- There's politics. I don't mean NPC world politics, I mean player politics. Since the game allows you to plant your flag somewhere... yup, there's gonna be politics. I consider it a good, unique feature - but others may disagree.The bad:- Some changes made by the devs can, and will, make you cringe. And no, not talking about 'P2W' (you will find out quickly that killing someone who paid a lot of cash for a ship he didn't know how to fly is a bit of a rite of passage for the more piratey kind of pilot).- My Arazu still looks ugly.So, if by a chance you wound up not only reading my review, but reaching this point - how do you take on EVE?In three ways:You can shelter yourself from the community, never leave high security space and quit out of boredom.You can hit low security space, put on your eyepatch and dust off your trusted parrot - get in fights, meet people, join a proper pirate group.You can take a running leap and slam yourself deep into the political side of things. Take it all with a grain of salt, and don't let the badposting overdose kill you - and you'll find one of the richest gaming experiences.Now, this was supposed to be a quick summary and I wrote a wall of text. So, I'm off to my watch - there are bad people who don't agree with my space dictator that need to explode, also their space dictator is bad.			",99,11,1,13,18,1,26

												Eve Online is perhaps the all time worst game for instant gratification seekers. It is neither intuitive nor simple. The game mechanics are byzantine. This is a sim for players who want to get lost in a thriving sandbox that is shaped by the efforts of the player base. Eve is deep, challenging, beautiful, and life-devouring. It continues to stand as the high water mark for sandbox game design's potential for player-driven content, emergent economics, and high stakes PVP warfare on a truly galactic scale. To see why this sandbox is surviving through the devoted investment of time and effort of a cult-like player base, stick with it. Your success depends on forethought and awareness. Lazy and impatient players will suffer. Learn from your failures or you will rage-quit like a child. Patient and adaptive players will carve out niches for themselves and leave their mark on the game world. Whether you are a devoted team player or a con artist sociopath, the social aspects of this game are absolutely key. Join an active nullsec corp. Get on Teamspeak. Veteran pilots tend to love to show rookies how to thrive, and mentorship is the best way through the steep learning curve. If you merely fly solo in High Security space, you'll remain stuck in the shallow end of Eve's potential. This is not a design-and-dump product. Hardcore Eve pilots know exactly why flashier younger spaceship sandbox games still don't pose a threat to the survival of Eve Online. Those games can never lay claim to Eve's core legacy: years of elite player ambition, investment, and struggle that makes a tangible difference in the game world.			",13,2,1,2,3,0,1

												This game is for jerks. If you're a jerk, you'll like this game. It's tailored so that you get ahead by being a jerk to everyone. It's like a simulation of real life. That being said, I love this game, I'm just not enough of a jerk. I would call them ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s, but steam censors that word.Here's my experience:-Learned the controls. They were super complicated which I loved. It takes a long time to get used to moving your ship around in combat and shooting. It takes a lot of know-how to fit a ship well, either through experimentation, or through reading a wiki. Deliciously complex.-Did missions to get money. Easiest way to make money in the beginning that I found. Doing combat missions nets quite a bit of money, not to mention the salvage operation you can do on the corpses of ships.-Got enough money to buy a good mining vessel. It wasn't huge, but it did the job well.-Grinded mining 'till I could afford the big boy. The massive mining barge. Yeah!-First day of mining, ship got blowed up. In high-sec. (If you don't know what high-sec is, it stands for high-security. Basically, if you attack someone or are attacked unlawfully, NPC controlled police ships called the CONCORD will come in, rather quickly, and blow the attacking ship into dust.) Appearently, this is a common thing. I looked it up, it's called suicide ganking. People outfit a ship to be strong enough to take down an expensive mining vessel quickly enough before the CONCORD get on them. The only goal is to destroy something that's more expensive than what you lose in the suicide gank. If you do that, you win.-Right after the suicide gank, the guy who killed me sent me a message. He said I was guilty of inattentive mining and mining without a ""permit,"" and if I didn't want other ""accidents"" to happen to my ship in his company's ""territory"", I should log online and pay his company some unreasonably high amount of ISK (in-game money) monthly. Say what you want, but this sounds like the mafia to me. The company that produces this game will do nothing, absolutely nothing, not a damn thing about these people. They simply allow it to happen. I refuse to play a game that supports the mafia.This game is amazing. I love it. So much fun. 'Till you meet a jerk or a group of jerks. And trust me, it'll happen. This is NOT an isolated incident.EvE - Jerks = Best Game Ever MadeEvE + Jerks/Mafia = GarbageEdit:I've gotten a lot of flak for this review, and everyone says the same thing over and over again in the comments: ""Don't fly what you can't afford to lose."" ""That's just the way the game is."" ""Stop sobbing over PvP."" ""Don't take it personally."" ""What a nub."" Or they end up giving me some arbitrary advice on how to play the game *properly*. I really wish people would read the comments previously placed before adding their own, so that they'd realize what they want to say has already been said.Yeah, I know that's the way the game is played, and I don't like it. That's why this is a negative review. It's my personal account of the game and WHY I don't like it.This is neither the first time nor the last time I was screwed over in the game, this is just the one that I remember the most vividly and pisses me off the most.This review isn't for the elites who know the in's and the out's of the game, it's for those who wish to start the game right now. The elites know the dangers of the game and know how to deal with and avoid them, but they also know how to screw you over. They know the loopholes in the rules such as the one described in this review. I posted this review to warn new players of the dangers the elite will thrust upon you. I warn you to either tell you to stay away from this game entirely, or be prepared to be ♥♥♥♥ed in the♥♥♥♥♥again and again and again. You will be screwed over in ways you couldn't imagine, and everyone else's advice to you will be, ""Get over it."" They. Are. Ruthless.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Despite my thumbs down, I really did enjoy my time with this game. So, why the non-recommendation?Because this game is at the point to where now it takes months/years to do anything that has any impact on the living universe. You can have your own little fun doing small missions and mining ore and killing AI, which really is all fun and immersive, but the fact of the matter is that if you come into this game now, you're already too late and the train has left the station a long time ago.The main reason I don't recommend this game is because of the leveling system. ""Skills"" aren't necessarily skill-based (though you will need to practice various ship ""maneuvers""), but merely time spent on downloading knowledge into your mainbrain (a la Matrix) so that your clone can use different ships or weapons. The higher the skill, the longer the wait, the better the payoff.I stopped my subscription after realizing that maxing out the ships and guns that I wanted to play would take about 3 years. Granted, the ships, guns, and modules that I wanted to use were more advanced, but as a gamer and as someone who enjoys stacking numbers in my favor, I didn't like the fact that I would have to play sub-par until my abilities were maxed out. Nevermind if I had any skill with a ship or was clever at manipulating the market; because of the lack of maxed skills in my prefered style of play, I wouldnt' do as well.If I had joined this game five or six years ago, I might feel a little differently, but after investing eight months into the game (two months just to get the slightest idea of what I would have wanted to/could do), I realized that taking so much time to make any kind of impact on the community as a player (not as a person, as I've met some very nice people along the way) wasn't very attractive to me.All in all, as a game, I loved my time in EVE online. I might have even stayed if there was a cockpit. The complexity of ship loadouts, the vastness of space, the epicness of battles (that I've never participated in), the realistic flow of economy, it all coalesces into a great experience...for someone who was there to board the train early.

												I've Been playing this game since 2010, on and off. I would take a break from the game but i would always make my way back to it.I dont know what its like to be a new pilot today compared to when i started playing but i still consider myself fairly new to the game, Although i can run an Orca with Tech II boosts i only can do level 2 security missions, The orca is an mining command ship that grants fleet bonuses to the party.In this game  you can mine the ice fields or asteroids, attack other players, do missions which are like quests, you can harvest the resources of a planet with planetary interaction, you can form corporations and an Alliance of corporations and declare war on other corporations or alliances and be able to legally fight anywhere without police intervention.The end game goal of the game is to be in a zero security alliance and own your own parts of space or team up with others to explore wormhole space and build your own structures at these places. At the end of your eve lifetime you could be flying capital ships or even a titan, but they take extremely long amounts of time to train for.In this game you level up your skills with time. Instead of experience points; you get a point every second which gets multiplied by whatever your attributes are. You can use a rare remap to change your attributes to learn certain things faster than others because so many different skills require different attributes to level up faster. The lower level the skill is, the faster it is to train it, up to a level of 5 for every skill. Movement in this game is not WASD movement with a keyboard, you right click something and tell your ship to approach or warp to, this is how you move around in eve. ",19,1,0,12,4,0,6

												Eve is one of the most amazing games I've ever played. Its single shard universe, player driven economy and risk-reward gameplay mark it out as something quite special. There is not much else currently like it, and its PVP is what has kept me playing regularly since I first started playing four years ago. I've sunk many, many hours into it, though they don't show up here since I've not launched it through steam until it's recent switch to f2p. I can't stress enough how much I have enjoyed the PVP in this game over the years.It might sound like a glowing reccomendation at this point, but it's important to clarify that what's kept me so hooked for so long has always been the player driven content, fueled by the interactions and conflicts that are possible due to the sandboxy nature of Eve. When it comes to content created directly by the developers themselves, well lets just say that aspect is very poor. The underlying game has changed very little since I've been here, and many so called improvements such as interface redesigns have been for the worse. They are obsessed with upgrading the graphics at the expense of stability, (I'd have been happier with annual graphics overhauls) and they are also obsessed with fixing bugs to the exclusion of almost everything else, especially new content. New content comes in drips and drabs with most so called expansions being awash with nothing but bug fixes. And, with so little content released, the chances are whatever they do add in any particular exansion will be irrelevant to you personally. In the entire 4 year period I played the game they added barely 2 new ships that fitted my playstyle to where I could use them day in day out.I can't honestly recommend it because of how little new content has been added to the game, and also how mind-numbingly boring all the PVE is. If I'm paying a monthly subscription to ""play"" a game I expect there to be some compelling content that makes me want to ""play"", and none of the PVE content in Eve is compelling enough to want to play for its own sake. After a couple of years in Eve the optimal playstyle is to log on for PVP and play other games the rest of the time.This led me to question why the developers even deserve my subscription money. After a lot of soul searching, the conclusion I reached is that they don't! Having had 13 years to come up with fun PVE I doubt that they are going to magically find their inspiration now. With the introduction of the cash shop it's in their best interest to maintain things the way thay are since this encourages players to purchase PLEX rather than spend their time making ISK through playing the game. I know from the comments that there are those who will read this and lack the experience in Eve to fully grasp what I'm saying. So let me attempt to clarify. I have access to highclass wormholes, incursions, and I have a good industrial setup, I have no problems making ISK if I need to. My issue with Eve is that none of the PVE in the game is compelling enough to play for the enjoyment of the activity alone. Eventually the activity is done for the isk alone. Hence grindy.Why am I paying to play a game I don't play? The compelling reason to play Eve is the player interaction, and that player interaction is not a resource that CCP have a monopoly on. I had just as much fun in Ultima Online back in the day. Any sandbox will do. I'm not paying £10 a month for a game where the developers think a ship and some bugfixes is an ""expansion"", nor do I think anybody else should settle either. So, while I've had a good run, I have decided to look for an alternative that has both old-school full-loot PVP, and PVE that is engaging enough to be worth doing for its own sake. Some have asked in the comments, if I love the game so much, how can I not reccommend it? Eve's biggest problem is its business model, it was created when subscription was the only viable option in town, and only a brand new game can overcome those problems. There are three other large full loot MMOs currently in development since the world is getting bored of WoW clones.Eve has taught me that the subscription model is dead. CCP has very little incentive to add new content, and that's exactly what's happened. Newer games that use a Buy to pay model are where I personally feel the future is in, since customers can buy once and play with no restrictions, developers are incentivised to add new content since selling new content is how they make their money, and customers only need to pay for the content that interests them. I know there will be challenges adapting buy to play to work in the context of a full-loot pvp mmo, but I think someone somewhere will manage it. And I am content to wait.Due to the old fashioned business model, CCP got complacent. So little content has been added to Eve over the years that I could actually be happy playing as an alpha full time. Alpha encompases the ships that I already spend 99% of my time in, despite having 80 million skillpoints. But why would I bother when I could play something else which offers at least the promise of new content.Regardless of my lack of overall recommendation, if you love PVP, crafting, or trading, then you owe it to yourself to try it anyway and make up your own mind.

												Ok so this will quite possibly be the most accurate review of EVE online. If you like fishing in real life you will like this game....No seriously I'm not joking. You wait long hours fulll of nothing or just talking to buddys then something happens, It might be exciting as pvp(aka catching a fish) or a as brain numbing as mining (aka more sitting while waiting for something else more exciting). But it'll eventually happen if you hate fishing....avoid this game. I know this is the stupidest review ever but you know I sadly found many who agree with me on this is rather accurate anology of EVE so I'm putting it up. I for one actually like fishing so back to the space lanes for me. Fly safe o7			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I'm playing EVE for 1 1/2 year... but certainly not for the game mechanics... I'm playing because of the corp I'm in.EVE has several huge problems :- It's very complex. You'll need 2-3 month to have a correct understanding  of  what can be done in the game (and there will still be huge points you won't  know about). Production,  Mining, Research  for T1 (material/time efficiency), Research for T2, Planetary Interraction, Exploration, Wormholes, Escalation, Incursions, Factionnal Warfare, Corp/alliance war, PvE and PvP  combat, ...  Don't expect to jump in the 2 weeks ""trial"" and have any correct idea of what EVE is- Skill learning is REAL TIME based. On some points, it's good, you don't need to grind your skills. On the other hand, it'll take months to get decent skills, years to get good skills and you will probably never pilot one of those top-level ships (Titans).  The skill system make sure that early players will keep the  upper hand.- To  make it worse, at a time, you could get Tech 2 Blueprints that could be used endlessly (BPO). Now, CCP switched to limited use Blueprints (BPC) that you've to research... this is great... except that they didn't remove the BPO giving once more a big advantage to older players...-  To make a better use of blueprints (use less time and materials to produce them), you've to research them. It  takes much time (to max up a Frigate (the smaller ship) blueprint, you'll need more than a month (2x19 days).  Again,  older players have their blueprints maxxed (maybe using less time that you'll need) which means that you'll never be as competitive on the market (except if you concentrate on smaller items)- Besides Mining and Planetary Interraction, there is a 3rd kind of ressource needed : Moon materials. Nearly all the moons that produce these are controlled by some mega-alliances which make them out of reach except by buying them (at an artificially high price) on the market. While the first materials can't be monopolized, the third one is quite limited...- Speaking of Powerblocks... the game is controlled by some big powerblocks (big alliances)... which are quite closed... you've nearly no chance to join these which means that your impact in game will be quite limited...- To begin the game, you've some assets (starter mission grant you a few ships and skillbooks, which is better than when the game began)... but to begin to really play, you'll need much ISK. Advanced skillbooks are expensive, same for advanced ships and equipment... which means that you'll have to grind for ISK in the beginning... Either by mining or by doing  PvE missions...-  When you're killed, you join a new clone... Except that any implant in your former  clone are lost. You'll probably need at least 2 clones, one for learning skills (with expensive +4/+5 implants)  and one for fighting (with no  or inexpensive implants)... To be able to create that second clone, you'll need to grind your reputation (standing) with one NPC corporation... which takes time.As you can see, there is an huge unbalance between older and newer players.... one that can never be negated (when you learn new skills, so do them, add to this advantages like the T2 BPO, Blueprint research,... As long as these are not addressed, I could *not* recommend this game to new players.If you still want to play, here is a few recomendations :- complete fully the  beginner's missions- you will be able to find several places in your part of the galaxy with the same beginner's missions... this'll give you some more ships/standing/ISK which will  help you much in the beginning- take some time mining with your Venture (you'll get it with the beginner's missions) in 1.0 or 0.9 systems (no rogue NPC) with some extra mining drones (mining->5, drones->5, these will always be useful)- at the beginning, think about ""generic"" skills (Spaceship command,  Hull upgrades, Mechanics, Repair Systems, CPU Management, Electronics Upgrades, Powergrid Management, Weapon Upgrades, Navigation, Warp Drive Operation, Afterburners, Cybernetics (3 or 4  in the beginning), Shield Operation, Shield Management, Diplomacy,  Social, Target management, signature analysis, long range targetting,trade,...) These will be useful  whichever way  you choose to follow (Mining, PvE,  PvP, Exploration, Distribution, Trading,...) as these will increase your survavibility in space, help you fitting modules on your ship and unlock a lot of other skills- stick  to one kind of ship : Minmattar, Gallente, Amarr or Caldari and one kind of weapon (Projectile, Hybrid, Laser or Missiles). You'll have time to learn the other one later- only fly what you can afford to lose... Each time you  get out of the station with  a ship, you may lose it... To an NPC, to a pirate gank (even  in High Sec), ...- Unless you're into  PvP, use implants +3 or +4  to  boost your skill learning (some mission will give you implants as rewards)- Choose your faction... Don't do missions for Caldari/Amarr if you have chosen Gallente/Minmatar.  Try  to grind a 8.0 standing to your favorite NPC corporation (make sure it has medical facilities) so you can create a jumpclone...- DON'T USE YOUR BONUS REMAP (well, wai for about 1 year before remapping, more bellow)After 6-7 month (minimum) and WHEN  YOU'RE SURE ABOUT WHAT YOU WANT TO DO, begin to plan your first remap. Most skills are likely to be Intelligence/Memory or Perception/Willpower. Your remap will allow to max out Intelligence or Perception, to get a decent value for memory or Willpower and reduce the other to lowerr values... So, choose which remap you'll do (ships/weapons => Perception/Willpower, production/research/electronic warfare/drones/... => Intelligence/Memory).When you've chosen your remap, only train the skill that use the other characteristics. For example, if you decided to remap Per/Will, train Int/Mem... keep in mind that you'll keep your remap for months (matbe a full year)... this will be 5-6 month training before the remap... after the remap, only train skills related to the remap.DON'T JUMP  TO  BIGGEST SHIPS.  Frigate/Destroyer/Cruiser/BattleCruiser,  Small/Medium weapons, only T1 ships (you may use some T2 modules, forget about faction/deadspace/... modules).  These will require  less time for the skills and are less expensive.And, try to find a good corporation. Avoid the ""gankers pirates"", they'll lead you nowhere  and there are plenty of good PvE/PvP corporations. Don't fall to these ""lotteries"" scams or to the racketteers... Fly safe.

												The game is great and has so much potential, unfortunately it has the most toxic community and devs I've ever seen in a game. While doing illegal activities in the game is a big part of the appeal and experience, some people take it too far. The endless ganking of newbies prevents the community from seeing growth as entire coalitons exist just to make the game miserable for everyone else. Not only that, but I've had friends who were new and I wanted to play with get ganked by these people in hi-sec and then repeatedly harassed by said gankers. When this harassment was reported (As it violates the code of conduct) the devs' response was essentially ""tough luck."" If you need further proof of how terrible the community is a quick trip to youtube will find a video of Mittani (the head of Goonswarm) give a presentation (attended by some people from CCP) and essentially tell the people there to go find a guy they've been trolling in game and make him kill himself in real life (He even gave out the dude's personal information) while the audience and CCP laugh on. The community and devs disgust me and I will never give them anymore of my money.			",186,38,0,51,35,2,44

												A long time ago I purchased this game, played it for a month and totally hated it. The game did not give me directions, or instructions and I think I was totally overwhelmed at the scope of possibilities that existed. I just did not know what to do with my character.Years later, i came back to the game, and decided I would give it more of a chance, by trying out different aspects of it and sticking to one I liked the most. I was lucky enough to find a small corporation with good dudes in it who introduced me to everything in eve, teaching me and giving me tips and hints about PvP, exploration, ratting, mining, industry, etc... After a while I decided that I liked some aspects of the game more then others and have stuck with it doing the things I like (mostly pvp and exploration). Now I'm an FC in a small nullsec alliance and I can't imagine not playing this game a few hours a day. It's literally like a part of my life, I can't imagine ever quitting EVE.Anyone who wishes to play EVE should know that. EVE will either become part of your life, or you will hate it and quit. I don't think there's a middle ground.			",149,25,3,54,24,3,81

												I was looking at this game for a while now and finally I was able to try it, and I'm definitely recommending it! Most of the recent negative reviews are just people being butthurt about the f2p model (Which isn't that bad as there is no pay to win like in some free to play games) and the subscription which is optional, although it is worth it - especially further into the game. The game itself is a true MMO sandbox with multitude of possibilities, mining, trading, producing goods, hunting pirates and much more as well as great PvP.And finally as a disabled gamer, I have to add that for someone with a physical disability, it is the most accessible MMO that I have ever played as everything can be done with just the mouse.Hopefully you will enjoy the game as much as I do and have a great day/evening/night!

												I have been playing this game for almost 6 months really trying to like this game.  I ran missions, explored wormhole space, station trading, Industry, PI, and mining.  However, I quit because this game is very focused on the sadistic side of human behavior.  You cannot prevent someone from killing you and taking all of your hard earned stuff.  You can avoid being killed for a short time but eventually you will be eaten by the bigger fish.  This is what they don’t tell you - this game needs new blood so that the bigger fish can consume you.  As a new player you are constantly flying around in fear of being cannibalized by others.  I can understand that you are better than me and you caught me and you destroyed my ship.  However, it doesn’t stop there.  After your ship is destroyed they Pod you (and they really don’t have to do this) and you have to start all over again.  The worst part is that people are constantly trying to scam you.  They say they want to help you but in the end they take advantage of you.  This is completely allowed - The game developers say this is the beauty of the sandbox mode.  I say it is “Lord of the Flies” in space.  A bunch of kids on a deserted island and all hell breaks loose.Sandbox mode?  Don’t think so.  How can this be a sandbox game when you are limited to where you can go, and do, as a solo pilot?  Yes, a few good people exist but you can’t trust anybody.  I live this in real life why would I want to spend my recreational time doing this?Final note:  The game developers (CCP)  have given-up on trying to resolve the new player retention problem.  CCP releases updates that only cater to veteran players - nothing to aid the new player.  The updates aid or assist the bitter vets complaints against null-sec or capital ship issues.  CCP has given up on fixing the tutorials.  They would rather have the existing players tutor the new players.  The problem is this is one of the worst MMO communities around - just read the forums.

												If you are coming from a game like FFXIV or WoW, there is one absolute that you must recognize: there is PVP everywhere. You are never truly 100% safe in this game unless you are docked in a station, and if you are docked in a station 24/7, you are either AFK or playing the market.You WILL get your ship blown up and you WILL die, its only a matter of WHEN it will happen. Your income dictates what you buy, because if you can't replace it easily, what good is the ship for? Fortunately, there are a lot of ways to make a living in New Eden.[www.alpha-orbital.com] You can jump in and do most things in high sec space without much skill, but for low sec, wormholes, and nullsec, you'll have to train your skills. And skill training can take anywhere from a few minutes, to a few weeks depending on what it is. EVE is a free time consuming game, but even a day 0 pilot can hop in and do PvP by joining one of the many large corps and alliances (Dreddit, Goonswarm, Pandemic) that specialize in helping getting even an a Alpha player fitted and familiar with combat tactics like tackling. As long as you are willing to put in the time to read, ask questions, and get familiar with the workings of the game, your time in EVE will be well spent.			",186,23,1,36,8,0,10

												i really hate doing this. i really thought this was my favorite game, because it is a GOOD GAME. im not rating it down because its bad. it just... doesnt feel satisfying. i never feel a sense of progression. even after getting my raven, i felt like a defenseless noobie. i was always on edge, reluctant to approach other people or mine in certain asteroid fields due to the fear that hours and hours, even weeks or MONTHS worth of gameplay can be lost because of some jerk that wants to take your stuff. if you really like that kind of game, by all means go ahead. but its hard for me to get invested in a game with that kind of community.i even thought adventuring to nullsec would be extraordinary and fantastical, but even that disappointed me. its just like highsec, except its filled with more jerks. i have to end up venturing through nullsec space at 3 in the morning to avoid all the people who get their income from spamming bubbles at warpgates and trapping those that just want to reach their destination. i thought i was enjoying this game, really. it only took me a while to realize i actually started to feel depressed, logging in less and less often to the point where its been almost a month since i last played. my plex is about to run out, and i spent these past 2 weeks enjoying other games with friends. i do not regret that, as it gave me plenty of time to shake off the anxiety that eve online gave me.EDIT: playing eve is like living in a crackhouse and holding up a neon lit sign that says ""if you stab me in the face, you may or may not find dope on my corpse""i will give crackhouses some credit since they dont seem to be killing each other as often.SUPER EDIT: the party seems to be in the comments section. chex mix and hawaiian punch for everyone!

												Eve Online is a great game. No doubt about that.But the problem with Eve itself is, that it may offer a ton of things you can do but the main problem is that it will take you a long time to really get started into something. The things you can do or make are massive, but considering the fact that the skill system is time based, you may only concentrate on one thing(for example: mining) and have to stay with it as something different will take a long time to be efficient or even -fun-.And speaking of fun, this game is only something for work-a-holics. Things to do take a long time, even plain traveling and there is not a lot you can do while it. If you want to have fun by blowing up other people or make money you will have to literally work for it and I mean this in terms of waiting, waiting and calculating.To skip those waiting processes or do tasks that are meant for multiple persons, people tend to buy multiple accounts and to keep them alive, you either need to A) purchase gametime or B) farm several hours (maybe 10-20 with GOOD skills) to get a plex. The combat system is slow and this is intended as this game will set you up with people around the globe. But to be honest, there is not a lot of how you can influence the combat with your own skill. What counts are simple decisions and Skills in term of In-game idled skills.So if you really want to play Eve consider taking a lot of time or money to be efficient. And if you want to get out in 0.0, keep in mind that you probably will just end as a 'fighting drone' for some Alliance. ",158,28,7,16,14,3,24

												EVE is a good game.  A hard game to learn but still nice.  It can also be very unforgiving but still a ok game.I do like EVE and the whole aspect it brings with it but a problem I found with it was I spend a lot of the time playing EVE doing nothing.  It sounds weird but it feels like sometimes your wasting time when you could do something else.  To get a good headstart into the game, it's recommended to get a read up a lot of the content that EVE throws at you because the learning curve of EVE ramps up very fast.  When you have done that, chances are it will seems pretty empty and joining a corp will be your best bet to staying in the game.Joining corps also brings in new problems. Chances are if you are new, you might have no idea of what the corp does or what wars are going on and you find yourself floating as a dead corpse in cold and unforgiving space.  If you had read all the core guides on eve, you might have been able to avoid dangers.TL;DR: Elitest game, can't recommend.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Eve is a phenomenal game.Playing it for me was like watching star wars for the first time. It's like entering a universe previously unseen to you before and getting encaptured in its ways and lore. Everything about the game is perfection, there's something in it for everyone. Want to ravage the lonely spaces of Low sec as a pirate? Want to mine minerals and make a profit? Want to explore the deep fringes of space looking for galactic treasure? Or maybe you just want to do it all. There's something there for everyone and the amount of possibility is endless. I highly recommend this game, if you like any sandbox MMO this is for you. Well worth the monthly subscription.			",91,9,1,18,11,0,11

												EVE Online is a truly unique experince. There never has been, and likely never will be an MMO quite like this one. EVE is truly a massive game, with around 8000 star systems and all players on a single server. Most people who have heard of EVE have probably heard of the massive battles involving thousands of players and destroyed tens of thousands of dollars worth of internet spaceships.DO NOT JOIN THIS GAME EXPECTING TO TAKE PART IN THESE EVENTS YOUR FIRST FEW MONTHS! You will likely be disapointed. First off, massive fleet engagements are few and far between, and when they do happen, they usually slowed down by the games anti-lag mechanic ""Time Dilation"" or TiDi for short. This is where the game will slowdown up to 1/10th its normal speed so that it can calculate everything for everyone at the same time. And massive engagements amount to ""Listening to whoever is in charge of your fleet telling you who to lock, and press F1 to fire your weapons.""Capital and Supercapital ships in the game, like the Iconic Titans are more trouble than they are worth most of the time. They cost massive amounts of ISK, can take anywhere from three to six months to even fly them, two or more years to use the effectivly. They truly are an End Game to EVE, something you decide to use after you can use most other ships.Now this isnt to say that PVP in EVE cant be fun, quite the opposite. PVP can be incredibly challenging, yet fun and rewarding. It can also be quite costly as loss is real in EVE. When your ship explodes, it's gone for good. Experince is the best thing you can have in small group, or solo PVP.  there are hundreds of different ships in the game, all requiring different skills to fly, and have different strengths and weaknesses. There are no ""Best Ships"" in the game, they all have their role, and some do it better than others. The Meta in EVE is constantly changing, and what is good one update, may not be in the next one.Always remember the Golden Rule in EVE: ""Never Fly what you cant afford to lose""If you dont like the risks involved in PVP, there are several other things you can do in EVE.Mining is slow, and boring. but is constant and reliable cashflow. The ore you mine can be sold directly or used in Industry to create items and ships. And like most things in the game, it's better in groups, where special ships can boost the yield of your mining ship considerably.Industry takes time, but can be incredibly lucrative. Almost everything a player uses in EVE, comes from another player. from the small and agile frigates, to the massive Titan class vessels as well as space stations are all built by players who combined raw materials, blueprints and time to build everything.Exploration has a lot of luck involved, and can take you out deep into hostile space, but you can find ancient data sites with data cores containing valuble information useful for Tech II Blueprint research. Relic Sites containing valuble salvage, Combat sites guarded by pirates which can drop valuble modified modules worth huge amounts of Isk, or nothing at all.Mission Running is steady, and fairly safe work where you take contracts from an NPC Corporation to complete a certain objective, like killing NPC ships in a certain system. You can collect bounties from these ships, as well as the loot they drop as well as payment for completing the objective. As you do more and more jobs for the same corporation, you can eventually take on tougher contracts worth more money.There is much, much more in EVE online, and there isnt much stopping you from experincing all of it, only time. EVE is an online game, and everything in the game is better with friends. Find a corporation that suits your playstyle and join them. If you get bored with your playstyle, change it up. doing the same thing day in and day out will make the game boring. When the game becomes a second job to you, it's time to change what you're doing, because it means you arent enjoying the game, like a game.And remember,Fly safe. o7			",25,0,0,5,8,0,3

												On it's surface, EVE Online doesn't seem to be a very ""Immersive"" game...No voiced dialog; a steep learning curve; unforgiving gameplay; limited Character Customisation; you can only walk around in one empty room in the entire game;  other players are just profile pictures with descriptions and stats; there's no real storyline; there's not even a way to manually pilot your own spaceship. Yet, somehow, at some point you begin to view your own universe as relatively less Immersive compared to EVE. You'll find yourself complaining that your entire life is spent on one single High-Sec system's planet, wasting your precious time in tedious tutorials on how to make money in a ruthlessly competitive world of confusing spreadsheets and market fluctuations in the endless pursuit of ever-climbing costs for your technologically-dependent way of life. You'll notice that people no longer speak, they just become dehumanised slaves to one corporate entity or another, each trying to validate their existence with some esoteric expression of individuality. None knowing what they really want, but everyone repeating the same mistakes, standing on the broken backs of others, in their fruitless attempts to attain it. Watching every transitory obstruction between you and your elusive happiness give way to another two greater barriers, you eventually look back and say: ""I could be playing EVE"".

												After a year of being abused by many players and pirates, I think it is time to write a detailed review or an impression of the psychological rollercoaster I went through.Eve Online is identical to real life in my opinion. You are thrown in there with little to no instructions. The learning curve is tough. You could end up mining for a guild, oh♥♥♥♥♥♥ I called it a guild, you might be shunned if you call them guilds in this game, they are called corps. Where was I? Oh yeah, you could end up working for a corp as a miner to get the ship you wanted after a very long time in the safest spot or you could end up being a pirate hunting the same miners you could have been. It most likely depends on your skills and how much time you are willing to dedicate to such a game. Why do I say that? Learning skills takes real time as opposed to game time. Skills would start building up in your queue from 3 Hours to months of real time. In case you read this far and you are wondering if it is a casual MMO, no it is not. It is rather hardcore and this is coming from someone who is not all that familiar with MMOs. Anyways, just like I said, you could ultimately do whatever you want to do in this game. Planetary exploration and material extraction, piracy, logistics, Mining, whatever. It sounds very exciting initially but it takes a really long time and money and effort. All that effort can go down the drain however. If your ship gets destroyed, all those upgrades you have spent time and blood and sweat on would go away in a heartbeat, but that's not remotely all of it. Your character's pod is thrown into space and you have to get your pod to the nearest space station to find another ship before someone destroys your pod and... Well, your character dies and loses all those skills you spent real life time on. I am repeating myself with the real life time because it is just so ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ frustrating.I honestly didn't expect myself to get into a game like this, I didn't expect to get into it for a long time. I rarely enjoyed it but it was like staring at pandora's box from afar, it seems so interesting your curiosity gets the better of you and well... You spend 100+ hours into it getting into more than one corps the same way you apply to a job. Perhaps even more humiliating. Getting into a corp is not easy, they interview you, sometimes skype you and assess if you are the man/woman for the position. It almost sounds crazy, and I assure you, it is when you end up hearing about people being humiliated in chat rooms filled with at least 200 players that watch a man get naked on webcam to get a position in a corp. That's how it is in the world of EVE, it sounds really interesting from afar just like the notorious battle that had thousands of players pit against each other, but when you actually get into it, you want to leave and never come back.Perhaps I got one good thing out of it. The love of Ambient music. A year ago, I was never a fan of music that fades into the background and helps you concentrate. EVE's soundtrack is full of that. It helps the players enjoy their sweet time digging into their menus for countless of hours to EVE's soundtrack. It was well engineered to the point where you feel lonely and it is scary out there when you are traveling and expect a pirate to strike you down even in the safest spots. Ironically, the first time I encountered an NPC drone, I thought it was a pirate and panicked and abandoned my ship only to find out later that it was part of the mission. I don't think I have anything specific in my review regarding the technicalities of EVE, but I was just surprised and my expectations have been greatly exceeded by what I saw there, and I was sure it was not for me. At the same time, all I can write here are my impressions. I finally left the game after realizing it was inevitable for me especially after a pirate corp threatened the mining corp I was in. I actually stayed with that cop for about a month or so, and it was newly formed. Later on when the pirate corp threatens it, members of my mining corp started arguing and all I could do was observe. I was a spectator the whole time and it was, admittedly enjoyable to see my own corp's members argue and argue until some of them left and it went down the drain. It's just so amazing how things could change ther-- YOUR SPACESHIP IS BEING ATTACKED,WAT? YOUR GUN IS FROZEN, YOUR SHIELD HAS BEEN JAMMED.... WHY? OH GOD PLEA-- *boom* Pod is still there, guess I can go and grab another ship and build millions of isks instead of buying PLEX cards with real money (60$ give or take) to get back the same ship I had with the same upgra-- *respawns* *pod destroyed* ..... *quits game* *uninstalls*10/10 would quit after a year and be haunted by it for the rest of his life			",358,230,0,55,7,3,27

												This game caters to the griefing crowd and hardcore PVPers. There is PVE in the game, but the developer has no sympathy for you if you want to pursue this aspect of the game. If you want to play the PVE part of the game, even in high sec space where you are protected by NPC ""police"" (aka CONCORD), you are going to be fodder for clever players who work around the broken systems that supposedly protect you. Because CONCORD is currently broken, high sec space is full of suicide gankers, griefers, etc. Some sociopaths in the game prey on newbies for kicks despite this supposedly being a bannable offense if it occurs in ""newbie"" systems. I have reported a bunch of players for doing this and never seen any bans resulting from it. CCP just doesn't give a damn.Low sec space is full of gankers and pirates. Null-sec space is dominated by a single Alliance. The developer has actually been caught clandestinely helping certain Alliances in the game. Considering how much Alliance equipment, stations, ships, etc is worth if their ISK (the in-game currency) cost were translated into real life dollars, the developer helping an Alliance destroy others is unforgiveable.Because of the skill point system where skill points generate over time with no way to accelerate them other than juggling your stats it takes a very long and tedious amount of time to develop a character, and you will be very weak compared to veteran players with no way to ever catch up. Sure, you can specialize, but it still takes months and months and you are fodder in the interim.Unless you like tedious boredom (e.g. mining, manufacturing), being ganked or you are a hardcore PVPer or social miscreant itching to vent your sociopathic impulses on others, EVE is not the game for you.

												i actually recommend this game just about as much as anyone else in my alliance does but i do not recommend buying this game through steam due to the fact that both steam and ccp fail to mention that the subscription plan system in steam only allows the use of a credit card and will not allow steam wallet points or paypal to be spent to buy subscription packages instead of plansyou are allowed to use the PLEX (pilot license extension) system in order to continue adding more game time to your account once you first activate it but you will be entrapped in an infinite spending cycle to keep your account active henceforth, like shackled to a chain you have to sacrifice your account if you want to hybernate or until you get a credit card (which as far as im concerned is the most outdated, most dangerous unprotected e-system we could possibly use)as long as this dangerous issue remains it is ill-advised for all steam users to buy this game or its subscription system for the foreseeable future, if you are still interested in the game and have the luxury to spend with a credit card system (that can and has been hacked across the world already) then you may use the main website of eve online at;http://www.eveonline.com/?&&gclid=CjwKEAiAp_WyBRD37bGB_ZO9qAYSJAA72IkgCP2MloLsTU8G4e6oxHJ_cfPEKLes6m07y9VKE3Ud6hoCjHXw_wcB&gclsrc=aw.ds&dclid=CNX4iPrmu8kCFQcYRQodR9EG_A or with steam (although as i see it there is no difference since you cant take advantage of the steam wallet points here, you may as well do yourselves a favor and buy in the eve website for a slightly cheaper fare instead of paying steams lazy staff for not fixing this problem since its inception.)advice to steam and ccp: a quick and simple solution is to allow the use of both the subscription plan for credit cards and a seperate subcription package system for people fortunate enough to avoid the fate of credit card users, obviously the marketing department is being paid too much for their laziness and lack of foresight.

												Endless space to explore, Ultra-detailed graphics, a tons of ships and stuff, giant battles.This game is the best space MMO the world ever seen: you can be a pirate, a mercenary, a businessman, a explorer....you can be everything as you want. In battle, is the same thing: you can prefer to fight with guns, lasers, bombs, missiles; you can choose to fight with good planned strategy, or a hit-and-run, or a rush.You can create your corporation and take a part of space where you can create your personal station, hangars, lab, and etc.At the end, this game stole your hearth if you play it. 12/10			",20,1,2,1,2,0,0

												As much fun as this game could have. It has no sense of community and encourages backstabbing. If that appeals to you then all the power to you. If getting crapped on by russians all day is your thing then head on down to null sec. Overall, at times i miss it, but then i remember how its impossible to enjoy if you arent part of the biggest groups or willing to be a jerk.			",207,30,4,32,12,1,25

												“It was the best of games, it was the worst of games.”EVE online is a massively multiplayer online resource management, economic simulator, tactical / strategical space combat social sandbox video game. You don’t play this game because you enjoy every moment, you play it because you know that at some point between vast vistas of emptiness something may happen that changes in-game history. That you may be a part of that change. You play it because it helps refine and maintain skills that you can apply in real life. You play it because you are a part of it as much as it is a part of you. If you come into EVE expecting a game with your goals clearly defined and the ability to assert power through in-game mechanics then you have set yourself up to fail. Much as the EVE wormhole led mankind to New Eden, EVE Online is a portal through which we the players are thrust, left to create a narrative that transcends the confines of the game client. EVE is unforgiving in that you may find yourself stuck forever in hi-sec performing mundane tasks, leading you to have a poor experience. But likewise if you have the motivation, the focus and the dedication you can learn how the game works and exploit it to your benefit. Just as Veldspar is an in-game resource, so is the miner who gathers it. Governing bodies are formed by real people, held together by real networks and real ideals. EVE Online is a game that demands the player to think 5 steps ahead. To prioritise and to plan. To think for themselves. For some this is asking too much. For others it is the only game worth playing.10/10 would think for myself again.o7			",97,22,1,22,13,0,7

Newbie story: How I found bunch of great items!I was like 2 days old alpha clone and after learning basics I've accepted a mission, where I had to deliver explosives to the pirate base and leave prior to explosion.Of course, I did not read the whole description of the task, so I went in, approached the pirate base and BAM - big explosion lighted up my screen. I was still being able to click'n'stuff, so I wasn't really surprised, but after the light from explosion dimmed, I discovered there is a wreck very near me - with a bunch of great items, turrets, ammo and massive amount of gear.I was so happy! You can't imagine!....only to discover that it was the wreck of my destroyed ship, lol. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												It's too much like working.  I have to pay per month to play, going up against battleships that take like literally a year to train up for.  constant 5% bonuses per level of dozens of skills, which takes actual weeks to get 5 levels on.  And here I am, playing against 1+ year people who have like 20% better shields, armor, guns, etc - not to mension seemingly unlimited funds.  So these bonuses to their crap makes a 1v1 situation impossible.  Most of the fighting is in a blink of an eye, small frigates (the only thing you'll be flying for a while) are super squishy and usually targeted first.  In addition to all of this, it's completely pay to win!  People buy plex on the market (1 plex = 1 month gameplay = 1billion in-game currency).  So a plex costs around $10-15 and people don't hesitate to buy these and sell them.  I played for 2-3 weeks and was bored, it was literally like working rather than having fun.  I made about 300million isk in this time and i was focused on making isk, exploring nullsec is the best way.  It's extremely boring, tedious, campers everywhere, multiple accounts just to get eyes on a ""neutral"" and follow them around to gank...  People will camp a spot for DAYS just to get one kill on some random person.  I love sims and mmorpg's, i thought i'd be instantly addicted, the pay-to-win just is a deal breaker for me.

												First, I would like to address the people that downvote this game.Many people that have downvoted this game believe that CCP is lying when they say its ""free to play.""  Well - it is, to an extent.  They show that extent in the video (Free players can only pilot up to T1 Cruisers.)  It is not a marketing stunt.To the people who say this game is boring - well, it can be.  In my opinion, I believe every MMO can be boring.  This game is a sandbox, it is exactly what you make of it.  You get out of this game what you put into it.  I have had a very fun time in this game, with a lot of PVP fleet battle action like in the videos above, and when even mining or exploring.  Its a very great game that allows you to carve your own unique experience in any way that you would like.I am currently a pilot in the FCON alliance out in null sec.  We have been having a very enjoyable time - making a ton of money, and killing a ton of players.  We built our own stations, our own citadels, our own POSes.  We harvest materials from the planets and the moons.  We explore the wormholes.  We mine.  We harvest gas.  We mine ice.  We mine some more.  We build ships.  We play the market.  We pilot gigantic ships.  We kill NPC Dreadnaughts.  We kill NPC Titans.  We kill NPCs.  We fight players that invade our territory.  We invade the territories of others, and fight them there.  We destroy others stations, citadels, POSes, ships, etc.  We pillage and grow our coalition.  I dont know any other game that allows me to do all that.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Hellow fellow gamers, I have been reading many many reviews on this page. And sadly I feel especially about the negative ones that they still misrepresent what it is actually about. Let me start of by saying. This is a good game but its not for everyone. Maybe saying its a game might actually misrepresent it. Maybe this should be categorised as a ""HOBBY"". Its not a game you can learn in a minute and play it for a few weeks and then toss it away because you finished it.My game time numbers are not accurate. I only made it go up this far so I could finally write a review about a game which has been inducted into a museum as the largest living sience fiction artwork in the world.To be precise I have no clue how many hours I have played this game but in the multi thousands over the past 8 years.So what can you expect of eve? - Simple a game so complex that CCP (the developers) have hired people with PHD's in some of the most complex fields in the world to oversee certain sections of the game. Like one of the most popular former developer CCP_DrEyjoG otherwise known as Doctor Eyj­ólf­ur Guðmunds­son. He led a entire team of economists to help monitor eve onlines ingame economy.- A game where you can become whatever you want if you put in enough effort and willpower.- A game that can give you life long gaming friends. - a game where the developers try to be as uninvolved as possible. Meaning almsot everything goes. But CCP will only step in if certain boundries are broken.- a game where you can be part of the largest battle in gaming history ( This comes with a side not these generally only happen once a year sometimes only once every 2 years. What negatives will you get?- immensly steep learning curve. ( BUT with the Hire of CCP ghost Also a Doctor btw. They are trying to create a New Player experience that will teach you all the basics propperly. This after more then a decade of a lackluster new player experience that caused many players to never get through it.) I count this as both a positive and a negative.- A game where every loss matters. Meaning that if you lose your ship its permanently LOST. - A game where people will scam you. What I am trying to say is, I guess this game is like nothing out there. If you find the right people to fly with you will always keep playing it on some level or another. If not you will probably dispise it for some reason or another. But if you give it a real shot and you go in with a open mind and willingness to learn and to be part of some awesome stories created by your fellow players. You will come to love the gameFor everyone who would wanna try it feel free to contact me. Ill help anyone who is willing to put time into this game. Or Ill answer every question you can come up with. I own every ship in game up to even the most expensive and powerfull ship class in game. So enough experience to share. So if you are hesitant about the game feel free to contact me ask questions. And I hope I can convince to join us. Manditory vid to watch for eve online:This is Rooks and Kings.

												I have played Eve for a long time before I had to stop for personal reasons. And the game is AMAZING. This game can offer something for every type of player. You like to fight get the right ship and wreck some pirates. You like to trade get your selfe a hauler and trade away. You like to mine get your selfe a Mining barge and melt some Astroids.But why a negative review on a game that is apperently so good?The negative review is not because of the game or what it has to offer but because of the way it represents it selfe in Steam.Its placed among the Free to play games. but its not free to play.When I was looking through the free to play games and found Eve I was absolutly stoked, finaly I could dust of my Retriever Mining Barge and  get mining again. But when I logged in I found that free to play doesn't mean free to play in Eve. Free to play means ""hey heres your tier one ship get hooked and give us money"". Sorry thats not Free to play thats a demo.If you like MMORPGs and you like spaceships and complex gameplay, eve is defenitly worth a look but don't be fooled that it is free.			",109,15,0,13,18,1,17

												It's just not fun anymore. It's an endless MMO full of very challenged individuals and being part of a top tier ""elitist"" alliance doesn't make it any better. The game is more fun in frigates messing around playing casually, but even then, the game is very 'n+1'. You bring 2, they bring 3, you bring 10, they bring 11... Who can blob the hardest wins most of the time, and that for me isn't fun. If you get sucked into the social mechanics of eve, just quit and remember games are meant to be fun. Let me save you 3000 hours, go play 300+ other games, make friends, talk to people, go outside, get a hobby. I'm lucky most of my game time was with the game in the background for 3 years doing nothing trading or something whilst I did more meaningful tasks with my time... p.s. if you do decide to get stuck in, go trade, it's stupidly easy to get rich in a few days and pay for your account. Plus you won't ever need to farm, rat, or grind anything.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I just reached three years since I started playing this game back in 2013 (steam hours logged are barely a drop in the bucket of my total playtime) and I've really gotten the chance to experience a ton of what this game has to offer. I've enjoyed a ton of what this game has to offer, primarily with PvP and making a decent bit of cash to enjoy the playstyle that suits my wants. Overall the community is nice and diverse and there's a group out there for everyone but finding the right group is rough and often burns out many from sticking with this game. Content updates are always coming to this game which is a great addition along with decent communcation between players and the developers on the regular. There are drawbacks to the game such as the grind to get money to afford being able to use nicer ships and modules along with skillpoints if you cannot afford to inject skills with in game cash you've earned overtime. Regardless of that though, I love this game for everything that it has and I'd highly encourage everyone I know to at least give the game a shot regardless if they end up loving or hating this game. 9/10, would spend three years of my life playing this game again.

												This game will: - Challenge you- Irritate the f**k out of you - Test your reflexes- Test your descision making- Test your patience- Test your intelligence- On occasion make you BORED TO TEARSYou WILL get ganked, you will lose hours of effort when your first ship (or two, or 136) gets popped,  but you will learn from every single loss. You will probably rage quit (twice), but you will always come back. This is not a game for casual players, this is a game for dedicated gamers that want to give themselves a genuine challenge. If you think world of warcraft was a challenge, skip this. WoW is hello kitty island compared to EVE.However, if you can get past everything I just mentioned, you are in for one of the best open world sandbox games that has ever been made. Full of people that will kill you, then politely tell you what you did wrong. People that will help you (if you are friendly) with anything you need. People that will sink hours of gameplay with you hunting down pirates (and you may not even find any). It's not for everyone, and it's for anyone.Fly safe pilot! P.S. I apologize if you run into me and I kill you, but you will be a better player because of it, I promise!			",62,5,2,10,1,0,2

												Can the game be fun yeah sure sometimes most of the time its boring,aggravating and out right hostile no not the game play the players (never have i heard so many colorful insults and i didnt even know hello kitty online was a thing until every single person who tried to attack/destroy my ship in game demanded i leave and go play it.... I dont know why). Well heres a pros/cons list from what i have found.Pro - Large scale fights  - Interesting game powered drama stories - Modular ship systems (items that can effect almost every aspect of your ship) - Deep ship systems (many of the modular items for ships have multiple upgrades and side grades) - Large map - Tons of jobs/things to doCons - The community is VERY VERY hostile (Many i have found will jump on you for no reason (thats fine) and then when they fail/succeed in destroying you will start to actively harass you try to aggravate you and finally tell you to GET OUT and stop playing (go play hello kitty). - Certain job/types of work in game are actively hated/attacked by the community. Good luck if you like playing PvE or want to be a miner (which results in a TON of con #1) - Corps. They are the guilds of other games this normally is a good thing playing with others is great  until they ask for a full 2 to 3 page in game resume and to read your in game mail. - Lack if up to date info for game, nothing like looking online and in game for 3 days for a item they removed and not finding any info that it was removed (be prepared to sift through posts and sites for info that is 5 to 7 years old, many dont have time dates good luck) - Boredom around 100 of the hours steam said i was playing i was actually asleep most of the time that came from sifting through the ENDLESS number of charts ,graphs, lists, and trying to find proper ship parts. - Low sec there is almost no reason to go there as it is (there's very few things there that you cant do everywhere else in hi sec, null sec, wormhole) but many will tell you to go there anyway and when you do you get hunted down (thats fine its a part of the game) which results in con #1 if you tell the people who advised you to go to low you dont want to go there again (as there is no point in doing so) you get a TON of con #1. Thanks help chat/corp chat.I hope this helps when deciding whether the game is for you or not.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												EVE Online is a space MMORPG set 20.000 years in the future, with a great background story and considerable ammount of science-fiction content, even some unique features in the genre like character immortality through use of mind transfers between clones, use of advanced cybernetics and man/machine interfaces. It uses a passive character progression system that lets users accumulate skill points over time while their subscription is active, the ammount of points collected in the various categories will determine how effectively a character will be allowed to perform any of the multiple in-game professions. Players can extend their subscriptions with their credit cards or with EVE Online timecodes (PLEX), which can be bought and then traded for ISK in the in-game market.Unlike other space simulators that place the player inside the cockpit of their ship, EVE Online features a tactical combat system, where capsuleers take remote control of their starship and its systems to engage in a variety of activities, from mining to manufacturing, trading, pirating, factional wars and even large scale space sovereignty wars between corporations and alliances. The in-game market is mostly run by players who mine, research, manufacture and trade all types of goods available in stations and player owned structures, from ships and modules to weapons, ammunition, fuel, ore, combat boosters, augmentations, among others. All sorts of trading scams and other types of conduct that normally would be forbidden in other MMO's like market manipulation, infiltration, espionage, theft and grief, are not only allowed but also encouraged by the developer, who uses the player stories emerging from those events as a marketing tool.The single shard universe (Tranquility) and large scale battles of up to multiple thousands of players in the same instance are one of the features that make EVE Online unique in the space MMORPG genre, but they are only possible at the cost of 1Hz server ticks, time dilation, reduced graphics and physics quality, among other architectural limitations that make some people opt for other newer and technologically more advanced space MMORPG's on the market.Throughout it's 13 years of existance, CCP Games has expanded some aspects of the game, the most notable ones probably being sovereignty wars, wormhole space and factional warfare, but has also failed to develop and deploy promised features like Planetary Landings and Walking in Stations. These failures resulted in tremendous community backlash, a couple waves of mass developer lay-offs and millions of dollars down the drain. A pattern present in multiple former CCP Games employees' company reviews https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/CCP-Reviews-E159347.htm points to upper management neopotism, employee favoritism regardless of competence and stubburness in constantly trying to reinvent the wheel with miscoded in-house tools instead of using tools with proven value in the industry. A few isolated cases of former developers being threatened to ""have their carreers ruined if they were to reveal the companies' plans to further scam their customers"" were also reported. The original developers who wrote the game have long ago departed, and the care-taking janitors working on it today lack the creativity to innovate. The upper management and CEO's competence is questionable at best.The company has tried to expand the EVE Universe into platforms other than the PC, namely with the now extinct Dust514 shooter on the PS3. Despite community opposition, CCP Games signed a PS3 exclusivity deal with Sony and scammed its playerbase, as Dust514's development was funded by EVE Online subscribers who were not interested in acquiring an obsolete piece of hardware to play it. Other side projects like EVE Valkyrie and EVE Gunjack have recenlty been spawned, also funded by the main game and money making product EVE Online, in a continued effort to expand the Universe to other platforms and Virtual Reality HMD's. Going all out on VR development, the company had as of 2014 invested more than $USD 40 million in VR Research & Development (yearly financial reports used to be available @ https://www.ccpgames.com/company/financial but were recently taken down after CyberChaosCrew brought them to the players' attention). A questionable move considering that VR is at this point an expensive gimmick with questionable future in the gaming industry.CCP Games has recently and controversially hired various former EA employees for key roles in the company, appointing one of them as Vice President for development, and shortly after a few others for Executive Producer positions in the new projects, namely EVE Valkyrie and Project Legion (now Project Nova). It has since adopted changes to its business model, including cosmetic item monetization and features like the skill point injectors and clone states that give players in-game advantages in exchange for money.Time will tell if these options will bring the EVE Universe many players and an endless revenue stream that will fund great things to come, but CyberChaosCrew chooses to remain skeptical until further developments and does not recommend people to spend their time/money with EVE Online.

												Been playing for 6 years now.  The only downside to the game is if you make it past the first 120 days without quitting, you will be an addict for the rest of your life.One of the many upsides, I have been playing for more then 6 years now have not scratched the surface of all the game has to offer.  And that's not for lack of trying.I highly recommend this game, but don't expect it to be easy.  This is a game that takes time, practice, willingness to learn and strong willpower to play.

												Been playing this game for 4 years with a complex love/hate relationship. It is an amazing game and your experience will vary greatly depending on your personality and luck in terms of who you end up playing with.On one end of the scale you will find nice people that will help you get over the amazingingly complicated learning curve, on the other end you will find nothing short of Sociopath Online.You don't/shouldn't play this game unless you have a thick skin.If this game wasn't on the decline so badly I would leave this review on positive but at this point considering the monthly subscription fee I would stay away.

												I play this game since late 2009 and up to now I still have a hard time describing the game to people that have never played EvE before, let alone writing a review about it that does justice to EvE!In short, you either love EvE or you hate it. This game is not made for the casuals that just wants to have some quick fun in space. This is a hardcore unforgiving MMO where it is possible to lose everything you worked for in the game (years of work even) in a blink of an eye. Surviving and thriving in EvE is an intelligence game, if you mess up and make a mistake then there are thousands of players that immidiately will try to take advantage of it. And the same goes for yourself as a player, your goal is to take advantage of other players in the game for profit and that does invlolves more than just ship combat. EvE is a beautiful but harsh universe, it is unforgiving and unfair, it is filled with tears of the weak, danger always will await you in space.  If you are cool with all that and are up for the challenge then you should really try the game out. You might love it too! Edit: grammar			",148,11,15,23,22,2,29

												One of the best scifi/space MMORPGs available! EVE just had it's 10-year birthday and it's looking better than ever. CCP Games has updated the game constantly with FREE expansions, adding more and more content every time.7,500 star systems, each with their own planets, asteroid belts, stations, wormholes etc. Economy that is fully player driven. Huge corporations ran by players, some part of larger alliances, some trying to make it on their own. Many different professions ranging from military to industry, business and exploration.Quite high learning curve, requires a lot of micro managing when setting up ship builds, choosing which skills to train, scanning treasures with probes, mining asteroids, calculating safe flight paths.In EVE, your character keeps training new skills even if you're offline and it's almost (I think) impossible to ""reach the max level"" - or learn all skills. That would take years.After a trial period you can pay your gametime with money or with in-game currency ISK.This is the only MMORPG I always come back to.			",380,92,4,58,29,6,42

												2 years ago, I was one of frustrated newbies.Factors making difficulty- Not support my national language- Complicated and uncomfortable UI (For example probe scanner, overview)- Countless guides about various departments- Quiet local chat window and invisible Players- Not enough money - Nobody gives me jobs after clear tutorialI realized that this game is too hard and I cannot understand gameplay in a short time.But, I didn`t want to give up playing this game.because I know EVE is considered masterpiece by many players.I read and read many guides on website and tried many things.The more I play EVE , the more I can understand game system.And I can feel true value of EVE for the first time.I think these make EVE masterpiece.- Stable market economy- Fun game fictions and nonfictions- Many contents hidden around- Various situations in pvp- Fleet battle- Experience Overwhelmingly important than skill point- Meeting with Opponent who may be a friend or an enemyThis game is best to me.Especially, PVP makes me so crazy!!!I wouldn`t forget the moment that I received a first solo kill mail...I recommend this to those who can afford to play long term with patience.★★★★★ 5/5			",95,32,4,9,11,2,16

												Eve is a player content game with a real-time leveling system. This means two things to new players. There is no possible way to catch up to older players. And there is almost no player verses environment content. Eve is a massive PVP game with players either engaging in or supporting PVP battles or conflict. If you are not in pvp then there is mining, exploration, trading and production. All of these are to support the pvp battles. As a new player you will have no chance of success in pvp on your own. Eve's real-time leveling system means you don't have to play to level your character. It also means you can not speed up your characters training. Because of this, as a new player, you will not be able to defend yourself against an older players attack or go pvp solo. This doesn't seem like too much of a problem at first because there is almost no new player training. So, you will be spending most of your time trying to figure out how to use the game mechanics and finding the limited training available in game. In the mean time your character will be leveling skills that your not sure are right. However, there will be players chatting you up willing to teach you and even more players recruiting into corporations aka guilds. I would suggest you lean heavy on youtube videos for your game mechanics training. There are many to choose from some much better than others.The answer the players and I guess the GMs have come up with for the new player pvp problem is that you join a corporation and be cannon fodder. It works like this. You equip your rookie ship with a device that can hold a player of any level or experience in place and then your ""friends"" warp in and make the kill. You will be killed for sure. But, that's all you can do and will be able to do for quite a while because of the training system. That's it there is nothing else you can do in the pvp area.That leads to the other roles in the game. Mining, exploring, trading and production can be done solo. You will need to train these areas to be any good at all and that takes real time. This is where those videos come in handy. You can watch them while you character is leveling. ""that's what I did and still do from time to time"" There are also help chat channels where you can get ok advice and better resource information like what website has the trade info you can't get in game. The game has a lot to offer and leaves a lot to be desired. Like the lack of PVE content. There really isn't any pve content except for the professions trainers and the profession agents. They have about ten different missions at each level and they are the same no matter what race or corporation you get them from. Doing missions gets you loyalty points that are only good where you earn them. They get boring very quickly because you have to repeat the same missions quite a bit to earn enough points to get anything good. If your looking for a good PvE game then look somwhere else. If your looking for a good craft / farming/ grnding game its not to bad. If your looking for a PvP game to invest a lot (several months depending on how fast you figuer out what skill are needed) of time waiting for your character to level skills and trying to figure out the game itself then I guess it would be worth it. They say Eve is a niche game and I guess thats true. Alot of the players have spent years trying to develope their characters and don't want the game to change. The developers have done just that.This is a post quote from a  long time player concerning the PvE side of the game. I thought  it should be added. I dont know how long it would take to get to this point but, after the initial rookie missions grinding you can do what is described below.""1: Do missions for one of the thousands of agents in the high security systems, earning money for better equipment, rising from level 1 agents up to level 4 agents as time passes.2: Do exploration, finding areas of interrest in the galaxy, and trying your best to exploit those areas for things to sell back at a starbase.Mind you, there are other things to do, but these two things are what I would define as action oriented Content in Eve.At some point during these first weeks or months, you start to figure out that there are a few more things to do, which would be the Eve equivalent of ""end game content"".1: Level 5 missions, which is group oriented missions, using the same approach as level 1 through 4. An analogue would be ""dungeons"".2: Incursions, which is a system wide alert, as a pirate faction moves in, locks down a system, and tries to kill everything. These Incursions will spawn areas in the system which are geared for anything between a few pilots working together, to dozens of pilots.The equivalent would be ""raids"".3: Wormholes. These are systems ""off the grid"" so to speak, with combat (and exploration and mining) quite a bit harder than what you would find in normal space. You could compare these to ""Elite areas"" in other games.Keep in mind, none of what you do in Eve can be truly classified as PvE, since at any time, you can meet other players with hostile intent. It is like playing on a ""PvP Server"", with no safe zones.""			",12,0,0,2,3,0,16

												Hehe, a review for EVE. Where to begin?..........To be honest, there isn't a good place to start. The game is huge. The amount of things you can do are almost endless. Wanna go inside a wormhole and take your luck against the rats? Good luck. Go exploring in uncharted space? sure. Attend a high pitched battle consisting of 700 odd players because someone threw a fit over rights to a moon? If you're in the right alliance, go right ahead.     In the 13 years that EVE has been around, players have made history in the world of gaming, from the largest battle ever created, to some jackass diverting a force three times the size of his own in order to save a 4,000$ titan. The reason why these things happen is because of the complexity of the game. There are a 150 odd ships to choose from, hundreds of ways to fit each one, and the best part is, they're diverse. There're mining ships, ratting ships, PVP, exploration, capitals, and each one is bonused towards it's intended role. There's politics that affect each player. Recently there was (and still is) a war between an alliance called goonswarm and thier allies, and everyone else. The npc empire Amarr just hosted games in an effort to find the next heir to the throne, after their empress got killed by enemy ships. What I'm trying to say is that EVE is essentially a living, breathing universe. There is absolutely no reason why you'd get bored.     Alright, so are there some negatives? Yeah, a few, at least in my opinion. First things first, the learning curve is steep. Like, Mt. Everest steep. It might take a few days to get the hang of it, but there're people that'll help you. There's a help channel where your questions will be answered. That's probably the greatest thing about eve: the community is the most mature audiance I've ever been a part of. Another negative is the fact that you have to have certain skills to operate certain ships/moudules. All told, EVE has about 20 years (give or take) worth of skills. It'll limit you in the early stages of the game. Not by a lot, but it will.      Overall, this game is outstanding. There is no other game like it. Elite Dangerous doesn't even come close. If you can afford 15 dollars a month, I'd recommend it. Also, don't forget the 14 day free trial.			",23,1,0,3,16,0,2

												This game is very boring and unforgiving - especially to the new players. There are players in this game that will try to take advantage of you so beware. Fly around, shoot things, dock. Fly around some more, mine some roids, hope you don't get ganked, dock, that's about it. Training in this game takes a LONG time, especially with the high-end skills, they're also very exspensive.The recent gate animations that CCP put in are just plain ugly. The cargo bay expanders no longer add to the ore holds in the mining barges making mining take twice as long now. It's just a couple of things I noticed before I left and never went back.The missions can be very difficult sometimes, with, or without another players help. It all depends on what you can fly and what type of skills you've been training in. It also depends on what type of mission you're trying to take on. If you try to go through, let's say, a level three mission with just a rifter by yourself, you're going to lose your ship. CCP likes to put the missions on repeat sometimes, it'll be the same ones over and over again.You will get little or no help from anybody unless you're in some type of group, even then, they may or may not help you. Never, ever, go off into low or null sec by yourself, especially if you're new to the game. You're ship will more than likely get blown to pieces and you'll probably get podded. High sec is a bit safer due to the concord (security) ships flying around.Unless you've been playing EVE from the very beginning, you won't get very far, just be prepared to yank your hair out - a lot. This game is all about taking a step forward and the suddenly having to take about  a hundred steps back.No one is to be trusted in this game - NO ONE - the players in this game will turn on you in a heartbeat if they think they can get away with it. EVE politics is basically about screwing over the next player before they can screw you.EVE is pretty, it's a beautiful game to look at, other than that, there's really nothing remarkable about this game at all.

												EVE Online is probably the best MMO i have ever played. There is literally nothing you can't do in this game. You terrorize carebears by being a Pirate. You could be an industrialist and take advantage of those pirates by selling them ships and modules at marked up rates. You can explore the depths of space like no other, visit the 2,000+ unknown wormhole star systems on top of the 7,000 known star systems. A lot of ISK can be made by running Incursion sites with a fleet filled with friends. New Eden is truly one BIG sandbox and it is incredibly addicting, definitely worth the $15 a month. NOTE: THIS IS NOT A SPACE FLIGHT SIM. If you are looking for that then this is not your game to play.			",109,11,6,8,35,1,38

												Eve is not a game for the faint of heart, it will chew you up and spit you out. It wont hold your hand and tell you what to do and where to go. You play how you want and choose where you go and what you do. Its a great game once you realize its a player driven game and you can't make it in the cold depths of space with out some friends.

												A great game but don't expect it to reveal itself in scope until you are fully in the game (maybe three months). The community is not great towards new people, but thats because more often then not new people simply leave before they stick around.Bad reviews come from two types of people. - The ones who wanted to change the entire universe by simply logging in - The ones who didn't understand what game eve is, and will be for the forseable future.

												EVE Online is so realistic of a space simulator that it includes all of the daily drudgery and time-sucking elements of real life. The visuals are absolutely stunning and it definitely feels like a true space game, but the learning curve is massive and the gameplay itself can be EXTRAORDINARILY boring. I really do wish that EVE was more rewarding to people like me who enjoy video games but also, you know, have a life and career outside of them. I love beautiful/immersive space games but I can't justify wasting my time on this.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Am Long time EVE Online player. As whole you start out and first thing you'll notice is all the menu and option windows. You will think that all menu and window confusing at first but once you set a path for yourself you'll find that menu and option windows be less scary. Once get a grip to how all menu work you'll find that game itself is GREAT FUN!. They say that get into larger ship take very long time, ""THIS IS NOT TRUE"". If you know what ship want to fly you can spent the skill points aiming toward that ship and not mind taking points in any other skill. As you start out you will get skill points given to you AND get 14 day booster that help with skill training. A good pilot will be able go from day 1 in friget to day 30 into battle crusier AND by 1 year you'll able to fly a full spec out battle ship with all trimming, ""even fuzzy dice hang from window of cocpit"".Graphics: 89%, no matter what you do in Eve online it always looks pretty.Music&Sound Effects: 71%, audio on Eve online is well thought out and rare thing, full 3d sound and can even hear your engie on ship running and rawr of rocket heading toward you.Controls: 90%, Eve online is point and click game for most part BUT can custom build key bind to whatever feel you need it to be, want buttion that fire all weapon? you can, want buttion that lock all enemrys? you can.OVERALL: 98%, Eve online wonderful game that can be pick up very quick AND even after logged off from game, your char still continue on with buiness getting skill, making money off market, building BIGGER BETTER MORE POWERFUL SHIPS!BAD POINTS. I could suger coat this and say Eve has no down side but it wouldn't be real review so. EVE Online has many down sides, specialy on Steam. I found that could buy 1 plex off steam store, am sure will be fixed at somepoint. Like I said above Eve has alot menu and option windows, I try open all windows once and found was 73 windows just in docking area, it is nightmare trying bring up market window, buy item and move item to ship hanger which might put alot players off, ""not me however"". Eve online to Eve Steam online, this I have found be very odd thing, Eve online support service I found to be VERY FRIENDLY but when say your steam user thing can get abit confusing. I try ask number of question about this and found lack of info to be SHOCKING!.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												TLDR :-A game so deep, with incredible mechanics that are actually a monument to both capitalism and basic human instincts.It's a sociology treaty in itself, and would be worth at least a paper on it .-Market is the most advanced in the whole gaming world.-Chronophage as hell.....but most of that time can be spent doing something else.-Frustrating for new players b/cof quantity of informations......But a new tutorial, renewed interface and helpful corporations come to limit the problem without erasing it tho.-Variety of roles you can play-Human interactions only limited by our own imagination-Gameplay could use a bit of dynamism, but in major battles individual skill is merely useless. Teamplay, preparation, and choosing the time and the place for the fight with the right focuses is the essence of PvP.-Pve fun at higher lvls.-Plexes I think i'll start with a major problem for new players, that has actually scared them to the point of quitting early.Eve online is a colossal work, with an obliterating waterfall of informations you need to keep in mind.Either you start keeping notes from the beginning or you're gonna forget about it the third day because you've been swamped by second day plethora of intel.That's actually both awesome and frightning.About that, the old tutorial honestly did nt help much: It was messy, not always clear, not always informative, and if you did nt read some missions you could lose everything you had.I'm thinking about a mission that gave you a ship for the very purpose of loosing it to Pve pirates. If you did nt read that you had to change ship for it, you were pretty screwed.Happened so many times you can t imagine ...Chatting the poor guys to stay was kinda sad.Since this game allows you to be W/E you wanna be : Pirate PVP, trading expert, industrial expert, mining monster, scout and many others, tutorial needed to cover the basics for the majority of possible roles.Well, they finally did a decent one now, so scared players can come back to give it a shot because it does what's expected from it. Even interface has been refined a bit, just enough to be noticeable, and it's good news.A second point worth talking about for newcomers is the community.About that, Eve community realized they needed new players to keep the game living, and many of them created corporations focused on helping rookies.Obviously, some of them are less effective and focused than others, but in that case there is one you can't miss :EvE University. They're gigantic, which could mean they can't focus their attention on the single player as much as a smaller one, but you're sure you're gonna get at least the basics, and you'll find someone to talk to at every hour of the day/night.Now that we've established the game got better for new players, i'd like to keep giving you hints on what's coming for you once you learned the basics.Research for example, which will be your bread and butter during your whole experience.Altho the game gives you the opportunity of choosing your race, and background, giving you an idea of what type of ships and weaponry you should use, these choices are not definitive.Indeed, thanks to the research system, you can decide to play a Caldari character b/c you like their look, while driving Amarr ships and their weaponry because you like lasers and good looking ships only for a small loss of time due to the initial research, and it will be adviseable to change system to amarr in order to have better chances of finding your modules on the market there than Caldari spawn.But that's just the beginning of it, because research will determine what kind of ships you can drive, and you'll be able to specialize in the role you wanna play. Guides on classes, roles, ships, and research orders are available everywhere.And the wiki is colossal.Then , when you've decided what you wanna be in the game, the researches are already going, and you're ready to play the game you'll need to make money to support you.Doing Pve missions, mining, trading will be your first choices as pirating might need a higher level of research, ships and modules.But you can actually find other ways, such as being a mule for someone that is hiding for some reason...With a small and low level ship you have less chances to be of any interest for pirates or any other things you can find a way to leverage over a higher lvl player.The game is only limited by our own imagination in the trading sector.And if you're a little impatient, you can buy plexes.Plexes are game time, that you can either use, stock, or sell for what will be a loooooooot of money for a new player, much more than what 15 euros might lead you to think. (in wow 15 euros are worth nothing in comparison).And when you have to trade those, it can get really dangerous, which is why i mentioned the mule thing earlier.If you have many plexes to sell or to stock somewhere safe you have either the choice of winging it, risking to lose real money, or to pay for an escort, or to have your own army within the corporation, or....using a very low level ship for more concealment.If the IG market were nt incredible enough for it's time, plexes and IRL usable money made it perform even better. Stupid prices are limited b/c there is always someone that will sell it for something less, because of the urgency factor, and so many other relevant things such as economies of scale that lead the market to be the best performer in any MMO and game in general.With all that, you can gleen from the context that eve online looks like an excessively time consuming game.It is. Chronophage as hell.Some Researches take days, weeks, and even months to be finished.Mining you whole cargo capacity takes hours, depending on the quality of the mining module and obviously the volume of your cargo.But it's meant that way. You can play while researching, even go to sleep or quit playing for a week, and the research will be done even if you re not logged. And it doesnt concern very new players, as the first levels of research are very quick.As for mining, well, you can go to sleep, i'm not sure about the logging part tho.But again, as a new player you don't have those mining monsters, and your cargo will be full pretty fast.And finally i'd like to mention Pve , PVP, and gameplay related review.As for Pve, many players like it as it is. I personally think of it as a little boring since the gameplay itself is nt very dynamic. But in the highest level i know it gets much harder, and you're swamped even with a honourably slow gameplay.For all those who were thinking about elite dangerous, or playing eve with a joystick,sorry bros, forget it.Eve is about activating the right modules at the right time, as energy is consumed, and you have plenty of them, turrets included.But i guess if you're ok with that kind of gameplay, you're about to discover an incredible game.I'm pretty sure in chess knights don t neight and towers don t shoot fireballs when you move them.Yet, its still one of the most advanced games in the world.PvP is probably the most exciting part of eve online. PvPing alone can be fun, but the best part is clearly in group.Corp vs Corp, pirates vs miners and their escort, destroying economic, industrial, and research stations to weaken enemy's production while you wait for the final blow are actually just little examples in the wide range of tactics and strategies you can employ in the game.While gameplay could admittedly be funnier, more dynamic, when you participate these encounters, that's just the last thing you think about as you realize individual skill in a major battle will never be enough.Pinning them in the right place, at the right time, with adequate modules to pin them, slow them, suck out their shields, with adequate forces and teamplay is the essence of pvp.

												I've been playing this game for about a month. Very involved. There's a lot of planning and strategy required if you plan on playing this for the long haul which is the type of game this really is.  There are multiple styles to play: Pirate, miner, indutrial a little of both. Tons of options, training and ther whole environment is fluid and live.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												TL;DR EVE is a phenomenal game. There are many reviews out there that will give you a sense of what you can expect of the game, so I will spend my time detailing some useful pointers to those who are considering playing the game for the first time.One thing I have to get out of the way:______________________________Do NOT buy any of the 'add ons' you see advertised on Steam. Anyone with experience in the game can tell you that the items they give you in the add ons are not in any way special, and even a newbie can afford these items fairly easily with money you earn in game.Also: know that if you create an account through steam you will not be able to take advantage of buying and selling characters on that account. This is not an issue for newer players but once you are wealthy enough to be buying characters you may find it an annoyance.______________________________So some advice if you do decide to pull the trigger and join EVE:- Do not consider mining as a career. It is an acceptable and easy way to make small sums of money as a new pilot, but does not lead to the type of glorious and engaging gameplay that makes EVE so incredible. Too many newbies pidgeon hole themselves into mining, this either ends in extreme boredom or unsubbing the game. - Sure when you begin the game you will have to spend some time training skills and it may be a bit boring in that initial month. Do a bit of research, join a decent looking corp that does something other than mining, and have fun. This game pays off immensely for those who are patient and persistent. - Do not look at the capital ships and be discouraged it will take you 120 days to fly them. This is not a game where bigger is always better. The biggest ships in the game are very limited in their practical use, there is tons of fun to be had in all sizes of ships.- Try to avoid the temptation to spend money on PLEX to buy ships you can't afford, this just makes it hurt that much more when you lose them. You will lose ships, you will feel bad when your pride and joy is destroyed. The fact that you can lose almost anything you have is a big part of what makes the game so compelling.- If you find yourself unhappy with what you are doing or the corporation you are flying with: do something different! Join a new corp! There are TONS of different things you can do in this game, and there are groups of people out there who specialize in all of these various activities. Joining the right group can make the difference between playing for a month and unsubbing, or being happy to play the game for years.- If something sounds too good to be true, it is. There are many scammers in the game, anyone offering to double your money is one of them.- Do not think you are perfectly safe if you are in high security space. People willing to sacrifice their ship can still attack you. They will be dealt with by the NPC Police, but they will still be able to destroy you before that happens. Always be on your guard.- Do not try to play this game solo. As an individual you can have an impact on the game, but you will probably not have much success trying to do it alone. Again, the social aspect of this game is a big part of its draw and having a great group of people around you to share in your successes and failures is really what makes the game so fun.I could go on, but in short: if you like spaceships and the idea of joining a game where your ability to succeed and make your mark in the universe is only limited by your ambition then EVE is definitely for you. You will experience crushing defeats, and glorious triumphs. All of it in a universe completely run by players in a way that will amaze you more and more as you play the game.			",67,4,0,9,4,0,6

												I love space... movies, games, books, youtube videos, if I could snort space i would. That being said I never played a game so mind-numbingly boring as EVE. Missions consist of clicking a button repetitively with warp cinematic sequences in between. Sometimes you have to right click and select ""Loot All"". Then off to the next errand. If I was into running errands I'd vaccum or do something useful like that. To maximize frustration, the gui is lackluster and not very intuitive. Some people swear by it, but I just don't get it.

Product received for free
Rank: 6/10Recommendation(s): Have a sizeable wallet, don't play any other games.Major Theme: A good solid respectable title, but it's Steam integration is odd.Bought at Price: $0 (Exclusively trial play time)When this title originally came out, I can see why it was such a big hit. Being able to explore space, do what you wanted to do, and have a living and breathing universe (on a reasonable scale) was quite attractive. Now take for granted that Star Citizen is coming out, Elite: Dangerous already came out, and EVE has already been out for sometime, there are quite a few reasons to play and not play this title.Let's start on the pros, why on earth (or this universe) would I want to play a game like this. Obviously this title isn't for everyone. There aren’t any “shoot ‘em up” parts to this game. Action isn't really a thing for this game, unless you do mange to get yourself involved in a big battle which rarely happens. However, from the perspective of someone who's interested in Economics, exploration, mining, production, building/engineering, this game could be the game you have been looking for. I find it quite difficult to find a computer system where this game won't run on. This is a signature trait of MMO titles, being able to run on even the most toaster-like of toasters out there, you shouldn't have an issue getting into the game.Speaking of MMOs, there are some important variances you should be aware of. First of, character customization is one of the best, if not the best I have seen put out. With a very solid 3D engine, the graphics do the character customization a great service, and then the players a great service.

From the portrait, to the neck line, to the eyes, the detail for character customization is out of this world (Ok... Ok... I'll stop with the space jokes) but in all seriousness, even the most seasoned RPG/MMO fans would be interested in the options this game gives. Sadly, you don't really interact at the character level, but rather the portrait level.So after you spend the hour or so picking out the right pose for the portrait, and all the back story, you will be happy to know that you can go get some sleep after you set some skills to train. That's right; skills can level up while you are not actively playing the game. This is again, a very unique part of EVE: Online. Having a ""set and forget"" system allows the player to focus more on the interactions in the game then grinding away mining senseless ores purely for levels. With the API CCP offers, you can find plenty of ways to micro-manage you account with up to 3 characters -- if you are into that. Planning for the long term is an attractive thing for both sides of the table.Getting off the main features of the game, the mechanics are quite balanced. I can't speak in depth about exploration and others, but for sure the mining and production parts of the game are well built. The variance and justification of the pricing for minerals, ores, and so on, it's unique and makes it evident that economists are at work here.Now with all the raving I've given the game, how come I ended up giving it only a 6/10. There are a few reasons for that.First off the bat it's a subscription model. That's right, monthly payments. Granted there's a complex sever system that needs to be maintained, $12 to $17 a month, that's really two AAA titles a year or more. I don't find myself spending that much in a single year on games, maybe you the reader of this review do, but with the quality of the games now, I simply can't find justification to spend about $150 a year. I completely understand that any upgrades to the game come to me for free, I just don't know if I could really play 1 game exclusively for a year. Maybe you do, but I find myself switching between titles all the time, and getting a momentous amount of play time out of all of them. If you can't really decide if you want to do a whole year, you could always do 1 month and then purchase an in-game item to extend your ""fly time"". In theory, you could play the game for free if you make enough in-game money to purchase the PLEX licence to continue your play time. In reality, this certainly isn’t going to work out for most people playing without significant game time behind them already.Hopefully it doesn't seem like I'm nagging on about the subscription model, but there is another key point to bring up. You can't really transfer your subscription between Steam, and then to CCP's own game launcher. The licencing system seems to be so vastly different the two can not be intermixed. So if you are getting sick of Steam for some reason, you won't be able to dump it if you purchase EVE though Steam (or the other way around).Beyond the subscription model, you will find out quickly that there isn't a whole lot to do as a single player. Joining a corporation is the way to go, but unless you a willing to put a lot of time in, it's not worth it. Perhaps as a dedicated MMO player you are willing to put a massive amount of time into it, you won't have issues, but as a casual player, it's appears not worth the fuss.Updates don't add a lot to the game either, unless you were to bring up the ""station walk"" update that miraculously disappeared. If you are a dedicated EVE player, then you targeted for the updates, as you get the most out of them. But as a player starting out, the updates provide little to no significance. All the core features are in the game, and there isn't really that much to add in the ways of core game mechanics or experiences. Evidence of this is ""capsular apartments"". Sure they look nice, and add ""flavour"" to the game, but otherwise it's just another way to access things you already had access to.

As you may have been getting the feeling from this review, there isn't really any middle ground. You either play the game exclusively, or you don't play at all. That's why I find the title being on Steam quite odd, where the ease of hopping from one title to another doesn't work with EVE.If you are willing to dedicate yourself to game, then I would strongly recommend the game. If you find yourself doubting and unsure (just like myself), you will probably end up finding it's safer not to subscribe, move on with your life, and wait for the next major title worth purchasing.There should be a “Yes, I recommend this game*” with you being able to explain the subtle issue with it, but I have to throw my vote into the Yes hat purely on what the game has to offer.

												Eve is an interesting game and it has some  beautiful space vistas and ships, but unfortunately it's the players that will make me not recommend this game to anyone I know. I might still tell them it's interesting but it is time consuming (almost like a second job) and many of the other players like to grief players who mine and do pve. They call it ""collecting tears"" and it fuels their sociopathic tendendies to blow up other players minding their own business (like mining). Then there are some others like a group called ""CODE"" that employ mafia tactics and force players to pay them to mine in systems. They are some of the most delusional and sociapathic people you will meet in any game, because they ""gank"" blow up anyone not paying them and call it ""justice"".  There are many others like this that will blow you up for no reason and call it ""fun""Skills also take a long time to train and there is no quick way to make money in the game unless you scam people, which is another ""accepted"" thing in Eve. Some players  harassed another player in real life to the point of a breakdown and they recorded the entire thing for a laugh but sadly no criiminal charges were pressed and the offending player is still playing. I do not recommend this game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												If you decide to invest your time in eve, know this, you're going to be thrown into a world teeming with content and other players going about their business. You won't have any clue what's going on, or what you need to do. And honestly, that doesn't change, I've been playing the game for two years and only know what I chose to specialize in. It will be overwhelming at first, but if you dedicate yourself to learning just the basics of the game, and find some friends to help you, you'll have a rich gaming experience awaiting you for as long as you decide to play. But seriously, don't try to solo this game, at least find some strangers in game to start playing with. Otherwise, you will cry, and you will quit.			",118,10,2,7,10,0,13

												This game is my go-to when I need to sit back, pretend to relax, and instead add scary amounts of stress to my already stressful day - and love it.It shouldn't have to be said that a love of space, spacehips, and fantasy in an MMO make EVE a perfect fit for you, but it should be said that the universe is only the framework - it is the individuals, your alliances, the friendly deals with corporations and the open acts of war with another coalition that drive the content of the game, everyday. EVE Online is not for the immature audience. Though the immature type has been known to find a place in the circlejerk of griefers and gankers that is found in New Eden, it is those with true-life skills in leadership, strategy, distribution, espionage, intelligence, diplomacy, education, industry, and philanthropy that make up the bulk of the universe. And it is THE universe - a single server full of hundreds of thousands of players spread across thousands of star systems. Every action you take has the ability to impact players you may never even meet; every new conversation may be a new relationship that pays dividends immediately - or years down the road. Only you can decide what kind of immortal spaceship captain you'll be with the actions of your choices. Dictator, or Savior. Pirate, or Protector. Villian, or Hero.This is EVE. You get to decide what titles you employ, and what they mean to you. As we say... EVE is real.			",46,0,0,8,0,0,3

												EVE Online is no bad game. It´s just no game for me.I love space and Sci-fi themed games and the stunning visuals got my attention.So I got myself an account and after a prolonged Character-creation I was finally ready to take on the vastness of space.But then I realised I got myself a space-themed Excel program. Fighting doesn´t rely on personal skill or cool maneuvers.It all boils down to the skills you selected for you avatar, your equipment and some point and klick...Just like WOW.And that killed it for me. I like to fly MYSELF. I want to learn stuff, test maneuvers, crank my Logitech 3D Joystick to the limit as a human being. If I want a character to level and to learn new skill at level up I play an RPG.I really tried to like EVE. The visuals are great, the ships are stunning to look at and the idea, that I play with thousands of others on ONE server is mindboggeling. You can pursue multiple careers like miner, trader, explorer or start your own corporation.But in the end it feels like ""point and click, my Char has skilled Multi-Lazor-Megadeath and I have the legendary Rocket of Boom equipped, so I win.""

												Oh goodness, eve is on steam now. Or was it before? Huh. Been a capsuleer from back in '04 when I fired up my first character. Had a Love/Hate relationship with eve for the last decade. I hate that I love it, and love that... well I dunno. It is like that abusive relationship that you keep coming back to. I have quit, lost Billions of ISK (the in game currency), been killed a couple times, all for simply undocking. Is the game hard? Oh yes. Harder than drunken calculus. It is more difficult to understand the nuance behind some of the PvP combat than it is to talk your way into someone's bed. It is unapologetic, unrelenting, and does not even OWN kid gloves. Unless you talk about that poor baby goat that the developers may have sacrificed. I guess those could be ""kid"" gloves, just not like they normally would be described.Would I reccomend the game? Of course! I would love to see more new pilots fly through my home system, and blow them out of space. If you can get past the (litterally) crazy player base, and find enjoyment in the difficulty, it will be fun for you. It is NOT for everyone though. It is not even for a significant minority. Sociopaths will love the game, as will economists (is there REALLY a differance? Lookin at you economists) for the economy, run by players, is insane, and fun.Download it, take your ships for a spin, get blown up, and decide for yourself, do YOU want to be that pilot, blowing other pilots up? Tough. They have probably been around far longer than you could imagine. Find a good player-run corporation, and go from there. It IS fun, I promise.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												You will likely love this game if you are:- Independent & Motivated.- Goal Oriented.- Outgoing & social / Enjoys playing MMOs with other folks on a daily basis.- PVP minded and does not fear permanently loss of ""items / gear"".- Strategic minded / prefer RTS or Strategy type gameplay.You will likely not enjoy this game if you are:- A Loner who prefer keeping to yourself even in MMOs all the time.- Passive mindset and seeks the game to prompt you on what to do next.- Risk averse (afraid of getting ganked and losing stuff).- Too serious and takes every smacktalk in local or lossmail personally.- Action oriented gamer who prefer twitch/reflex gameplay. About this game:-EVE is really boring when played solo without social groups. Please join a good player corporation ASAP!-Graphics are pretty but you may be forced to turn down settings to increase performance in large fleet battles.-Combat is not exactly ""action packed"". Excitement is there in the form of adrenline pumping when you are hunting or being hunted by other players, not when you are doing the usual ""Approach, Orbit, Shoot"" combat system.-Player communities are awesome with dank memes and propaganda during wars.-Dying in the first few minutes of fleet combat can be a very sucky experience as you now have to reship and rush back to the fleet alone while avoiding opportunist hostiles waiting along your return route to gank you. -Making isk is quite a boring chore, if you are a new player you may want to buy PLEX instead.-Developer is known for introducing new features and leaving them unfinished to chase after the next shiny idea.-CCP support is still very bad at responding to your tickets in a timely manner. Tickets that go unresponded for weeks is still common BUT they are usually very good at compensating you for the wait. (i.e. Poor response speed but excellent support)Good luck and fly dangerously! o7			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I find this game to be very immersive and complicated and the Tutorial does a very bad job at keeping new players interested, but once you get past the initial stages of the game its a very rewarding experience.Eve Online and Texas Hold Em poker are the only 2 games that give me an adrenaline rush, and this is because of the risk involved. If you die in Eve you lose everything you were carrying with you especially if you have implants (in game item that are every expensive and increase how fast you gain skills) it can be very expensive. Some people might think this is a bad thing why spend 100 hours playing a game if you can lose everything, but if you ask me thats what makes it fun.I tend not to pick on other players and try and be helpful whenever I can but in Eve hardly anyone is like this, expect to be ganked and attacked everywhere you go. (They say if you stay in high security space your safe, but in my experience if you carrying over 100 mil worth of stuff people will attack you even there.)Another part of what makes the game unique and different to me is that this game is like the real world. The universe is a big place and a lot of people are already established and powerful, and just like in real life you are a nobody, getting dumped into a world full of billionaires and cut-throat competition with hardly any resources or help and expected to make your own way to the top. This is a breath of fresh air over most games out there where everyones a hero in an even level battlefield where skill matters more than time invested. Yes its going to seem unfair that 10 year old veterans with all of their skills are going to beat you, but what makes it most satisfying to me is that feeling of always having to watch your back, and that adrenaline rush you get when trying to escape from someone or battling away in space or the marketplace. I have spent many years in Eve, I have many more hours than Steam displays since this game was released years before the Steam Store even included Eve, I can tell you this. Eve will seem boring at first to most people, but there is no other game similar to Eve out there, with a persistent world economy thats actually good, and a shared universe with so many people on the same server. Sometimes I feel most MMO's don't deserve that label, they all have heavily instanced maps and they are more like small group party games rather than real MMO. Might aswell give Eve a try, theres an option to play it for free with restrictions to try the game out, to be honest, its a very good idea to play using the free account anyway until you have maxed your skills, thats more than enough time to decide for yourself wether this game is worth the subscription fee.

												EVE Online is one of the best true-Sandbox MMO's currently on the market. It has some of the best graphics and in-depth skill systems I have ever experienced, and has among the most intense player vrs player environments that can impact any level of game play.Alternatively, the game still is plagued with a slow skill progression where every player is stressed with how to make the best use of each of their 30 day subscriptions. Although the ability to ""play for free"" is a possibility players must invest both real time and real money, often times with multiple alternate accounts, to even come close to affording such things regularly. The harsh realism of space, and the hauntily similarities of the game to real life can make EVE online a ""Real Job.""If a monthly-subscription simulation game with periods of dull conflict punctuated with infrequent mass conflict from a ""Top-Down"" real time strategic perspective is your thing then EVE Online can not be beat. Though the harsh reality and learning-""Cliff"" of the game can be a detractor for many that can provide substantial sense of accomplishment for those who brave it.As such, I wouldn't recommend this to everyone, just those who I feel fit into the very selective audience that EVE Online has grown accostomed to over the years. For most, the game can come off cold and unforgiving, though for the others the game can be and is a true gem that is unlike any other.			",153,30,1,23,16,4,31

												I've been ""playing"" this ""game"" on and off for a decade now. It's definitely not for everyone. But you're either going to love it or hate it. If you love it, you'll think about it all the time and even if you decide to quit it will still pull you back in eventually. Sometimes it feels more like work than a game so try your best to keep reminding yourself that it IS JUST A GAME. What can you do in this game? Pick your favourites, or even do all of the following: Kill dangerous pirates (NPC badguys) Kill other players Explore hidden and forgotten sites for treasure Mine vast fields of asteroids/ice/gas Place colonies on planets to extract valuable minerals Manufacture or Research ammunition/ships/drones/equipment etc. Complete missions for a wide variety of NPC corporations Create a personal Corporation that you decide how to manage  Erect space stations of your very ownPlus so much more that I'm sure I've temporarily forgotten. And you can do it all alone or in a group. Don't worry about the subscription either. After you get the hang of things it won't take you long to make enough in game currency to fund your new addiction without having to pull out your wallet.This game has so much to offer and has many aspects to it that appeal to many play styles. Do yourself a favour and give it a try.[secure.eveonline.com] ",247,70,6,34,33,1,63

												Patience. patience is a virtue and many have it. many dont have it. Some dont have and a game like this calms them down. this game did not do it for me. BUTi do see alot of good in this game. this game has been out i believe since 2003! and it shows big time! absolutely beautiful game all things considered, i have never said that before. to who it may concern this is something special.BUT the community is old too and it shows. i met plenty of nice, informative, helpful, people but being new in this game is not fun or profitable and the skill tree for just dealing with real people is too deep for me. i come from a FPS background and do not have the mindset that EVE people have. that is why i will not be purchasing another month. not because of the price or somthing like that but because i dont ""fit in"" for lack of a better term. i got into a null sec corp and could not find my role in the whole thing. like i said though great people inhabit this world but i dont have the drive and mindset for it. i definitely recommend the trial. just so you can get a look at the universe they have built. if you are astronomically inclined at all, you will definitely appreciate EVE. thats it that all			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Look. this is not a MMO than you can just walk into, this needs to be said especially if you are trying it on a free weekend. It needs much more dedication. So if you are going to give it a go please bare this in mind, it is brutal, very confusing to start off with, and even more so when you get to actual PvP. A starter corp to help you along is a MUST!.Steep learning curve for beginners, helps a lot to have a corportation to helpo you in the beginning stages. Highy addictive, there is nothing quite like hunting human prey to get the blood rushing or more likely running away from sociopathic monsters who roam the universe.What can I say?

												TLDR: Sounds great on paper, fails to deliver.I keep coming back to EVE over the years and every time I quit thinking the same thing... why do I keep trying it?In all the descriptions of gameplay and even the gameplay videos it seems like such a great game but when I play it again I always feel something is amiss. I don't know if it is that the real-time based skill system takes so much time to really get anything cool or if maybe the travel, mining, crafting, et cetera is equally slow but for some reason it just feels so lack luster when actually playing.While the game is visually great, there are other space games that do it better. While the premise is great, it just doesn't feel as great when you actually play.			",180,26,2,41,30,1,22

												If you are a fan of fast action, compelling storylines and game depth this really isn't the game for you. Eve Online offers countless hours of pointing, clicking and waiting. There is an intricate skill system which is designed purley to make you pay your fee each month by making skill training last days.The GoodThe player base is really helpful most the time.It's visually stunningThe BadThe missions are as dull as watching paint dryYou are always at risk of being ganked generally for no other reason other than they can.Designed to be addictive and to make money, not to entertain gamersThe learning curve is hugeYou must pay for at least 3 months gametime and train skills constantly to have any sort of chance in PVPDid I mention how completely dull the missions are (in a couple of hours of play time I was given the same generic mission 3 times)It's an expensive MMOOverallThis game is terrible yet odly addictive.

												Let me start out by pointing out the obvious: EVE hates new players. The new player experience is flat out horrible: I kid you not, you create your character, you log in, and you find yourself in the middle of space in a small ship. That's it. Go, do your thing. Well, thanks for nothing! Yes, the ""opportunities"" windows will keep popping up on your HUD, but that just makes matters even worse, since those are not coherent, proper tutorial missions, just a net of achievements, basically. The real tutorial missions slumber deep within the ""help"" menu, which you can lure out by pressing F12.F12. Seriously. The quests telling you the basics of how to get around in this massive universe are in a submenu of a menu, that can be opened by F12.And that's just the tip of the iceberg, and only a mere hint on how cumbersome and overwhelming the UI of this game is, to a point where a second display is almost a must. Somebody once said that this game is basically ""Spreadsheets - The Game"", and, well, that's what it is, really. Everything important is in tables, texts and numbers, an unholy amount of raw data and information; I swear you could play this game without graphics even being there, because you do everything by clicking on table rows. Even the combat, yes.That's another problem of mine. If you want in on EVE for the combat, then leave now, because the combat in this game is somewhat similar to Planetside 2 in the sense of being a logistics battle instead of the battle of spacecrafts. You need a good fleet commander and do what he says, and get the right amount of ships to the right place in the right time, and that's that. It's not your skill of flying your ship what matters, but rather your skill to counter-fit your ship considering the strengths and weaknesses of your enemy. To further prove my point, you can see a lot of YT videos, where a guy fights the whole combat in his tactical overlay, which, at that point, becomes a real-time board game. Yellow dots moving to purple dots, purple dots moving to yellow dots, that's it. Does it still require skills? Yes. A lot of skills, in fact. It's just not what you'd expect, and possibly not what you want to do when you think about space combat. Probably that's where piracy comes into play, because that's a way to fight small scale fights, but without a proper manual control over your ship it's just not that exciting (yes, you don't have manual control over your ship, you approach enemy crafts by telling your ship to orbit them or keep them in range).Oh, since we are talking about pirates and piracy, let's just mention that there are enitre corps, specializing in piracy, WHICH IS FINE! Seriously, this is a sandbox game, part of the fun is that players can be ""bad"". The problem is that the war declaration system (wardec, wardeccing, or deccing) is a piece of garbage. So what is wardec, exactly? It's a system that enables player corporations to declare war on another player corporation, meaning that they can do PvP combat even in hi-sec space, where otherwise CONCORD (EVE's NPC police) would brake up the fights and hunt down the aggressors. This sounds about OK, right? Nope. The price of a wardec in the game is about 50 M ISK. Now, to put that in context, when the game was new, a PLEX (Pilot License Extension, this is basically gametime in a box) costed about ~400 M. That means 20€ could buy you 8 war decs, right? Well, now you can sell PLEX for 1.2 BILLION, but the price of declaring war remains the same, which means that now 20€ gets you 24 wardecs. The result? Entire pirate corps (so-called ""wardec corps"") sit on trade hubs, wardeccing EVERY. LIVING. SOUL. This is like if you could, in real life, walk into the police station, give them a checque about $50, and in return they would grant your family the right to do whatever you want with another family. So how can you play around this? Well, either you and your corp move out of the trade hubs, or change regions (and believe me, hauling an entire corp to a whole other region is so fkn annoying), or you can pay the ransom, because yes, these ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s usually want ransom money to drop the wardec, which is usually 100 M ISK and up. That's basically a death sentence to a new corp, so that's a no-go either. So you either jump systems over and over and over and over and over again, like space gypsies, or make some trial accounts and have some hauling alts, who never leave NPC corps (those cannot be wardecced) and do the hauling between your corp's AO and the trade hub - not immersion braking, not at all, nah.And with that, I think we finally arrived to the whole cancer of the game: the lack of immersion. In EVE Online, you don't feel like playing a game. In EVE Online you feel like working a job. Hours and hours and hours of doing nothing but grinding, farming and running errands, fueled only by the hope of someday getting some enjoyment out of it in a form of a good ship or some nice equipment - meanwhile the market is filled with fake courier contracts, item exchange contracts and auctions, with which people are trying to trick you out of your hard earned money. The space is littered with space pirates, who are either some bored gamers looking for some fun, or actual horrible people, whose sole form of enjoyment is seeing you suffer; meanwhile decent guys roam around space like nomads, being chased and harrased. EVE is not a joyful ride in space, it's hell, a good example of what would happen if anarchy would overtake our current world; an apocalyptic wasteland, a man-eat-man universe, of which I want no further part.

												This is an amazing game that I have played for a quite a bit with close friends and made friends online from time to time.The game is probably the most refined open world Space Sim you will ever get in to. The graphics are amazing and always seem to improve. Since i last played there have been amazing improvements just in the opening tutorials alone. The economy is very realistic and you can make good money trading from Low Sec space to High Sec space provided you feel lucky and have the guts to take those risks.Mining ore is realistic and profitable if you take chances like anything else. Mine is probably one of the more laid back professions you can do where as Military you find your self in combat quite often.This can lead you to a pirate profession should you enjoy the idea of PVP. There are lots of pirate players that make their money off your head. Treasure Hunters make good money going in to Wormhole, scanning down old ruins and salvaging or hacking instolations to find valuables.The possibilities are endless.My thoughts on EVE going Free to Play however is that you will not experience what this game truly has to offer. Coming back I noticed my old accounts with maxed skills have lost their maxed abilities and am subjected to lowering my ship fitting to weaker versions and even using different, or weaker ships unless i pay for a subscription.You will get very limited enjoyment from the game on a F2P account and will never get to experience some of the more interesting aspects of the game till you pay. You can certainly explore to your hearts content on a free account warping around from star gate to star gate but most likely you will be killed and respawn with a starter ship again. For most, this will become discouraging and they will stop playing almost instantly.There is the posibilty of purchasing in game a 1 month PLEX to fund your account with out paying real money, how ever the cost on these items have gone way up to the point that you would be grinding for quite some time as a new player before you even see one to play the full version of EVE Online.I recommend the game to anyone YES, but it’s not good to F2P with the restrictions put in place.

												""Knowledge is knowing something and wisdom is knowing what to do with that knowlege"". Think of skillpoints as the knowledge in EVE, and player skill as the wisdom. You can have every skillpoint in the game and still get destroyed by a pilot with only few million skillpoints, but understands how to use them effectively. Disregard the negative reviews claiming ""pay to win"" and give the game a chance. Learn how to use your skills rather than focusing on the quanity and you'll succeed in everything you do, paid or free to play.			",60,2,0,11,2,0,5

I know some people really enjoy it, so maybe its a matter of getting past the beginner's grind.The atmosphere of space is very well done, but this is not a MMO Space Simulator, its an MMORPG. Travel times are long.I enjoyed what time I played of this game, especially just taking some time out to listen to music and look at the game environment. But other than that, its not really fun or interesting for me. Would not go back.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I have been involved with Eve for 10 years now... I say involved, as I did not spend that entire 10 years playing. It was more like one of those bad relationships where you know you're not compatible, but the action is so good you always go back for more. The emails always come, and I always read the latest goss... I'm not playing but I was certainly invested.I can do nothing but recommend it... However, there is a catch.The reviews are generally accurate.It is like working. Some people like to work alone (very dull), some people like me need co-workers. Find the right group of co-workers and you'll have a blast!But it is work. You will be finding the most time effective way of making coin, you will assess every activity for its ISK/hour return, and weighing up the risk. Sometimes that only gets interesting when you are about to loose the lot, the adrenaline starts pumping, your heart bursting out of your chest as you mash the warp button.It is brutal. People will kill you simply for the taste of your tears (nothing brought me more joy than reading some poor souls ranting on local after we totally fry him for no reason - hilarious). And it WILL steal your soul. If you like the game, the people you play with, and you have some goals and ideas, you will think of nothing else.The shear scale of the game is amazing; nothing comes close to the variation of ships, ship loadouts and variations, skills and 'professions'. You can be anything you want to be, and here in lies the rump. Trying to decide what the hell you want to do.In the early days, everything was new and developing. You would pull a group of people together to help roll off our first battleships off the line. It was a big achievement as a group, and we were stoked. We saw the first IPO in game. Was then we people tried to create the first open and friendly null-sec space, with its own military and police (didn’t work). There were plenty of original ideas out there, you just needed the creativity and drive to do it.Things are a little more 'mature' these days, big alliances owning vast swathes of space, with vast epic capital fleets going into battle. It’s kinda hard to make a difference in a world like this. Not impossible, just a little harder. That and things like the new ship ‘skins’ aesthetic changes, with no game play value, seem to just cheapen the whole thing…This is not a casual game. You will sink hours, days and weeks into this game, sometimes with little reward.If you find the right people, you can sink those hours together and talk smack whilst your doing it - fun times.If you have any sort of life, this game is not for you.With a busy job, demanding wife, and a bouncy wee baby I knew I couldnt put the time into this game to do it justice- you're looking for a quick cheap thrill, and Eve cant give it.I had to go cold turkey, I gave away all my stuff, eliminated the reasons I might return, and uninstalled the game. I have now been 6 months without any Eve... is that a free weekend I see?			",69,9,1,17,12,1,30

Posted: August 26, 2016
												Where to begin on what a terrible experience this was:Quick Setup:  I bought the game a week ago.  Steam / EVE had a weekend free trial.  I downloaded the trial, and was immediately hooked.  First day of the trial, I bought the starter pack for $5.  Later bought Aurum for $5.  Then the Colonist DLC for $5.  The first few hours the game has some very cool parts to it.  Good graphics, more complicated than Civilizations, and different from most other games I have.  But... after 6 days of playing 17 hours a day, I'm pretty much done forever with this game.  I do not recommend that you get it.  Here's why.1.  NOT New Member Friendly.  The game has been around more than 10 years.  Every player in the game is more powerful than you are, because you just signed up.  Some are ridiculously more powerful.  Every player in the game can attack you.  Anyone of those supposedly ~150 thousand players who didn't sign up the same month as you, can attack you and will destroy you, no matter where you are.  There are no safe zones.  There are no peaceful leave me in peace areas for new members.  My first ship lost was in a 0.9 area.  Areas in space are rated for safety using a system that's maximum safety is 1.0.  Two players warped into a 0.9 area, destroyed my ship in 7 seconds, and left.  You will be bullied and destroyed multiple times a day, for many many months, as you are hunted for sport, by players who have a ridiculous wealth and game advantage that you will quite honestly, never catch up to.  How long would you be willing to pay a monthly fee to get nowhere?  Forget the fees, how long would you play a game where your role is to be blown up by everyone you encounter and provide them points on a kill board?  2.  No Game Support. I wrote 3 support tickets for help.  The first request, they took 4 days just to respond.  They didn't resolve the issue and by that time, I really didn't care.  The best part was, I was contacting them to get support to spend more money on the game!  And they didn't care about that.  The second issue, their response, didn't answer my question.  The third... its been 28 hours, no response yet.  I used to do Computing Support.  Know how long we had to respond to an issue?  4 hours, not 86.3.  No Single Player options.  This is an MMO. That means thousands of players in one game.  In the 6 days that I played, there were on average, 20,000 people logged on.  Now, its an MMO, and maybe you're fine with ALWAYS doing something with someone else.  But IF you are like me, and you might be logging in early morning, late at night, and you didn't sign up with 10 at the same time, and you just want to hop on for a short time, do your own thing, and then get back to sleep... NO.  You cant do that here.  The last day that I played, I took my ship out 3 times.  It was attacked all three times and destroyed twice.  One person showed me mercy and let me go.  I didn't overcome an attack, I begged him not to destroy me, and he nicely let me go.  The other two laughed and destroyed my ships.  Ships are not free, nor are the components or upgrades.  The 12 hours it took to mine resources, didn't cover the cost of the ships lost. Cant do the simplest of things alone, you will die.  What percentage of the time will you get attacked?  Well... on the last day, it was 3 for 3, so yeah, All The Time.4.  Extremely High Startup Cost.  There is a Serious Game Imbalance.  You can actually find several articles on the internet about EVE's membership problems.  I wonder why they have difficulty getting new subscriptions when it only takes years to build up your character to a level where it could more than the most boring, mundane, and time wasting tasks in the game.  You could go the normal route and wait years as you pay your monthly subscription and slowly build up your skills.  (simplified explanation): Skills build up over time at a linear or constant rate.  You can slightly modify this, but unlike other games, 10 battles / day, will not advance your skills any faster than 0 battles per day.  The skills just build up over time, slowly, as you pay your $10 - $15 membership fees each month.  Want to advance faster, then spend more money.  You can buy something called a PLEX, for about $18, which you can sell for in game currency, which you could then buy Skill Injectors, which give you about 1 month worth of skills added to your character.  Two Plex will get you about three skill injectors.  Three skill injectors will get you about what you need to stop piloting the super crappy ships, instead you can now pilot the crappy ships.  Want to get to the good ships?  Buy another 3-4 Plex.  So you can either wait years paying your membership, or you can pay your membership AND spend $100 on Plex which you can accelerate you to a much faster start.  Keep in mind that I did get 4 Plex worth of skills, and the result was still to be destroyed by everyone who decided to attack me.5.  In Game Assistance was terrible.  The company (CCP), has a certain number of players who answer questions in the Rookie Help Chat.  Probably get paid with in game items or Free subscription or whatever.  Not a bad idea.  But the execution is terrible.  I asked the same question on a different day, and got the word for word same answer that wasn't helpful and was insulting.  This prompted me to ask the question again later, just to see IF a third person would respond in the exact same manner.  Instead they just ignored me and didn't answer, which also happens.  I see a ton of people asking questions, and sometimes (my estimate 20%), they just dont get answered.  When they get stuck on something they cant answer, they dont, or they say its realistic.  What about this that doesn't make any sense?  Its realistic.  What about this that isn't fair?  Its realistic.  What about this that isn't fun?  Its realistic.  The answer itself is also a stupid answer, because you're trying to claim realism for a SCI-FI video game in which every single thing is made up / fake!  And Oh....  another 10-20 percent of what is asked, they cant help with, they direct you to create a support ticket.  Good luck getting an answer on that.I dont want a video game that causes more anger than joy.  You could spend ridiculous amounts of money on the game, all at once, or every month, or both, and still be destroyed ALL the time.  This game should be classified as pay to lose.  Its like playing the lottery; odds are incredibly against you, AND instead of losing $2, you can lose 64 Million when you take your ship out, or win 10 Million.  Not a good deal.  Every time you get destroyed, you're either losing hours of time you spent building up wealth, or real world money you spent purchasing that equipment.  The last ship I lost set me back 12 hours of drudgery to accumulate that wealth.  Most of the people I interacted with, was a bad experience in some way.  The very last of which, when I complained in the rookie chat help about being attacked 3 times in a row; one of their helpers said she had lost TEN ships in a row on one day, and she didn't complain about it.  People dont often realize how the comments they make might be interpreted.  This comment tells me that either:  You Don't have any common sense, because who would do the exact same thing with the exact same result, 10 times in a row?  Or you're just repeating a company line to make it seem like thats not unheard of, or you are just a liar.  10 ships in a row, for me, would have meant I just lost $30 or the last 120 hours of my life.In Any Event....  I DO NOT recommend you get the game, and google instead  Eve On-line Single,  google will fill in the rest long before you can put in Single Player Alternative to EVE-Online.  Apparently its a very popular search.			",1,0,0,2,1,0,2

												Do you enjoy spreadsheets?  Do you think adding 0.007 degrees of turning radius is worth several days' worth of work to purchase?  Do you enjoy watching a spaceship shoot a laser at a rock for an hour, returning to base, and then going back to the rock?  Then this game is for you!			",192,62,0,31,48,2,35

												sooooo one does not simply play eve right,,, well let me tell you about my eve experience so far. ive played for a year and 5 month about 6 month of that time was spent inside a station training skills. this game is ruthless and unforgiving. if you are a wow or any other casual mmo player you should click back now. but if you want the challenge , if you wanna feel pain, and suffering , if you wanna feel suicidal, if you want your adrenaline lvls go sky high in pvp battles than install the game and start playing it. the game is what you make out of it, simple as that. i highly recommend this game 10/10.

												You either love or hate this game. Sadly, if you don't have the determination to give up massive amounts of time to learn to play this game it is a very difficult start. I tried 3 times before I got really into it, but the payoff is great.The mechanics, possibilities are endless. The people in this game are helpful if you ask them nicely, so once your ship gets blown up ask them for some tips to avoid it the next time and say that you are new. They'll probably shoot you a helpful mail and some money. If you are the kind of person that gets mad at losing his progress or ship, stay away, it will not be good for you.The community is very tight (even across the different player groups). The first thing you have to do is join a player corp. You won't get anywhere on your own, this is the most important thing in all of Eve: bring friends.			",148,48,0,18,9,2,12

												After playing Eve for over 11 years since Beta testing it...Eve is a harsh mistress...I Love Eve and I Hate Eve!!   It has the best game mechanics, but the worse community.  I've quit and rejoined many times over the years, but eventually come back to it, since frankly, it is the most amazing and most complex game I have ever played. PvP is not required or even corps, I never have pvp and play mostly alone.  I've made most of my fortunes deep in wormholes fighting Sleepers, mining high end ore and building my own ships.  There really is a lot of options and money in exploring and null sec mining, especially if you know how to use a scanner.  I recommend it, but you really have to dedicate your life to Eve, once you do, it will suck you in and change you!			",158,12,5,25,33,0,47

												Ignore the time I spent on this game, I probably have more like 500+ more hours into this game and I'd say that I'm still a newbro when it comes to the game. This is a tentative recommendation in that this game is NOT for everyone, in fact I would say about 95% of the world population would find this game the most boring thing on the planet. However, if you are one of the 5% like myself that is even mildly interested go right on ahead. I'd recommend joining a corporation (AKA guilds) as early as humanly possible because trying to learn by yourself would be next to impossible to do. Eve University, Pandemic Horde, KarmaFleet, BraveNewbies, are all perfectly valid corps to join. The only wisdom I can share with you about this game is that to remember that the only safe place in Eve is in a station. Once outside it's open season for everyone in New Eden to shove a missile up your♥♥♥♥♥ Good luck capsuleer.			",35,8,0,15,10,0,5

												 EVE is not a game for everyone, it involves a massive committment of time and being a fairly lifeless sandbox on it's own it's largely up to the player base to create their own entertainment. While massive wars over territory and resources do occur, along with other epicc occurances, they tend to be few and far between, and ultimatly fairly pointless as again what is resolved largely comes down to the player community and how it reacts. If your interested in solo, or small group, play there is comparitively little to do as the major focus of the game seems to be on large scale guild or in EVE terms ""Corporation"" gameplay. Due to the politics paranoia is rife as well which can make forming connections and getting in with a good group difficult. What's more the game is totally infested with scammers, and newer players are among the favorite targets, although scamming and conning has become such a part of EVE that you see people largely making a joke about it and sitting around all day in major hubs like Jita claiming that they will give people 10x the amount of money back that they are sent.  This is not to say EVE is a ""bad"" game but it's one that I can't recommend in a general sense because it's not for everyone, it has a long-lasting, and enduring community, one of the longest ever, but it's not something I think the typical gamer will find a lot of pleasure in which is why despite the length of it's existance it's never achieved any kind of massive popularity on the level of Everquest, or World Of Warcraft.  If you play EVE expect a steep learning curve, and a decent amount of frustration, should you make it past that initial obstacle, the biggest question is of course going to be what group you get into, and how good you are at making your own entertainment in terms of setting your personal goals and striving to meet them, as they game is not going to present much in the way of quests or a storyline in the style of other MMOs.  After several forays into EVE I can say I understand the appeal, but have not found the game one able to hold my interest for massive amounts of time. Probably due to the fact that I've never gotten into the whole ""large guild"" mindset, and I'm not paticularly predatory.			",300,124,0,142,17,1,71

												EVE Online is my longest running MMO, a sandbox which allows  you the means to build great stories. This is a game of endurance and perseverance, as there will be good times and bad times. A realistic Sci-Fi simulator/part social experiment. Is this a good game yes? Will the game be fun all the time? No. But you suck it up and move on.			",94,23,1,20,15,0,33

												The Only MMORPG that managed to Age Elegantly.While most MMORPG barely capable to remain Alive within 3 years, this old lady actually still move and danced elegantly after 13 years. She even grow more sharp and intriguing. She is one of the major landmark in the road that is the Dao of MMORPG. If you enjoy playing MMORPG, and have been looking for the newest release hoping that it will be The One. Consider meeting this old lady, at very least she will teach you humility.I think the 2014 eve trailer showcase Her really well.

												Ok, so my hours on this game don't really pay testoment to how much bloody time I have spent on this game. I started playing back in 2009 where I found myself starting out in the PVP side of EVE. From the beggining I found that the learning curve in this game is HUGE. If your going into this game thinking you are not going to be devoting a large majority of your time to this game you are very mistaken. However, if that last point scared you a bit not to worry as the community with in EVE Online make the experience of getting over that HUGE learning curve ; 1. Enjoyable and 2. Alot Easier. The one thing I think makes EVE Online one of the best games I have ever played is the fact that after almost 7 years of playing this game (with breaks in between granted) I still come back to this game and I am still learning new things everyday. Another thing is the versitility of the roles available in EVE Online. The main roles available are probably in Industry or PVP/PVE. So if you think that combat is too scary for you or you dont want to dedicate too much time to the game industry would definately be the route for your or possibly exploration. However if you think mining rocks for a majority of your time is too boring then definately go for the PVP route, as believe me from personal experience you will have more than enough fun :).So if you want to try out the game after this but there is still a element of uncertainty with in you I would recommend going to the EVE Online website and getting a trial first, and then if you like it upgrade to the full game.o7			",75,9,2,9,8,2,4

												A stunningly beautiful, immersive, and boring spaceship management business simulator.This is a not space flight simulator like Elite nor is it a starship simulator either.  It is best described a business simulator set in the future and focused primarily on owning, operating and managing spaceships and spaceship related equipment and accessories.The first thing you will notice when you first start to play EVE is the graphics.  They are awesome and captivated me right off the bat.  The detail to the ships, the huge starbases you encounter, and the beautiful celestial bodies really make it candy for the eyes. Even space itself which is usually depicted as boring and black, is a lovely feast of colorful nebulas and backdrops.  Graphically EVE is what space games should aspire to look like. As you start to interact and fly around the attention to detail with the immersion is well done.  From the automated computer voices announcing what you are doing like docking or warping, the billboard advertisements, the UI, sound effects, ambient music, and even the player portraits, it all makes it feel like you were transported to a living breathing space opera universe. The player driven events and economy only adds to this experience and makes you feel like a real person in New Eden.  Running a spaceship and spaceship related equipment and accessories business involves needing to get money and fight other ships.  Semi-nonviolent ways of getting ISK (the in-game currency) involves mining, doing missions, transporting, crafting/selling, and surveying relic sites.  When you first start the game they all seem to be rather novel activities which eventually become a bit repetitious.   Thankfully you can switch between them with different ship types and mix things up enough to keep this aspect of the game somewhat engaging.  Keep in the mind though no matter how rich you get or how powerful your ship is, everything seems to drive toward one main goal in EVE: ganking others (or preventing yourself from getting ganked).  There is really no other end-game than this.If you were hoping for a more exciting combat intensive experience, then this is the weakest part of the game.  EVE online has the prettiest, boring fighting I have ever experienced in an MMO.  You don't fly your ship directly, nor do you really give it much in the way of ship commands.  You are more like the starship owner, who radios to the captain if he should fight or not, and then gives a few him a few basic orders.  You target and tell your ship what to fight, how far it should stay from the target, then tell it to shoot.  That is pretty much it in most battles.  You then sit there and watch the lovely non-engaging fight unfold.  You don’t choose what evasive maneuvers to use or where to aim your guns, you mainly just sit there and hope it goes your way.   It is somewhat like paper/rock/scissors, but with no rock.  Either you are the scissors in fights and win pretty easily, or you are the paper and get splattered.  There is very little in between, and there is very little you can really do in fights if things aren't going your way.  The outcome is usually predetermined based on your ship/equipment and numbers.EVE online combat is a throwback to an earlier era.  Did you ever play early PC games like the Bard’s Tale or the goldbox Dungeons and Dragons?  Those games had more exciting, engaging and dynamic combat…  There are occasionally some items you activate (kind of like abilities) as part of ship combat but they are few and very situational.  Combat is what really did this game in for me and bored me to death and caused me to stop playing.  PvP is a big part of this game so refer back to my paper/scissors analogy.  Either your ship will be fitted better or you will have the numbers and will usually always win, or the opposite.  If there is any randomness involved it is simply in encountering or surprising someone in the first place.   There are some positives to EVE’s combat style.  It is the only MMO where I can eat with one hand, play with the other, and really be at no disadvantage compared to a player with both hands on the keyboard/mouse.  It is also the reason I started playing EVE in the first place. I had some hand injuries and it is one of the few MMOs where you can play if you are disabled since the whole game is slow paced can be played with one hand very easily.  I subsequently got bored of the game when I healed up and could play more interesting games but if this is a permanent issue for you then EVE online is a good MMO where disabled gamers can play quite well and competitively on par with everyone else.Summary: If you want a beautiful and immersive spaceship management business simulator then EVE online is the game for you.  If you were hoping for something more akin to an “MMORPG in spaceships” then I do not recommend this game.  The weak and repetitive missions, dull combat, very lopsided fighting, and the lack of any real end-game except to try and gank people makes the game rather unsatisfying and boring..

												i had a very negative point of view about eve when i first started tho i loved the game as you can tell by the hours i put into it,for the past 3 years i watched ccp removing botters, gambling sites, exploiters and many more revolting things from new eden while making a very decent job on user UI, tranquility maintenance, lore, capital ships and adding new stuff, i gotta say they cleaned up the game pretty nicely and always took a step forward while doing it.with a brand new NPE and unlimited free trial coming next month, all i can say is grow a ♥♥♥♥ing pair and start playing eve online, dont be such a normie, believe me there is nothing like eve in this world.

												Easily the hardest game ive ever learnt or played, but once you pop that pod cherry for the first time theres no going back. Limited dev interference with more responsibility placed on the player makes the game extremely immersive. The innumerable mods and customization really makes you attached to your ships and you will be constantly pushing to improve your skills to keep them alive, especially since you lose them permanently when they go boom.Completely changed how i approach gaming, and it will always stay near the top of my most memorable games list. 7o			",78,10,4,8,29,1,31

												Since I bought EVE online about 3 years ago I have logged over 1,328 hours into the game (according to steam) and to this day I still feel like an amerature capsuleer. EVE is a fantastically complicated piece of brilliance. It can offer the most rewarding gaming experience for those who put the time and effort into learning the mechanics and nuances that reside within New Eden. If you want to build empires you can. If you want to get into the fight right away, there is a way. You can join a giant alliance or a small corporation, or you can go it alone. It is your sandbox and you may do with it what you will. The economy is deep and intricate with each station housing its own economy packed with items that are almost entirely produced by players. Markets react to player choice. The price of a module or a ship can vary wildly with supply and demand as powerful Null Sec Empires struggle for dominance and control. All those who play reside on a single server. It lives and breaths, ebbs and flows. The universe is beautiful as it is deadly. The world is full of gorgeous alien worlds, wormholes, space ships, stations, asteroids and epic battles that non players have seen on the news but can only wonder about.  EVE is home to a wide variety of people who come together from all walks of life. I have met very interesting intelligent people from around the world. They come from all different backgrounds and come together to form a community like no other. The game itself has aged very well over its history. The developers are a dedicated team who cares about the players and more importantly, what EVE Online stands for, which is a universe that holds epic rewards and dishes out dire consequences. EVE is the best game I have ever and probably will ever play in my life. That being said this experience is not for everyone. I would venture to say that for every 10 people who try EVE 9 will quit within the first few days. The challenge will not be easy. The game mechanics are difficult to understand and can take years to master. I will admit, the UI isn't the best, although it has improved over the years. EVE doesn't just have game mechanics, they are layered on top of one another like a cake. While some shine, others are buried deep down becoming relics of times gone past. As a new player, you will struggle with basic functions. How do I undock? How do I equip a weapon to my ship? How do I move? How do I warp? Where is this mission objective? How do I accept a mission? Why did I just get blown up randomly, I was ‘mining’ my own business.... These are just a few of the questions that new players ask every day. Many will quit because they have too many questions, others will quit claiming they are bored running missions or mining, and yet others will quit because the game is just too damn brutal. These are all true statements. EVE is not WOW. Completing tasks will not be easy, but a job well done, a battle won, an enemy vanquished will feel 10X as rewarding because you risked it all to get there. You will rise to the top and fall straight off the ledge.  For the 1 out of 10 eve is like gravity, and the further you venture towards its center the tighter its grip will be upon you. Once you cross its event horizon EVE will have you forever and no other gaming experience will compare. ALL players take long absences but they always come back. In EVE if you lose your ship it is gone forever. The only thing is to learn from the mistake and grow as a player. Combat is short lived but very intense. Risk and reward is what EVE is about and those who embrace it will thrive while those who are afraid of it will wither. So if you are the type of player who enjoys a deep challenging and ultimately rewarding experience take a free trial. If you are the 1 out of 10 and New Eden is a place for you Im telling you from the bottom of my heart that It will be the most rewarding gaming experience of your life and well worth the money paid. And if you don't well...EVE is not for everyone.			",24,4,1,6,10,0,17

												Best game ever. Extremely complex. Not for children. Most bad reviews seem to come from people who spend money on PLEX and lose their money in high or low sec. Those reviews do not give testament to fleet pvp, or working with large groups of hundreds of players to accomplish collective goals. Spending money on PLEX to buy ships and lose them is probably not going to be fun. I recommend finding friends and learning as much as possible before you go and buy PLEX.With any internet experience you will have toxic trolls doing their best to ruin your day. Just like WoW, Reddit, and Youtube comments.			",69,12,0,10,6,2,10

Eve Online Who should spend time playing this? If you long for a deep time consuming Sandbox MMO. If you enjoy PvP and Group PvP gameplay primarily.How much Money Should I spend? $15 Per MonthWhat’s it about? You are a pilot fighting for money and power in a stunningly expansive universe with thousands of players and factions in constant conflict. This is a very open-ended MMO where the end goal is not clearly defined. You’ll need to make up your own goals and determine how you want to play and what you want to spend your time focusing on.What is the Gameplay?  Ship customization is a major component of Eve online, there are thousands of different modules, hundreds of ships, and countless hours’ worth of theory crafting available. The game is primarily point and click ship movement, managing weapons and other modules properly, and using in game knowledge to outsmart your opponents using basic and complex game mechanics. There are plenty of avenues to venture into: Mining, Pirating, Salvaging, PvP, PvE….the list goes on. Unlike most MMO’s you have to pick a path determining how you would like to play the game, there is very little hand holding here.Graphics/Visuals  Gorgeous planets, ships, stations and warp effects.  Fantastically detailed moons, ship turrets, and numerous other small details. One of the best and deepest character creators I have ever used, which is particularly staggering considering most time in game is spent outside of a spaceship.Sound/Music  Music is very good, one of the few MMO’s I have played with the music ON. It complements the battle scenarios nicely and is both futuristic and, perhaps inadvertently, melancholy. Sounds effects are pristine though most aren’t observable until the camera is zoomed in. The sounds of humming spaceships, crackling hulls, and zapping laser pulses set the scene magnificently. Very little voiced dialogue, the vast majority of content is delivered by text blocks.What does it compare to? Elite DangerousStar Citizen (At least once it’s finished)Arch Age, Primarily for the gameplay openness and PvP focus not for the theme.Achievements No Steam Achievements What are my overall thoughts? A fantastic open-ended sandbox MMO where you really can choose how to play. It runs incredibly well, looks fantastic, and has all the well-tuned and refined details of any AAA game and MMO from any other company. Fantastic PvP gameplay though the community is a mixed bag, there are some great beginner friendly groups and players as well as an assortment of elitist, snobbish, and rude idiots. The PvE is very good though up to point you are, in a broad sense, going to have to group up to do advanced later game content. It is basically impossible to solo certain missions and areas and there isn’t really “End Game” with a hierarchical structure.This game is well worth your time and money to try out. It is F2P now so there is no reason not to give it a chance. I certainly think it was worth $15 per month when I was playing and surely still is today. ",748,201,13,96,37,4,108

												This game is a special one. It isn't like anything else you will play. That is the most difficult point to get through the heads of newbros. It isn't something that can be explained, in a rewiew or otherwise. It is something that you must experience yourself, and truly experiencing this game will be something you will never forget. It has fascinating and intriguing politics(which you can be a part of), full-scale wars that last months, battles of literally titanic proportions that go down in the game's history(everyone who plays this game can tell you where they were during the bloodbath of B-R5RB), friendships forged through mutual loss and triumph together, and endless depth to every caveat of the game.You will make friends that you'll never forget. You'll make enemies that you will always resent. You'll take losses that will leave permanent scars, while making gains that you will brag about for years. When you play this game, you will come out of it with stories so vivid, rich, and exciting that you could sit around a campfire and discuss the time ""where you escorted a caravan of allied industrial players through nullsec space with your corpmates after weeks of careful planning"", the time ""where you set up a wormhole outpost with new-found friends only to be betrayed by your CEO and log in to a disapeared and looted base"", that time where you ""threw your most prized ship into a deadly skirmish in the futile hopes of just maybe saving your friend's ship worth billions of isk, while your corpmates do the same"", any possibility is realistic. Anything can happen. Every player of EVE experiences his own story. Every single one of them is worthy of a best-selling novel.Only EVE can make your heart race like never before and your hands shake from sheer excitement as you warp into a fight that has been built up to through weeks of political tension. I♥♥♥♥♥♥you not, I ♥♥♥♥ed up on my first fight and lost a ship I raised money for over a period of two months because I couldn't get my hands to stop shaking.The negative reviews of this game are all results of the same thing - staying in the safety of hi-sec. Doing so will result in a chance of you only experiencing a very narrow and short-sighted part of the game without witnessing anything else. If you try this game, here is the golden rule: GET. OUT. OF. HI-SEC. DO NOT tell yourself that you will ""get good first"". There are plenty of very formidable alliances that will take you in on day one in null-sec, guiding you through your first months. Believe it or not, it is MORE difficult to get through the new player stage in hi-sec. Start looking at the sov map and researching alliances. Figure out who shares your morals and who you want to fight for. Get out there and get your story started! The key ingredient to this masterpiece of a game is the element of RISK. Don't avoid that. In other words, grow a ♥♥♥♥ing sack, and you'll have a great time!Here are some motivational videos and links for playing the game(and getting the ♥♥♥♥ to null) that may or may not give you a boner:TITANIC scale battles Video capturing the scope of the battle Video explaining the cause and implications of the battle The battle of Asakai, you can hear fleet coms in this one Imagine being there, in a battle with thousands of players. I want you to understand that this is not an example of      something that ""only the top 1% of people who play the game"" get to experience. This is something that people who go to null sec experience. In that battle, there are many other ships that you can't make out fighting alongside the capital ships. Even if you were not involved in the battle or not yet skilled enough to make a strategic difference--you would still be able to bring in a scout ship(look into training a cov ops frig at some point) and experience being in that battle. Everytime you hear a friend chirp in about EVE, and how that one big battle happened, you can say ""yeah, I was there"".Important videos to see, in order to fully understand the depth of EVE politics Fountain War A visual history of null-sec geopolitics The butterfly effect Every single movement on that sov timelapse has a rich story behind it. The Fountain War is just ONE of those stories. You CAN be a part of these stories, and you DO NOT have to train for years in order to do so. DO NOT let someone tell you otherwise, they are WRONG and I would love to invite them down to null-sec with me so I can change their minds.EVE trailersI'm making an honest review here, I'm not going to tell you that these trailers are like the real thing, but DAMN are they fun to watch. Here are my favorites. Watch these to get you on the HYPE TRAIN: Fanfest trailer showcasing EVE<->Dust514 relations Dominion Tyrannis Another trailer showcasing the interrelation between DUST514 and EVE The prophecy Although it may be a while, the Prophecy trailer shows us what ccp wants to do with its universe--have players soldiers, player pilots, and player fighter pilots all fighting in the same battles. This is already very marginally achieved so far, with the ability for EVE players to provide orbital strikes to DUST514 fights.If you would like a 21 day trial of the game(longer than normal trial!), follow this link.[secure.eveonline.com]If you enjoy the game and buy the next month of time, I'll split my referall reward with you half and half. Right now, that would mean 600 million isk for you going into your second month. If you are going to take this route, add my character Vestigo Masefield in-game so I know what is happening. If you want, you could even come down to null and fight alongside me! If you think I am trying to extort you here, I'll be honest and say I don't currently possess the evidence to prove you wrong other than the fact that you won't find anyone in EVE who considers me a scammer(although I have been a victim myself). I'll leave the judgement up to you, but I give you my word--I do not stab people in the back, not even in EVE.			",106,13,2,10,27,2,20

												Oh man... Where to start... This game. Isn't really a game in a sense. It's more of a hobby of sorts where you spend a couple hours doing wormhole relic sites or ratting in -1.0 sec systems to gather ISK then spend it on PvP ships and go out and blow up other nerds. And to have fun. Joining a corp other than the NPC corps is also a good idea. You can either join a massive null-bloc coalition like Brave, Goons, PL, etc or a smaller one that does say faction warfare, small-gang PvP, etc such as Straya. and Redemption Road.My one word of advise to anyone who is just starting with a 2+ week trial; go join a corporation that has a well made and reputable newbro program, such as Brave Newbies, Pandemic Horde, Eve Uni, etc. They will most certainly and 100 percently get you started at Eve and get you into the good fights as soon as they can even though your character is new. Sure, you'll likely die a lot but that's all part of the learninig experience. And if you did decide to join one of these newbro friendly alliances/corps, they have a thing called Ship Replacement Program (SRP) so it doesn't really matter if you lose your little tackle or EWAR frigate, they'll just give you a new one. When you're first starting up, that little 1 million ISK frigate of yours is the most expensive thing you've ever owned in the game. But for some of us, that's a single module on one of our ships. And so many people are happy to throw money at newbros simply because they can. EVE doesn't necessarily need a huge commitment to play it, but the more you're involved with it, the more fun you can have. And most importantly of all, we should all remember three things: 1) The best ship in the game is the Friend Ship2) Never fly what you can't afford to lose3) F*** CODE.100,000,000/10			",104,24,2,7,27,2,21

Over 100k people on this single server and there is no lag. at all. (Don't believe if the launcher tells you ""only"" 50k people online, it just can't count so much big amount of players per second. Like 4000 per 5 minutes connect.) IF YOU WANT REAL MEN GAME WHICH IS THE BEAUTIFUL SPACE AND SO MANY SOLAR SYSTEM OMGGGGGGGGGGGGGGG! HUGE BATTLES OF FACTIONS AND LIKE 20K BATTLING!!! EVEN MORE AT NIGHTS ! (But seriously, it's men game, so awesome, so many action. You gotta give it a little time tho, people there are kind and awesome, NO KIDS..!

												IF YOU PREFER PVE GAMEPLAY - AVOID EVE ONLINEEve Online is considerably PVP driven, which normally would be fine, except this game is also a ganker's paradise. There are no controls, no balances. Your options are to play in hisec space with crap content or in space where ganking is permitted where the only decent game content exists. This is not much of a choice for those who prefer PVE. I've played this for four months and have become fed up. Even after four months you cannot develop the skills and bankroll to be able to stand up to gankers who have been playing this game for a decade (unless, of course, you willing to shell out ungodly sums of money for pay to win). Really, who wants to spend 1+ years just training skills to a point that you have a remote chance of survival? All that said, the true PVP aspect is actually very well done, but the game is completely destroyed by those who only wish to attack defenseless ships, and the producers of the game encourage this behavior. It's so pathetic that it is a common site to see players posting kill reports in chat of non-combat vessels they have destroyed, as if it is some kind of trophy. I mean seriously, who would want to advertise that they win by picking on the defenseless? I guess it is sort of like trophy hunters in Africa, killing animals just to have a head to mount. Just pathetic.			",0,1,1,5,1,0,1

												EVE Online is one of those MMO's that will go down amongst gaming history as one of the greats. EVE just might be the deepest, most sophisticated game I'v ever played. Starting out it's a lot to take in and can be slow to get your bearings, but once you get going it becomes one of the greatest experiences in gaming. EVE is not for the lite hearted MMO players and should be avoided if you've never played one. This is a game that requires more commitment than even several other MMO's combined. In your usual run of the mill MMO's, give it like a month or two and you've pretty much peaked. You'll find yourself doing redundant daily instances or tasks, maybe some dull PvP and that's it. EVE Online is a multi year commitment. Don't fret though, EVE can and will be casual at most times. You will spend a lot of time basking in the incredibly gorgeous, massive universe that is EVE Online. You will mine, trade, bounty hunt, explore, hack, lead, invest, manage, manufacture, salvage, pirate, scout, and much more. EVE Online also has one of the greatest, if not THE greatest player run economies. It's one the easiest games to become self sustaining, essentially becoming free. The truth is, I'v only ever scratched the surface of this behemoth. Yet despite that, If I were to continue this review I'd be here all day typing away and I believe short, to the point reviews are best. If you fancy a gorgeous, truly massive, relaxing worlds in space that is full of possibilites, there is non other deserving of your attention than EVE Online. 91/100			",521,151,26,75,80,8,100

												When I first started to understand the game mechanics, how to make isk, how to pvp, corporation politics etc, I wanted to quit the game. The best way to make isk in this game is to get a part-time RL job (doesn't matter, minimum income will suffice), buy 6 plex a month with half of your new income, manipulate the market, make more money, sustain your sub with your in-game passive income, go to pvp get blown up or not, repeat. You will make more money than %85 percent of the players, and with the gained RL communications skills you will be able to manipulate people ingame for more ISK (market speculations, in-game politics etc.). This `game` is the ultimate spreadsheet simulator with clicking minigame added on top. Even the developers admitted the game is boring, and some people play it because they like boring stuff. They developed the game this way because when they first started it, they didn't have the man power and resources to make an AAA game, so they told themselves, ""how can we make a game that is not a game, and still make people believe they are playing a space game"" (this is basically what they've said in an old interview about the developement process). Most of the game is an illusion, ""space"" images you see are mostly static, you can never see anything change, you can't even observe the orbits of planets, spacestations, stars or any other object. NPC's are non-existent, and when there is less than 20k people are online in the server, game feels barren with nothing to do but do pve ""content"". This spreadsheet has the worst NPC mechanics in any other game. I even dare to say some of the browser games have more pve content than this. If you are looking for a spaceship exploration game with non-gated mechanics, and come home after a long day and chill by playing this, don't even try to play this game. UI is horrible and impossible to explain to the new players, only way to learn the game is by experiencing it and reading about it in forums-wikis. You won't be able to understand the game before you reach at least 20M sp, get blown up a couple times, cry, make people cry by harrasing them, rinse-repeat. And by this mark if you are continuing to play this, only explanation is, you want to take your revenge or build huge spreadsheet empires and never login again and be still playing the game. Do some research and you will see, some of the most succesfull players in this game almost never login, they go on to ts, talk with some same-minded people, talk some more, and logoff from ts3.  This game never seen more than 60k logon at the same time, never seen more than 600k~ subscribers, and most of the subscribers are the alts of the main accounts. Most people can't play this game without 5-6-7 alt accounts for skill training-afk ganking- suicide gankking, and some are willing to pay hundreds of dollars to this game just to be able to play effectively. And this people, mostly never login to their main accounts unless♥♥♥♥♥♥goes wrong and their bus drivers are ganked. Some people will disagree no matter what critism anyone will bring to their beloved spreadsheet, but research before you decide to put money on this game, or you will eventually like the most players, begin to debate in your mind why you are still playing this♥♥♥♥♥♥ And like some players your answer will be, because I played it for so long and I don't want to lose what I have in the game. Its called buyers remorse. You will try to rationilize why you like this game even though you are bored.And if still you want to play the game, this is not a sandbox, this is a non consensual pvp, drived by the industry of players, gated behind real time skill point training system. If you are not willing to pay hundreds of dollars, you won't be able to fly %85 of the ships in your first year, at least effectively. And if you are willing to pay, as I said before, you will find best way to gain money in game is to get a RL job, and buy Plex's, sell them ingame, and save your self from boring grinding and get to the fun stuff (because you will see, you want to buy skill injectors to cut in to skill training time, some skill training queues can go up to 350 days even to begin to be able to fly some ships, or manifucture some ships effectively. 5/7 best Microsoft Excel simulator illusion ever.

												Here I am almost 500 hours into eve and I haven't even scratched the surface. So much to do, so little time. I vowed never to sub to a game, well that all changed about a year ago when I picked up eve. Not only do I have one account but I have 5 in total now. Some of the features are more fun or productive with more characters, hell even CCP offers or did offer a discount on your second account. Character buying/trading is legal, you can scam the living daylights out of people and CCP just laughs (make it a big enough scam and you'll end up in the EVE book!) This game actually inspired me to get back into school and get a degree this time in hopes to work for a company like CCP. They don't act like gods or even admins, they list to people if they messed up the players amass and burn a monunment or something and CCP makes the changes needed. The creaters are amazing, the game you can do anything imaginable, Manufacture drugs, pirate, move freight, mine, build, explore... so much stuff. I give this game a 10/10 :D			",114,10,0,12,22,0,28

												EVE is a complicated game. It is a PVP environment unlike any other with all the good and bad that this entails. The game has a steep learning curve and can at times be very grindy but with some persistance the game begins to open up and allow for some great game play experiences. It looks amazing and plays on a fairly light weight system.With any game that is open PVP there is good and bad. Some members of the community are incredible and make the game an amazing experience. Some are ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ that can make the game a lesson in frustration.If you love space gaming and have the patience to wade through then EVE is an AMAZING gaming. If you desire something with more focus on solo play then you should look at other games.			",97,9,1,19,14,1,27

												Way too much work for way too little payoff. If you're not prepared to put in the work to join a corporation and engage with that side of the game then this is not for you.If you are, then you'll find amazing depth and emergent stories. Stuff that can't be found in any other game. It just takes way too long.Combat is a dull affair and very rarely becomes a challenge. You do not have direct control of your ship so it's more of a game of comparing your ship against the other ships and watching as they shoot at each other.The warp animation is amazing though, go look it up on Youtube.

												DON'T GET THIS GAME ON STEAM. Having your account permantly linked on steam is a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥ Just go on amazon or other registered sites to buy a subscription.Going into Eve you have to understand it's not just another videogame, it's truly a hobby.Here are some things I can clear up for players.-------------------------------------------------Eve uses a skill queue to train skills rather than the traditional leveling. You simply put in the skills you want to train and let time do it's thing. The skill queue is now 1 year long or 50 skills in total. Generally you're going to fill out 50 skills rather than 1 year. There are now things called skill injectors and extractors that allow you to inject skillpoints to learn the skill faster. You can either purchase an injector from the market or another player, or if you make an oopsies you can buy an extractor (which is cheaper) extract the skill points and put them into more useful skills. More on these later.For a while now there is a system called PLEX, also known as a pilots license extension which is an ingame item that you can use to add a month to your game time. This item can be bought with real money ($20) or with ingame money (ISK) at fluctuating prices. The game's market is completely open to manipulation, but a PLEX is roughly around 800m-1b ISK. If you purchase with real money you may sell it on the market to gain a quick sum of cash, or you can purchase it with in game money to extend your subscription. There are NO ways to take ISK and turn it to real money without breaking rules or laws. Many people who don't play Eve consider this ""Pay 2 Win"" but even if you buy the biggest ships on the market you can easily get killed by someone flying something like a frigate which is the smallest.On top of this there's a in game store as well. You can purchase Aurum, the premium currency, to purchase strictly cosmetics, an item that allows you to multi train characters (you can have 3 in total) for a month, or purchase the previous said skill extractors. However ALL OF THESE THINGS CAN BE BOUGHT WITH THE STANDARD CURRENCY. This simply just boosts the Eve economy further. -------------------------------------------------I'm going to reccomend all new players to right away find a high-sec corp and learn the ropes. Eve is a complicated game and will take many hours to understand, however once you have a good idea on how the game works you will have the most fun playing a game ever.Like I previously stated too, don't but this game on Steam, I bought an extra account to use on here and it was a complete pain in the♥♥♥♥♥to manage.

												EvE is for:My Pros;- A strong community that is less toxic, and more mature. (Usually) Average age here is much, much higher than most games, and most of the time the reviews I see online and in person are from a) people who want instant gratification in their games, which usually leans towards the younger spectrum of players who don't end up enjoying EvE. (I didn't until I was older and tried several times.)- A sense of danger at all times. - Not pay to win. (Not sure how some people think this.)- Alpha is free to play, but there are limits due to how fragile the game is as it is a free market. CCP employes five full-time Economists on its staff.- Something no other game has been able to do well, and has been around for well over a decade to boot.- Space and how beautiful it is. - Every person can make an impact. Grouping up feels amazing when you acomplish something.- Real politics and war.- One server. That's it. No ""Hey, what server do you play on?""My cons;- First starting, this can be pretty daunting. Join up with a newbie corp. Or do what I did; read the wiki everytime you're in the bathroom sitting on the toilet. That's how I learned fast.- First starting, you have to train a lot of skills needed, and you can't do a whole lot right away. You have, HAVE to specilize in something early to start making isk.  While it seems tempting to try and crosstrain four careers or more at once, it can feel hectic. In a month, you can get really good at one thing, then focus on the other. It'll take you that long just to sorta learn that career.Overall;This is the most unique experiences. The emotions that run from this are unlike any other and bleed into your personal feelings in an amazing way. The people you meet, the stories that you are a part of, they're all there.It's not for everyone, and it's hard to get into for some (took me four times before I found a corp/alliance that I never wanted to leave), the feeling you get from EvE is unlike anything else, and I have tried to find anything close to it, and nothing ever comes close.Fly dangerous. o7			",381,97,11,75,53,2,70

												Eve provides a valuable service to the rest of the MMO community - it gives griefers their own little playground where their playstyle is the one encouraged by the devs. I sincerely hope Eve continues to grow its playerbase, because that means fewer terrible human beings for players of other games to be burdened with.Yes, I play Eve, but only until another multiplayer space game is available that is not based on griefing. At least it's possible to set up the game to pay for itself (via PLEX), so I will provide no further financial support.			",412,86,3,101,52,1,89

												UPDATED REVIEW: I've returned and enjoyed EVE, but not for long. After mining and gearing up, I've spent some time in LowSec. The bottom line is: LowSec is DEAD. If CCP revives it, I'll be hooked. Meanwhile, forget about LowSec PvP. :(OLD REVIEW: Give it some actual gameplay mechanics, it would be the best game in the universe. It's an amazing world with a huge economy and tones of mechanics for social interactions between players and factions. It's great looking with a very classy style. People are friendly and mature. YET, it's a game you can play with only your left mouse button... Add twitch-based dogifhting and walk-in-spacestations, and I would probably play it forever.Meanwhile, enjoy the best Excel simulator out there, and hope Star Citizen gets it right so that CCP feels pressured to turn EVE into the game many of us wish it was.

												If you don't know someone who already plays this and is willing to guide you, your gonna probably be very frustrated with this game, like me.The interface is bloody awful and only partially explained in tutorial (and so are the many terms you will have to learn) and a lot of things take a *lot* of real time to complete.  Add the insult of a relatively high subscription cost to get anything worthwhile (which can admittedly be negated if you get really good and plough a *lot* of time into the game) and it just not worthwhile for most people.Its a shame as personally I love the idea of this game, but have tried multiple times before it was on steam to get a grasp on this game, but couldnt.Go ahead and play it if you have friends who play it and are willing to teach you, otherwise steer well clear.

												This game seems to have a good community.  Character creation is very detailed and well done.  I just don't find the gameplay that exciting.  It is billed as an immersive experience, but it plays more like an RTS.  If you want immersive sci-fi and open world gameplay, I would try Elite Dangerous.I think the concept is still interesting, since your in-game actions supposedly affect the trajectory of the game as a whole, for all players.  It is not tangible as a beginner, but if I could find a group of people who play, then I may continue this game.  Visuals are good.  Game is deep.  Gameplay is tedious.			",35,19,1,2,10,1,3

												I've played EVE for months (non-steam), and think it's a nice and deep game. The player-driven economy is incredible (though more to observe than participate in, at this point), exploration and 1vX pvp are very fun.The difficulty/learning curve is exaggerated greatly in most places (if I have to see that stupid learning curve picture one more time...), the game isn't hard to grasp, it's mostly just poorly explained, and there is a lot of research to be done. If you know how to use a search-engine to answer your questions, the game becomes rather straight-forward.If you plan on joining a nullsec corp and get into fleet pvp asap (which you can do on your first day), I think subscribing to the game is probably worth it. For all other aspirations, while it's true that you can do wormhole exploration in week 1 (I know, I did it), realise that it will take months of passive training (= maintaining active sub) to train up the skills needed to become even remotely competitive in a field. For instance, even if all you want to do is 1v1 pvp in frigates, you will need a lot of gunnery skills researched to even be able to use T2 guns and ammo, not to mention the passives like tracking speed, etc, which you will need to compete with people who have been playing the game for years.tl;dr: if you know how to help yourself, and if you come to the game with the knowledge that it is a time investment, I can absolutely recommend EVE Online.

												This is the most immersive game i have ever played, There is so much to do and so much more to explore. I would however advise you that patience is a necessity. You cannot do everything at once.You will die and lose or be scammed out of tons of Isk (in-game currency) don't let it put you off, you can always make more, lots more. I would advise any new player to watch every video and read every bit of info they can to decide what they would find most appealing to them, Then read more info on how to train to be the best they can at their chosen activity.Solo play is difficult but not impossible but the big Isk earners are in alliances that allow different corporations to work together to achieve their goals and make lots of Isk. Most of them are noob friendly and will offer advice on all aspects of the game. Don't be affraid to ask questions.There is a monthy subsription to pay but if you work hard and put the effort in you can earn enough Isk to buy plex which you can then use to pay your monthly subscription just don't let Isk earning take over the enjoyment of playing a truely magnificent game.My advice is experiment for a couple of months with the game then choose a path or give up and go back to whatever ruled your life before eve because once you get hooked you'll be in it for the long term.

												What do a sandbox and EVE Online have in common? They're both toys. EVE Online is a game without goals, otherwise known as a toy. If I had to describe the toy I would call it ""sad.""  It took me over a thousand hours playing this game to realize that. Something else you won't realize until you've spent a lot of time with this game is that it is engineered from the ground up to give veteran players the advantage. It's baked into the mechanics. Wait until you are no longer a noob. By then you should be so bored with the PVE stuff and so sick of helping other noobs that you start to kill them. And then you begin to understand what EVE is all about. It really is a sinister place. I tried many things in the game and even bought older characters, but in the end I decided I didn't want to spend any more of my life in such a dark and sad world. Give it a shot if they really managed to pique your curiosity, but take my word for it this game is more punishment than pleasure so make sure that's what you're looking for. ",48,4,0,2,4,0,4

												This game is awful your paying too be abused or join a gang of back stabing scumbags. Its a shame realy its such a beautiful game the combat system is crisp and the expansive option of paths too progress down are expansive as the univers its self not too mention the ships and customizations! Too bad you'll never get too experiance any of that becouse scumbags will kill you and proffet in pvp free zones. When i first played this game i wanted to too fight rats (NPC enemys) and exlpore now places and find rare and valuable ore and enjoy the vast solitude of space. this is exatly what did not happen bout dont get me wrong there was alot of fighting just not fair or with rats. Oh and ps they camp the spwan grounds for new players. so theres realy no gitting in too this game if you havent ben playing sence 2004. what a waste of a beautiful game.			",65,1,0,5,1,0,2

												I really wish steam had a way to vote games neutral but that's what I would rate Eve Online. Eve Online is a confusing game to get into but the community is wonderful, their older players are more than welcome to help out newer players. I think the biggest thing holding me back from really getting into the game is the subscription since I only bought 1 month to just try it out, but seeing the scope of the game, 1 month isn't enough to really get a gist of the game.If you're willing to learn a massive game with heaps of lore and content, then I'd recommend it. But I believe that this game is currently too stressful for gamers who just want to have a casual MMO experience.			",135,48,3,27,14,3,24

												I played a good little bit in EVE. It is really hard to get into. If you can power through and play on it. more power to you. I stopped playing cause I have the attention span of a fish and can't justify a sub on this.Update 5FEB2017: Put some more hours in this. F2P was the right move, it gets people to actually see what this is as a whole. Takes up alot of time. Completely worth it.			",115,13,21,29,28,1,14

Posted: December 22, 2015
												I have played over 1,200 hours in this game and I thought I might as well write a review now because I am bored. I first want to say that this game is kind of what you make it in a lot of instances, being that this game is largely player run. Sure you have the devs adding content, fixings bugs, and so on, but it really has been the players that make this game what it is. I wanted to break this down into a few sections for me to review.PvP: I think the game revolves around PvP. What do you earn isk(in game money) for? To get new ships to shoot stuff with. Sure you can buy a better PvE oriented fitted ship but I think that most of the time in the end your going to use the isk to get involved in PvP in some way. In fact PvP is not always optional in this game which I will explain later. Anyways though like I said this game revolves around PvP. I think EvE has a unique PvP design that a lot of MMO's don't have. It's a ""if you lose it sorry but it's gone for good"" kind of game, and that's for almost everything in the game. Even items(like plex for example) that you buy with real cash can be lost and won't be refunded most of the time. You can spend 100 dollars on plex and if your transporting it through space and someone kills you and takes it, it's considered your fault and you'll likely never get that money back. I have had mixed feelings about items being bought with real cash being able to be taken by others, but for everything else it's a pretty good concept and makes the game more real. The way EvE has set this up is really important to the game and removing it would probably kill the game. It's one of the main reasons this MMO is unique. For PvP there is a variety of ships to choose from, and a lot of corps, alliances, third-party groups will often host PvP roams/fleets that you can join. I would recommend a corp that does some PvP. I recommend this and later on I will explain why. Also PvP fleets can get huge and are often exciting. A lot of the time strategy is involved and good fleet structure is always needed. All in all PvP can be really fun in this game but it is up to you and your corp to get involved in it if you want to do fleets.PvE: I cannot say the PvE in this game is top notch. All of it gets dull after awhile and for the most part only serves the puropose to get you isk to buy new pvp ships. There is a variety of PvE activities you can do which you can look up and see which one you would like to do most to earn isk. All in all I won't go much into detail about this. The PvE stuff is just dull in my opinion and really needs to be improved more. PvE is a job in this game. If your looking for a completely PvE experiance don't come here.Community: I feel like this will apply to all MMO's. Pick a corp/alliance(basically eve's guilds) that is active and for the most part always has players on. Make sure your first corp will be able to teach you the ropes of EvE. The tutorial does some but you will more than likely need extra help from other players to learn stuff. If you find a corp that is really inactive do not give up, leave the corp and join a better one, same thing if the players in the corp you joined are A-Holes. Also find a corp that suites you the best in terms of activities, time zone, etc. I cannot go much further into detail because it really depends on the corp you join.Economy: For the most part the games economy is run by players. Prices can go up and down on a daily basis at times. Most of the items you buy are made by players. You can also produce your own stuff with minerals and other materials as well. Since that is is pve though that can be a grind and a job. I personally just buy things off the market. it's totally up to you though. I cannot say much more really.Graphics: They are fair enough. Not the most wonderful thing you will ever see but it's good. Also sometimes people call the ships submarines because they act like their under water. So definitley not accurate physics. Skills: You are able to use new items and improve your skills through training skills. You buy a skillbook of the market and activate it. It is all time based. Skills can take weeks to train sometimes so it's wise to choose them well and find which ones will be the most useful to you. Overall i think it's a good system.Conclusion: Eve offers a lot to do. You have many things to choose to do and it's really what you make of the game. PvP is fun but overall PvE is dull and needs work. Most people I have met are also really nice and helpful but like I said you need to choose a good corp/alliance. I have not explained everything but a lot will become known when you start playing the game. Also ask for help if you need it.Overall I rate this game a 7.5-8/10. I do believe it is worth the sub for many reasons which will take awhile to explain so i will not right now. I give it this rating because PvE is definitley not that great considering how long this game has been out(10+ years). Also I feel for over a decade of producing this game should have more content. As in activites to do and improving PvE more which they have but it still needs work.Thanks for reading.			",54,6,1,9,9,0,8

												Don't beleive what anyone tells you. This game is all about PVP. There isn't any way to play this game without getting attacked at random by morons who think it's fun. The 'community' is full of hateful, unhelpful people who's only bit of 'advice' to new players is ""lol stop playing""This isn't a game, it's a job. And a terrible one at that.			",47,11,0,19,13,2,5

												Playing as an Alpha Clone (free-to-try) I find there's still plenty to do without feeling too restricted. You're allotted a set number of skills and limited to piloting only ships from your own race up to cruiser-class. A paid account (Omega) would lift these restrictions. The revised ""New Player Experience"" helps with learning the mechanics of Eve. If you have the patience to learn the complexity of Eve early on, the long-term experience will be rewarding.

												There will never be another game like it.It is not your traditional MMO. It relies heavily on the fact that it's all about its player-created universe. It is a little slow paced, and you do will not want to do PVE for PVE's sake forever.But where else can you actually watch empires rise and fall detached from some developer's scripted boring plot? We recently had a war where half the playerbase was hired to the rough equivalent of $11,000 to go destroy one of the biggest, longest-standing, and most toxic entities in the game.Beyond that, there's smaller games of cat and mouse to be played inside low-security space and wormholes, and the thrills of actual risk that are so thoroughly divorced from MMOs and shooters. When you blow up someone else's ship, it stays gone, providing a satisfaction to destruction I can't get from WoW or Overwatch.Give it a try. It'll take some work to figure out - I've played a long time and I'm not even close - but each piece the game reveals to me is another reward.			",248,62,1,39,12,3,34

												Vast, everchanging, and a 3rd job. EVE Online will suck you in with it's possibilities, but whether it gets its claws into you depends on the community you make yourself a part of. Flying solo in EVE is possible but much slower. If you find a good corporation, they will help you along and then add that little bit of accountability that will keep you logging on and forgetting about reality. I don't suggest this for anybody with responsibilites beyond a job to go to.			",70,14,2,7,13,0,14

												Good Day,My friends called Eve ""Microsoft Excel Online"" but it isn't that bad, EVE has a very complex and layered interface it is the definition of old school mindsets for how to approach developing a PC game. With that said I did not down rate this because of the interface, if the game didn't turn me off with other things the interface wouldn't have bugged me at all, instead it became one more reason not to play the game.The problem with EVE in my opinion is that it failed to give me the impression that I was piloting a starship or was part of something bigger and instead I felt like I was the star ship itself. There is a distinction here and with that said I could not convince myself that this game was worth the price tag.The community for EVE is very nice from my experience and once you understand the chat interface you can meet very kind and helpful people. I have nothing to really say about the developers since I never ran into any bugs or had any complications, the game does what it was intended to do well.I played EVE for about 3 weeks and a few months later I decided to write this review since by now I think I have an objective opinion of the game and I will present the rest of it now:EVE has an unfun micromanagement issue where you need to travel and do essentially a fetch quest but the time it takes to do this quest can get unbarable. Worse yet at the begining you will be micromanaging just about everything so it's not like you can walk away and take a shower and stuff will get done. I got to the point where I could set AI to take care of somethings in high concord areas (Basically AI will protect me from evil players) but there is nothing fun about mining.The next thing is EVE's character creator, it's AMAZING I really liked spending an hour making my character but afterwards there is nothing, nothing to it at all. You can't interact with NPCS because you aren't your character persay. Instead Interactions happen between ships this threw me off big time and I gave the game a chance in the hope that maybe they had plans to expand this stuff but I know of no such plans and I'm unwilling to dump money and time on this game because of it. Essentially instead of feeling like the Captain of my ship I feel like a ship.The Music in EVE passes the time well but bring your own music because even good music gets boring after your 15th material haul. Eve takes itself too seriously, the game tries way too hard and consumes way too much time, while I didn't mind it at first the back and forth between areas and having to wait for 2 days for things to complete so I could use them only to find some detail that requires something else be made before I could use it  or make something from it.  To put it briefly the game does not appreciate the value of the players time and it is not streamlined to deliver it's product to the player. The result is being pounded with self imposed fetch missions across a small portion of the galaxy which can take 20 minutes to traverse if you don't get lost.Textures are mid to low, the character textures are mid to high though, but the game graphically is not puke worthy but it doesn't get any praises from me. Space ship fights look like something you'd see from a web game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												It's a neat concept for MMORPGs but the always-on PVP (PVP is enabled on every server and in every location in the game, even ""newbie"" areas) makes it virtually impossible to ""break in"" to the game.  Joining corporations (guilds) does help a little but the war system means that other corporations can declare war on yours and you're fair game everywhere meaning that, until you've spent a very long time getting higher-end spaceships (even if someone gives you one  it takes weeks of training before you can fly it), you're stuck sitting in a station because you can be destroyed the second you exit.  Even outside wars, people sit at gates (how you travel between systems) and just destroy people randomly and, as a new player there's no way you can stand up to them.  It's not a terribly newbie-friendly game but if you don't mind spending months being completely outclassed by your attackers before you have a chance to fight back you may enjoy it as the mechanics are good.

												I've been playing scince early 2004. (Ignore the time on this steam account, this is just a scouting alt. There is a lesson in that.) Know now that Eve is not for the soloist, nor the faint of heart.The only skills truly required in Eve is friendship, and being calculated in every decision. ""Attention to detail, teamwork is the key!"" I've chanted that countless times in the military, and Eve is one of the few rare games that truly emphisize that. Above all else, learn that you are not your ship. You will lose plenty of them, and it may frustrate you. Take the time to learn from every decision you make, otherwise you will have invested time poorly. The community is hostile, but it responds well to those thick-skinned. Even with that said, trust nobody. You have landed in a shark tank, and know that going in.There is a lot to learn, and it takes time to amass that knowledge. Though having spent fourteen years playing Eve Online, I have seen it's worth aplenty. Without wax, it is vastly worth it.			",62,12,0,15,20,0,8

												Fantastic game. I came in incredibly intimidated by everything I ever heard of about this game, especially the steep learning curve and heavy PVP aspect. I grabbed a venture, started mining, slowly made a little isk, got ganked, made more isk, found a new, small, indy corp in HighSec. We all grew together, made friends, slowly skilled up, got war dec, got ganked, skilled up more, made more isk, time went on and I learned something new literally every day. Now we're in an indy alliance living in Null. Made new friends, learned a lot more, had to skill up in things I never thought I'd ever use, and there's plenty to do everyday. Now I go on roams, get drunk and gate camp, go out on large coalition fleets with hundreds of other players (also drunk), blow up citadels, mine null sec ore with maxed Exhumers, go ratting in my VNI, the list goes on. Sometimes I sit there in my Hulk mining and I think back to my days in a venture where it would take me 2 hours to make what I do now in ten minutes. I'm only less than half a year in, if veterans of this game read this they'll probably say ""awww how cute"". I'm still a total noob but this is some of the most fun I've ever had being a noob.A few tips.Don't buy any of the packs, there's nothing in them worth the money, with that money you're better off just buying plex and selling it.Don't log in through steam. Download the client directly from the offcial site and just run it independently.Find a corp sooner than later.Don't join Goonswarm.You're going to lose ships, not a big deal, don't let it ruin your game.

												unless you are paying for the game its best not to play. you only get to play a corvette and thats it. you cant play any other ship because its all locked in ""omega clone status"" aka ""i have money and pay for game"" if you are free to play only i would absolutely NOT recommend this game unless you pay.it should have remained pay to play because their version of free to play is just an epic troll. its like a sample cart at costco where you take a bite of the game and then leave. if they made it where you were able to play tech 1 ships with tech level 1 equipment that would be way more interesting to actually get into.the basic understanding when you first get into this game is ""this other ship on the market looks cool i should train towards it"" if you cant do anything at all? why bother to even experience the game? or let alone pay for it? i dont know if it is a advertising campaign to try to get people to look at the game? but they are doing a♥♥♥♥♥♥poor job. it creates no basic level interest or any goal based interest. including when the game takes ALOT OF TIME TO PLAY!what are you trying to do EVE? if you want more people to play? lift the omega lock to tech 2, tech 3, faction  and capital ships only. if you allow people to just play tech 1 and establish themselves in the game. that would be enough time for people to become interested in the game is because they have taken the time to create assets of interest. THIS GAME HAS A LEARNING CURVE AND DOES NOT TAKE 5 SECONDS TO LEARN! nor does it take a corvette to actually enjoy it.you need to give alpha players more to have fun with than just some stupid corvette. Free Trial had more to offer than alpha F2P. if you are to stingy to try new things then go back to pay to play and stop wasting everyones time...great game though.			",22,0,0,4,3,0,8

												I absolutely recommend EVE. However, you should go into it knowing several things: 1.) It has a steep learning curve. 2.) The possibility exists for you to do anything you can imagine, and be as successful as you want to be, which is incredibly fun. 3.) Any player can take absolutely everything you've gained away from you at any given time. You've been warned.			",328,68,15,116,146,1,141

												unless you are paying for the game its best not to play. you only get to play a corvette and thats it. you cant play any other ship because its all locked in ""omega clone status"" aka ""i have money and pay for game"" if you are free to play only i would absolutely NOT recommend this game unless you pay.it should have remained pay to play because their version of free to play is just an epic troll. its like a sample cart at costco where you take a bite of the game and then leave. if they made it where you were able to play tech 1 ships with tech level 1 equipment that would be way more interesting to actually get into.the basic understanding when you first get into this game is ""this other ship on the market looks cool i should train towards it"" if you cant do anything at all? why bother to even experience the game? or let alone pay for it? i dont know if it is a advertising campaign to try to get people to look at the game? but they are doing a♥♥♥♥♥♥poor job. it creates no basic level interest or any goal based interest. including when the game takes ALOT OF TIME TO PLAY!what are you trying to do EVE? if you want more people to play? lift the omega lock to tech 2, tech 3, faction  and capital ships only. if you allow people to just play tech 1 and establish themselves in the game. that would be enough time for people to become interested in the game is because they have taken the time to create assets of interest. THIS GAME HAS A LEARNING CURVE AND DOES NOT TAKE 5 SECONDS TO LEARN! nor does it take a corvette to actually enjoy it.you need to give alpha players more to have fun with than just some stupid corvette. Free Trial had more to offer than alpha F2P. if you are to stingy to try new things then go back to pay to play and stop wasting everyones time...great game though.			",22,0,0,4,3,0,8

												I play Eve without Steam, and have lots of time in it. It's not for everyone, and neither is Candy Crush. Back when I started playing, I thought it would play similar to Mace Griffin: Bounty Hunter, Elite: Dangerous, or Star Citizen, but it doesn’t — more like a 3D RTS, but honestly it’s very unique. It’s a game about ideas, numbers and people. Your progress won’t be reset with the next content patch, and your skill points will continue to increase if you go on vacation or deployment. Join Pandemic Horde (represent), TEST, Brave Newbies, or Karmafleet (all established newbie-friendly corps) if you want to not hate the game. DO NOT jump into Eve with the goal of mining in highsec. Get on corp comms. If you have any questions, let me know, especially if you're on my friends list.			",99,13,1,12,17,0,17

												Great game. Bad payment model (in my opinion!)Pros;FunGood deapthAll player drivenHuge galaxynon-frustrating movement (warp is fast and not frustrating like some other games I have playedSo much to learn and tryGood graphicsGood soundCons:Subscription modelFree to play is really only free to sampleSo much you have to learn and can't try unless you pay subscription.I don't mind paying for a game once and supporting the industry but I have a budget and am not made of money. After wasting so much money on WoW back in the day (I am 3,135 days WoW free!), I decided I didn't want to play any games with a monthly payment model. I have always wanted to play EVE online, so when I saw it was free to play I downloaded it right away.After playing the tutorial and getting familiar with the game and envisioning my glorious career as a ship captain, I tried to start training skills but found it was very limited to what I could train. So I thought, ""Well, maybe I can pay $60 and unlock the ability."" But no, the only way to improve beyond a basic level is to sign up to pay a monthly subscription.My hopes are dashed to pieces.Oh well, there are other games.			",29,8,1,4,3,0,3

												It is not a new player friendly game. New players are so far behind on skill points (sp) that they can never compete. It is going to take you a good year to get up enough skill points to do the things you want, all the while paying $15 USD a month to keep playing and there is nothing you can do to speed it up (there are implants but we are talking like a few % faster)I did enjoy aspects of the game and the complexity and had a look at buying a charchter, which is perfectly fine to do through offical channels but we are talking like 50 billion ISK  (in game currency) for a good charchter. you can 1 PLEX (30 days of game time) for $20 USD and sell it in game  for 1 billion ISK. Do the the maths that is $1000 USD of Plex i would have to buy, resell in game to buy a charchter to play the the game......A thousand god dam dollars. nope. if CCP ever some hpw give new players a betting start so that are not 8 years behing some of the other players wwith no way to close the gap i might have another, untill than dont waste your time.

												This game looked great in the trailer, but like so many games, the trailer was much more than the game. It's rather fun until you lose your ship that you spent 100,000 credits on, then you have no ship and no papers. The Metacritic rating - 88 is too damn high. I would give it a 40, at most.

												+ Game is actually very good, graphics, gameplay ... everything is just perfect. - And then you meet russian mafia. I guess - to enjoy this game to full extent you have to be very social - ideally play with group of friends. If you try solo, you end up dissapointed. Yes yes, you can join corp, but .. these people don't talk to each other really. It's like CS:GO but these people own half a universe and camp at all low-sec gates all day just to obliterate you. Aaand they have big big ships too. With bigger guns. - The game itself is very, very unforgiving. Work hard to get enough ISK to get that dream ship? Ok - you might just get it, only to see it blown up when flying out of the station you got it. True story :) You work hard to get next one .... but this time you insure it. Another will get blown up, you will get the money, but ... then you spend half a day chasing that missing equipment you lost. That brings me to my point, most of the game you travel. And it's slow. If you have time to kill, this is ideal. Everything is slow (except when you find russian mafia). One of my combats with NPCs took 15 minutes to kill single transport. I went to take a dump, only to find it's not over yet. + On the other hand, level of complexity - it's just amazing. So many items you can loot and put up on your craft, I have never seen so many. And I played for a week only. And I have explored perhaps 1% of it. Maybe less. + It looks good too, while system requirements are pretty modest. That's a big plus. - Also crashes a lot on Mac. What a shame (MacBook Pro 13, Late 2014). Overall: Looking back after a week of intense play (played more hours than shown here), I have to conclude that this is very very slow paced game, if you don't mind getting blown up all the time by super aggresive russians, or to travel 1 hour just to get your new missile launcher, this game might be for you.

												Full Disclosure: This review is what i remember from quite a while ago of EVE. After being asked a ton what i thought of it by various people, I thought I would write this review based on my experiences. While I certainly had fun in it, the lack of any real sense of purpose just kills it. The systems in it are super slow and tedius to use, combat super slow and calculating, requiring a suprisingly small amount of skill, as everything is in the prep work and larger strategy.Basically, the way I see it, this is the kind of game that for me was best played before i knew what i was doing. Once I was told I really shouldn't be doing virtually everything i was doing, the game became entirely boring. While I was aimlessly wandering about and got podded by some dude, i laughed super hard. When i ran across a bunch of enemies i shouldn't be near and got killed in 2 hits, i found it fun. When i found missions for my own level after I started getting some decent-ish ships, the game came grinding down to a halt. Every mission was ""check to see weaknesses, load out accordingly, target enemy and wait. Target enemy and wait. Target enemy and wait. Target enemy and wait.""I don't see this being a game I ever return to, but I don't regret my time in it either. It was radically different from any mmo i've tried before and I give it credit for that. That said, it just doesn't appeal to me much.Should you try it? I really do not know as I never got far enough into it to really experience all it has to offer. Would I personally reccomend the game to someone based off of what I played? No.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I picked this game up a some time ago during a sale and it was really interesting for about three weeks then it just got boring. My issues with the game where twofold starting with the afformetnioned boring that seemed to creep into the game somewhere in my final week before I would have had to throw down for a full sub, mind you for those first three weeks I was completely glued to this game. Coupled with the depressing reality that nothing I did in game really mattered as far as character progression. Since everything is queued and gains points regardless of if you are even logged in, which was sorta cool I guess but the downside was when you where logged in what you did in game didn't matter because it continued to look strictly at the queue. Admittedly that might have changed since I last played but if it hasn't that means if you had say (insert ship skill) queued and went hunting pirates or mining asteroids you got no increase in your weapons or mining skills because they weren't queued. Nor did you appear to get any extra points twards something that you were currently undertaking and had queued. So say you are doing a lot of fighting and had some weapons system or targeting skill queued you didn't get any bonus as far as I saw for actually doing something related to what you had queued. Which injected a certain sense of futility in doing much of anything. I mean there was always grinding for loot to grind for better weapons/ships which you can't used until you queue to train up the requisite skills and log out to let the game train while you are not playing the game.There was also the ever present dread of being pvp fodder in much of anything you do. If that is your thing then you should probably check this out but I don't really get anything out of planning how I'm going to ruin someones day or constantly looking over my shoulder to see who is coming to brighten their day by ruining mine. Tho I will admit that there have been some interesting and entertaining stories that have come out of EVE. That said this game does look to have a bunch of potential that I didn't get to fully explore but ultimately I couldn't really justify the subscription based on my experience.			",164,27,2,17,9,3,29

												I love space games,  I love RPG, I love MMO.  I should love everything about EVE online.  For the moment though I find the game play to be very difficult to get into and even frustrating as I wade through the hours of tutorials which could have been made so much more engaging with a central plot theme, or even just given easily readable interfaces.  I found that I spent so much time simply trying to find a button that opens the area where I need to get my quest item.   Eve is probably a great game, I would probably love it but I have no interest in giving them the benifit of the doubt and suffer the hours of hideous learning curve game play.  There are so many other games out there that don't require me to suffer and then on top of everything else pay a monthly fee. I recommend EVE to only thoese who have an abundence of time and energy or who already have a hardcore friend who can hold their hand through the whole experience until your ready to go off alone.  I have neither so I'll pass for now.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The game is really inaccessible to new players. The time-based skill point system means that you will never be able to do as much as people who have been playing for years. There is little synergy between different career paths so you have to focus on doing one or two things in the game.The real problem though, is that it's not fun. It's a universe where you can do whatever you want, but none of it is fun. Most things you do feel like work.			",157,55,0,71,35,4,62

												Started playing in Jan 2004 when less than 1 year old as a game and played for over 3 years before life got crazy. Now my son gave em the game again and I could not be more delighted. The new player tutorials are very detailed and leave you strting the game with several ships and over 2 Million ISK ( currency).  As a skill based game you can do what you like - mine, build , research, run ops, spy, battle PVE or PVP. Has a excellent detailed marketplace. But the more advanced skills take time - there are some things that help - like attribute modifying cybernetics - but it can take weeks to get high level skills. ( skills train regardless of if you are online) This is good - no amount of money canmake someone walk in and POOF be able to fly a battleship. Also has innovative chracter clothing and imagery interface.  I am enjoying seeing how game has developed. They have updates about once every 2 months so always something new. If you like a hack and slash beat people up do same ting over and over every day sort of game - this is not for you.  If you like an open architecture game that  can be non competitive and easy going or brutal and politcal and cut throat then join us here.  ",14,8,0,17,9,0,9

												EVE Online is one of the most difficult to sum up experiences around, which is indicative of how unique and interesting it is. The only true way to know is to try it and you owe it to yourself to.Advice:-May sound intuitive, but the longer you play - the better it becomes and the more likely you are to enjoy.-Convince some friends to join you on a trial/free account or link up with a corporation.-Ask questions, read the help chat channels and learn from your mistakes.Review InformationFor clarity, I started playing end of 2006, so I have a fair amount of years played. The important points are:-Single shard universe. (One server)-Almost a fully player driven economy. (With a couple of exceptions)-Player driven content. (Transport/hauling for players, player ran bank that offers interest, mercenary/protection contracts - to name a few)-Real consequences for loss and opportunity for gain.-Line between PvE and PvP is blurred and the balance shifts depending on where you are. You exist in a world where either is possible at all times, but there are inherently safer and more dangerous areas.-Single platform for development and commitment to it - EVE Online began around 2003 has been in constant development ever since. Infrastructure, graphics and game features/content iterated on and expanded continually.-Excellent communication between developers and community/players. (Dev Blogs, Fanfest, strong presence in-game and on forums, Player Council elected by players.)-Soundtrack, atmosphere and world building really adds to the overall experience.I'm interested to see where EVE Online will go in the future. I hope they continue to focus their efforts on developing a singular product and reap the rewards (for both player and company) of all the benefits that come with doing so.""There's no such thing as a learning curve in EVE, only a learning cliff.""

												I started the game thinking it wouldtake a while before it was fun like other reviews said. I imidiatly enjoyed it. I joined a corp and found lots of great people, learned how much fun the different things you can do were, and learned how much fun and how dangerous wormhole traveling into unknown space can be. I highly recomend this game if you don't mind spending some time to enjoy the game. I also recomend you try exploration in the game as that is a lot of fun. Also if you are killed by a player, don't let it discorage you. Ask how they killed you and if they have any tips and you will find even that guy who kills you the first time you enter unknown space, also has a heart.			",262,65,3,67,43,3,60

												I have only barely touched the surface of the game so far, but I want to chime in with a few things, seeing some of the negative reviews here:-Yes, the game is complicated and has a learning curve. If you want a smooth and simple ride, you're definately not getting it here.-As a free-to-play, you are indeed limited to smaller ships. That's not entirely that bad. I've been told by veteran players several times that ""Bigger =/= Better"". Having a small frigate is fine for many people.-I see too many people complaining that mining is boring or that the game is too slow. It's a sandbox. If you detest the idea of mining asteroids, then don't. You can focus heavily on combat as well if you wish. It's up to you. You can find a corporation and get involved in space combat, or even find an NPC contact for missions. You can. Just realize there's several ways you can play in EVE.Overall, I'm liking it so far. Opinion may or may not change in the long run, but I simply wanted to point out some things to folks.			",137,19,0,25,9,3,4

The new player tutorials are very detailed and leave you strting the game with several ships and over 2 Million ISK ( currency).  As a skill based game you can do what you like - mine, build , research, run ops, spy, battle PVE or PVP. Has a excellent detailed marketplace. But the more advanced skills take time - there are some things that help - like attribute modifying cybernetics - but it can take weeks to get high level skills. ( skills train regardless of if you are online) This is good - no amount of money canmake someone walk in and POOF be able to fly a battleship. Also has innovative chracter clothing and imagery interface.  I am enjoying seeing how game has developed. They have updates about once every 2 months so always something new. If you like a hack and slash beat people up do same ting over and over every day sort of game - this is not for you.  If you like an open architecture game that  can be non competitive and easy going or brutal and politcal and cut throat then join us here.  ",14,8,0,17,9,0,9

												Playing for a year now, I can say for a fact that this is one of the greatest games I've ever played. From the helpful community , overall depth of game, and great friends you make playing it, it's by far an amazing experience that shines above not only other games of the genre, but every other game out there. Having everyone on a single server lets you, a single person, make an impact on the ENTIRE gaming community. Be it through commanding a giant fleet or being the tech 1 frigate you trained into 2 hours after getting the game, you make a difference.  There aren't any specific goals set in the game, so you'll need to make your own. Unlike most games, once you've chosen your path it will take you a while to master it. So while your skills train passively (yay no long grinds for skills!) so do your player skills. I've been pvp'ing in this game for 10 months and I still have a lot to learn in JUST pvp. Not to mention the hundreds and hundreds of other non-roller coaster career paths you can take up, you will always have something new to strive towards. You won't need to kill a wild hog 500 times to use your gear, since your skills train passively!The pvp in this game is also unreal. I've never had games consistently make my heart race like this one. Be it you barely killed a guy and you yourself only have a sliver of health left, or you just won a fleet fight where you were just commanding 50 people, and you just barely came out on top from the 75man gang you ran into! Just in pvp, the depth is unreal. With hundreds upon hundreds of modules, ship types, and environmental factors it keeps pvp a challenging and fresh experience day in and day out. You can change your game from flying solo, flying in small gangs with a few of your bros, to HUGE fleet fights with thousands of people! Although the learning curve is steep if you go at it alone, it's not meant to be played that way. There's nothing else like making new friends and playing through the game with a group of people you care about and smacktalk and chill on comms with. With only a day of training - you can fly and ♥♥♥♥ with players who've already been playing for 10 YEARS. I highly recommend you at least give the trial a shot, and hit me up so I can give you a hand. If I'm not available, be sure to stop by the channel ""R-V-B"" and join them to get your feet wet with some fast paced and heart racing pvp! All in all, I r8 8/8 m8 ",59,10,0,6,8,0,28

												Quite possibly the hardest most brutal game you can find. One might even go so far as to stop calling it a game, as it's more than that - it's an alternate universe, being 90% controlled by the people who play it, it feels as close to real as a game can. Your actions will stick with you, for better or for worse. People remember, and how you choose to live your alternate life as an EVE Online pilot can lead to you being well-known to thousands of people, giving you a kind of power that no other game (and in some cases real life) can offer you. Or, you may find yourself hated by many, and being driven out of the EVE universe. However, most don't reach this level, and many quit before giving the game a chance. It takes a certain kind of person to enjoy EVE, one that can be quite rare. However, if you're that kind of person, this game is like none other, can provide countless hours of enjoyment, and offers a unique sense of belonging.			",70,5,0,6,10,0,4

												A true sandbox MMO that will definitely eat up more time than you intend. There's so much to do and so many viable play styles (industry, exploration, PvE, PvP, and trade to name a few big ones) that there's really no excuse to be bored. You can micro-manage as much, or as little, as you want.Don't Buy the Starter PackIt sounds like a deal, but it's not. I bought it when I originally started playing, and trying to move that amount of stuff around as a newbie is more trouble than it's worth. Go to reddit or just about any other EVE site and ask for a trial code. That will give you 21 days to test the waters free, as opposed to the usual 14. Even if you subscribe 2 days after starting the trial, You'll retain any leftover trial days after subscribing.Play Through the Tutorials, ReallyEvery EVE vet will tell you that skipping the tutorials is about the dumbest thing you can do. While it is a wall of text (they are fixing it...it's already better than it used to be, which is saying something), it will teach you the basics of just about everything in EVE. You'll also get a good handful of ships to fly around in and a nice chunk of money to start off with. See above - starter pack isn't worth it, and will cause more confusion than problems it solves.The Skill System Doesn't Screw Over New PlayersIt's easy to look at EVE's skilling system and say that it gives veterans an unfair advantage. It doesn't. You'll probably spend the first 2-3 months getting all of the ""core"" skills out of the way, during which you can still have a lot of fun and do a lot of things - a week into the game I was flying around with small PvP fleets (5-10 people) and meaningfully contributing. After the ""core"" stuff is out of the way, any further differences are on the scale of 2-5%. There's much more going on in combat that's going to dictate the outcome than skills.Bigger isn't BetterIt's easy to get caught up in the excitement of flying huge ships in massive battles, but rushing to that point is the easiest way to ruin your experience. You can fly those ships around, but you will be far from effective, which is a quick route to discouragement. Start out in the small ships, learn the game, get blown up. Frigates are cheap for a reason, and new and old players both fly them more than you'd think. Most common advice for someone interested in PvP? Fit 50 cheap frigates and go get them all blown up.Dive in and Have Fun!You will make tons of mistakes while playing (I know I still do), and you will lose ships. In the words of Ms. Frizzle, ""Take chances, make mistakes, get messy!"" It's the best way to enjoy EVE.			",161,37,2,35,35,0,27

												What can I say about this game? Well to start, its one of the very few MMOs that I have played in the past several years that still keeps me interested. Constant updates like the new Citadels or upcoming ship revamping to the player community in game make Eve some of the best fun I've ever had. One of the best pieces of advice I can give new players is to activly seek out people and corps to join up with. Eve is a very player driven game and most of the fun comes from playing with other players. There are corperations for every type of player from the combat hard fleet commander to the casual miner, daily players or weekly/monthly types. The best thing you can do is give the game a try. Eve constantly runs a 14-21 day trail program that will give you a near full game experiance and Steam offers from time to time offers a free weekend that will give you FULL access to everything Eve has to offer. If you dont want to take my word, the nearly 2000 hours I have registered on Steam should give you a good idea about how much I like it and you may too. Fly safe! o7			",65,6,2,7,11,2,16

												I get what they're trying to do here but throwing newbies right into the stew with lategame players is always a bad idea. NO. Stop trying defend such things. It's a bad idea. The learning curve for this game has already been metion enough but really I believe alot of that could be alleviated merely by putting new players in a seperate instance space while they learn the flight controls, How to read they terribly designed HUD [which can be modified but still], and come to terms with everything availible to them. By throwing Newbies in the pot with Vets you only whind up with a massive turnover rate. Which is sad cause I see great potential for this type of hands off MMO. But just because you'll let your game world run itself doesn't give you the excuse to not actually design a good tutorial. TL;DR Any game with this strong of a learning curve should have a good tutorial. This one doesn't as such you SHOULD count that against the game. NO Players shouldn't have to just slog through it 'till the good stuff comes'. That is asinine for a game that is subscription.			",207,34,0,51,37,2,41

												It's a game that pretty much every serious gamer should try. You probably heard that it's not like any other game, and do trust these words as they are true. Even if MMOs isn't your most beloved genre, there's still reason to try it because of how much it can offer. It's not for everyone, that's for sure, and chances of that you won't find it your game are rather high, but it's so special and fascinating that not trying it would be wrong.

												Given that CCP's landmark creation, EVE Online has consecutively walked away with our annual ""MMORPG of the year award"" it would be safe to assume that we like this game. I would even be so bold as to say that this collective Internet cloud cherishes, loves, adores, and embraces everything about this online-romp. Eve Online is perhaps one of the most purest definitions of the genre; a definitive example of how a PC, monitor, and Internet connection can open a gateway to a virtual world.Let's just get it out of the way - if I could, I would marry, buy a condo, and have children with Eve Online: It is just that damn sexy. With that said, let's get on with the formal make-out session I like to call a review.Aesthetics 9/10Given that the game is now approaching almost 9 years in age, you have to hand it to CCP for keeping EVE so visually appealing. Starting out in 2003 as a slightly emancipated, ungainly child of an MMO, the Icelandic developer has continually updated and refined their vision of space. From sweeping vistas, colourful gas arrays, and goliath ships that pound seven tons of laser out of each other - EVE Online has a graphical charm you can't help but admire.The scale and ""epic"" nature of the entire ensemble fights tightly with the adventures that unfold around you - couple this with an inspired soundtrack and you might just believe you are a space-faring smuggler. Since Incarna, the developer's have taken us one step closer in letting us walk around in space stations (still no direct contact) which also adds another layer of immersion, and helps create some of the most camp looking avatar's in MMO history (I prefer the sunglasses and a look that says ""I'm casual but I'm ready for anything."")Perhaps EVE Online's biggest draw however, above and beyond the new interior bits or the awe-inspiring space stations, is its scalability. Whether you have the dimmest laptop or the mightiest gaming rig, New Eden is a forgiving mistress when it comes to processing power, meaning that you won't have to earmark a thousand dollars to make the game actually run - and that's what we like, humble yet attractive.Gameplay 10/10Eve Online is a game in which you can run quests in the morning, build a spacecraft for lunch, and pretend to be an inter-galactic Gordon Gecko for the afternoon. No MMO has ever come quite as close in achieving the multi-faceted, ""make your own adventure"" that defines this genre. Starting out with a tiny ship and without a single credit to your name, it is a player’s choice and individual journey that will lead them to the height of piracy, or even a freighting-empire.The ever-refining tutorials now streamline the process from creation to first steps with easy to follow guides, as well as nudging you to a number of missions which give a taste for the various facets of the game. While newcomers will still suffer from what is known as ""Eve-istentialism"" at the enormity of the experience, CCP is doing their upmost to help this feeling dissipate.And yet if you come from any traditional online game, you will be confused and scared by EVE Online. The lack of a level system, grind, humdrum questing, or even equipment (+135 Strength YAY!!) building will shock most people. This MMO takes a different tact, skills are gained in real-time, ticking over in hours or sometimes days, meaning that progress isn't about gaining an Engineering level 4, but the bits you do in between. The biggest indicator of success is in the ship you cruise around in, and the amount of money you have in the bank - sort of like a galaxy hopping rap artists: it's all about thruster-spinners and the fuzzy space-dice.How you achieve riches and infamy within New Eden however, will be up to you. It isn't highfaluting talk to say that you could pirate the vacuum, or mine your way to fortune. Eve Online is developed is such a way that every play style is catered for, whether you want to be an action-ready pilot or instead a docile mogul looking for that chance to make it rich.This is also one of the last few MMORPG's to emphasize the ""multiplayer"" part. Making it within New Eden will require a few choice friends, and seeing some of the more dangerous and exciting sights will definitely require a buddy or two. Low secruity space offers some of the most intriguing and thrilling moments of PvP known to the genre. This FFA full loot area will see paranoid groups mining for the finest ores, or even cruising asteroid belts looking for unaware opportunists - whatever the case may be, low-sec will never provide a dull moment.From the economy to warfare amongst corporations, the individual can influence everything, and that is where this game shines. Like Ultima Online before, this is the type of game that you can proudly nail your colours the mast and proclaim that the experiment works, and you do indeed have a second life, in a galaxy far, far away.But is it perfect? With a score winking a mighty 10 above, I'd say that whatever few negatives pale in comparison to the sheer volume of things that this game has going for it. For whatever cat-calls of it being too slow, too group-orientated, or indeed ""We play to crush, not to bake bread!"" well that's just missing the entire point of EVE Online: it is a virtual world, go out there and take advantage of it in its full glory.Innovation 10/10Originally EVE Online was a slightly broken, online Elite with nods towards Ultima Online. Now almost 9 years later that game is the hulking Goliath that most sandbox MMORPGs look to emulate. From the exclusion of grind to the classless, limitless choices for your avatar, CCP's title is leading the way in terms of what can be achieved within the genre.Like UO before it, the game bangs the drum of the ""playing to bake bread"" in that it gives you the option to play an action-packed pirate, or a simple engineer. This is the type of game that truly brings to life the idea of virtual world and finding your own place within it. Even before we exclaim about player-driven markets, low-sec space, or the countless ways its developer's have overcome the most extensive genre issues, EVE Online is first and foremost the greatest definition of the term MMORPG. Innovation is what its Icelandic studio guzzles for breakfast.Polish 9/10Developing an MMORPG over the course of many years must become like a routine juggling act. On the one hand, maintenance, patching, and refining must all be attempted, but tweaking one thing might cause the whole thing to fall to a crumbled mess on the floor, with several angry little people caps locking ""OMFG NEWB RUINED THE GAME"". To this end, CCP have done a very admirable job in keeping this game in check, whilst continually adding and tweaking in whatever way they see fit.EVE Online will rarely splutter or stall, neither will it kick you out like a stroppy horse. Through years and years of continually bettering their product, the Icelandic developer has, with gaffer tape and lots of spittle, forged a well-made, tight game. Now just get on with remaking those newbie ships.Longevity 9/10Most MMORPGs are victim to what is known as the ""locust player"". This is the type of gamer that will not rest, sleep, eat, or poop before they can claim that they dinged 50 before the servers even opened. CCP have once again bucked the trend by offering a game that makes it not only unconquerable with days, but even within months you will still be training skills and juggling abilities.What this means is that not only is the experience in New Eden vast, but also there are many ways in which to go back through it all, never doing the same thing twice. With so many skills and with those taking a finite amount of real-life time, unless you have dual accounts alts are essential to the experience, as well as time consuming to make: the result being that you'll be playing EVE Online for a very long time.Final score 9.2			",74,4,1,9,1,0,0

												How do you summarize a game that can be played in a million different ways - even when the game is not even turned on? I care about kills because I'm PvP oriented and I like green entries on my Killboard - maybe totally lame for a high-margin market trader or some sneaky explorer etc. Losing a ship in the early stages can be painful, you just spent maybe half your fortune on that thing. But here is the thing - maybe it was your own fault. You start in High-Security Systems in which you are kind of protected against random agressions (if you buy PLEX and sell those to get a lot of ingame currency and then buy really expensive stuff and put it in your cargo you have a huge Target on your back - don't do that), but if you go into low-sec or null-sec (or spooky spooky wormholes), people will engage you and murder you if you are not associated with them - chances are pretty slim that somebody lets you walk - what might happen is that people see that you are new and send you some money after they killed your ship and your capsule.EvE is hard and there can be many reasons why you might quit early on. Frustration because of missing knowledge or boredom because you hang out in your Beginners-Mining Ship (Venture) and hack away at an Asteroid for a laughable reward. While frustration and boredom might be initial reasons to quit (among other things) these factors can be a constant threat to your enjoyment of the game. But here is the thing - you can decide how you play this game and how you want to spent your time. PvP, doing Missions for Agents, Mining, Building, Trading, Exploring etc.Are you artistic and like doing things in GIMP or Photoshop? Create an interesting/funny/serious poster for your Corp or Alliance and receive ISK for it. You are an IT-Guy/Gal who can set up Stuff for your Corp/Alliance - expect ISK raining down from the heavens. Eve extends vastly over the Game itself, more than maybe any other Game. If you are new to Eve here are some Guidelines:- The start is not user friendly and it can be overwhelming (I wanted to punch my screen when I started and I was supposed to scan something). It ♥♥♥♥ing sucks, but hang in there.- Don't trust anyone, but also join a Corp, built relationships, think ahead while interacting. If something is free or too good to be true it's most likely a scam. Ask in-Game for help - also EvE University, Pandemic Horde, Karmafleet etc. are a few of the big Beginner-friendly Alliances, which are also involved in big fights. But don't overlook smaller Corporations or Alliances, there might be a perfect one for you out there. Additionally Corps, Alliances or single Persons can be pretty toxic, if something is not for you leave and search for greener pastures - because some people are ♥♥♥♥ing awful (not League of Legends awful, but still).- Don't fly around in Ships you can't replace / Don't buy Items with real world Money and fly them around (Plex and Skillinjectors is a nono in the cargohold - exceptions may apply here).- You are ""safe"" nowhere, but outside of High-Sec (read it up) you are freely engageable.- Play EvE if you have the time and you want vast and slightly complicated - if you don't want a doughnut but go to the bakery to get a doughnut and write then a bad yelp review for the bakery you are just the worst kind of person.- Reviews and the enforcement of an opinionated culture are a platonic nightmare... We are all doomed. ♥ ♥ ♥			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Not a game. A way of life.A rare work of digital entertainment who has the potential of changing people's lives.The ""entry ticket"" is expensive because the game is vast. Go piecewise. Play solo or with friends. Roleplay it or break the fourth wall. Do it your way.The game can be a very stressful, or a very relaxed, almost contemplative experience.Typically, you play for 6 months, a year, three years.

												151 hrs on record. 150 of them were sitting in a station queuing up skills and wandering off to make food or watch tv. It seemed like everything I tried to do in the game was wrong and any time I tried to venture to make money, I'd get gatecamped and lose more than I gained.Progression is just far too slow unless you have a megacorp that you belong to. Unfortunately, that's just not my playstyle. Cool ships, cool concept, cool open-worldness. I simply don't have enough time between work and real life to make this game pay-off or be enjoyable.Hoping Star Citizen allows a bit more freedom and feeling of reward.			",256,64,6,69,56,2,59

												9.3/10 - Best Space Game AroundIt's not Star Trek.. but it may be better! Countless high detail galaxies, upgradable ships, corporations and more. The best space based game I have ever played.This is a monthly subscription though which causes me to stop playing after my steam deals expire. 'Plex' or month subscriptions are about $15/mo.Look to grab this game on steam for about $15 which includes a few month bundle. Play hard then disgard or subscribe.

												I feel that it needs to be said that the recent influx of negative reviews is down to one thing and one thing only; false expectations. This is a wonderful game, and the many new players trying this game since the 15th have apparently yet to realise and truly appreciate what this game really is. Yes, it's difficult. No, it doesn't hold your hand. No, this does not make it a bad game.All of these new players spewing out negative reviews either need to understand the game more or just accept that the game isn't for them, and that they should go play something much easier or simpler.I highly recommend trying EVE Online, but only if you're up for a challenge. The 'player-run' aspect of it really is amazing to play with, and there's always something to do in New Eden.			",89,15,1,14,12,1,2

												EVE has several problems. It's a fantastic science fiction game with lots of tactics/culture/economy, however, it's basically a second job. And more importantly, there's alot of hate for carebears. There's a big push for PvP. In all honesty, this is why after 6 years of playing. I gave up on it. It was just too pvp-centric for me. The point about in game characters in the game never materialized, I believe this in part, because the same mechanics of the game where duplicated in Dust 514. (And did not do so well.) I hope someday they make carebearing more fun, and less harped on by pvp players who flip your cans, create corp wars, or locator agents to harass miners, haulers, and industrialists. PVP in this game was too slow for it to be fun, and losses where real enough to not entertain my interest.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is the first game I've played where I've accumulated so many hours so quickly. I did the tutorials, then the career agent missions, and then spent time building my savings with isk from mining. I struggled at first but asking questions in chat and watching all of the videos in-game helped a lot. Now many tasks are quite easy to do. I did join a corporation but they were in 5 different wars within 2 days. I ended up leaving and going back to the NPC corp where I don't have to worry about wars yet. I'll keep it solo for a bit.  I was an alpha player for a week and a half before going to omega. My next plan is to earn enough isk to buy PLEX.			",85,34,3,27,32,1,24

												This game is spacemazing. If you have ever played any of the Escape Velocity games, it's like that but 1,000 times more epic and of course with more innovations. This is the first monthly pay game I've ever bothered spending money on. It's just too amazing not to give it a try.If you want to play a game that tells you what to do at every turn, hey listen, this isn't the game for you. There is so much freedom to do what you want it can be daunting. It really captures the vastness of the cosmos. Here are the possible ""career"" paths one could take: http://eve-guides.fr/images/wtd.jpgBe prepared to spend a good amount of time learning the interface. I wouldn't say it's really difficult (so far). But, there is a steep learning curve to the controls. There are many video tutorials under the F12 > Tutorials. Some tutorials don't make everything clear, so use YouTube too or the Rookie Chat to ask questions.Edit: I changed my review when I discovered you *can* use the ""EVE Online - Core Starter Pack"" with a Steam FTP Weekend account. The note, ""Purchasing a Starter Pack will initiate the creation of a new EVE account. This account cannot…"" is directed at non-Steam EVE Online accounts.			",98,24,1,25,12,1,15

												Do I recommend this game? Hmm. If you have patience and have some intelligence then yes. If you like the idea of free-roaming in space in an almost endless system and doing whatever you like.. then again my answer would be a yes. It's not for everyone though, it not initially a fast paced game as there's a learning curve to tackle, and don't be put off by the subs based payment. It's quite easy to your subs with ingame money with a small amount diligence. Very well made game though in my opinion, and thoroughly enjoyable.			",84,12,13,1,22,0,10

												I have had this game not connected to steam and have played for years. Yes you starting as a new player will have nowhere near the SP (skill points) compared to a veteran player, however just because they have the sp does not mean they have the skills to use said sp.This is an MMO and as such you get a very large benefit by joining a corporation (clan) and if said corp is in an alliance (group of allied corps) with both people to play along side and well as teach you the tricks to survive. If you sit in High sec (safe space) alone you will hate this game......period. If all you do is mine or mission solo life will be terrible and you will quit and have a bad taste for an other wise ok game.It is not F2P and has a Sub. If you think and have drive this game is good, if you are stupid and have to have your hand held to have fun don't play.			",91,6,0,22,14,0,30

												First of all, i dont think that players who spend less than half of the year in this game are able to give you full review on this game. It doesn't mean that people who played one week and left the game are bad players...no. The most essential aspect of the game starts from the very begining. After several hours of gametime you will get the most vital point of the game. Its - Leveling of your skills. This game have really bad♥♥♥♥♥leveling system. I'ts good that you are getting this point at the very begining, so you have two options - 1) Proceed 2) Quit. Ok lets come back to review.Very good to play when you dont hooked by other game(s).

												There really should be a thumb sideways. I like the game. This is my second go trying EVE. I want to get it. I want to love it. But getting anywhere and doing anything is....so........s.l.o.w. This nice thing about this game is that you can play it while playing other games at the same time. If I have to travel a long ways, like 6-10 jumps I'll play a few games of blitz chess on chess.com. One thing I am certain about, you have to put in alot of effort just to make a small dent in everything the game has to offer, but I am not entirely certain I am having fun. It's strange. Therefore, if I can't tell if I am having fun or not then I couldn't very well recommend the game to someone else.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												""addicting"" isn't a strong enough wordThis game is not for everyone. It doesn't hold your hand. It doesn't lead you by the nose. It does not have mercy for those not willing to put in effort to gain anything. Pros:Beautiful scenery. Literal galactic vistas that can be more beautiful than your own night sky. Highly detailed ships. (So detailed you can identify what the armament is by looking at them.) VAST OPEN SPACE.. over 7500 different systems to explore and get blown up in. There is something for every play style: PVP, PVE, Marketing, Mining, Industry, Research, Exploration (that pays!), manufacturing, and even more. Constantly evolving game with direct player influence over everything in the game and a great deal of player influence on further game development. It's not, nor will it ever be, dumbed down to make it easier.Cons:This game is one of the most unforgiving MMOs out there. If you blow up your big fancy ship that you worked months to save up for and trained to fly.. Too bad. It's gone now. Have to buy a new one. And if you had implants, they're gone now too.  No magical respawn where you appear in a ""safe zone"" complete with your newly rebuilt ship. Nope, you regain consciousness in your home station.. Naked, and with only what's left in your hangar. Sucks to be you.Another con.. players can be giant jerks sometimes and scamming is rampant in the trade hubs. The devs take a very hands-off approach to this. So be wary about deals that seem to good and read every detail of contracts.I can not stress enough how much I love this game. It's not for everyone. If you played WoW or other simplistic MMOs.. this is like driving in a goKart and suddenly being handed the keys to the space shuttle. Its awesome but you have the learning curve of a baby bird getting punted out of it's nest! They have made great strides in trying to make it new player friendly without dumbing down the game. I think you'll be pleasantly surprised.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Hi there,this game can be pretty captivating.if you put time in fun comes out. If you want PVP join plaer a corporation.If you want PVE stay with the NPC Corporation or to do Hauling (transportation of goods) or Industry (""Indy"").There is mission running, in different flavors: Security, distribution, R&D and others.Security: They revolve about  killing NPC's of opposing factions and maybe save some cargo or people(or captivivate them).Distribution: little more for the calm minded people(if in so called High sec) just pushing wares from one point to another.You can get yourself Blueprints  and Build Ships ammunition Weapons and a real big bunch of items.You can develop Blueprints further for efficiency or use them to develop something of higher tech level.The PVP fleets are huge and if you get proficient you can harness other peoples fortunes to build up your own.if you want to start and subscribe right NOW you can also use my referal :)http://secure.eveonline.com/trial/?invc=5145a875-9db0-475a-803c-f09d5ce15d96&action=buddyGives you one week abovethe regular trial.

												Dont listen to the people complaining about pay to win, or being destroyed in high security space, or complaining about older players having an advantage. Its an MMO, every game has people who will kill you and take your stuff. Its a sandbox. You do what you want. And the police in high security space will pretty much help you and destroy your attacker in a second. The only time you will get attacked in space is if you have a very expensive and vulnerable ship, such as a miner. Skill points are gained over time, and while an older player may have high skills, you can still outwit them. Just keep your ships cheap so losing them wont make you quit.PS dont be a miner if its that boring and you die. Go do something else.			",107,10,1,12,15,0,12

I play 15 hours before I was banned, and I did nothing at all wrong. I playd before and the PLEX is still a rip off, not to mention how they added AUR shop full of useless stuff and its very expencive to stay competative but now its PAY TO WIN with buying skill points.Support ques are beyond a joke and CCP Peligro is very rude.

												God damn it. It's only been 2 days since i started it and I've played 24 hours. It's good. Really good. there is something for everyone. If you want to play aggressivly you can be a pirate, bounty hunter, hitman, doesnt matter you can be a War Machine. If you want to play passivly you can be a miner, trader, builder (meaning you build parts, ships, weapons, all sorts of stuff) own a space station. You can play both where you run and gun all while feeding your empire with the goods you earn. You REALLY should play this. If you want a friend code for a free couple weeks just let me or anyone in this review thread know.			",232,48,2,69,33,2,53

												I gave the game over a month of my time recently. And I own more then 4 accounts from attempts at diffrent times in life months or years apart. This is attempt number 5 and I am finished.I found the game mostly to be disingenuious, its not that there is no content, it is a factor that the EvE community basically has an in-grown tradition of lieing their asses off for the privlage of blowing away the new guy. Most of the community is even willing to pay you for the privlage. But the time invested is honestly not worth it for what you get out of the box, you cannot buy or even obtain membership in what you would term "" a decient clan "" or corp as they are called here. And this is the really harsh criticism I have, unless your part of a super-large-well-equipped multiple corporation alliance you can look foward to repeated losses with no whim or pattern to them, forcing you as a new player to feel bad repeatedly for honestly just plodding along and working the game the only way you know how. There is no excuse for this honestly, you should not need to have a college class or 4 to 6 hours of youtube videos to figure all the tips and tricks involved in navigation of your ship in eve, and even when you do know all you need to know there is no simple well organized system to let you know when your♥♥♥♥♥is indeed in trouble. This comes from the simple fact that players do not identify with factions in any way that means♥♥♥♥♥♥to you, the new average player. There are too many player made corporations and no system for classifying them into say pirate corporations. You have to litterally play this game for years, and fly/operate in the same sectors to develop a ""phone book"" of bad guys, which takes time and lots of blown up ships, shattered dreams and honestly pointless slaughter to no end, and given the priorities of the fleets and people in eve, they will not travel half an hour just to avenge your poor stinking soul when they can be protecting some station or sector with bigger more valueable ships at risk. The game operates mostly as a space driven feudal system intended to reward the players who gang up fast, and by the way dont bother even buying a big ship. Apperantly the stealth bomber class can kill anything in the game they just need  someone to scout for them. A three man team of players can acomplish a whole lot of hurt in the game. Including ruining your brand new battlecruiser (shopping mall sized) with a ship about the size of a large pickup truck.So play the game please do so, but understand there really is no helping their system they have decided to just let this game go based on player abuse made wrought into content. They moderate some chat channels but its a far cry from anything close to fair. Even in the so called high security zones people kill players repeatedly, espicially the mining ships.Apperantly loosing money to little or no goal, is good playing for EvE Online, meaning 1 million credits destroyer or even 300-500 thousand frigate is worth blowing up for your free mining frigate or 200k. Litterally they will take the loss just to make you feel the pain. What a great game!			",92,6,0,23,15,0,27

												Decent game, terrible support.Played this game for several years (From 2006 to ~ 2012), stopped playing due to a combination of personal time constraints, and the developers seeming inability to fix longstanding issues. But my biggest gripe, and the reason I warn anyone who wants to play a game from this developer, is thier abysmal customer support. If something happens and you need to submit a support ticket, expect anywhere from weeks to months for a response,  (and even longer if you have to reply to have the awnser fixed!).And if your account gets hacked, well tough♥♥♥♥♥♥ Best case scenario is that you get your account back within a couple of months, (yes months, and any time you paid for the game during that time is essentially lost), with almost non of your items. (If the hacker sells all your stuff, its gone buddy).If the hacker does anything to get your account banned, they will return the account to you but not reverse the ban. (And any game time you had on that account is ♥♥♥♥ed), If they are merciful they will allow you to start over and  create a new character (in a game where skills are time-based, meaning you could lose years! worth of skills), and use the gametime already credited to your account.If your super unlucky (as I was) the hacker will sell your account/character (which is condoned by the developer). In this case you are ♥♥♥♥ed, as the developer will just let the hacker/third party keep your account.			",120,27,2,21,43,1,42

												The MMO is something to be remembered it is worth the price and offers hundreds of possibilities for you to explore... I am the only gamer girl in my clan, and it is totally worth it ^.^, this game is not for the feint minded, it requires you to actually spend time training in skills and learning the concepts of the game; But once you do the rewards are endless. it is a massive sandbox world with 7,500 star systems and hundreds of thousands of players to encounter. you can make friends and form alliances together or make enemies and watch their ships explode as you destroy them in fierce battles, or watch your ship explode if your skills are to low ^.^... The world of eve is treacherous but yet very friendly, you can take up roles of whatever you want and you are not bound to them at all if you want to hide in low sec and kill capsules as they are passing through your system you can, or if your a brave bounty hunter you can hunt pirates or earn your isk by ratting in low or null sec, or even if you want a peaceful break from combat you can switch from your combat ships and pilot one of you mining rigs to harvest minerals to sell for isk or save for the blue prints you just found exploring the deep darks depth of space for; and use those minerals to build that advanced ship or fittings that would benefit you alot. Training is relatively easy depending on what you want to train in, you can always allocate your points to the primary attribute that skill requires to shorten the training time it takes for your character to learn that certain skill. You can also become a good enough player to use in-game money to buy plex that you can then use to extend your monthly subscription... my first month was the free 30 days from steam then i bought 1 month from the eve account management site which is cheaper... and my third month i was able to use in game money to pay for my subscription, and at this time i learned enough skills to do level 4 combat missions with diffrent corps and by myself to earn 50 - 200 million isk per run. The rewards of isk only become better as the risk becomes greater... you start in high sec where ccp forces are protecting you then there is low-sec, null sec, then deadspace , and wormhole space... i love wormhole space the graphics are beautiful ^.^, but my friend's pos (player owned starbases) that helped transport materials to build was attacked and destroyed o.o... but that is eve ^.^, and when you start you get an attribute boost that increases your attributes dramatically and allows you to learn skills faster for two weeks ^.^, lol i forgot about it until i was 2 weeks and a day into the game so i couldnt use it, and sold it for 300 million isk, which enabled me to buy my first battleship The Abaddon. Learning skills for ship piloting is also very easy you buy skill books with isk and it could take 5 to 7 days to learn skills from frigate to a battleship as a new pilot, but only a few hours if you keep playing for experienced players with im only 3 months experienced and i have 2 battleships and love helping new pilots ^.^... Also the economy is completly player contolled so you can be a trader and become the richest person in eve just by buying low and selling high... I think if you search this video on youtube (EVE Online Inferno | Official Trailer HD) you will fall in love instantly ^.^...  and i will also post a link on my profile page to give you a 21 day trial instead of 14 day trial... and you must buy through steam for starter pack and you will be able to take pictures to share, because the graphics are just stunning... so see you soon, and remember ""With risk comes Great Rewards in the world of Eve"". ^.^			",66,4,0,11,1,0,8

												IT CONSUMES YOU. It is not a game. It is another life. It is very difficult to sell this MMO-strategy game, not because it is difficult, but because it is so demanding.The possibility is endless, you can do what ever you want in the complex, in both economically and culturally world. It will demand every little time you have in your personal life, to research for your best growth strategy. It reminds me of Everquest, but more organic and rich in context, which means you have to co-operate with many others to survive, let along having fun. The political structure and gameplay is creepingly realistic that you don't feel like you're play a game. You are WORKING like its your career, DEALING WITH REAL BARGAINS like its your business, and FOLLOW&LEADING like in the army. Soon enough your will lose balance, you have to deal with two lives, so you developed your time management skills and such, learn to differ your personal life and EVE life and real work. It's just too much for me. I quit because I realise I can't enjoy other games, books, movies and real life relationships. I wish I can but I'm not that smart, not that strong like those I met in the game. They can keep up, leading and manage their kids and wives/husbands in the same time. Tempting, but I rather spend more time experience new stuff, so I respectfully send my regards and leave this world.Nevertheless, I recommend you give it a try. Feel the gravity.

												Eve Online is not a game for everyone. Its not for children.Its not for people who dont want to learn and research a game.Eve Online is special.With elements of space simulation you command a ship rather than ""flying"" it.It takes time and effort to learn everything, but its worth it.Eve Online has alot of freedom. The freedom to shoot and get shot, to scam and get scammed, to trade and to make a fortune, to explore and to find something amazing.Like no other game Eve Online thrives on player generated content.This can not be understated. The sandbox that is Eve is full of Blood and Glory, full of storys and grief. In the spirit of high risk high reward i can only advise you not to spend too much time in high security space. Null security space is where the fun is, find a big alliance on www.reddit.com/r/Eve/ or go to http://dredditisrecruiting.com/ and play this game the way its meant to be played.

												This is the most complex and most realistic MMO out there. It contains a huge galaxy with thousand of solar systems. This game is not just about killing, looting and leveling up. As a matter of fact characters don't even have levels. Instead you can train skills and specialise your character. For example I'm a miner, trader and I can haul a big amount of cargo with my skills.The whole universe runs on 1 huge server and it's the biggest MMO universe out there. The biggest problem with it is that it's hard to find your interest in the game, because it has no storyline, so the players make the story. They make friends, they make enemies, they make business. Almost everything in EVE online is built by players. If you want to build a starship and sell it, real players are going to mine the minerals for your starship and real players will buy the ship on the market.To see how complex the market is, check out this site: http://www.eve-markets.net/To see how big the universe is, check out this site: http://evemaps.dotlan.net/ ",251,81,15,18,19,3,54

												I have played even since it was in beta, well, I did stop beta as I hated the way you progressed in game. It was new, and Earth and Beyond just sent me an invite for phase 7 beta, which I played as NeX and founded Nexxen corp in EnB for 2 years until it shut down. Returned to eve after that and have been there since. It is not a game for everyone, but with the way CCP has been changing the tutorial system and providing ways for new players to start out, it is much better for new players. With changes coming in 2015 that will change how the universe evolves, it is the best time to get started with this beautiful game.CCP is one of the best development and publishing companies out there. They take part in the community, get suggestions and new ideas from players, they work with the playerbase and there is even an electorial Council of Stellar Management CSM that is the elected by players and the voice to CCP for the players. You won't find that anywhere else!I highly recommend this game, there is nothing like it.			",169,20,1,21,23,2,19

												(Deep breath)Do you know that feeling, when something gets under your skin so badly, that you can't help but want it more, and more?  For me, EVE Online evokes that feeling, which either raises really weird questions about me, or points out the nature of this game.The devs have done a wonderful job in smoothing out the early learning curve, which was a main frustration point for new players. Sure, it's still steep, but now if you can learn to read, the game actually teaches you the basics. Emphasis on ""the basis"". The game is still far, far away from holding your hand, which I do adore.However, the game is still extremely harsh when it comes to penalties. Most of the major penalties can be avoided to some extent; insurance will pay for your ship if you're blown to smithereens (you still lose your junk on the ship, though), having an up-to-date clone will prevent skill loss (you still lose your implants). Death IS essentially just a slap on the wrist... If you make sure that your backup assets are sufficient, and active. Otherwise... Well, I hope you enjoy sitting in your rookie ship again.The skill system is still as in-depth as it always was; the metagame is still as enticing as it always was. You are, as always, free to pursue whatever path you desire. There's no such thing as an unviable playstyle.... Just remember that at the core, this game is still about people.And people never change. They'll always be @ssholes.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												EVE online is the ultimate space MMO.  With a player controlled market, decent space combat, interesting lore and real time player progression it stands in a league of it's own.  This MMO is not for the faint hearted as it has a steep leaning curve and death within the game is soul destroying as you will have to create your spacecraft again from scratch.Eve is meant to be played in a guild, playing alone become boring fast, teamspeak is essential.  8/10			",55,17,0,15,7,0,15

												If you have the fortitude to get through the first month of skill training and learning curve, this is one of the most beautiful space simulations on PC. Make friends quick though as there are no reset buttons in Eve. Once your ships go boom, they are gone along with the contents of your cargo.			",479,96,36,70,69,1,58

												I played Eve since december 2001 in beta and after release till august 2009.Although it is an incredible hard game to get into, this is one of the most awesome I ever played.Can recommend it to all that like an economy driven space mmo.For RPG gamers, this is not as suitable. There is virtually no storyline other then background lore that does not impact the game at all.Also, EvE is not a game for half an hour or even for a few hours. Anything substantial will take hours.Another thing, a friend quit cause he was convinced he could never catch up with a veteran player who spent years in EvE already, well, for any other MMO this is probably true, but not so in EvE.A veteran player with 8 years of playing, will be able to fly lets say 30 ships, some at expert level, others less so.Each skill in the game, has max 5 levels, take a ship for example an elite frigate, I myself can fly one of those with every skill, that affects this specific ship, at maximum.As a veteran, I can not improve on that ship, as all skills are maxed out.A new player can learn those skills in about 5 months (guessing now, cause things changed quite a bit since 2009, but it won't be much longer) and then the new player is as sufficient at that specific ship as a veteran player can be.So saying that you can't catch up with a veteran, is not valid.Eve beginners 101Your Race of choice does not limit your choice of ships/equipment.There are 4 races, Gallente, Caldari, Amarr and Minmatar.Any of those races can buy and learn ship skills of any of the other races and fly those ships as well.Race choice determines only your appearance options, starting ship, the set of skills you start with and the place you start at in the universe.PVP : (your first ship will never be lost, upon awakening after death, a new 'noob frig' will be waiting for you at your station where you awaken.)If your biggest ship is a frigate, use a smaller cheaper frig to pvp with.In case you own a cruiser, pvp in a frig.If you have a battleship, pvp in a cruiser.And so on.Keep the bigger ship to earn back a smaller in case things in pvp go not as planned, AND they will go not as planned !It is possible to acquire an insurance, however it does not pay out 100%, I do not remember the percentages, but it's in the range of 80 to 90%.EvE's universe is divided in security systems, most secure is called Empire, being 1.0, 0.9, 0.8, 0.7. 0.6, and 0.5These security ratings imply that these solar systems are guarded by police and navy. The player who starts shooting in those systems, gets taken out swift by the cops. You can not get away from that impending death due to an action of yours truly. (below in reply)Then there is 'Lowsec' 0.4, 0.3, 0.2 and 0.1, In those systems there is no police or navy, stations and gates do have turrets however that acts same as cops, but only to targets in range. Anywhere else (belts, mission area's) Free PVPLast but not least, 'Nullsec' 0.0 This makes up the biggest portion of the universe, home to big alliances with 1000's of members, if you want a piece of that space, bring bigger and more guns.- Are you bound to 1 ship ?No, you are not, I had as much as 120 ships in my private ship hangar.- Can I play for free ?Eventually, yes. With ingame currency you can buy gametime in the form of a 'PLEX' (Pilot License Extension), these are items that can be bought on the ingame market for the ingame currency (ISK), however it is not cheap. Do not expect to pay 1 month and then never again.- How does leveling up work exactly ?In Eve there are skills, some you have already at start, most of them have to be bought from the market, mostly from NPC corporations, you will see. Each skill has 5 levels, from lvl 0 to lvl 1 for a simple skill takes few minutes, to lvl 2 takes 30 minutes, lvl 3 upto 3 hours, lvl 4 perhaps 2 or 3 days and lvl 5 Weeks. All in real time. BUT, you do not have to be online to train skills, start a skill that takes 2 days, and come back in 2 days to see it done. Currently it is possible to queue skills after the one you are learning.So in fact you are leveling up while not playing.- But then whats the point of playing to better myself ?Well, the personal experience counts alot, you can train a skill called 'Tracking'. that doesn't mean that you personally in your biological head understands exactly how that works. You learn that by experience.Tracking :A big World War 2 Battleship with these huge guns, cannot hit a speedboat that is circling the battleship at close range, you will miss, cause the big guns can't turn as fast (Tracking).Same so in EvE. Things become different at large distances as you can imagine.- A player in a big ship will kill my small ship in 1 shot.Ehm, not true, see previous point, if you orbit at close range to a bit ship with big guns, it can't even hit you. (Unless with a splash bomb (AOE), but a ship needs to have fitted those bombs to do so).- But me in a small ship can't harm the big guy eitherTrue, however many small ships can harm 1 big guy.100 frigs vs 1 battleship with a 10 year veteran = a very dead veteran.___________________________Before Eve Online, I never played a fantasy mmo like WoW, however I had now 6 years in Aion and can see a few differences that may need explaining.Crafting in EvE goes in a similar way to skill training.Some stations have manufacturing slots.When you want to craft, you need a blueprint, this print specifies the amount of resources (minerals/half-fabrics).When you offer the print to a manufacturing slot, you have to specify the number of products you want to produce, and if you have sufficient amounts of resources, the slot will give you the duration of the process. ( this can be hours or MONTHS and all that in real time).If you want to build 5 Frigates, but you need 1 asap, start 2 manufacturing jobs sametime, 1 slot for 1 ship and a second slot for 4. Cause you cannot take 1 ship already out of the manufacturing when the rest isn't done yet.Same as with Skill training, you do not have to be online to craft, start the process and log out, your goods will be produced.With manufacturing skills you can decrease the amount of resources needed and/or decrease the amount of time it takes to manufacture.- Warehouses/Storage space.In Fantasy MMO's you stick your stuff in storage at place A, travel to a different zone B and open your storage : heeey all there.Not in EVE : Stick your stuff in storage at place A, travel to a different zone B and open your storage : EMPTY ! You stuck it in storage at A, remember ? It is still there, if you want it at B, go get it.I got surprised the other way around, in Aion I stuck my stuff in the warehouse at place A, and traveled to B to store the rest.. Full already.. what the heck ?In Eve stuff does not magically transport where-ever you go, unless you stick it in your cargohold.I like to help people out, half of what I knew is still in my head and anything added to the game since 2009 I have no knowledge about.But try your luck, I'll try to answer.

												This is the most complex and most realistic MMO out there. It contains a huge galaxy with thousand of solar systems. This game is not just about killing, looting and leveling up. As a matter of fact characters don't even have levels. Instead you can train skills and specialise your character. For example I'm a miner, trader and I can haul a big amount of cargo with my skills.The whole universe runs on 1 huge server and it's the biggest MMO universe out there. The biggest problem with it is that it's hard to find your interest in the game, because it has no storyline, so the players make the story. They make friends, they make enemies, they make business. Almost everything in EVE online is built by players. If you want to build a starship and sell it, real players are going to mine the minerals for your starship and real players will buy the ship on the market.To see how complex the market is, check out this site: http://www.eve-markets.net/To see how big the universe is, check out this site: http://evemaps.dotlan.net/ ",251,81,15,18,19,3,54

												I have played even since it was in beta, well, I did stop beta as I hated the way you progressed in game. It was new, and Earth and Beyond just sent me an invite for phase 7 beta, which I played as NeX and founded Nexxen corp in EnB for 2 years until it shut down. Returned to eve after that and have been there since. It is not a game for everyone, but with the way CCP has been changing the tutorial system and providing ways for new players to start out, it is much better for new players. With changes coming in 2015 that will change how the universe evolves, it is the best time to get started with this beautiful game.CCP is one of the best development and publishing companies out there. They take part in the community, get suggestions and new ideas from players, they work with the playerbase and there is even an electorial Council of Stellar Management CSM that is the elected by players and the voice to CCP for the players. You won't find that anywhere else!I highly recommend this game, there is nothing like it.			",169,20,1,21,23,2,19

												It's hard to describe EVE properly in a review as the game is completely different for everyone, you are given a framework (should you do the tutorial missions) of what you can do to give you an idea of roles that you can take on but you are not forced into anything, EVE is what you make of it.You can sit in hi-sec relativley safe and run missions, mine ore, play the market, craft things to sell, run cargo for players, defend people, explore and more. That's pretty much more than most games like this offer, and that is just hi-sec.Should you want to be a bit more daring, earn more money, blow up some people then enter low-sec and null-sec...This is for me where the fun is, you get all of the above and more, join a corporation, defend your systems, enter faction warfare, mine ore that sells for millions, scan down combat / data / relic sites to earn a fortune or hell monopolise the corner of a market. Like I said it's hard to describe because everyone has their own way of playing the game and enjoys different things.I've tried a lot of things in EVE, some that I thought would be boring as hell that turned out to actually be really fun - This sentence has never rung more true for the actual game, I thought it would be boring but god damn I love it and every person I have introduced to it has thought the same and stayed!Give EVE a shot, try and play with a friend or ask the amazing community in rookie help should you need any help, plenty of corps take in new players and are very helpful.Fly safe o7			",94,4,1,11,20,3,19

												Say goodbye to your lifeI'm only an alpha and despite what many say, its still quite an experience. You may play for ONE faction, controlling frigates, destroyers, cruisers, the venture mining frigate, industrial ships, and the navy versions of frigates and cruisers.A wide variety of skills are avaliable (although not as much as you'd want) for the core aspects of combat. Gunnery, navigation stuff like that.There are now many big-name corporations that have expanded to encourage and include alpha players into their ranks.One rising aspect for alphas however...PvE will be the core of your gameplay, unless you magically manage to scratch up over 5 million ISK/hr to fund your navy ships. And PvE, although effective, IS BORING AS BALLZone word of advice. Make single player PvE alot more immersive, interactive, story-line intensive and with a variety of objectives and way to complete them. The tutorial mission battle is a good example. Also - these missions would bring a hefty weight of ISK as well, seeing as they'll probably take longer than your standard milk-runJoin the world of EVE Online, alpha or omega it doesn't matter. Its still fun as hell either way.Just be prepared to lose your life to this game			",23,2,0,1,3,0,1

Posted: December 30, 2015
												Ok so i promised i would wrtite a review when i had a few more hours under my belt before writing this, so i understand enough to give a basic opinion without sounding like another fanboy.One of my only problems in terms of bugs was in the character creation screen. It requires you to complete all the steps, and i mean ALL THE STEPS, to finish. Thats only part of the problem. When i wanted to continue after creating my characters appearance, it told me i couldnt because i hadnt selected footwear. Lo and behold, THERE WAS NO FOOTWEAR SELECTION MENU. After spending about 10 minutes browsing everything it had to offer, i had to eventually restart the game and redo the process. It worked the second time through.Ok so i spawn in and i thought ""Wait how does this work, its all complicated and stuff and my tiny brain cant understand these complex controls that i dont know are complex or not until i finish the tutorials!"" (I said all of that out loud, alone, in my room guys. 100%.) However, the tutorial is very simple, step-by-step and thorough. Its not annoying either. Every time you complete a part of the tutorial (which doesnt take long), it asks you if you want to skip the rest. If you are new, i dont reccomend skipping.The community, from what i have seen, is very kind (or just stays out of other peoples way). Theres even an entire chat channel called ""rookie help"" where dedicated admins answer all your questions. I found it helpful on two seperate occasions. There is an entire market system which is how any money you make (at least in the beginning) comes from. From what i have heard and read in the negative reviews, there are griefers who like to trash newbies ships for scrap. However, there is a VERY effective police force (at least in the gallente systems) called the CONCORD, which will effectively destroy anyone showing player-on-player violence. And there are sentry guns. I made my home station  (the station i use for buying, selling, and storage and other services) the Federal Naval Acadamy in the Duripant system. There is a large asteroid field filled with Veldspar, which i can run out and mine for about 20,000 ISK (in game money used in EVE).However, i realize this is very opinionated, which brings me to my next point; DONT BUY THIS IF YOU ARENT WILLING TO SPEND AN HOUR OR TWO LEARNING, AND WAITING AROUND AND REPEATING CERTAIN PROCESSES TO REACH A MORE GLORIOUS ROLE. Eventually, i plan on fighting for the Gallente, but i need a bigger more powerful ship and crew for that, and those are expensive.TL:DR; This game is perfect if you are looking for an expansive, open-universe, independent and cooperative space exploration and combat-oriented game that is playable for hours on end if you get interested. Otherwise, its probably a waste of time. Then again. you can always refund.			",52,10,0,8,8,1,10

												A game that always keeps you on your toes and is fun too play. Stunning graphics and a world environment where you decide how you are going too play and what your goals will be. The game is completely controlled by players in every aspect, everyone is playing on one major server and yet there are times where you will find yourself all alone in the coldness of space.  Years playing and still enjoy this universe. Highly recommended.			",1432,576,99,205,249,22,353

												It's hard to explain what EvE Online is. It would probably be easier to explain what it isn't.It's not a game. Not in the normal sense of the word at least. There are no objectives that it points you towards, no obvious progression, no fail state or even a way to play it ""right"".It's just a sci-fi simulation of a galaxy. And it's just there.What makes it, and the reason why it's been going on for 13 years, are the players. Everything is run by players. Everything is made by players. From the smallest bullet to the biggest conflict in gaming history.And when every single interaction is human, there are no limits on what can happen. You've probably seen the articles around the web - huge wars involving thousands of players, heists and backstabs carefully prepared over the course of years, revenge stories and so much history that you could fill dozens of books. Nothing is scripted or meant to happen.EvE is not a game. It's an experience, an alternate universe that lives on its own; you're simply trying to make an impact on it and create your own goals.But if you want to try it, remember: at the heart of it, EvE is about social connections. Alone, you're nothing. You won't go too far if you try to be a lone wolf.Take your friends along with you, create a corporation or join one of the many already established ones - it doesn't matter which; but stay together, and be something.

												I only have 40 hours in this game at this point so I'm just giving my obersvations so far on the very limited amount I have seen.I never played Eve before this week, but I have heard tons about it over the past decade. I always assumed in order to play eve, you needed to take it on like a second job. I find this to be the complete opposite. I don't know if things have changed, but due to being time walled by skills you can play casually and grow with your character.First thing I thought when I started playing eve was, the bigger the ship, the better the ship. Well I quicky bought my way to a Battleship and realized how wrong I was when I couldn't hit anything small and was moving slower than a snail. It seems like every ship (or at least family of ships) in this game has a place and something it excels at. I started as an Alpha player, and quickly got my PLEX to be an Omega. I have only managed to get to the Trade capital so far, but I have been working with the Security agents and have been having fun doing the high sec content of the game. I am recommending this game on the Tutorial alone. I really wish there was more because it was really really good. Voice acting was awesome, and it gave me a basic sense on how to play the game, and what the Universe was about. I wish it continued on into a campaign or something.There is still so much I haven't experienced in this game, and I am looking forward to my first space tragety!			",904,241,25,142,131,13,177

I reccomend diving on into the community and making friends or friendenmys/ get someone angry and get in station with chats open. You will lost your day watching chats blink in station and occasional undocking, etc...idk its a good game. Just if you buy it through steam its a pain in the butt to transfer plex or resub..etc..

Posted: January 26, 2014
												In summary: The World of New Eden is beautiful, vast, & most of all, extremely dangerous.I'm going to start by saying that EVE is legendary for being unique. Not only due to its Learning Cliff, but also because of its Gameplay, Systems, & the fact that it's likely THE most authentic Sandbox MMO currently in existence (at least Sci-Fi Sandbox, if not overall). As such, with this game, you're going to either feel immediately at home, or you're not, in which case you're going to struggle for a while, only to end up quitting quite fast.As such, before you buy, I truly recommend you get yourself a 14-day Free Trial Account first, before you potentially waste money on EVE. It's simply not for everyone. Even if you adore Dark Souls & worship its PvP, EVE might still not be the game for you.One of the major hurdles you're going to face, apart from the Gameplay, Systems, the User Interface etc, is the Subscription - much like all Sub-based MMOs, you're going to need to constantly justifying spending the necessary quid each month to keep your Account active.Some people criticize the Sub Model, saying it's outdated, others feel the game is too old for this, but I prefer to see it like this: EVE provides all of its content, all of its updates free of charge, minus the necessary monthly Subscription Fee.Most Games launched at the same time EVE was look like they're stuck in the '90s. EVE doesn't. Not only does it look Visually stunning due to the continuous Graphical Overhauls (DX11 features are on the short list right now!), but it also keeps things fresh with constant Updates. CCP has actually just switched to a new 6-week Patching Cycle which will deliver more content, faster than ever before.Of course, like any game, EVE does have downsides:  The User Interface is like 2006 Burning Crusade (for those of you who played), & Development is slow, but it is steady at least. Much like any other Game, the Community varies beween total ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s to campers, stalkers, gankers, griefers, haters, trolls, to extremely friendly blokes that actually want to help, to people who run Corporations dedicated to training Newbies in the various Career Paths that New Eden has available to you.Speaking of; there's a multitude of Careers to choose from in EVE, you don't need to necessary do PvP (which can vary from Fleet-sized fights to small Gang-sized encounters to 1v1s), or PvE (which also varies from Exploration to Missioning to Incursions (Raids, specifically, Rifts), to Wormholes).  You can just sit in one of the 4 Major Trade Hubs (Jita being by far the most popular), & Trade items on the market all day long, making Millions. You can jump into Wormholes & live isolated from the rest of New Eden in your own secret corner of the Galaxy, fight for your Empire as a Loyalist in Factional Warfare (PvP), or become a Conqueror of Star Systems with an Alliance of like-minded psychopaths looking to seize the Player-Controlled Regions of New Eden (known as Null-Sec) for themselves (with a bit of backstabbing, lying, deceiving, stealing, bribing, & blackmailing involved along the way), etc.In EVE, Progression is different, unique even. In many MMOs, you train (read: grind) to the Level Cap, max out some 2-3 Professions & you're done. Then you just bang your head against the wall when it comes to the Content itself until it keels over & delivers ""epic lewtz."" In EVE, Training can last for months on end until you finally have the Skills you need to fully Pilot that epic Battleship you've been drooling over for months - especially the Pirate Faction Ships, which have higher requirements, tied to higher Damage Output, etc, so when you do finally undock that sweet Beast, you feel like you've accomplished something amazing, you've achieved something that so long ago seemed impossible, even.The revamped Tutorials help make the transition from your standard VG into EVE a lot smoother. Just a few years ago I made a Trial only to barely get past them. Now, I picked up EVE again over the Steam Winter Sale, & my experience was far smoother. I ended up clocking over 50 hours into it in just the first week alone.That's not to say the Legendary Learning Cliff is gone, no, it is still very much there, & the EVE Community works hard to ensure it remains there, even while helping newbies overcome it. Rather, the Path leading to the top of the Cliff has been worn smooth by a decade of Capsuleers that came before you, but the ""Jump Here"" sign remains, waiting for those who wish to escape the madness of New Eden.The Tutorials used to just drop you into the massive, gaping pit that is New Eden, now, the transaction is smoother. Needless to say, Combat is still unique, & takes getting used to. The game still stands out from anything else, BY FAR.Oh, & the EVE Starter Pack is extremely handy for newbies. In short - recommended, but only after you do the Trial & see if you're actually willing to spend money on EVE.Updated 6 months later, still playing, still loving it ;)			",292,27,13,17,16,1,20

												This is the ultimate space game and probably the most immersive MMO I have ever played. Some good things dont come free and this is one of the best example. It is literally a space theme game with a big buffet of things to do.Pros- This is the real sandbox experience with online players.- Lots of thing to do.- PVP gameplay is extensive and it is the main focus of the game.- Human controlled corporates (akin to clans or guilds) added vibrancy to the Eve online community, it enhances the sandbox experience in a subtle way.- Ingame graphics are top-notch, stunning weapon effects, the ship models are well-designed and great eye candies in the vast lonely space.  - Enough options for PVE at low level if new players dont like PVP.- Probably the best virtual market (ingame, not Eve store) I have come across so far, real players and NPC simulated supply and demand make the market feel realistic.- The game is continuously evolving and improving thanks to players' subscriptions. You could be sure it is a matured game with incremental improvements every now and then.Cons- Steep learning curve, lots to read up but you should have no problem if you like space games- No grinding but 'gaining experience' can be time consuming when no means to accelerate the process without spending tons of ISK or real money-  Unforgiving to newbies who venture in low or null sec, you will lose alot of ISK making newbie mistakes- Limited means of control for your starships in space, do not expect to pilot your ship with a joystick like a space sim.- Pace of game progression is slow and will get boring if you only focus on one aspect of the game. Diversify your things to do in Eve, plan out your learning programme to experience the majority of what the game has to offer.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Oh well, this ""game"" is more like a second job if you take it seriously.  Really, it can be so competitive that it's not even fun.  But at the same time the mechanics are attractively deep yet logical.  The game is not for everyone - concetration and good communication skills seem to provide huge benefit.   Given time you can amass great power and influence.  On the other hand there are multiple activities that are fun by their own almost from the start, though most of them become boring through repetition.  Of course, the later isn't about blowing stuff - that's always fun.  The other side is that you can also be killed almost anytime and anywhere.  Speaking personally, not following a wise advice of ""Don't fly what you can't afford to lose"" made me stop playing twice already.  All in all Eve Online is best suited for focused people whose idea of leisure time is a switch of activity but at the same time it can easily break player's spirit when everything that he've spent countless hours on gets destroyed in mere minutes, sometimes even without any chance to predict or prevent that.  So, the immersion is very real life-like.			",346,104,5,59,48,5,94

												TL:DR - If you need instant continuous action, 0-attachment and want to invest 0-effort than this is the worst game you can choose.  Everything in EvE takes an incredible amount of time, either you put in the time and effort and become attached or like most people you just walk away because as a GAME EvE is not fun.  EvE simply becomes exciting when you start having things to lose.Long version:EvE Online is more of a Fishing+Poker+Spreadsheet hybrid than a game of spaceships.  You usually have to endure hours of mind-numbing boredom to be rewarded with brief excitement.  The boredom can come from grinding away to have a little bit of income or from enduring 30+ 1-minute long warps across nearly identical - boring - solar systems.  At some point you'll finally have some things in the game that you feel attached to and then it becomes PvP......it's still like fishing but now it has poker elements.....you have something to lose and something to gain and other players are trying to outsmart you.....well, outsmart you or they've been playing for 10 years and a loss is so insignificant to these players that it's essentially win-win for them because they stand to lose .00001% of their wealth to you and that's worth any excitement/potential tears they can get (They'll always have a better hand and more of them and all the chips, good luck!).Anyway, spreadsheets!  EVERYTHING you do in this game is a spreadsheet with a space backdrop, most folks don't even recognize that there is a view of space.  Want to be a trader?  You dock in a station, open 2 or 3 spreadsheet views and spend all day staring at them, right clicking your orders and increasing them by .01 isk and then having 4 other people immediately up you by .01isk.  Want to run missions?  The spreadsheet is now a list of objects within about 400km of you, CTRL+Click the red things and click your gun icons then let math decide how much damage you do based on range+tracking speed+ a bunch of other things that you can enable as columns on your spreadsheet.  PvP combat?  Yup, just like mission spreadsheets but now you open an additional spreadsheet called the d-scan that shows you items >400km away so you can see what's coming to blow you up!That's pretty much EvE summed up.  Yeah, you can make some friends and run a corp......or through 5+ years of effort you could be part of leadership of a sizeable alliance but that's just more spreadsheets with the addition of PR work.  They could call it real life simulator spaceship edition.			",141,12,10,21,30,0,36

												If you consider yourself a space lover/addict, EvE is something you must try at least once. It has a very steep learning curve but the prolonged tutorials (hit F12 and talk to career agents) will tell you everything you need to know and they will take you through every aspect of the game.I can't stress enough but there is no game out there that comes even close to the feeling of grandiose and the constant peril around you like EvE. It's horrifying and abso*uckinglutely fantastic at the same time.Don't be discouraged by people calling the game a ""spreadsheet"" game - It's not, unless you go full into trading. Don't be afraid of crybabies that whine about getting ganked... PvP is a core part of this game and it will happen sooner or later. HOWEVER - the community is just amazing and chances are huge that the same player that killed you will whisper you back and talk to you about what you did wrong and even help you pay your ship and the fit that was in it.If you want to avoid PvP as much as possible - you can always stick with a NPC corporation and be a carebear in high-sec.The training system is very different than your usual MMO stuff (no standard ""levels"" or ""classes"") and it does favor the players that have been playing the game for a long time - BUT you can be very competent if you specialize early on. It all depends on your skill - both ingame, and RL.Yes, it has a monthly sub but all updates are free, including the expansions that come out all the time.			",108,56,4,28,8,1,7

Posted: November 15, 2016
												So, I used to have a legit review here, but I'm going to do something different.I'm going to tell a story.The story begins with me, a free to play Alpha clone, bringing a 2.8mil Merlin Frigate (The smallest ships in the game) out into Faction Warfare space for some PvP action.  Now, Faction Warfare has become something of a ♥♥♥♥♥how as of late.  All the Alpha clones have invaded it as a way to grind free ISK.  This results in many ships just leaving the complexes of FW instead of fighting.  Now, before I go on I want to talk about the ship I'm flying.  It's a decent solo PvP fit that's pretty cheap.  I know 2.8mil sounds like a lot, but in reality that's nothing.  It's about the cheapest you can fly around and PvP in.  In terms of real money (Using the ability to buy in game time as the converter) it costs about $0.05 maybe less.  This is very important as in EVE Online, when a ship dies it's gone for good.  Maybe a moduel are two will drop for loot, but the ship has gone bye bye and the likely hood of you getting your loot back in PvP is just... Don't even try you won't get it back.  Back to the story.  I fly around for about 10m looking for a fight and find a Kestrel in a small.  I'm pretty happy with fighting a Kestrel, so I warp in just as the Kestrel warps off.  AGAIN a frig has ♥♥♥♥♥ed out on me.  In my time roaming this space (granted I only started coming out there a week or two ago and Real Life has prevented me from playing as much as I would have liked) I've only had 2 1v1 fights.  Everyone else has warpped off or brought in 3-6 guys to murder me savagely with no chance of winning.  A quick look in the direction of the frig's warp I see there is a stargate (A portal to another system).  As I am going to be exploring the surrounding systems looking for fights anyway, I warp to it.  Just as I land the Kestrel jumps through.  I jump after him and get to see him warp away, not to a complex, but a station to avoid fighting me.  I half taunt him in local ""Warping out like a ♥♥♥♥♥, 3/10."" and continue on my way.A few minutes pass and he invites me to a private conversation.  Turns out he didn't even have guns fitted and just wanted to grind for more ISK.  He's appologetic and tells me that the opposing faction does this to his faction all the time.  I appologize for being rude and tell him of my bad luck roaming in this section in space looking for fights.  The guy is pretty nice and I stay in the private conversation with him for a few more jumps.  And then I spot a Tengu.  A Tengu is a Tech 3 cruiser (Lets just say it's tanky as all hell, expensive, and has some nice damage) and is not a good match up for my small Merlin.  The Tengu is flashy (Anyone can attack him) and jumps the gate he's landed on.  As the gate is on my way, I go through it thinking ""Hey, if I warp away fast enough he won't be able to catch me.""  As I jump through, I see the Tengu has launched Probes.  The Tengu was named ""10/10 DED"" or something along those lines.  From this information I think ""This is a PvE Tengu.""  What's the difference between PvE and PvP Tengus?  PvE ships are often fitted with very expensive moduels and designed only to run PvE in order to more efficiently run Combat Sites and make ISK.  The Probes dissapear into space and the Tengu cloaks up.  This is another good sign for me, as if he is fitted with a cloak it is unlikely he will deal as much damage or tank as much damage as a non cloaky Tengu.  I decide to go for it and try to decloak the Tengu.  Just to give you an idea about what I'm about to do, I am 30KM off this Tengu (Who is now invisible) and I have to get within 2KM to decloak him.  I saw in general where he was headed, turn on my after burner, and wait...I honestly didn't expect to decloak him, but I did.  The Tengu is now 2KM off of me and I quickly lock him and tackle him so he can't warp off.  Now, looking back on it, I should have checked the type of Probes he launched.  They were Combat Probes, for finding ships, not Combat Sites.  He immediately Tackles me back, but doesn't deal any damage to me... Strange... The Tengu is definently fit for PvP, but he isn't dealing damage...I can't believe I decloaked this guy, let alone tackled him.  I tell the FW guy I met earlier that I tackled a Tengu and give him my location.  About a minute goes by and then the Tengu does something that changes the situation completely.  He lights a Cyno.A Cyno is like a beakon that other ships can ""bridge"" multiple ships to or jump to themselves.  This guy is either bluffing and hoping I warp off, or he has friends.  Next thing I know, there is a Redeemer Black Ops Battleship (A cloaky Battleship) right next to me.  Now, the Tengu costs around 500million.... A fully fit Black Ops Battleship?  That's at least 1.6 Billion.I honestly can't believe this guy brought in a BLACK OPS BATTLESHIP to kill me.  I'm sure he must have throught I had friends, but I'm about as solo as you can get.  I'm in my own corp, ""We Probe Your Holes"" (Yes it's a joke name, Yes it's immature, No I'm not changing it I find it hillarious as I used to poke about in Worm Hole Space), with literally no other people.  But I have one person near me to talk to and he lives in this region.  Remeber that Faction Warfare guy who warped off on me?  ""He dropped a Cyno""""HOLY♥♥♥♥♥♥HE JUST DROPPED A REDEEMER ON ME XD"" I honestly can't believe it.  This Tengu was hunting for targets in Faction Warfare space and was bringing in a Black Ops Battleship to kill anything he found.  AND HE JUST DROPPED IT ON ME.  A SHIP THAT IS WORTH CLOSE TO NOTHING.I'm laughing my♥♥♥♥♥off in my chair now.  I'm fine with dying here to these guys, it's not like my ship is worth much.  I can lose 100 of them without too much financial pain.  I establish a close orbit on the Redeemer, as I think he's the bigger threat (The Tengu STILL hasn't damaged me).  The Redeemer launches Drones, Ogre IIs to be exact, to try to kill me.  While they miss me completely with my Propulsion Moduel Activated (An Afterburner), the Redeemer shuts that off with an Energy Neutralizer (Resulting in my Afterburner turning off as it does not have enough energy to run).  A few lucky shots by the Orge IIs and I'm dead.  My ship blows up and I go back to my home station.I'm still laughing about it when the guy I met earlier messages me.""I just got a Ping that a Redeemer was tackled on a gate""At this point I'm going ""THERE IS ABSOLUTELY NO WAY THOSE TWO ARE GOING TO GET BLOWN UP ALL BECAUSE OF MY 2.8MIL MERLIN.""  I'm laughing my♥♥♥♥♥off just thinking about it.  And just in case you are starting to feel sorry for these guys....The targets they are hunting are most likely PvE ships (Of the very very expensive kind).  The Tengu will probe them down, tackle them, and bring in the Black Ops Battleship for a very one sided fight.  Additionally, there is absolutely no reason for him to drop a battleship on a Merlin.  The Tengu could have easily reapproached gate as his tank was not being pressured at all by my measly 100DPS.  EVE is about Risk, and these guys could easily make millions or even billions killing expensive PvE ships and looting their wrecks.  This is the price they pay for engaging in such a dangerous way of making money.  It's a Dog eat Dog world in EVE.With my 2.8mil ship, I caused not only a Redeemer to die, but also the Tengu.  https://zkillboard.com/kill/59233305/https://zkillboard.com/kill/59233251/It sucks for that guy, but don't fly it if you can't afford to lose it.  This is EVE.  A sandbox where anything can happen.  Just like the Butterfly Effect Trailer, a simple chain of events lead to this... This bit of organic PvP that I started by decloaking a Tengu.  I brought down ~2.2 bil in 2.8mil.  It wouldn't have happened without the local FW guys coming in and finishing off the two of them (To which I am forever greatful), but it still started with me... and my 2.8mil Merlin.

												The game starts out fun, sure, but it drags on. There's lots of grinding, and once when you get out into Nullsec or join a corp, the game becomes more like work and far less fun.  The game is also setup to reward those players that have been around the longest. What ships you can fly and weapons/tools you can use is based on your skill level-- which slowly creeps up at a steady pace if you're in game or not. If you're new to the game, you'll stand no chance against someone who has been logged out for 5 years and only pops in once in awhile to train skills.If you want a space game without the MMO BS, look to X3, or even the Eleite based games like OOlite. You'll have more fun, and more time.			",60,26,0,22,21,0,21

												Its been the best part of 2 years since I loaded this game up.. I thought 'what the hell' its been 10 years since I played it seriously. I did the 14day trial, and it took about an hour for me to rekindle the love affair. Everything is so much easier than before. I remember it took me a solid month of play to become an ISK millionare in 2003. It took me the best part of 2 hours of working through the tutorials and I've already made 2million ISK. Its not so much 'dumbed down' as streamlined. Graphically it STILL looks stunning, now making full use of modern GFX cards. But the core dynamic is the same.. its a huge and beautiful sandbox.Whilst my old account has a few years worth of training, I've decided to start completley afresh.. no baggage and no billion ISK to help.. and I'm so pleased I did. I have forgotten more about how to play this game than any other.. the systems are complex but rewarding because they are complex.I went the whole hog and grabbed a discounted yearly subscription, and I'm really looking forward to spending as much time playing as I can.Until Star Citizen or Elite Dangerous comes along, EvE is still the King of the Elite crowd which has consumed more of my gaming hours over the last 30 years than all the others combined.Definatley worth a look, definately worth the small subscription fee (£90 for a whole year - thats only £7.50 a month) - I spent £75 on a tank of Fuel this morning.. this is cheap entertainment!!

												READ THIS FIRST: THIS IS NOT A BAD GAME, BUT THERE ARE PROBLEMS WITH THE COMMUNITY.Based on almost a thousand hours of gameplay and study, I can say that Eve Online is a game with an acquired taste. That taste can range from an upper class citizen to the lowly dregs of society, but what do they have in common?An untreated diagnosis of Moderate to Severe Psychosis and Sociopathic tendencies.Now this isn't to say that ALL Eve players are like this, but most are. In this virtual realm they are known as "" Carebears"", according to the Pirate Hierarchy. Online interactions are of course not rated by the ESRB, and trash talking is common in various MMO's, but the level of detail to a response AGAINST PvP in a PvP-centric game is shocking. Death Threats, Deviancy, Inclining Child Abuse, Inclining Physical abuse and threats of ""hacking""(ISP detection, Keylogging, Apache log manipulation and Proxies) Racism, Botting, hate groups; CCP allows this as long it remains WITHIN THE PARAMETERS of the server client, and action is only taken when external applications and domains are used in violation of the EULA. They are Lax and exhibit Sloth behaviour, not a company I would want to subscribe to.It is a game that might of had once noble intentions, is now a den of debauchery, void of good Etiquette, and a haven for the Mentally Insane allowed online.Now one may retort, ""But if you're spouting such inane frivoulties about these psychopaths and played for such a long time, aren't you one yourself then?"", to which I reply by saying:Emulation does not equal indoctrination. I can observe and blend in to delve into the psyche of these supposed ""Carebears"" when in fact it is the ""Evil"" pirates that are the Gentlemen and Women of New Eden. This isn't propaganda to say that you should be a pirate, if anything it's a red flag that this Sandbox game is More Linear than Theme Park MMO's such as WoW or SWTOR.The pirate Hierarchy run this game, if you want to be a pirate, more power to you, you'll find some decent folk within their ranks.If you want to do anything else (apart from marketing and trading, which can be done solo) you will reach a dead end by AFK mining, Grinding missions over and over again, redundant Planetary Interaction, Faction Warfare Plexing etc.There is only one proper way to play EvE in its Canonical format: PvPIf you are looking for a narrative story, PvE, a safety net, and a nice Passive Atmosphere, I suggest you find another Space Simulator.2/10 for Community /  6/10 for Gameplay			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												WARNING!WARNING! There is basis for suspicion that EVE utilizes employee/players that dreamweave the customers I know because one of them was not a good enough liar during one of my conversations with a so called rookie player. I had a feeling alot of gaming companies were using shill/plants to keep milking a customers wallet I do not recomend this game just for the simple fact that you can play a miner but you will have to farm 200$ from your wallet and 12 months of your life probably just to  start enjoying the money you spent 12months earlier. And that goes for pretty much all other classes besides the pvp pirate combat aspect.Warning! Would suggest not buying unless you are three of the following-You are rich or others pay for your subscription-Your are very young or immortal,have alot of time on your hands,then maybe you have chance of making enough isk to start exploring the game-You are a social maniac that the only thing that matters to you is friendship, your only purpose in life is to have a friend. Or if you spend your entire days on social networks this is a game for you.			",21,1,0,6,1,0,6

												Its hard to review a game which has no peers. This game started as a project to create a universe. not some simple game universe where you are a mere tourist like in normal games, but a true universe where you have an actual impact. You don't just play eve, you live it. The entire game is built around giving the players control and as time goes players get more and more controll over the universe.I could go and talk about how unforgiving the game can be to those who are careless or get to greedy (most oftenly a combination of the 2), but you shouldn't form a oppinion based on the reviews. You should experience it yourself firsthand trough the FREE TRIAL they always offer. I admit 2 weeks (or 3 if you ask a friend for a trial) isn't much to explore everything eve has to offer, but it should give you a better idea then any Review can give and help decide wether to give the game a chance or wether it isn't your thing afterall.

												Unfortunately this game is its own worse enemy.  In order to make decent money or to accomplish anything besides the most basic gameplay you have to go into ""low security"" areas.  However, as soon as you go into these areas you will be oneshot by other players.It seems that many people have been playing this game for so long that they have nothing else to do but PvP.  They aren't trying to be malicious or anything...its just the only thing in the game that brings them enjoyment.The penalties for losing a ship aren't huge...you have to buy a new one, all the gear for it, and you lost what you had on you.  But after it happens time and time again, it goes old.  I don't have a ton of time to constantly be buying ships and restocking them...I just want to play.  And unfortunately, since PvP is unavoidable, I can't really do that in EVE. ",539,307,5,130,84,4,103

												EVE Online offers tons of value for your money. EVE operates just as real life would, you don't level up and most of your life progression comes from spending time and money; time to increase skills in certain areas; money to buy you that shiney new toy that gets the job done. It offers multiple career paths but not too much that you find yourself overwhelmed with decisions. I would say it has just the right balance. When you first start off I will admit, the game can be daunting. You are essentially thrown into the game world. You are given a helpful yet breif introduction to ship control, combat, the in game market, mining, and exploration. After that though you are essentially on your own. EVE has a great user community as a whole who are willing to teach and set you on the right path, but beware there are some who would seek to take advantage. EVE does have a bit of a learning curve but if you start of slow dont rush into anything and find people who are willing to take you under their wings youll do just fine and youll enjoy the game.

												For some i'm sure this is the perfect game. If you love space and want a deep universe to explore with player base making the decisions of said universe than this is for you. This game is so deep and theres just so much to it. The little I played (500 hours) ""Yes 500 hours is relatively nothing in this universe"". It was beautiful just far to much for me to get into. If you have the time and are looking for a hardcore space MMO than this is for you. Dont get me wrong this is a great game if you have the time to invest in it.			",369,86,5,35,15,1,47

												Dont let the Game time fool you. i have 3 accounts. This game is heroin multiplyed by crack and tailor designed for the gamer demorgraphic. You will forget what the word sleep means. You will hate social interactions that involve something caleld reality. You will most certainly go on a real life rampage the first time you get podded.""Don't fly what you cant afford to lose""Its a harsh unforgiving universe and eve reflects that in its own way. Crime is legal, conning and scamming players is legal ( as long as it doesnt involve RL money or assets). Think of as many ways as you possibly can to make isk (money) and then you can probably do it.9.5/10loses half a point for developers anarchistic approach to its playerbase.			",104,4,3,22,32,0,36

												I really wanted to like this game. I tried it out for some time, first I found out you can't control your own ship you just click on destinations or targets .Then It's full of moronic griefers fully backed by the game mechanics : Basically in a game where you can do so much stuff, I wanted to mine, haul cargo and stuff, but the majority of players in there live a desperado kind of life ganging up on defenseless targets (that didn't happen to me though, because I was very prudent and stayed in safe zones) while risking very little.An allegory of this game would be a village with 99 bandits, 1 farmer being ganked all the time and no cops anywhere. The moral aspect of this game sent me away. I'm just not a bandit and have no fun being one. So if you like screwing people over, I say go for it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												So you start off in a station after making your character. You have this blue woman talking to you in an early 2000s-era style prompt window. She tells you a bunch of stuff you don't understand. Welcome to EVE Online.Find players to play with, avoid mining as your primary goal for your first month, and don't look at a big shiney capital ship and say ""LOL BIGGER IS BETTER I WANT."" Because it isn't, and you'll be disappointed. A frigate (smallest ship you can fly on day one) can kill a battleship (easily 4+ months of in-game training time). Skill overrules all in EVE, so find players to help you get there. Because the game sure won't. Enjoy your space sandbox and lack of themeparks direction o/			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												After playing this game for over 2 years I reccomend staying away.. I really wanted to like this game. The PvE is crap and only PvP that is decent is priating(whitch is one of the few things I never did). The ONLY way to make money in this game is by screwing other people over by scamming or pirating. I think its silly that the people actually taking risk are the ones who make NO money. The in game risk is NOT worth the reward. The the game gets so buggy at times too. Forget it dont waste your time and money. This game is dominated by an elitist attitude.			",54,6,3,10,39,0,11

												Unfortunately it would seem that the launcher that comes with steam is quite broken.  Most people, including me, need to navigate to their steam directory and run repair.exe after a fresh download just to get this game to run.  Further, it seems this launcher doesn't play well with firewalls so I need to disable mine to get the game to launch otherwise it will just fail part way though starting (with no splash screen) and leave behind a zombie rundll32.exe process.  As such I do not recommend purchasing a subscription through steam as you can avoid all these troubles by going direct to CCP (the publisher) and actually paying less to get started with an account.

												I have been intrigued by this game since release but I didn't pick it up because I don't like the pay and wait to level up mechanic that they have where you have to buy a subscription which basically gives you a month of leveling up skills.Now that it has a free mode I figured it's worth a shot so I tried it and followed my friends advice of doing the tutorial.I didn't even complete the tutorial when I found myself unable to train in a level 1 skill in one of the cheapest and most basic weapons in the game due to being in free mode. I was planning to subscribe in a week or two if the game was fun but it's clear they are just using free mode to trick new players into trying it.Don't waste your time it's a trap.

As a beginner I can't pay to play the game with in game money (it's a lot of the in game currency). I'm also only 14 so I have no reliable source of income (I do odd jobs when I can) and can't afford to spend the 10 a month to play it (and I think you have to pay the 120 at once...).

Posted: November 16, 2016
												The game is really amazing. Couldn't afford it when it was sub-based, but thanks to that brilliant move on the part of CCP now I can. I think EVE would be probably my first MMO that I'll pay in for anything at all, that's how I'm in love with this game. Started yesterday, barely scratched the surface, but love it already. The community is great and unlike other F2P MMOs that are overrun by gold sellers in minutes after they're live, goldselling isn't a problem in EVE, hadn't see any gold (well, ISK, but you know what I mean) selling spam up to and counting from now, CCP really does good job at keeping those immersion ruining a-holes at bay. Not sure if bots are a problem though, since due to game specifics (lots of people just afk while mining, including me) bot would be hard to pick from a legit player who just doesn't like to talk, unlike in other MMOs where it's usually obvious when someone is botting.﻿As for F2P model used, it is actually LESS restrictive than other F2P MMOs, including Wurm, Istaria, and pretty much any F2P MMO that is now popular. Why I'm saying this? Well, while there are limitations to Alpha clones (free accounts), there are, the fact that you can buy premium status (Omega Clone) just for in-game currency (i.e. if you put enough work or find some rich sponsor, for free) fixes that problem. Obviously it takes time to get enough ISK to buy PLEX (item that when used gives you 30 day of premium/omega status) unless you're a beggar or get lucky with drop, but in other MMOs that have some kind of ""premium"" status, you can't even do that.I really recommend anyone trying it out, if it's not your cup of your favorite beverage, that's okay. But since it costs literally nothing to try, why the hell not?			",118,24,8,24,22,1,10

												I honestly do not recommend this game. Before you dislike this review, please read it.It is a awesome game, and very well made. The overwelming content it amazing, and, if things had turned out different for me, I would still be playing it. From the moment I played it, to the moment I finally stopped, I have lost 27 ships, was beset upon by numerous gangs and ""pirate"" groups who wanted nothing more then to blow my ship up and leave my frozen carcass to float in the infinity of space, and I got stuck in several wormholes. FUN! One guy blew me up when I was trying to recover from getting killed once already, simply because he thought I had valuable resources onboard. Another guy put a bounty on me for cleaning up after him. Which, surprisingly, is a well-paying job, as long as you don't mind having a target painted on you for 30 minutes.The reason why I'm disliking this isn't the game itself, far from it. The main reason is the people. I could have gladly jumped into the void if it meant being able to play with my equal. but they had other plans.			",173,14,6,10,9,3,9

												Spreadsheet simulator? Nope. WoW not engaging enough? Maybe a bit too simple? Eve is for the people, by the people. Literally. There is definetly a learning curve to overcome, but after that its quite entertaining. Beautiful space vistas without the taxing requirements of todays generation of games. Thousands of people to interact with: Big-Wig corporations, mercenaries, pirates, smugglers, cargo couriers, miners, navigators, salvagers, bounty hunters, scammers, vigilantes, brokers, market manipulators, etc; all of who carry whatever title they want to fit their playstyle. Eve is a true sandbox space experience. Just, whatever you do, don't use smartbombs in HiSec.			",106,4,1,18,4,0,28

												Guys and gals,never use EVE Online through Steam. Use stand-alone client instead.I wasted three evenings and like 10GB of traffic to make it work (and I have no idea what caused it to work finally).Thanks for totes crap update download speed, by the way. Guys and gals, don't use Launcher to update - use Repair.exe instead.I understand that I failed royally when purchased subscription without having game client ready.Though it won't cancel some devs' laziness.Why ever bothering yourself with placing MMO in Steam if you don't benefit from its infinite easy-to-update possibilities? Moneybag playerbase gathering?The game itself is OK - Steam-EVE implementation is horrid, that's why that much negative feedback.The game...Endless crafting possibilities, possibility to level character up while offline and infinite possibilities for diplomacy, thievery, trolling and otherwise spending time with joy.Too lazy? Farm resources from planets while offline!Fond of playing safe and/or wanna have lot of time to chat with somebody? Mine the ore/gas/ice!Wand some risk? Explore space anomalies and wormholes!Want MORE risk? Hunt pirates in low security status systems!Want some real action? Join alliance that is at war with another alliance!Want to have some fun? Become an outlaw and steal some booty from anyone from abovementioned examples!You can even become a kind of headhunter and become rich by collecting bounty placed on other players by another players.Or do something really nasty, get bounty placed on you and mock headhunters willing to get you.With new update you can even steal some rare resources from moon bases.The only real downside is overall tempo is relatively slow... unless you bumped into raving pirates B)Though you can stay in safe areas... however, it won't protect you completely.

												I have to admit, I was a little intimidated by how much there is in this game but when it comes to a space shooter I can understand.  I have played at least a couple hours of it.  The tutorial is annoying, because sometimes it will lead you to what you have to do but sometimes confuse you with misunderstandings.  When you first start, I would recommend getting a friend to teach you how to do it and you'll get the hang of it soon.  The graphics are amazing.  And the gameplay can either work as you play missions or pull up marketing charts to gain EVE money.  >♥♥♥♥♥es get wet for Titan Ships			",65,8,0,14,20,0,21

												I recommend this because it is an experience like no other. I played this two years ago and play before steam integration occured. I can say with out a doubt Eve Online is an MMO masterpiece. The game recently went free to play, it's free to play model is ment for you to wet your feet, it is not for infinite play time. Eve has it's own living breathing world with it's own politics, economics, and buisnesses. Almost everything that happens in game is caused by players, but over all the one thing Eve has is it's freedom. You can do or be what you want. I personally enjoy the miner's life, but for you adventurers it could be a soldier's life for your empire, the merc life, a pirate's life, or if you are more domestic, the ambassador or buisness life. This game has so much potential and to call it pay to win is sad. The amount of time that has to be dedicated to succeed in the game in amazing. I recommend you try it, and if you think you like it, try it out for a month and see.			",174,26,1,35,44,2,43

												(Don't mind the game hours on steam, I play it without steam.)EVE Online, so much to say about it, so much to do once you pass the steep learning curve. A sandbox space mmo, 13 years in the making, still evolving and very time demanding. But so rewarding in the end.You will be amazed, you will fear, cry, be proud, be merciful and merciless, be an opportunist, be a savior, a destroyer, you will be something and feel so many emotions that games don't usualy put you through.The hardest thing is maybe choosing a path, crafting your style. Create or join fleets and corporation, be a rivals, allies, just be and do what you please: raid and destroy/pillage others or follow the rules of your empire and corporations. Explore, Trade, Fight anyone (factions, corporations, random players) and for anyone, Haul, Build, Mine or even spin your ship if you want to ! Do as you want and specialise in what you want, do something and excel in it, or do multiple things and be average in them, you will have to choose or you will have to invest time. Time is the only way you gain experience and get skilled. You will play for years and still learn, you may think you know it all but you'll still be amazed at how much you still don't.Talk, study, discover and learn the game, explore the game at your own pace.Bigger is NOT Better in EVE Online, every ship and class has it's role and it's variations, any ship is useful in a way, the combat system is full of details, of counters, learning how to fight will take some time but when you grasp it it's probably the best tense pvp you will ever have, it's brutal, it's cunning, it's rewarding and punishing. Don't fly what you cannot afford to lose, keep that in mind.I could talk about EVE for hours and hours without telling you everything there is to it. EVE Online is a game you always go back to in the end. Play it for a few months, a year, then stop and come back later.You'll learn some more and follow new paths you didn't even suspected the last time you played.And now EVE is free, limited but subscription-free if you want to have a look, just get in, love it or hate it, EVE is not for everyone, but if you like sci-fi, complexity and always discovering something new and learning, then it may be the game you always looked for.Try it out, what have you got to lose ? It's an unique and interesting experience. Like it or hate it, EVE Online is an experience no other game can offer.			",178,32,0,22,18,2,37

												While most certainly not a game for everyone, EVE Online offers something to such a great degree that pretty much no other MMO offers: Freedom. The freedom to walk the path of honesty or the path of deception. The freedom to make for yourself, buy for yourself, or steal from others. A game where you can be a pirate one second and a manufacturer the next. A game where, given the time and energy, can not only be played for free, but can allow you pilot machines that are larger than imagination. You can be a part of something much greater than yourself. You can take on the entire galaxy if you should so desire. Just be aware that there are consequences to your actions and that an ounce of caution is sometimes worth more than a ton of skill. A massive time sink and potential money sink but once you get going, it's hard to stop. Skills train in real time so you may not reach your goal as quickly as you would like but as long as you keep going, you will reach it. Just remember before starting, it's a ruthless universe out there and you basically just have to deal with it. 8/10			",168,12,0,17,12,0,19

												I had my doubts about this game but after playing for a little while and getting to know how to play, I just loved it. The gameplay I find quite interesting, its almost like muptiple types of games put into one. I mean theres quite a few things about this game that in my opinion people normally would not expect to find in an MMO. Even though I may just be starting to scratch the surface of this game I can at least tell that this will be one of my top favorite games that I have ever played.			",28,5,0,8,8,0,0

												For some reason, I love this game to the point where I have it on literally all of the time -- even when I'm playing other games. It caters to all playtypes. You can have lots of fast-paced action, participate in its extremely in-depth market and economy, or you can conquer the universe with others in a persistent single-shard server that everyone is on. It is able to be a game that you can play AFK, requiring minimal focus, or be a game where you can't peel your eyes off the screen because of the insanity of it.EVE is love. EVE is life.

												I recommend this because it is an experience like no other. I played this two years ago and play before steam integration occured. I can say with out a doubt Eve Online is an MMO masterpiece. The game recently went free to play, it's free to play model is ment for you to wet your feet, it is not for infinite play time. Eve has it's own living breathing world with it's own politics, economics, and buisnesses. Almost everything that happens in game is caused by players, but over all the one thing Eve has is it's freedom. You can do or be what you want. I personally enjoy the miner's life, but for you adventurers it could be a soldier's life for your empire, the merc life, a pirate's life, or if you are more domestic, the ambassador or buisness life. This game has so much potential and to call it pay to win is sad. The amount of time that has to be dedicated to succeed in the game in amazing. I recommend you try it, and if you think you like it, try it out for a month and see.			",174,26,1,35,44,2,43

												tl;dr - Game is super hard, even more rewarding and enjoyable.My Thoughts:Many RPGs claim that they allow players to play how they want and make the game a ""truey unique"" experience, EVE Online is the first that I have played to actually deliver this idea. Over the course of the game's history, players have made fortunes and lost much more playing roles that are not strictly defined by the game itself yet nonetheless valid. Large scale warfare has taken place between enormous, player-created corporations (which might as well be nation states) providing an experience that drowns you not only in combat but  intergalactic politics as well. There is no correct way to play EVE Online, as EVE Online at its core simply provides you, the player, with setting and tools needed to create your own, everchanging, actually unique experience. Should players stick around long enough to overcome the steep learning curve, there is an addiction to be found in this game that allows you to win and lose everything.What I don't Like:-It is unfortunate that such a marvelous game would have such an unintuitive user interface. Even one of the more simple features, the camera, controls in such a manner that it can be called clumsy at best.-While the developers are working to improve a new player's first experience, the tutorials meant to teach you the basics do little to cover basic menus and features that need to be understood in order to play the game in any reasonable manner.

I am still very new to this game even with 45 hours under my belt there is so much to learn.  For anyone who likes space and is bored or traditional MMO's, I highly recommend this game.  The only negative i really have for this game is how long the tutorial is, and the learning curve is crazy steep, but if you put the time into it, It's a great experience. ",237,33,4,32,24,3,26

												Love this game! It really is an in-depth simulation/trading/PvP game. There a so many things for you to manage, places to go, ships to fly, it really can be quite overwhelming. Growing up with Star Wars, this game lets you fly numerous ships (with proper training) in 3rd person perspective. I like  simulation games and EVE Online gives me the opportunity to scratch that itch in a player driven trade market.  Want to become a trading mogul? It's here. You like PvP space battle? Want to become a space pirate or a war hero? It's here. Large faction space battles? It's here.Join a Federation or Alliance and have at it. You like exploration? From high security to low security to null security, go where you like, do what you like. Just make sure you have the right skill training. Training takes place in real time, from several minutes, to several days for higher level skills.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												EVE is huge and immersive if you can give it the time it requires. Apparently I clocked up a mere 40 hours, minute in the EVE world but still a hell of a lot more than some games. The thing is I am not sure what I even done in those hours. All I know was that it was strangely relaxing and, once I had mastered the basics, it became very easy to become deeply absorbed in the universe.It is a time killer though, a life killer perhaps, and that is why I had to stop playing. I just could not do the game justice in the short available game time I had. A real shame as I think I could quite love it and I know I barely scratched the surface.I will no doubt start it up again if I get fired and have to claim benefits.			",359,103,10,39,24,3,49

												So iv played this game on an off since 2008 & i now run my old account plus a new 2nd account through steam.The game is a very brutal one that is very quick to punish your inexperience,its very complex and massive in all aspects, so much so noobs WILL die as have we all.working your socks off for a Tier 3 Cruiser + subs is an amazing feeling when you first get in it but if your only skilled enough to fly it the it wont be long before your new toy is destroyed an your so heartbroken you feel like quitting.Anyone new to the game should always make sure they have the skills to properly equip mods that increase its survivability before takingthem into combat because even in the fairly safer are of highsec other players might still gun you down if the NPC dont.My new account could run L4 missions in a T3 Destroyer with T2 Weapons in under 1 month because i dedicated all the skill time for the one purpose.Finally, you dont need to constantly play the game to keep up to date an stay on top like in other MMO. Skills are time based and to be good you only need to be experienced at pvp or good at math (ideally both)I wish the game could add something along the lines of Mini-carrier's for people to run L4 with in Highsec as i can PvP but its not what i enjoy.

												Really immersive sci-fi MMO. Don't let the skill curve fool you! There are plenty of resources you can read that will tell you how to get in the action in your first week of flying! Every ship counts! There is always a group of players that will take you in! Eve online is a game that truley lets you play how you want to play, you can follow any path you want! The choice is yours! Fly Safe!07			",132,5,1,9,13,0,20

												For some reason, I love this game to the point where I have it on literally all of the time -- even when I'm playing other games. It caters to all playtypes. You can have lots of fast-paced action, participate in its extremely in-depth market and economy, or you can conquer the universe with others in a persistent single-shard server that everyone is on. It is able to be a game that you can play AFK, requiring minimal focus, or be a game where you can't peel your eyes off the screen because of the insanity of it.EVE is love. EVE is life.

												Spreadsheet simulator? Nope. WoW not engaging enough? Maybe a bit too simple? Eve is for the people, by the people. Literally. There is definetly a learning curve to overcome, but after that its quite entertaining. Beautiful space vistas without the taxing requirements of todays generation of games. Thousands of people to interact with: Big-Wig corporations, mercenaries, pirates, smugglers, cargo couriers, miners, navigators, salvagers, bounty hunters, scammers, vigilantes, brokers, market manipulators, etc; all of who carry whatever title they want to fit their playstyle. Eve is a true sandbox space experience. Just, whatever you do, don't use smartbombs in HiSec.			",106,4,1,18,4,0,28

												I have to admit, I was a little intimidated by how much there is in this game but when it comes to a space shooter I can understand.  I have played at least a couple hours of it.  The tutorial is annoying, because sometimes it will lead you to what you have to do but sometimes confuse you with misunderstandings.  When you first start, I would recommend getting a friend to teach you how to do it and you'll get the hang of it soon.  The graphics are amazing.  And the gameplay can either work as you play missions or pull up marketing charts to gain EVE money.  >♥♥♥♥♥es get wet for Titan Ships			",65,8,0,14,20,0,21

												Extremely addictive if you play it as a social game and exploit the opportunities presented to you. I have never gotten so immersed and cared so much about a game since my childhood. My hours played is a lie because i mostly played the game outside of Steam, basically i have somewhere from 2 to 3 thousand hours played. If you do one thing, like mine for resources, then use that to get a better ship to mine more resources or likewise for doing missions, basically just interact with the AI you will get bored.    Good stuff: make friends, betray your friends, make enemies, kill people. The industry side of EVE is quite interesting, you will look at spreadsheets on a saturday evening voulantarily.What eventually happens: become a bittervet, stop logging in, ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ on the forums, make extremely optimized fits for all ships you will never fly, cancel subscription. 6 months later reactivate subscription and play for a couple of weeks until you rediscover why you stopped playing.

												tl;dr - Game is super hard, even more rewarding and enjoyable.My Thoughts:Many RPGs claim that they allow players to play how they want and make the game a ""truey unique"" experience, EVE Online is the first that I have played to actually deliver this idea. Over the course of the game's history, players have made fortunes and lost much more playing roles that are not strictly defined by the game itself yet nonetheless valid. Large scale warfare has taken place between enormous, player-created corporations (which might as well be nation states) providing an experience that drowns you not only in combat but  intergalactic politics as well. There is no correct way to play EVE Online, as EVE Online at its core simply provides you, the player, with setting and tools needed to create your own, everchanging, actually unique experience. Should players stick around long enough to overcome the steep learning curve, there is an addiction to be found in this game that allows you to win and lose everything.What I don't Like:-It is unfortunate that such a marvelous game would have such an unintuitive user interface. Even one of the more simple features, the camera, controls in such a manner that it can be called clumsy at best.-While the developers are working to improve a new player's first experience, the tutorials meant to teach you the basics do little to cover basic menus and features that need to be understood in order to play the game in any reasonable manner.

It's a fun game is to play alone, but it is even better with friends.  Once you actually get skills and a few shots of whiskey in you, you feel like you can take on anything. Or as much as your ISK will let you.  o7			",133,25,5,22,13,1,13

I am still very new to this game even with 45 hours under my belt there is so much to learn.  For anyone who likes space and is bored or traditional MMO's, I highly recommend this game.  The only negative i really have for this game is how long the tutorial is, and the learning curve is crazy steep, but if you put the time into it, It's a great experience. ",237,33,4,32,24,3,26

												VERY GOOD GAME. The tutorial however could use with an overhaul. however to do a proper tutorial, it would last well over 30 days. There is THAT MUCH stuff to do in this game. One of the few games that is player driven. Everything in the game is made by players. And when I say that i mean: The ore is mined by players, then refined by players, then items and manufactured from thosed minerals by players, then flown by players, then destroyed by players. Game is very in depth and there is almost never nothing to do. The almost part is because the game has a set maint schedule (1 hour every day for restart, maint, and patching of the server, etc.) With that being said, if you are on the fence. Try out the trial, its free. One word of advise though: Do not think you are going to start and be the best ever. you need to learn. This game can be very daunting / challenging to new players.

												Eve Online is a hardcore space mmorpg. It has a broad range of professions including but not limited to: Pirating, Smuggler, Naval Military Personnel, Explorer, Miner, Planet Colonizer, Industrial Manufacturer, Trader, and Ship Salvager. These are just some of the main professions that have numerous sub professions such as Explorer = Wormhole Seller, Hacker, Relic Salvager, Information Dealer, Reconnaisance and Espionage. The LEARNING CURVE is high but dont get frustrated. It is important to find a Corporation to teach and mentor you. Make sure that these Corporations are inalign with your interest. Be prepared to die alot, lose your stuff, be scammed, cheated, ganked, and mentally terrorized. Eve Online is not a happy go friendly mmorpg.

												Adore this game, the community has its rough-spots, but if you get yourself a good corporation you are set for some of the most amazingly alive and vivid times that can be had in any game: from taking part in massive fleet ops capturing solar systems, to exploring somewhere remote only to be scanned down and destroyed by pirates, it is just awesome. Yeah you will get up from the computer sometimes raging at EVE, but you will always come back whether for revenge or for amusement, or maybe just to learn something new.One thing for certain though, there is no other game in which the tutorial is so essential. Also recommend joining up  with EVE-UNI at least for a month.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												After playing for 2 years here is my conclusion:The worst game you ever have to pay so much  for so many Boring  activities , Its made unplayable for all players  especially new players so you keep paying your monthly fees with real money ,  you have to join Corps  to do anything  and  will treat you  like you are an employee working for them , it brings the worst to everyplayer I met there  ,and when someone scam another it considered short of celebrity.Lots of trolls  this game. The addiction to play lays on  the negativity on losing  something (ship ,isks were ever) and you get mad so you keep playing like gamblers do. When you play at first you will be on a ""Hight sec""that will give you short of security to learn the game ,buy ships do stuff etc,   guess what ,  there is not such thing , it s a game scam to hook you on their loop of addiction by losing. Practically  the game developers favor big corps to market their poor product and not single players to have fun playing a game with couple of their buddies.			",20,2,0,5,7,0,13

												This is a game, with a specific stance and uniqueness.Portraits a future society isolated in its own universe that is called EVE.In it you can choose 4 faces of humanity. Set up to your own adventure and gear up for the fantastic thrill of being in space with your own ship. Currently, I am still experience the game, so my review is limited to my own understanding of the lore and gameplay that i have done and understood so far. By i am well aware it is only a scratch.The game has much more deepness to it, than i can realize it, but still I am obligated to express sadness when it comes to what can you do within the game. Which may sound a lot for what i describe but it is highly limited.I recommend for you to try it for yourself, and reach your own conclusion.It is a free game :)Carefull though it has transactions within it, with real currency.

												Too many crybabies with 6-10 hrs of playtime reviewing EVE. This is a great game; but to truly enjoy it, you have to invest time. I've played this game off an on since 2006. I had an official EVE account but started anew with steam just for the simplicity of logging in. Invested almost 190 hrs in the past month and still NOWHERE near where I was back when I first played.But you see, that is where EVE is most successful. There is always something to learn: New tactics, ships, fits, play styles, careers, etc. There is a reason why CCP has managed to keep this game running since 2003. I decided to get back into the game last month when I noticed it was F2P with restrictions. I just wanted to see if the game can suck the soul from me again. With a few dedicated friends and a new corp, my soul is lost to New Eden once more.I'm thoroughly enjoying my time in space again. If you want my recommendation? Make friends, ask questions, have some patience, join a corp that shares similar playstyles and goals as you do. If you do this, you will truly enjoy the experience. Never stop learning. Uni-Wiki and veteran players are your best friend.Gale Corbin, CEO of Anvil Excavations Inc. in game.--Fly with me!			",85,9,0,8,5,0,7

												It is like alternative life... I have a holidays from EvE now, will back to it in December - the same schedule each year.almost 5 years of playing, yet there is always something new to discover. If you are looking for strategy/planning/real economy and huge open world - co-existence with other pilots (believe me it is really exciting) -> EvE is for you! With proper planning you do not have to pay real money for subscription - just pay with isk (in-game currency) and fly where you want... Fly safe pilots o7			",21,2,0,5,15,0,13

												9/10.An online universe. Tons of possibilities. Gameplay is fun. ""Don't buy what you can't afford to lose"". Too expensive. Not a game for 12yo kids.If you like crafting, the game has it. Almost everything you see in the game was made by players. If you like trading, the game has it. A whole skill tree focused on allowing you to set tons of buy/sell orders and player contracts around the universe. And pirates to try to rob you as you carry your valuables through low security sectors.If you like scamming, the game has it. And it's not against the rules. o.O There's a contract system for most of the interactions you might want with an untrusted player, but there's also a guide on how to use the contract system to scam people (like offering a contract where they'll pay and give you some items instead of receiving).If you're into adventure, the game has it. If you google ""eve online star map"", you'll find a map of the KNOWN universe. Each dot there is a solar system you can explore. There are parts of the universe that won't show on map and can only be reached through wormholes. So... you might die irl before exploring everything.If you're into combat, the game has it. From pve or suicidal attacks to mess up with afk miners in high security sectors up to full scale hundreds vs hundreds wars in player-owned null security sectors. You can expect some lagging on massive wars, but rest assured that it's balanced among all players to make the combat fair.Expensive. Too expensive for an mmo. The starter pack with steam discount is worth it, and if you focus on gathering money, you might be able to buy the PLEX in game to get another 30 days. But probably won't have much ingame progress. Otherwise it may take a few months until you're able to get PLEX and play. Once you start playing, the game doesn't feel that expensive anymore, but it's kinda hard to get your friends to try the game. The steam starter pack has two problems. First, one of the items will give +9 of each attribute for a player up to 14 days after creation. The boost is awesome, and speeds up skill training a lot. The problem is that you'll get no warning when you create your character that you have an item that will only work until 14 days after creation. Most people end up losing a few days because they didn't know they had the item or thought it would be better to save until they're training higher level skills. The second problem is that the items on the starter pack have a value too high for new players. It wouldn't really be a problem if it wasn't for a single detail: you may lose most of them if you get killed. Some may be stored in a station until you're able to use them, but some only have value if you have them active or on you. The ship may be lost if you engage pve combat and don't know how to escape if things get bad. The +9 booster MAY be lost if a player destroys your escape pod after destroying your ship. Some reported that they lost, some that they didn't lose. I wouldn't want to risk. That's almost a 50% booster for noobs who don't have access to implants.Anyways, the golden rule of this game is ""don't buy what you can't afford to lose"". As a noob you can't recover anything you get from the starter pack. It's not like you can't survive without them, but it's pretty annoying to lose all that stuff if you get suicide ganked by someone the second you step out of a station in a high security sector. Even though it's not something that happens often, it is possible.Other than that, this is not a game for 12yo kids that used to play alliance hunter on WoW. If you want to see their impressions of the game just check the negative reviews on metacritic: ""QQ this is too hard. Where's my IWIN button???"", ""QQ me no understands this."",  ""QQ me wants iwin button plis"".			",47,20,0,20,65,0,18

												I have been playing this game for 10 and half years now. There are many possibilities in the game. How to succeed is ENTIRELY on you. Am I a successful player in Eve-Online? More or less! I have done everything Eve-Online has to offer, except for invention! This game definately deserves the ""Test of Time"" award!Is it a hard game? Yes, it can be. Is it complex? Again, it can be. It all depends on what you plan on doing in the game. The game is always changing, both its graphics and its mechanics (find details on Citadels, latest game changing effect). This game is not for everyone due of its vast and harsh nature.Two simple reasons I play Eve-Online. 1. Everyone (except China ...) play in one server. None of the multiple servers crap. 2. While this is probably no longer valid due of skill injectors... No one can ""catch up"" to you and skill training is passive. Don't need to ""grind"" for skills. Only grinding there is, is making the in-game currency, ISK. (And you can earn ISK without grinding). I don't need to worry about ""getting behind"".To quickly explain what I have done for the past 10 years for Eve-Online, I have lived in empire in my first few months into Eve-Online, mostly PvE. After that, I spent the next 6'ish years in Null Sec. Then almost 2 years in Low Sec after I left nullsec. Now I am venturing my current time in wormhole space, another kind of PvP enviroment :) . I am a PvP'er, but I also do industry related things and PvE.If you want to play the game, my biggest tip is, join Eve-University Corp. Or ask friends that play the game. I seen new pilots go straight to wormholes or null sec, skipping the high sec environment. Only limit there is in the game, is you and how you make it succeed! If you need some advice or direction, send an eve-mail to NeoShocker!			",241,23,7,18,25,2,48

												(I've been playing EVE Online for roughly about three years total--using the CCP client.)I won't attempt to write a comprehensive review of all that there is to experience in EVE Online. I'll simply recommend it and give a few reasons why. However, if a comprehensive review is exactly what you want, it shouldn't be too difficult to find one. And truthfully, all of the ""comprehensive"" reviews will end up saying what I am going to say in this review.1) I highly recommend EVE Online. Now that the latest update has implemented indefinite F2P, you can try EVE for free, indefinitely; you do not have to purchase what Steam offers BEFORE you can explore the EVE universe--though what Steam offers is a great deal. I suggest that you consider what Steam offers AFTER playing the game.2) Because of the indefinite F2P update, a new influx of beginners and veterans alike will be online. This influx has already provided a significant boost to EVE's commercial exposure, and will likely mean that if you want to learn how to do all of the technical things in the game: explore for wormholes, mine in dangerous parts of space, manipulate the player market, and so on, now is the time to do it. There are groups of players dedicated to teaching new players how to get the most out of EVE, if there are new players to be taught. Learning the technical aspects of the game is what EVE is about. As is usually the case with other games, knowing HOW to play EVE is what allows you to really enjoy it.3) It's a game you will likely never forget. EVE Online is easily a classic. [There's even a damn book written about it by Andrew Groen! Go check it out!] EVE is up there with those games that define the paradigms of gaming. It's the ONLY game on the market that delivers what it provides.			",146,67,0,42,10,2,12

Not only did the Devs get the point, it was hilarious to see the Killmails 7 jumps away and thank Baby Vorcha Jesus that none of those poor Capsuleers were me.In Short, Awesome game!

												EVE Online has been my favourite MMO for years now, my steam hours aren't all of my playtime as I played through a seperate client before I bought it on steam to support the creators even more, because well, they deserve it.It's a well-polished space pirate MMO, the career mission's and opportunities that act as the tutorial for the game couldn't have been better than what they were although it is a lot of text to read early on for new comers and can be very overwhelming which could be extinguished by just voice acting.After the ""tutorial"" you should find yourself with a variety of ships and modules to start you off playing through the game which not a lot of MMO's do, they just give you a class and basic gear and send you off but Eve Online leaves you a huge insight into the ships and modules and their uses and gives you time to learn the in's and out's of the game, including it's well-known market.Overall, I recommend this game to people who want a MMO that will keep them busy, try out the free trial first before buying a subscription though as that will be more than enough time for you to know if this is the game for you or not.

												I normally don't write reviews, but the game is in a whole different galaxy. It can't be described in words the feeling you get when you are warping together with your friends and allies straight into a war zone with people dying left and right and you are frantically shooting everything while your Fleet Commander is shouting out orders. All the while hoping that you don't get targeted, dodging left and right through the wreckages of fallen allies and foes alike, Then suddenly, you notice your ship has been locked on and taking heavy damage from a battleship. Just as you think you are going to die, your friends swoops and saves you by blowing up the enemy battleship. In that moment of relief, you all smile.Suddenly, Boom!! one of your friends explode in a blaze of bright lights, then another, then another. It's like a string of fireworks and all your friends are dying. Before you realized, the enemy has brought backup and its a Titan.As the Fleet Commander shouts orders to retreat, you only gaze at the massive behemoth loaming over you, dwarfing anything you have ever encountered, a reaper of death. With one last look at the floating corpses of your fallen friends, you press the emergancy warp button and back off into the endless space once more to regain power........ for revenge.

There's alot to learn, but you dont need to know everything.  Early on you can train to fly a frigate, they are fast-> big ships slow. In a week you can train to equipt and afford decent enough modules into the frigate to do decent damamge in pvp. of course with the help of that begginer friendly corperation you joined.    you get a month free trial, you make friends quick. you also make enemies quick ;)			",130,7,6,20,12,0,6

												(I've been playing EVE Online for roughly about three years total--using the CCP client.)I won't attempt to write a comprehensive review of all that there is to experience in EVE Online. I'll simply recommend it and give a few reasons why. However, if a comprehensive review is exactly what you want, it shouldn't be too difficult to find one. And truthfully, all of the ""comprehensive"" reviews will end up saying what I am going to say in this review.1) I highly recommend EVE Online. Now that the latest update has implemented indefinite F2P, you can try EVE for free, indefinitely; you do not have to purchase what Steam offers BEFORE you can explore the EVE universe--though what Steam offers is a great deal. I suggest that you consider what Steam offers AFTER playing the game.2) Because of the indefinite F2P update, a new influx of beginners and veterans alike will be online. This influx has already provided a significant boost to EVE's commercial exposure, and will likely mean that if you want to learn how to do all of the technical things in the game: explore for wormholes, mine in dangerous parts of space, manipulate the player market, and so on, now is the time to do it. There are groups of players dedicated to teaching new players how to get the most out of EVE, if there are new players to be taught. Learning the technical aspects of the game is what EVE is about. As is usually the case with other games, knowing HOW to play EVE is what allows you to really enjoy it.3) It's a game you will likely never forget. EVE Online is easily a classic. [There's even a damn book written about it by Andrew Groen! Go check it out!] EVE is up there with those games that define the paradigms of gaming. It's the ONLY game on the market that delivers what it provides.			",146,67,0,42,10,2,12

												I have been playing this game for 10 and half years now. There are many possibilities in the game. How to succeed is ENTIRELY on you. Am I a successful player in Eve-Online? More or less! I have done everything Eve-Online has to offer, except for invention! This game definately deserves the ""Test of Time"" award!Is it a hard game? Yes, it can be. Is it complex? Again, it can be. It all depends on what you plan on doing in the game. The game is always changing, both its graphics and its mechanics (find details on Citadels, latest game changing effect). This game is not for everyone due of its vast and harsh nature.Two simple reasons I play Eve-Online. 1. Everyone (except China ...) play in one server. None of the multiple servers crap. 2. While this is probably no longer valid due of skill injectors... No one can ""catch up"" to you and skill training is passive. Don't need to ""grind"" for skills. Only grinding there is, is making the in-game currency, ISK. (And you can earn ISK without grinding). I don't need to worry about ""getting behind"".To quickly explain what I have done for the past 10 years for Eve-Online, I have lived in empire in my first few months into Eve-Online, mostly PvE. After that, I spent the next 6'ish years in Null Sec. Then almost 2 years in Low Sec after I left nullsec. Now I am venturing my current time in wormhole space, another kind of PvP enviroment :) . I am a PvP'er, but I also do industry related things and PvE.If you want to play the game, my biggest tip is, join Eve-University Corp. Or ask friends that play the game. I seen new pilots go straight to wormholes or null sec, skipping the high sec environment. Only limit there is in the game, is you and how you make it succeed! If you need some advice or direction, send an eve-mail to NeoShocker!			",241,23,7,18,25,2,48

But since the navy cruiser takes a few weeks to properly train up/ 5o-90 mil to fit right, there is no shortage of stuff to play for free at least for a while.

												After playing for 2 years here is my conclusion:The worst game you ever have to pay so much  for so many Boring  activities , Its made unplayable for all players  especially new players so you keep paying your monthly fees with real money ,  you have to join Corps  to do anything  and  will treat you  like you are an employee working for them , it brings the worst to everyplayer I met there  ,and when someone scam another it considered short of celebrity.Lots of trolls  this game. The addiction to play lays on  the negativity on losing  something (ship ,isks were ever) and you get mad so you keep playing like gamblers do. When you play at first you will be on a ""Hight sec""that will give you short of security to learn the game ,buy ships do stuff etc,   guess what ,  there is not such thing , it s a game scam to hook you on their loop of addiction by losing. Practically  the game developers favor big corps to market their poor product and not single players to have fun playing a game with couple of their buddies.			",20,2,0,5,7,0,13

												This is a game, with a specific stance and uniqueness.Portraits a future society isolated in its own universe that is called EVE.In it you can choose 4 faces of humanity. Set up to your own adventure and gear up for the fantastic thrill of being in space with your own ship. Currently, I am still experience the game, so my review is limited to my own understanding of the lore and gameplay that i have done and understood so far. By i am well aware it is only a scratch.The game has much more deepness to it, than i can realize it, but still I am obligated to express sadness when it comes to what can you do within the game. Which may sound a lot for what i describe but it is highly limited.I recommend for you to try it for yourself, and reach your own conclusion.It is a free game :)Carefull though it has transactions within it, with real currency.

												Too many crybabies with 6-10 hrs of playtime reviewing EVE. This is a great game; but to truly enjoy it, you have to invest time. I've played this game off an on since 2006. I had an official EVE account but started anew with steam just for the simplicity of logging in. Invested almost 190 hrs in the past month and still NOWHERE near where I was back when I first played.But you see, that is where EVE is most successful. There is always something to learn: New tactics, ships, fits, play styles, careers, etc. There is a reason why CCP has managed to keep this game running since 2003. I decided to get back into the game last month when I noticed it was F2P with restrictions. I just wanted to see if the game can suck the soul from me again. With a few dedicated friends and a new corp, my soul is lost to New Eden once more.I'm thoroughly enjoying my time in space again. If you want my recommendation? Make friends, ask questions, have some patience, join a corp that shares similar playstyles and goals as you do. If you do this, you will truly enjoy the experience. Never stop learning. Uni-Wiki and veteran players are your best friend.Gale Corbin, CEO of Anvil Excavations Inc. in game.--Fly with me!			",85,9,0,8,5,0,7

												9/10.An online universe. Tons of possibilities. Gameplay is fun. ""Don't buy what you can't afford to lose"". Too expensive. Not a game for 12yo kids.If you like crafting, the game has it. Almost everything you see in the game was made by players. If you like trading, the game has it. A whole skill tree focused on allowing you to set tons of buy/sell orders and player contracts around the universe. And pirates to try to rob you as you carry your valuables through low security sectors.If you like scamming, the game has it. And it's not against the rules. o.O There's a contract system for most of the interactions you might want with an untrusted player, but there's also a guide on how to use the contract system to scam people (like offering a contract where they'll pay and give you some items instead of receiving).If you're into adventure, the game has it. If you google ""eve online star map"", you'll find a map of the KNOWN universe. Each dot there is a solar system you can explore. There are parts of the universe that won't show on map and can only be reached through wormholes. So... you might die irl before exploring everything.If you're into combat, the game has it. From pve or suicidal attacks to mess up with afk miners in high security sectors up to full scale hundreds vs hundreds wars in player-owned null security sectors. You can expect some lagging on massive wars, but rest assured that it's balanced among all players to make the combat fair.Expensive. Too expensive for an mmo. The starter pack with steam discount is worth it, and if you focus on gathering money, you might be able to buy the PLEX in game to get another 30 days. But probably won't have much ingame progress. Otherwise it may take a few months until you're able to get PLEX and play. Once you start playing, the game doesn't feel that expensive anymore, but it's kinda hard to get your friends to try the game. The steam starter pack has two problems. First, one of the items will give +9 of each attribute for a player up to 14 days after creation. The boost is awesome, and speeds up skill training a lot. The problem is that you'll get no warning when you create your character that you have an item that will only work until 14 days after creation. Most people end up losing a few days because they didn't know they had the item or thought it would be better to save until they're training higher level skills. The second problem is that the items on the starter pack have a value too high for new players. It wouldn't really be a problem if it wasn't for a single detail: you may lose most of them if you get killed. Some may be stored in a station until you're able to use them, but some only have value if you have them active or on you. The ship may be lost if you engage pve combat and don't know how to escape if things get bad. The +9 booster MAY be lost if a player destroys your escape pod after destroying your ship. Some reported that they lost, some that they didn't lose. I wouldn't want to risk. That's almost a 50% booster for noobs who don't have access to implants.Anyways, the golden rule of this game is ""don't buy what you can't afford to lose"". As a noob you can't recover anything you get from the starter pack. It's not like you can't survive without them, but it's pretty annoying to lose all that stuff if you get suicide ganked by someone the second you step out of a station in a high security sector. Even though it's not something that happens often, it is possible.Other than that, this is not a game for 12yo kids that used to play alliance hunter on WoW. If you want to see their impressions of the game just check the negative reviews on metacritic: ""QQ this is too hard. Where's my IWIN button???"", ""QQ me no understands this."",  ""QQ me wants iwin button plis"".			",47,20,0,20,65,0,18

												Fair warning: it took me in excess of three months begin to appreciate the game and more than 2 years to start playing it properly.It's worth it.I fear there is little I can really tell a new player, other than the mechanics of how to play (don't use WASD), in order to get them up to speed and having fun. EVE is a sandbox MMO and it's a long-term game. There is unprecedented freedom, yet anyone looking for an easy, on-rails experience needs to leave quickly. You will make decisions that will take months to complete and may not be profitable nor pan out for you. You will learn, slowly, and you'll adapt. The major battles (the fun stuff) are player-based and do not depend on the whims of developers (CCP tried and we barely took notice). Nigh all of the items in-game are made or otherwise harvested by players. Don't play this game if you do not like the concept of PvP as you will be forced to face it, whether flying in space or tackling the markets. Play with friends or learn how to make them fast. Some will want to run background checks on you. Most find this normal. Those who don't are spies.You will find yourself making spreadsheets in Google Docs and using the API to your advantage. You might find yourself shooting lasers at rocks, you might find yourself shooting lasers at other ships, you might find yourself staring at endless items and modules for hours on end, trying to eke out as much function out of your ships powergrid and CPU limitations. And it will be fun. If I have yet to scare you, you may have what it takes to be a capsuleer.			",108,27,0,12,25,2,26

												Only been playing this game for about 70 hours and still its one of the most fun games ive played overall. Just recently joined a superfriendly corporation which is now going to teach me the ropes on the endgame stuff. If you dont want to join a corp right away, the ""Help"" channel in this game is also very helpful, overall id dare say the biggest % of the players in this game are mature, levelheaded helpful people. Though this game can be a moneysink of you dont smear yourself with patience, it doesnt -have- to be. Nobody will chastise you for being low lvl (skillpoints).Lost a ship worth about 10 bucks the first week tho. 10/10 would roam the empyrean again.			",204,22,2,41,35,1,37

												EVE Online,I've sank so many hours into this game that one would deem me a ""professional"" but even then I still learn alot from day to day, this game is so incredibly complex that you'll never run out of stuff to learn or find out about new things you can do.I've been playing this game on and off for almost a decade now and I can tell you that this is the worst game in existance with the best community.Why worst game?It's ♥♥♥♥ing dull, you target someone, you hit your modules and you shoot him and hope for the better, or is it?There's alot of mechanics that come into play when you fight, which you will learn over the course of many fights if you do get into this game, mechanics I can't just explain, they come with experience.Same goes for alot of activity like Planetary Interaction, Mining and the likes, the action you're undertaking is very, VERY boring (especially in high sec), but it's the suspense of someone being able to come out of nowhere and take your shiny ship to the abyss that keeps you going, a small bit of adrenaline, but then you finally settle down and go, yeah things are okay now, BOOM, hotdrop, 100s of players in system and your shiny 300m mining ship goes up in flames.Enough of the anecdotes.I can't stress enough how complicated this game is, not as in HARD, but it has alot of things you can do inside the game, and each activity has a whole encyclopedia on how you can do it better, what items you can get, etc. etc. etc. There's alot of depth to it.My experience comes solely from pvp and a small bit of industry, things like this:https://clips.twitch.tv/veetus/GloriousWormUleetBackup(My name is FSync)Just like that stream above, the guy got killed by me, I did not know him before but he made my day by just giving me the finger on his own stream after I killed him (he told me he was streaming after the kill).People are really people in this game, not like your average cod player that joins your lobby to whom you will never see again, any player has a history, a circle of friends and networks, everything you do leads to another, there really is a butterfly effect in this game.Whenever you are in a system and you see a person in local, if you look at his history, all the clans (corporations) and alliances he's been part of, all those people still know him, still remember him, still fly or talk with him occasionally.The whole community is intwined with each other throughout the game because the community management tools inside the game are perfect, people can dictate whom they like or not and literally implement politics, this game has propaganda going on the web and thousands of stories from alot of players alike.Even though for it's nice stories and events, the game has an argueable amount of active players (45k as writing this review) a day, make note that all these players are all playing on the same server, there's only a sheer amount of people who become interested in this game and their interest is literally limitless, the active gaming community of EVE is one of the most hardcore, but if not the most friendly community out there in any mmo, new players can expect ships and lots of ingame money to come their way and win their hearts over to join the evevets group.To draw a conclusion about my review;Pros:- Game has alot of depth (playing for 10 years, still feel like a new player)- Near limitless activities to do.- Very active and friendly community though alot of trolling aka salt mining is abundant throughout the game.- Sandbox (you decide what you want to do)- Beautiful space scenery and ships- Has a pretty good F2P option, people saying you can't do much with a F2P account should shut their prejudice mouth, I wish I had this option 10 years ago, I would've played at least 6 years with all the F2P ships that they can fly.- The game has alot of IT playing in it, if you have computer problems and you mention it in corp/alliance chat there's at least everyone replying a solution to your computer problem, don't do it too often, you'll lose their interest in solving your problems.Cons:- Game pace is slow, for some this can be quite a turnoff.- Game is very harsh, if you die you lose your♥♥♥♥♥♥ no refunds unless you have an alliance backing you with a ship replacement program, some might view this as a pro.- Game is dull, as I mentioned before, the actions you take may seem boring, mining is just sitting at an asteroid and shooting lasers at it for hours, it's where talking with your friends or doing your real life administration while watching local/intel is coming into place here.- May take a long time to get ""in"" to, the game is complex and requires alot of patience and common sense, something that 70% of the of the human population on the planet Earth lacks.- Sandbox (some people like linear goals, referring to the con above this one) people might not know what to do and get bored and just leave.

												Ever wondered ""what if?""If you have ever wanted to be a trade mogul making billions....A miner amassing riches extracting the most precious metals of the galaxy and selling them for profit...A soldier fighting wars on all fronts in massive fleets...A researcher studying the vast mysteries of space...A manufacturer and dealer of an insurmountable level of munitions and arms...A PROFITEER - Then EVE is for you. You can be anyone in EVE. You can do anything, at any time, for any reason. EVE is an open universe waiting for you to jump in and make a name for yourself. The sheer level of activities on offer is mind boggling. Sure, the FREE TO PLAY isn't really free. Alpha characters, as they are known, are very limited to what they can do. That being said, they can still do almost everything there is to do in EVE, not to mention MAKE A KILLING. If you want more, sure. You can pay. Or, you can buy PLEX with IN GAME money (ISK) and never have to pay your subscription again, since PLEX (Pilot License Extention) can be redeemed for 30 days of game time. I love running military missions, killing pirates, mining and running HUGE pirate hunting ops called Incursions. 10-12 hours of incursion running pays for an entire month of game time for me (about 3-4 hours a day, 2-3 days a month). I fly a Rattlesnake battleship equipped with cruise missiles that have the capability of locking a target over 90km away, and travelling a maxium distance of just under 130km. With my microwarpdrive and target painter in hand, a volley of these missiles from several launchers at a time usually means certain death for nearly any but the largest of battleships. And even then, they are not nearly close enough to do anything to me...before it is too late. The satisfaction of making things go boom in this game is indescribable. If you want to forge your own path in the stars, EVE is for you.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												While posessing a learning curve steeper than any other game I've seen in my day, this game has to be one of the most rewarding. My encounters with players and NPC's alike have yielded enjoyable hours of gameplay.As much as I love this game, there are some things that could be done better. No game is perfect, so I'll highlight some personal Pros and Cons.PROS-Rewarding if you stick with it. It's always fun to see yourself grow from a tiny cruiser pilot to the owner of a massive frigate-You can make a living in the game by doing just about anything. From mining rocks all day to being a filhty pirate.-The universe is rather large, and there's a lot of ground to cover (Like any MMO)-Players drive the economy-You can buy subscription with in game cash! :DCONS-It's really difficult for newer players to actually get into this game. Yes, they can play for a few hours and enjoy it...But it takes a lot of dedication and patience to actually end up somewhere noteable-The subscription. For a game that's so exclusive feeling, it seems like a bad idea to have a subscription for only allowing a Two week trial period. Based upon most peoples schedules, two weeks isn't enough to truly experience the game. -You never really get told where it's a good idea to go and where is not. There are a lot of places that you can get swarmed by people who just want to make your day tough. Losing your ship means losing your ship, so it's hard to move up in the world when you're constantly being sent back to the beginning. IN CONCLUSION-I think this game is a good game to get into. It's fun and makes you feel good when you begin your slow crawl into the heart of space.			",170,51,1,38,28,2,17

However, it has a great degree of realism and a huge variety of things that you can do in game. You can do everything from PvP combat to creating ships and modules to suppy your fellow players with the things they need.

												I love the fact that you have an MMO in outer space, I just didn't think space was this ♥♥♥♥ing boring!!!!  With the new tutorials they have in place figuring out the game is pretty straight foward and easy, learning curve wasn't that bad for me,  making money is fairly easy, but you have too in order to afford anything, my god the market is way out of whack for new players.  I mean I made 20 million credit pretty easy, but I need like 400,000,000 credit for the ship I would want, I mean you literally have to have played this from launch to be in the upper tier and without help it would literally take you almost a year to get into that game, I mean if you want to pirate with a lesser ship you could probably do that in a few weeks, but frankly I think the combat is boring, mining is boring.  I was really hoping to like this, it is unique but def not for everybody.			",108,6,3,24,3,0,22

												If you enjoy other hobbies or video games I would warn you to stay away from EVE Online. The addication is real. Not only  can you do whatever you want and conquer territory. You can also lose all of your wealth from a single mistake (The best part of this game). If you do play, join a player guild (corporation) and start building your own virtual sandcastle. Play only if you are either a masochist or love complete sandbox games.			",141,11,2,29,13,1,43

												While posessing a learning curve steeper than any other game I've seen in my day, this game has to be one of the most rewarding. My encounters with players and NPC's alike have yielded enjoyable hours of gameplay.As much as I love this game, there are some things that could be done better. No game is perfect, so I'll highlight some personal Pros and Cons.PROS-Rewarding if you stick with it. It's always fun to see yourself grow from a tiny cruiser pilot to the owner of a massive frigate-You can make a living in the game by doing just about anything. From mining rocks all day to being a filhty pirate.-The universe is rather large, and there's a lot of ground to cover (Like any MMO)-Players drive the economy-You can buy subscription with in game cash! :DCONS-It's really difficult for newer players to actually get into this game. Yes, they can play for a few hours and enjoy it...But it takes a lot of dedication and patience to actually end up somewhere noteable-The subscription. For a game that's so exclusive feeling, it seems like a bad idea to have a subscription for only allowing a Two week trial period. Based upon most peoples schedules, two weeks isn't enough to truly experience the game. -You never really get told where it's a good idea to go and where is not. There are a lot of places that you can get swarmed by people who just want to make your day tough. Losing your ship means losing your ship, so it's hard to move up in the world when you're constantly being sent back to the beginning. IN CONCLUSION-I think this game is a good game to get into. It's fun and makes you feel good when you begin your slow crawl into the heart of space.			",170,51,1,38,28,2,17

												I first started playing this game a couple years ago with some friends of mine. They both fell out of it after awhile so I stopped playing. I decided to give it another shot about 2 weeks ago. And I'm hooked. I love it. I joined a nice corporation  (which is like a player made clan) and there is so many different routes you can take and so much to do from mining, bounty hunting, warm hole farming, salvaging, transporting, ganking, exploration, fighting in corporation wars and earning your ranks as you go. I decided to put my time and skills into mining. I love it. I started with a venture (basic mining ship) and earned the cash and learned the skills for a procurer which is a pretty damn decent mining ship, the greatest thing about this game is its completely player made, the players have the choice to do anything they damn well please. For instance I was mining in a low security asteroid belt and got ganked by someone in a higher tier battleship and got rekt. At any time and any place someone can kill you, so only travel with what you can afford to lose. Only this about it being on steam is that it doesn't mention it's not completely free to play. It's free to play up to a point. Most ships, upgraded fittings for your ship and skills, can only be obtainable for being an Omega player, which is the status of being a subscribed pilot. Which the subscription is only $15 a month. So it's not that much. I recommend this game completely. But if you're not willing to get hopelessly addicted and lose 3000+ hours to this game don't play it, becuase you will get addicted.			",86,5,3,7,5,0,4

												I've been playing EVE Online for nearly two years now and, barring the occasional downtime, the game still feels as engaging as it did when I first started playing it. A vast ocean of player-driven and NPC-aided content ensures that one has a choice of engaging in PvP, PvE, exploring the immense backstory and universe of EVE, simply wandering the galaxy, hanging out in a station trading, or even mining an asteroid belt to your heart's content(although it is worth noting that nobody, *nobody,* is ever safe from PvP!) However, if you lack patience and the willingness to wait and train for a long period of time before being able to enter high-level engagements, or have an issue with sharp difficulty curves and the borderline-necessity of repeatedly losing ships and investments as a learning experience, then this game is not for you. You will be shot. You will die. You will lose hundreds of millions in a stupid mistake. But you have the patience to laugh off the loss and go at it again, then you will have fun doing it.

												Honestly, This game is in a league of its own. North of 4000 hours in, and I'm far from being tired of it, which is quite the achievement.You could call it a ""space MMO"", but lumping it in with other MMO's is a disservice, quite frankly. What makes me say this?Well, lets start off like this: Space is big. Huge. Mindbogglingly vast. You have all of this entire star cluster (and a second one) to explore. Conquer. Do whatever you want, literally; you can build stuff, blow stuff up, explore, scam, trade on markets, heck, make a T-Rex your mascot and go around spamming memes if you want.Market PVP? Check. Industrial PVP? Check. Good old-fashioned ship-to-ship combat using missiles, lasers, antimatter blasters, and artillery cannons? CHECK!!!And the fact that it's all single shard means that whatever you do affects everyone. None of that instanced BS in parallel realms that you find with other MMO's - If you go out and blow up someone's space station, you could legitimately throw the balance of power off between the ingame player coalitions in that region, if not on a larger scale. The story is entirely player-driven, and you can interfere with developer-driven-events if you so choose - for example, the leader of one of the NPC Empires was chosen by a player tournament, and at the ceremony, other players were noted for their support/opposition of the proceedings, and all of this is now official lore.And, of course, the hundreds upon hundreds of possible ships. You like fast small ships with missiles that fly like X-Wings? Check. Big lumbering battleships that tank for days, and have slow-tracking turrets that will obliterate something when they hit? Check. Something in-between? Guaranteed it's there.The F2P model does lock out capital ships, and advanced hulls (cloaky ships, interdictors, covert ops). But having played with a restricted character as well, I can safely say that you don't really need those either, as the meta is currently focused around cruisers and destroyers (read: fast kitey doctrines), and generally trends towards making the most out of the least expensive possible hulls. There are exceptions, but those are used by niche groups that don't generally take on newbies.Recommendation: Play it. It's free to try out(!!!), you can do 95% of the ingame content as a free player, and once you get the hang of it, upgrade to a subscription if you want to try those 5% things! The game can be quite unforgiving of mistakes, and is a very tough nut compared to most other games, but I can safely say it's worth the time, and likely one of the easiest games to get sucked into if you have a love of science fiction.

If you've never played now is the best time ever since it allows a free to play option.

												""The moment I dread most is having to explain what EVE is when asked about games I play""I don't think I could ever reccomend a game more: But there are a few things you need to understand.I've been playing EVE since 2009, (although I've only recently been able to use my old account on Steam, because of the introduction of the new launcher), and I don't think I've ever had more hours pooled into any game in my life.EVE is essentially a close-to-no-rule sandbox multiplayer game, with all of the goods and bads (goods) that come with that.EVE is also an extremely complex game of details that makes the Clausewitz engine games look weak.Still though: it's not hard. It's brutal, without a doubt, but not necessarily hard, and it's equally brutal to everyone.EVE doens't have safe zones (besides the interiors of NPC stations), although there are systems of crime and punishment, and law enforcement does exist in the areas refered to as High Security (HiSec) space.Rather than having NPC merchants, EVE uses real resources produced and products manufactured by real players, which are then marketed or used by, you guessed it: players.Everything from the ships flown, to the structures in space built (excluding the aformentioned NPC stations found in HiSec and LowSec space) are sourced from real people, meaning they have value you won't find in other games.Every ship (and structure) in eve is highly customizable, with extremely few limitations.PvP in EVE is probably the most rewarding experience I've ever had in any game. Period.PvE is a nice break from the stress, but can also be extremely exciting if done for high reward (and high risk).Mining isn't my cup of tea, but I can see the appeal. Great for people who like numbers and low stress situations (until you blow up).Industry is very fun in my opinion, despite lacking much interactive content; It's what I do, but I get my inputs from blowing things up and picking up the parts instead of shooting space rocks. Something about pressing the ""Deliver Order"" button is super nice.To be honest though, I really don't think I can properly explain this game. Just give it a shot, and brace yourself for something... Different.If you need any assistance or have questions, feel free to hit me up ingame at Aetran Molou.			",63,8,0,9,11,0,16

												Downloaded on Steam mainly to write this review.So, first mistake most people make when approaching EVE is they look at it like a generic game. This is no game, this is a second life. A chance to be who and what you want all while flying some beautiful ships (or in the case of some reviewers your Pod/space).Have I done mining? Yeah, have 4 alts just for that. Have I done PvP? Yes, high, low, and null. Mission running is a nice break from running sites for PvE and can make you some good ISK (in game money).Are noobs constantly being screwed over? Only if stupid enough to accept duel requests or loot something that tells them (and they have to acknowledge) will allow EVERYONE to attack them no matter the security status of the system (suspect flag). Also falling into that category are people who jump into low/null/wormhole space because ""There's better ore/sites there"", join faction warfare without knowing how to PvP properly, carry everything they own with them, afk in space, or allow someone to talk them into going into low/null space with them.Your actions dictate what happens to you in game. Want help learning how to survive in EVE? Look for a corp that is focused on what you want. Want to build stuff, find an indy corp. Want to kill stuff, talk to a PvP corp. If all else fails, see about getting into EVE University, they'll sort you out.Again, if you're stupid enough to do any of the aforementioned stuff. YOU DESERVE TO DIE.Welcome to EVE, prepare Uranus!			",47,7,1,18,14,0,12

												I expected another MMO that took your money and gave you basic gameplay like every other MMO has with no originality or differenece maker. Let me tell you from experience it certainly can stand on its own. This game may be difficult for newbies to learn, but is worth it. They always say EVE has a learning CLIFF not a learning curve. Once you get past that the game can be A LOT of fun. One thing I did enjoy is, if you dont have friends that play it essentially can be played alone. Not as easy when you go lone wolf but its still a lot of fun and can keep you busy. The game has MANY ships you learn to fly and very unique and large skill tree and skill learning system. This also a game you can essentially play for a few minutes and then get off while your character still learns new skills (if you have it in queue that is). If you do have friends that would like to play this or do, this game can suck A LOT of your time so be ready to be committed and have a lot of time on your hands.

												I love the fact that you have an MMO in outer space, I just didn't think space was this ♥♥♥♥ing boring!!!!  With the new tutorials they have in place figuring out the game is pretty straight foward and easy, learning curve wasn't that bad for me,  making money is fairly easy, but you have too in order to afford anything, my god the market is way out of whack for new players.  I mean I made 20 million credit pretty easy, but I need like 400,000,000 credit for the ship I would want, I mean you literally have to have played this from launch to be in the upper tier and without help it would literally take you almost a year to get into that game, I mean if you want to pirate with a lesser ship you could probably do that in a few weeks, but frankly I think the combat is boring, mining is boring.  I was really hoping to like this, it is unique but def not for everybody.			",108,6,3,24,3,0,22

												Downloaded on Steam mainly to write this review.So, first mistake most people make when approaching EVE is they look at it like a generic game. This is no game, this is a second life. A chance to be who and what you want all while flying some beautiful ships (or in the case of some reviewers your Pod/space).Have I done mining? Yeah, have 4 alts just for that. Have I done PvP? Yes, high, low, and null. Mission running is a nice break from running sites for PvE and can make you some good ISK (in game money).Are noobs constantly being screwed over? Only if stupid enough to accept duel requests or loot something that tells them (and they have to acknowledge) will allow EVERYONE to attack them no matter the security status of the system (suspect flag). Also falling into that category are people who jump into low/null/wormhole space because ""There's better ore/sites there"", join faction warfare without knowing how to PvP properly, carry everything they own with them, afk in space, or allow someone to talk them into going into low/null space with them.Your actions dictate what happens to you in game. Want help learning how to survive in EVE? Look for a corp that is focused on what you want. Want to build stuff, find an indy corp. Want to kill stuff, talk to a PvP corp. If all else fails, see about getting into EVE University, they'll sort you out.Again, if you're stupid enough to do any of the aforementioned stuff. YOU DESERVE TO DIE.Welcome to EVE, prepare Uranus!			",47,7,1,18,14,0,12

												Don't approach this like a normal MMORPG. It isn't World of Warcraft in space.The appeal of EVE is in the interaction with other players. You have a sandbox and the tools to create your own stories. The game is PVP, PVP in whatever you do. Don't forget this.You can engage in PVP market trading without ever undocking and make billions of ISK. You can engage in PVP politics without even logging into the game. EVE exists in a single universe populated with real people. Make friends, make enemies.			",250,51,12,39,26,5,50

												EvE is a very unique game. It is a sandbox, with doors open towards every path you want to take, and that can be anything really as the training, the gameplay, and the people that keep you company are just some of the things that you can decide. The market is phenominal as it is a player run economy, with inflation, prices increasing and decreasing all depending on the supply and demand of PLEX as well as the in-game items/materials. I'm not saying this game is for everyone, but that doesn't mean that everyone shouldn't try it out as there is a free 14 day trial (could be 20 if you have a friend) which allows you to try out the game even if it is simply to admire the amazing graphical design that it has. Also, the fact that you can pay for your monthly fee through in-game currency is freaking epic!! ",152,20,2,11,12,1,19

Oh, that's just the tip THATSWHATSHESAIDof the iceberg ;). So much more in this game, and it's now got an F2P model!For those who by divine intervention of the Heathen & Pagan Gods, namely Odin the All-Father, have been spared the firey death of playing No Man's Sky, well good job. I salute you. I nearly burned my PS4 over that.Basically EVE online is a space MMO/Sandbox. For those that've played Star Trek Online, it's similar. If you like Sci-Fi space games play it.

												EvE. I really can't recommend this game to anyone. Its an outstanding game forcing you to think every decision on multiple levels. If you're an explorer and you take a trip to 0 security space get ready for one hell of a ride filled with lots of planning, lots of complex warping (not from gate to gate), lots of scanning. Get ready to run like hell from pirates if they appear. The risk is big but death is avoidable, don't buy the whole ""you'll die a lot in this game"" thing. You'll die a lot if don't think like a pirate and don't plan a safe trip. The ""free"" portion of the game is very limited, it's made to get new players into the basics and thus subscription is mandatory.EvE is probably the only game where when you're not playing, you're digging into articles about fitting, exploration guides and pvp videos. EVE IS NOT NEW PLAYER FRIENDLY. It is hardcore af and you'll have to get on it's level fast if you want to feel the thrills...and man are those thrills addictive. All in all, stay away from EvE if you want to stay sane and not addicted. Hop on the EvE train if you want an adrenaline fix, headaches from overthinking a jump and the sensation that you just conquered the world.			",9,0,0,1,0,0,0

I once played the game couple of years back and the monthly payments were alright for the time, but in these times, I would not say it's worth it.

												There is a reason Eve Online is aka Spreadsheets in Space, these are required to keep track of information whether you are a miner/industrialist or wormhole explorer or even pve'r.  The thing I love about this game is the amount of detail involved in almost everything, and keeping track of everything and preventing information overload can be challenging.  This game can only be recommended to the experienced MMORPG players in the crowed, and at that not to ones that have played strictly care bear types of games.  By background was from Everquest pre care bear days, back in the late 90's and early 2000's when dying meant you could lose all of you stuff.  That is an important distinction since in Eve the exact same can happen but with even worse odds of not recovering your gear.In Eve your ships can get very expensive very fast, faster than the isk curve can keep up with.  Most will just buy a couple plex which they exchange on the market for the in game currency isk which is used in all purchases on the in game market.  This will allow them to fund one or two characters for the first little while to get the needed gear, unless you like grinding the old fashioned way for isk.  Most new players though will have issues with this since they want to get into the action right away, that just usually does not happen, unless you have connections already in the game world.The learning curve is another element of the game that puts most people off, it is with out a doubt the worst in any game ever, yeah including old EQ.  You will be spending long hours reading forums and wikis trying to glean out every last bit of information that you can, especially after losing a few ships and wondering what is wrong with your fits.And keep in mind after the 21 day free trial your now paying for the privelage of being all the older players favorite new ganks, because that will happen unless you are lucky enough to fall into a good player run corp.  If you are an experienced player and love having to live a game in order to be in the top and receive the just rewards then this game is for you.  You understand that all of this can happen, but with lots of patience and at least 6 months to a years worth of skill training on your character.  Enjoy!			",4,0,0,5,4,0,3

												The learning cliff is a little less steep now days with the latest ""New player experience"" which is fully voiced and very easy to follow. The career agents that give you a taste of what you can do in Eve Online now set you up with a good selection of ships and a small nest egg. After that you are on your own still, but that will always be the nature of Eve. I recommend staying in your starter NPC corporation and learning from the people there. You will find that all 12 starter NPC corps have emmbers who have been playing the game for an extended period of time and most of these people are still there because they like to help new players, or ""newbro's"" as they are often called.Don't start playing Eve just to fly a huge Titan or something silly like that, it's not gonna happen without YEARS spent training the skills required.Do start playing Eve for the deepest, most complex Massively Multiplayer game that exists today. Do start playing Eve for the ONLY Massively Multiplayer game where failure HAS a concequence.And finally Do start playing Eve for a game where everything you accomplish will have meaning to you.

												Ohh... Eve Online. The game is just fantastic, graphics, planets, ships everything is so detailed, but also runs on older computer which is very good.Skill system is bit off, real time skill queue is, in my opinion, bit off, cause it gives huge advantage to older players. For example to train for Tier 2 ships or marauders takes insane amount of time, about 2 months to fly and another 2 to fit it properly. Few skills can take up to 60 days in queue. To bring new players SP system should be changed, but also keep the advantage for older players, because of the dedication and time they have put in. I have around 5 million skill points which is around 4-5 months of gameplay.PvP, PvE: pvp system is fantastic yet very lethal if you don't know what you are doing, good pvp fits takes months to train yet it's fun in its own way. I have run few wormhole ganks and gatecamps in low sec and null sec so unfortunately I don't have enough experience running pvp fleets. In the other hand PvE system is quite routinuous and can get boring in some point.High sec ganks and newbie killers. First of all I would say this game has one the most mature playerbase I've seen, but also one of the most agressive and stupid one. There are countless of corps which hunt new players in high sec, which is meant to be safe, because it's ""fun"" and it's a problem with sandbox games. But in the end I will continue playing and highly recommend this game if you are looking to spend some time and like sandbox games.			",9,1,0,1,0,0,1

												EvE Online is an interesting and truly unique MMO. With it's passive skill system, the game moves away from the need to always be online and always be working towards a goal. Anything on a schedule beyond simply updating your skill queue is something you decide on investing in or not.Since it's originaly incarnation in 2004, the game has improved steadily. From moving to DirectX9 and retiring it's old DirectX8 engine (with rumors of DX11 and tesselation coming in the future), to improvements in tutorials and reacting to player feedback, CCP proves they are willing to work with the game on the notion that it's shared by the playerbase.All ships in EvE Online tend to have a role that the ship excels at. In one case you may have a frigate that you'd assume to be not worth your time, but they serve a vital role in fleet fights and have numerous advantages over bigger, heavier ships.EvE Online does require a monthly fee, but it is possible, if you get yourself established well enough, to pay for your subscription by buying in-game representations of 30-days for your account. However, like all items in EvE, they are subject to scams, thefts, destruction and so on which means that you'll have to be on your toes when dealing with trades and transport.EvE Online is hands-down my favorite MMO. Others have tried, but none have come close to the sense that you, as the player, get to carve out not only what's going on in the universe, but what your place is in it.			",655,134,32,120,86,3,104

												Yeah so if I could get my money back please. Since playing I've lost my wife, my kids, my ability to shave and I can't even remember the last time I looked at water.The issue mainly is that you see it on Steam and think it's a game, it isn't. It's like taking the blue pill you soon realise trivial things like human interaction, work and bills matter little as you are have now established that EvE is reality and everything else is unimportant.The depth of this game is ridiculous from the second you start character creation to the first duel offer 10 seconds later you will be asking yourself how did I miss this gem. Just give it a go if you have a few years free you won't be disappointed.WARNING THIS ""GAME"" WILL SERIOUSLY DAMAGE YOUR RELATIONSHIPS.			",103,10,0,27,17,1,17

Want to go around killing as you please, dystroying any one that comes across you path, go straight ahead. or if you feel like being a good guy or a minner the choices are endless. Finer points to the game like massive wars, spying, lying, espionage, politcs, and the way of life it brings all add to the overall greatness of ths game. Backed by amazing graphics, real breathing market and one of the largest sandbox servers in the world, Eve has anything you could ever ask for.Heads up though, Eve also has one of the steepest ""learning curves"" in a game I have ever played.

												Not a game I can stay away from for longer than a few months. The developers are incredible, the community is like no other game I've ever seen, and the gameplay is unique. After playing EVE Online for a while I tried to find other enticing space-simulator games but none so far have even gotten close to being better than EVE Online.The first time I played I started a corporation and although I wasn't ""awoxed"", one of my members had a large bounty on his head which caused bounty hunting coorporations to declare war on us. We sustained great losses and in the end ultimately had to disband. I stopped playing for a few months after that and have been on and off since.This is not a game for casual gamers, this is an experience for gamers who want to be apart of a community.

												One hell of a learning curve, but this is one MMO where you can actually make a difference, and it feels like an actual world you live in and not a theme park.Biggest advice I could give would be to join a player corporation. Most of them will take new players and will help you learn how to play the game.I'd also say that you should not necessarily get caught up in the hype about the wars you always hear and try to join a ""null-sec"" corp right away (null-sec being the incredibly dangerous player owned areas of space). That part of the game is a lot different than high or low security system space and isn't for everyone. It's essentially like going to ""ultra hard"" mode. There are ships and weapons which can only be used in that space and the tactics are a lot different, but on the flip side it does mean you get to be a part of some huge battles which is fun.

												Game isn't nearly as difficult as people claim it is.  I've known about this game for nearly a decade but never tried it because I was put off by claims it was difficult and needed massive spreadsheets to play.  Thats complete nonsense and the game is easy to get into so long as you are capable of reading instructions, have the not so common ability to use google, and have some semblence of social skills.  I started out with nothing about 3 months ago and I'm now an active member in a corporation managing manufactering and resource production whilst also particitpating in doctrined fleets.  Then again I do have the advantage of not being borderline ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.  Don't listen to numbskulls claiming it isn't new player friendly.  The game doesn't hold your hand or coddle you thats all, and thats how all games should be.  You will die alot in the beginning unless you are a pansy who just hides in high sec, but once you do you will learn how to let go and move on.  Try new things right from the start.  Run to lowsec and attack someone for the hell of it, jump head first into a wormhole throwing caution to the wind.  Hell I went wormhole exploring my fifth day in and got ganked, but the dude was so impressed that I had the balls to jump in there and take risks despite being new he sent me 50m and a corp invite.  Nothing is safe and thats what I like about it.  Your belongings have real value since at any time you could lose them with one false move and you have no one to blame but yourself.  Give this game a go if you want a challenging game that has the best emergent gameplay I've seen yet. 10/10 buying 2 more accounts to maximise PI and mining output.Update:  To all these recent reviews about how the game is too punishing and how its not fair people gank you and you lost your stuff.  Boo hoo if you had read even one guide before starting the game you would have known that was going to happen.  The first thing every single guide tells you is not to fly what you can't afford to lose.  Thats not a suggestion, thats a rule.  Occassionally I'll fly an expensive ship that like a battleship and lose it but I took the risk and knew the consequences so I move on and work towards another.  Learn how to produce your own ships and fittings, thats what I do.  When you become self sufficient losing items seems like nothing when you got tons in storage and many more in production.  With my 2 accounts I can produce more then enough ships and isk to pvp all day without crying about a few blown up ships.  Its not even that hard or time consuming.  Its not like you have to grind skills you can leave them for a month to level on their own, and the game literally throws mountains of isk at you.Don't give the game a thumbs down because you failed to grasp the simpliest of concepts it introduces and thus are butthurt when it chews you up and spits you out.  Its not the games fault you were too scared to experiment and ended up mining 100 hours in a venture then quiting because you were bored.  This is why there aren't any decent modern mmo's.

Thats complete nonsense and the game is easy to get into so long as you are capable of reading instructions, have the not so common ability to use google, and have some semblence of social skills.  I started out with nothing about 3 months ago and I'm now an active member in a corporation managing manufactering and resource production whilst also particitpating in doctrined fleets.  Then again I do have the advantage of not being borderline ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.  Don't listen to numbskulls claiming it isn't new player friendly.  The game doesn't hold your hand or coddle you thats all, and thats how all games should be.  You will die alot in the beginning unless you are a pansy who just hides in high sec, but once you do you will learn how to let go and move on.  Try new things right from the start.  Run to lowsec and attack someone for the hell of it, jump head first into a wormhole throwing caution to the wind.  Hell I went wormhole exploring my fifth day in and got ganked, but the dude was so impressed that I had the balls to jump in there and take risks despite being new he sent me 50m and a corp invite.  Nothing is safe and thats what I like about it.  Your belongings have real value since at any time you could lose them with one false move and you have no one to blame but yourself.  Give this game a go if you want a challenging game that has the best emergent gameplay I've seen yet. 10/10 buying 2 more accounts to maximise PI and mining output.Update:  To all these recent reviews about how the game is too punishing and how its not fair people gank you and you lost your stuff.  Boo hoo if you had read even one guide before starting the game you would have known that was going to happen.  The first thing every single guide tells you is not to fly what you can't afford to lose.  Thats not a suggestion, thats a rule.  Occassionally I'll fly an expensive ship that like a battleship and lose it but I took the risk and knew the consequences so I move on and work towards another.  Learn how to produce your own ships and fittings, thats what I do.  When you become self sufficient losing items seems like nothing when you got tons in storage and many more in production.  With my 2 accounts I can produce more then enough ships and isk to pvp all day without crying about a few blown up ships.  Its not even that hard or time consuming.  Its not like you have to grind skills you can leave them for a month to level on their own, and the game literally throws mountains of isk at you.Don't give the game a thumbs down because you failed to grasp the simpliest of concepts it introduces and thus are butthurt when it chews you up and spits you out.  Its not the games fault you were too scared to experiment and ended up mining 100 hours in a venture then quiting because you were bored.  This is why there aren't any decent modern mmo's.

												The best virtual-life experience out there. That comes with ups and downs, which I will try to point out throughout the review.First of all, it's a sandbox game so do not expect to have a clear purpose in your EVE-life. There are so many different careers you can choose from that you won't ever fully explore and know them all. It could take anything from months to years to fully understand and master every aspect of the game (and I'd be happy to laugh at anyone claiming that). One of the most hilarious reviews I've read about this game was ""I think I'm starting to get it"" by a person with 1400+ hours on record (it should be somewhere in the reviews section). The thing is, it might not be too far from the truth. There's always something new to learn about the game, something interesting to read about. I always find myself having a few tabs open in my browser with articles, guides, forums, all related to the game, trying to stack up on knowledge to better understand different aspects of the game. However, don't think that you can't enjoy the game early on. I've been enjoying it from day one and having fun ever since. And if you don't like what you're doing anymore, just drop it and start doing something else. It's best to try out different things so that you can find out what you like doing most; and you can always come back to what you were doing, it's a sandbox, remember?Second of all, it's a complex game that requires seriousness, patience and attention, to say the least. There's times for just having fun and not caring what's going to happen, and there's times when you have to be dead serious and can't even blink, all while your heart's racing to a -maybe even- dangerous level. There's times when you're wandering solo in dead silence, looking for that big prize that you're hoping to find before anyone sees you and there's times when you're running in a big fleet, everyone hooked up to a voice chat and you feel the adrenaline rush of being in the same space as dozens, maybe hundreds or (why not?) even thousands of other ships and you're just stunned by the view and scenery, trying to keep up and make the best of it while also making it back alive.Third of all, it's all run by the community. From the ship you're flying to the modules you've eqquiped it with to the very market you use everyday and all the way to the stations (and lately citadels) that you're docking up into. It's all planned, constructed and placed by the community (except the initial NPC stuff already in-place of course, but that's only a small portion of it); and let's not forget it is all priced by the community as well, as the market is as realistic as real life markets in many if not most aspects, always being influenced by events and everything that's happening in the EVE universe. And there's also the aspect of corps, alliances and coalitions, which along with everything said above merge into the best game stories I've ever read and could fill out whole books. (oh, wait, it already has!).All in all, it's a unique game that gives a unique feeling and experience which cannot be found in any other game. Its harsh world and complexity make it a hard game, but the satisfaction you get for acomplishments definitely makes it worthwile. That being said, it's not a game for everyone. However, everyone should try it out and if you remember to keep an open mind, who knows, maybe you'll find that it was the best decision in your gaming life.Pros:unique experience you can't find anywhere elsegreat mechanicshigh complexityrun by the communitystunning views and scenerystory rich (mostly made by the community)Cons:time consumingsubscription-based (can be ruled out by paying with in-game currency)can seem harder at firstRated 10/10			",84,12,1,12,9,1,10

												Do you like Mining? Do you like Piracy? Do you like being paranoid of everything around you?With a giant game area, EVE online presents many... Well actually, the game doesn't have much in the way of exploration, making money kind of burns down to having a bigger hold for ores. Or, you could join a mercanary group and participate in a hundred wars at the same time. If you're just plain unlucky, soon after you join a random person will slap a ten million ISK bounty on your head for no reason (saw this happen.)I played for a bit, and most people I met and chatted with would talk about switching to their pirate accounts where they just trolled people who were in the wrong place at the wrong time. If you attempt to take a risk, expect a pirate to come by and smash your ship for no reason.I'm quite used to losing everything over and over in troll-based games that'd never make it on Steam, and only left EVE after getting back into KSP, where the realistic physics simulation has ruined my ability to accept space physics in EVE.I do not recommend this game for one simple reason: There are no consequences for trolling so long as you have two different accounts, one for trolling and one for supplying the troll character with items he can no longer get after blasting every ship he runs across.

												God, so many people coming in F2P and complaining about ""PAY TO WIIIIIN!"" ""SO BOOOORING"". EVE is not for everyone. This game has been subbed-based for YEARS. It has an incredible in-game economy and a political system like no other MMO. This game takes A LOT of time and dedication. I couldn't get into EVE. It takes too much effort. But if you are interested and you are willing to put that effort and time and dedication into the game, this is the most unique MMO out there. It's an incredible experience and an incredible game. There are many things you can do. Combat, trade, exploration, mining, piracy. You can roll solo or with a small group or with a giant corp and depending on what you do you will have vastly different opportunities and experiences. It's a huge galaxy out there.Expect to spend months of your time in this absolutely gigantic game. It takes a while to take off.If you're expecting to jump into an F2P game and fly around in giant ships pew-pewing away - this is not that kind of game. And if you're going to ♥♥♥♥♥ about that - you are not welcome here.			",261,27,3,51,46,1,64

I loved this game as many times as i played it and i%I played it . I still love this game and there is no other that bringsa smile on my face just thinking about EVE.There never will be better one then EVE and only if you make a newer EVE it still will be ever and only EVE.I love this game.

												This should be renamed ""The waiting game: MMO style"".Combat: click and wait.Minining: Click and wait.Skill Training: Click and wait.Building: Click and wait.BP Research: Click and wait.Travel:: Click and wait.Everything you do in the game is: Click and wait, except ""immediate"" selling/buying.If your idea of fun is watching paint dry, you'll love this game.  Of my time in Eve, I'd say 300 of my 475 hours is travel time.Don't bother playing this. There is a game mechanic where alliances specifically target new corps (guilds) in ""high security"" (SUPPOSED to be safe) space. These groups of people exist for no other reason to grief as many people as possible.I'm not talking a few gankers here and there. I'm talking multiple massive fleets of players that take great joy in killing everyone trying to get to the major trading hubs.The game is moderatly fun, if you enjoying TONS of waiting, but the community is the worst of the worst bottom feeders. Griefers have ran everyone else off. Even with the new steam F2P mode, the griefers outnumber the non-griefers 10 to 1, they fight over who gets to destroy that starter frigate or mining vessel first.  And I've noticed a massive decrease in player population starting around Jan 17th or so.It's call ""War Dec"" (Declaring war allows them to gank anyone in your corp/alliance at will right in front of the ""cops"" face.) And they specifically target guilds that are PvE only.If you're enjoying getting repeatedly killed by people who've had 10 YEARS to gear up and skill up and gain PVP experience... Then this is the game for you.  Oh, and when you die, you can easily lose *everything*.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Reviewing MMO's is hard. Having people pay attention to those reviews is even harder. Yet I'm going to write one anyway:EVE is around 10 years old now and is showing no signs of slowing down. If anything, it is (probably) still expanding its player base. The reasons for this are many, but one thing that can certainly be said is that it is unlike most other MMO's out there due to the fact that it is a ""sandbox"" rather than ""themepark"" MMO. The latter-type of MMO, which includes most other MMO's out there (World of Warcraft being the most obvious), EVE is not about dungeon crawling or loot hunting or any of that sort of stuff. The ""sandbox"" of this game allows for an absurd, and honestly frightening, amount of options for how to play the game. There's PvE content for solo and groups, though admittedly this is easily the weakest and least interesting part of the game. The PvP environment is, on the other hand, arguably the most vibrant and violent of any other MMO out there. Fight scale from arranged one on one duels to massive battles involving thousands that have been noted by gaming and even mainstream news outlets on more than a few occasions. And then there's the market, full of complexity and opportunity in equal measure.In other words, this game isn't very good solo. It's far better in groups and even moreso if you choose the right one for what you are wanting to do in the game. It is worth noting however that these groups have a double-edge to them not usually found in other games. Aside from hacking the game, RMT, and stuff like botting, there are virtually no rules on player content. This means theft and scamming are perfectly legal, which scares people away from this game but the reality of it is that you can only really get conned if you are careless or too trusting of bad people. I personally have never fallen for a scam, though some of the cleverer ones almost grabbed me early on. People can't just go into your hangars or wallet and steal all your stuff: You have to either put it in a place accessible to other people, like Corporate (Guild/Clan) hangars (think Guild Banks in WoW), or you have to actually hand your stuff over to someone else without realizing you are falling for a trick.The other side of this lack of rules is that this game has a metagaming scene unlike any other. The individual scams and steals from hapless victims, but the corporations and alliances have full-blown intelligence networks. Espionage is a very real thing here, and the great heists you may have heard about where someone steals gigantic amounts of stuff are, more often than not, agents of another group specifically sent to spy and eventually take everything that isn't nailed down. Or it can be a high-ranking officer who decides to rage-quit and just steal stuff on the way out. Eiher way you only will personally lose stuff if you allow it to happen. This game does have flaws. The potential for theft with few consequences creates a culture of paranoia that some might find really annoying to deal with. The spaceship gameplay is often boring, with the PvE content being the worst offender. The public channels, like every other MMO, are often filled with idiots who just spam garbage. The learning curve is notoriously high, and the sheer amount of things there are possible to do can easily overwhelm a new player. The game's skill training system, while good in that it lets a player make progress even while not playing the game, makes it take some time before you can truly get to where you want to be. And lastly, as with all MMO's, tedium and grindy activities are inevitable. This may be an MMO unlike most others, but it is still an MMO. You should think long about whether or not to jump into this game, because it  can become extremely difficult to pay proper attention to this game and others at the same time.But, I like it. If I was forced to play an MMO, it would be this one. So if this overlong review didn't make you flee, you can check out a free 21-day trial. Speaking of free, it is entirely possible, if you make enough in-game currency on a regular basis, this game can be a free-to-play MMO. Perhaps not for the first few months, but it is very possible, once you are established, to never have to pay real money for this game again. I haven't since early 2012. :3			",243,94,1,62,44,2,65

												The last great standing Titan from the old school original MMO's. E.V.E Online is a shining example of what an MMO can be. It has the deep skill and trait system with the open sandbox modern MMO's lack out right or fail to achieve in execution. Its well rounded and got a very social and skilled community. It's still going incredibly strong given its age and the Developers work tirelessly to add in new content on a shocking huge basis. They are keeping large aspects of it updated with modern gaming as well. Not over looking any aspect of their game engine. Its one huge server fitting 10,000+ daily average active players with little to no-lag. E.V.E Online is space based Pvp at its best. Yes, There are no manual dog fighting FPS style controls here but once you get used to their control system you will notice that less and less as you get drawn into the E.V.E gameplay. E.V.E works on a traditional stat and trait system not all that disimilar from older MMO's like SWG (Pre-C.U/NGE). This mix of skills and traits combined with your ship, ships bonuses and the equipment you choose to slot effects what kind of role you decide to play. Needless to say the many menus, massive game map, dozens of factions, ratings, reputation let alone the controls are pretty staggering at first. But you eventually find yourself growing comfortable with them.In E.V.E Online you can really do anything you can think of if you work hard enough at it. Are you the lone gun for hire jumping from system to system looking for work? Maybe your a power hungry warlord after total galactic domination? Or maybe your a Bounty Hunter searching for that right sum to retire on. The options in E.V.E Online are pretty vast and there is definately somthing for everyone.E.V.E Online has been around for 11 years and counting now and has never lost its momentium and I'm sure it will be around for many many years to come.E.V.E Online 11/11.

												This game has the worst F2P model I have ever seen. If you want to play this game you HAVE to have a subscription period. You have the option of not getting a subscription and not being able to use 99% of the equipment in the game because it is locked to only subscribers, so sure if you want you can put around in the worst ship in the game and get murdered ever 2.5 seconds if you want, but I do not know anyone on earth who would find that type of gameplay fun. Literally the MOST pay to win game ever. This game is full of PVP, there is no point in playing a game with this much PVP for free when free players are literally forced to never even be close to the power of paying players. To be honest I played this game back when it was a pay to play game and got extremely bored with it so I uninstalled it. When I heard it went f2p I figured I would give it a try again, but literally all of my ships can't be used anymore because the weapnons and crap I have are for subscribers only. Uninstalling this garbage again.			",111,31,0,26,21,1,7

												I've played Eve for about a year without downloading it via Steam, so I'm going to estimate I have around 200+ hours played overall. Eve is a strictly PvP oriented game, which can be either a great thing or a terrible thing, depending on what kinda game you're searching for. The vast majority of players are long time veterans and it's not very easy to venture into low-security or null-sec space and expect to kill NPC's or even mine without being ganked by a player who's years ahead of you in skill points and has vastly superior weapons and ships. Basically, in order to really do anything in this game, you have to join a corporation and get assistance from other players. Eve's playerbase is pretty cancerous, but like most MMOs, there's always groups of pretty amazing players who're catering to newer players and want to help newbies. I've been in two corps, both of which were very friendly and ran daily fleets. Overall, if you're looking for a game that's heavily PvP based, extremeley competitive, don't mind being killed by losers who have nothing better to do than gatecamp and gank, look no further. Also, the free-to-play version of Eve locks about a good 80% - 85% of the game's content, locking all mid-tier and high-tier ships, and most low-tier and beginner vessels. If you want full access, enjoy paying $12 a month for a subscription.			",36,2,0,9,0,0,1

I still wouldn't call this free to play. at best its an extended trial.If you are planning on playing this game cause its ""free to play"" dont bother.Edit: removed cant train skills, you can train level 1 and 2 but no further.

												awesome game. if you like action packed first person shooters this may not be the game for you. although pvp battles are very action packed, it can take quite a while to learn about them and to do well. the game is more strategy based with a heavy focus on industry.....such as ""boring"" mining of asteroids then manufacturing the ore into ships and modules to use for pvp or pve missions. the market/auctionhouse is definately the biggest/best out of any game out there. theres thousands of stations you can sell or buy goods at, with about 4 major trade hubs which have the largest volume.

												I've played EVE for 1300 hours, and I still consider myself a rock-bottom noob. As for instant gratification, sure, I've built a small fortune, collected powerful ships, and learned skills that allow me to do amazing things. But the real payoff will be in a year, or three years, or ten years, when that small fortune and those skills have blossomed into an empire, and I'm truly able to do anything I want. There aren't many games that let you plan ten years into the future while still enjoying every step along the way right now. (Lest you think I'm exaggerating, EVE went into Beta in 2003, and some members of my Corporation have been around since before the game went live).I won't repeat what others have said about the expansive universe, bruising large-scale PVP environment, emergent economy, and player-driven content. I'll just leave you with my ""big picture"" impression from so many hours in New Eden: EVE is a game of moments. I've hunted war targets in a fleet of 70 cruisers and destroyers. I've gotten lost so deep in wormhole space that I didn't know which way was up. Once, passing through a silent system on the fringes of high-security space, I passed a convoy of four freighters packing up and moving all the resources of an industrial corporation somewhere else. I spent a month in exile, living alone in a derelict Citadel long-since abandoned by the player who built it, while I mined and spent hours in research and industry. EVE truly is a game in which nearly anything is possible.I avoid making specific recommendations, since I don't know anyone else's preferences, but I hope this review encapsulates some of what makes this game so magical for me. Considering the new (and well-done) free-to-play model, it is worth investing a few hours or a few hundred hours.			",34,3,1,9,1,0,2

												recently i had posted a negative review due to the fact that the F2P model really isn't F2P, it's more of a F2T or free to try, but that shouldn't discourage people from giving the game a try. Honestly once i gave the game a real try I found alot of good things about the game. Balencing, player freedom, community, developer interaction, a deep deep DEEP level of management for every aspect of the game. PvP, PvE, PI, Industy, hell even shooting space rocks with lasers has a level of strategy to it. In the end I can't recomend this game enough to any player no matter what aspect of gaming you enjoy.			",114,7,0,19,10,0,12

												EVE Online is a game where I consistently see ""2000 hours played, thumbs down"" in the reviews.  Well, this game is amazing, atleast from a shear data standpoint.  Everything is on one server internationally (excluding China because of internet use laws) and every descision impacts the universe in some way.  I am not going to lie by saying this game is easy, its a hard game!  Also, the game discerns between the competent and incompetent people who play it.  Do not take this the wrong way, but if you want to be generally successful in this game, you gotta be competent, or follow orders well.  This game, like every game, has a darkside, but that darkside takes the form of certain player-bases rather than because of the game itself.  So I am gonna give this game what it deserves, my thumb up (because im only using one thumb).			",71,3,1,8,17,1,10

												EVE is a dark and cruel universe where everyone is out for their own gain, a universe where you need to be careful who you trust. In EVE, you can be an arms dealer/manufacturer, a miner, a researcher, you can be a pirate killing other players or holding their ships randsom, or you can lead thousands of other players to conquer space and be a politcal power unto yourself. The possibilities are endless.If you havn't tried it, get yourself a trail and see what you think. (If you contact someone who plays eve you can get an extended Trial). Eve requires a very specific type of player, someone with long term goals, who is self motivated, patient and understands that things will go wrong but you just have to push forward. Eve isn't like WoW or most of the other MMOs. You can't just grind to the highest level. No matter how big or powerful the ship you can field, there will always be people out there who can kill you.			",80,5,0,10,3,0,9

												Eve Online looks like it could be interesting; although - judging from what I've read - it's rather complicated (there's a lot to learn) and unforgiving (there are lots of trips, tricks, and traps for new players).I played this via a Steam free weekend promotion; however, the idea of paying a monthly subscription fee for a game, any game, does not interest me.Pay for a game once? Fine. Pay for a game forever? I don't think so.Nonetheless, if you are willing to pay a monthly fee, then it's worth giving this game a try.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is one of the only TRUE MMO available at the moment (maybe Perpetuum Online is in this category).It's a real, massive sandbox MMO where each of your action may have a repercussion in the entire universe. All of the free for all areas (called 0.0 sector or nullsec) are controlled by the players where battles and wars can happen to take control of those territories.But be careful, while the life can be quite easy in high level sectors, it becomes really dangerous to go in low level/nullsec sectors without a corporation (guild/clan in Eve) to protect you. It's a hardcore game where you can lose everything you've earned if you don't pay attention!Little plus: you can pay the subscription with ingame currency!			",318,36,15,30,37,8,48

The ship design is brilliant, the atmosphere and the look of the game is brilliant and it has a nice level of character as well. Don't be scared off by the subscription, you can dip in and out through a leniant subscription plan that you can just get rid of without any trouble! However i would get this game only if you're prepared to understand it and maybe take it slow, some areas (pirate filled, null sec etc.) will mess you up if you're not prepared or lost.

												This is a great game so far what a MASTERPIECE I've been playing just under a month. It requires getting many training manuals for your character (in-game) to train on the necessary skills for a desired path through the game. Basic training includes Jurry Rigging, Energy Weapons, Shields, and Scanners. These training manuals aren't free. They cost many ISK, which can be easily obtained through mining in the first part. There are sufficient enemies lurking about to keep the game interesting and the player aware of the environment, which is constantly changing based upon the players playing the game.

												EVE Online is a game where I consistently see ""2000 hours played, thumbs down"" in the reviews.  Well, this game is amazing, atleast from a shear data standpoint.  Everything is on one server internationally (excluding China because of internet use laws) and every descision impacts the universe in some way.  I am not going to lie by saying this game is easy, its a hard game!  Also, the game discerns between the competent and incompetent people who play it.  Do not take this the wrong way, but if you want to be generally successful in this game, you gotta be competent, or follow orders well.  This game, like every game, has a darkside, but that darkside takes the form of certain player-bases rather than because of the game itself.  So I am gonna give this game what it deserves, my thumb up (because im only using one thumb).			",71,3,1,8,17,1,10

												amazing game, it has a few bugs but i noticed that if you play the game directly and don't use steam most of the bugs go away. you can setup a eve login direct on thier website and then go to your program files to get the direct open link then use the login you link to your steam account on eveonline.com i am over 30 and have kids but so does most of the people that play eve. It is not a game dominated by little teeny boppers trying to act cool, it requires brains, it is by far one of the most difficult mmo's to learn which is great again as it deters little kids from playing. I will play sometimes 10-20 minutes a day or 12+ hours and it never gets old. This coming from someone that normally hates playing the same game week in and out. The ""corporations"" can't screw you by kicking you as all your assets stay yours and corps are kick hungry as they need the pilots to be sucessful. Unlike other games where if you farm alot the ""tribe"" will kick you to keep the resources for themselves.			",7,0,0,3,1,0,2

												ok, i see a lot of people on here whining about how much time it takes to get into a huge titan (or another legendary ship), and how long it takes to train skill to that level, and how much grinding it is. but when it comes down to it, this is a fun game. would i recommend it as a solo game? no. but if youre into being alone and not talking to a sole, then go for it. but at least give the game a try before you give it a bad rep. dont hop in and expect to be king big♥♥♥♥♥♥and be able to take on a battallion. it doesnt work like that. you have to earn that. hop on, do the training, join a corp that will help you get to your goals and give you guidance in the game. you'll meet some great people. you'll meet some total ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s. but for the most part, the community is chill and helpful, its fun making new friends, and its fun exploring space with a fleet. getting into wars. mining as a fleet even. so yea. i'd recommend this game.

												recently i had posted a negative review due to the fact that the F2P model really isn't F2P, it's more of a F2T or free to try, but that shouldn't discourage people from giving the game a try. Honestly once i gave the game a real try I found alot of good things about the game. Balencing, player freedom, community, developer interaction, a deep deep DEEP level of management for every aspect of the game. PvP, PvE, PI, Industy, hell even shooting space rocks with lasers has a level of strategy to it. In the end I can't recomend this game enough to any player no matter what aspect of gaming you enjoy.			",114,7,0,19,10,0,12

												Fun, really cool atmosphere and presentation. One of the most immersive sci-fi games I've ever played. Addictive gameplay, though much of it WILL be spent grinding/farming, at least at first as you try to build up enough ISK to enter the (immensely satisfying) PvP portions of the game. Yes the free version is highly restricted, but it's also free, and you can still be useful in large-scale PvP. You used to only be able to play for free for 2 weeks before they locked down your account, be grateful you have unlimited time now.It's tough to get into and learn the mechanics initially. If you have played similarly complex or more complex games before (X series, Dwarf Fortress, SS13, etc) you should get the hang of basically all of the important stuff within a couple of hours, though if not it will likely frustrate you for several days as you try to learn your way around everything. MOST IMPORTANT THING TO DO: Find and join a player corporation ASAP. The game is 100x more fun and more easy once you have people with knowledge supporting you and showing you the ropes to the more complicated parts of the game, and that is where this game's community really shines. You'll see recommendations to join big corps like EveUniversity for example, and while that's a good idea, almost any corp being helmed by at least a few experienced players is a safe bet as they will always be able to show you a lot of good info you'd miss, and typically smaller corps will be more personal and let you make friends more easily.Eve is the only MMO I've ever played more than 10 hours of and still felt like coming back for more, which is also why it's the only MMO I've ever subscribed to. I expect to spend a few hundred more hours playing at minimum, and recommend anyone try it out as well.			",47,2,0,6,6,1,1

Posted: March 6, 2014
												Home to world record breaking PvP battles in terms of player participation and monetary losses, Eve Online is a polarizing PvP centric MMO that players will either love or hate. Especially new players; most will hate it while some will love it. While commonly described as an MMO and sandbox, a more accurate description of Eve Online may be that it is an economic simulator wrapped in a political simulator with “roguelite” elements. While initially intimidating to new players and overall unforgiving, especially endgame, Eve Online’s developer CCP has created a meritorious masterpiece that has received a bounty of awards since its inception.The pace of the game will be off-putting to the majority of potential and new players. Unlike the majority of other MMO’s, acquiring new skills and abilities in Eve Online happens in real time; there is no experience to be gained by completing missions or killing rats (NPC’s). Training new skills will take a given amount of time in Eve online, but may be altered by changing a pilot’s attributes, by utilizing implants, which affect training time. Skills in Eve Online may take merely minutes to train or may take months. In ARPG’s, the point of the game is to acquire new, better, and rarer loot. During endgame, the new loot may augment the game in some facets, especially in the case of Path of Exile, but general gameplay elements (endlessly killing monsters) and those of the player’s chosen class largely remain the same creating stale, repetitive gameplay. The seemingly endless amount of skills to train in Eve Online means that there will almost always be something new to do in-game which functions similarly, yet superiorly, to loot in an ARPG.Gameplay in Eve Online is unique and very much different from other MMO’s; a player cannot move his/her ship using WSAD. Instead, you give commands to your ship, such as “orbit at 30 km,” “approach,” “warp to,” etc. However, you can still double click anywhere in space and your ship will head in that direction. This lack of freedom of movement will also be unappealing to many, but it allows for more tactical gameplay especially in PvP.PvP is heavily strategy based; an expensive ship can still lose to a relatively cheap one. PvP requires not only an in depth knowledge of what the function is of each ship, but the synergy amongst them. Also, it requires that a pilot know what modules to best fit his/her ship. However, a pilot’s individual mistakes and lack of understanding of the game may be made up for by other players, since PvP battle may consist of several thousand players.Time Dilation (TiDi), is heralded by CCP as a triumph to reduce lag in epic, expansive battles involving thousands of players. TiDi supposedly reduces the passage of time in the system, where the battle is occurring by up to ten percent as to reduce the stress on the server’s hardware. CCP decided to introduce this so that things players did in the battle would not be processed out of order. However, players who have experienced TiDi will report that actions that would have taken no more than ten seconds instead take between several minutes and up to twenty minutes to complete.Players are arranged into corporations, corporations may thus be arranged into alliances, alliances may thus be arranged into coalitions; all of which revolve around the economy. These arrangements allow for complex player run governments. These governments vie for control of various systems across the galaxy for the right to harvest various resources. Almost everything in-game can be made by players and then be sold on various markets. Unlike other MMO’s, such as World of Warcraft, the market in Eve Online utilizes a brokerage system akin to that of the stock market. CCP allows controversial actions such as extortion, thievery, espionage, and scamming in Eve Online. If a player were to do any of these in the majority of other MMO’s, he/she would be facing a permanent ban. These controversial actions fit well into the governmental arrangement of players as well into the occurrences of wars.The effects of PvP are wide reaching; they can be felt across the game. Such was the case of the costliest battle in Eve Online history; B-R5RB. Prices in in-game markets, especially those in the main trade hub in Jita, fluctuated more than normal allowing traders to secure large profits.PLEX (Pilot’s License Extension) in Eve Online is analogous to gold in the modern world; PLEX is what determines the worth of ISK. Also, much like gold, the value of PLEX fluctuates. PLEX is an in-game item equivalent to thirty days of game time. It can be bought in-game with ISK, hauled to various markets, and sold. It can also be purchased for twenty dollars. Comparatively, a one month subscription that is instantly activated on an account (not PLEX) costs fifteen dollars. While not free to play, it is more than possible to play Eve Online without having to open a wallet, although this will most likely be difficult in the first few months of a new player’s account.While not often addressed, Eve Online utilizes many roguelike elements and thus, may be classified as a roguelite. Ships may cost tens of billions of ISK and when they are destroyed in battle, the pilot lose ISK which translates to a few thousand dollars (USD) lost. Those ships take real time to make; potentially thousands of man hours to make and months of waiting for it to roll off of a production line. When they are destroyed, they are gone. There is no respawn; they no longer exist. The most expensive ships are titans, the Death Stars of Eve Online, are worth approximately three thousand dollars. When a ship is destroyed in Eve Online, a pod is ejected containing the pilot. Should a pilot be unable to escape in his/her pod and be killed in battle, he/she loses a clone which may have billions of ISK in implants. The most harrowing of losses, due to mistakes, involve pilots not updating their medical clones to retain the skill points they’ve trained. Should a pilot fail have failed upgrade the clone and be killed, he/she stands to lose millions of skill points which may have taken months to train.Anyone one can be ganked anywhere by other players. Whether a pilot actively engages in PvP or simply mines asteroids, he/she can be ganked. Systems in Eve Online are assigned a security status. Depending on the security status, the in-game NPC police force, known as CONCORD, may respond and aid the victim by attempting to destroy the aggressor.Players are most often drawn into the game by the epic, lurid tales they hear of massive battles, espionage, or betrayal. Eve Online is a massive game. While events do occur like these on a daily basis, they are rather uncommon. As a result, many players do not make it past the trial version or tutorial because of this realization, whatever or whoever made them decide to try Eve Online made no mention of the incredibly slow pace, or the unusual and very different gameplay style.Eve Online is not perfect; no game is. Developer CCP has claimed through its public relations that TiDi is indeed necessary and successful in its purpose. Despite these flaws CCP has done many things right. According to the Guinness World Records Gamer’s Edition 2014, the battle of 6VDT-H in Eve Online reached a total of 4,070 pilots fighting simultaneously, making it the largest PvP battle in history. CCP is one of the few MMO’s that welcomes immoral actions into its core gameplay. Eve Online is a game in which there is an incredible amount of depth as is evident by the way players produce goods, the manner that player governments who want to do so must hold their own territory in which the resources to do so reside, the in-game economy, and the strategies utilized by players in PvP. While the pace will be appalling to some, Eve Online warrants a try from all.			",112,26,4,12,10,0,17

												awesome game. if you like action packed first person shooters this may not be the game for you. although pvp battles are very action packed, it can take quite a while to learn about them and to do well. the game is more strategy based with a heavy focus on industry.....such as ""boring"" mining of asteroids then manufacturing the ore into ships and modules to use for pvp or pve missions. the market/auctionhouse is definately the biggest/best out of any game out there. theres thousands of stations you can sell or buy goods at, with about 4 major trade hubs which have the largest volume.

												I've played EVE for 1300 hours, and I still consider myself a rock-bottom noob. As for instant gratification, sure, I've built a small fortune, collected powerful ships, and learned skills that allow me to do amazing things. But the real payoff will be in a year, or three years, or ten years, when that small fortune and those skills have blossomed into an empire, and I'm truly able to do anything I want. There aren't many games that let you plan ten years into the future while still enjoying every step along the way right now. (Lest you think I'm exaggerating, EVE went into Beta in 2003, and some members of my Corporation have been around since before the game went live).I won't repeat what others have said about the expansive universe, bruising large-scale PVP environment, emergent economy, and player-driven content. I'll just leave you with my ""big picture"" impression from so many hours in New Eden: EVE is a game of moments. I've hunted war targets in a fleet of 70 cruisers and destroyers. I've gotten lost so deep in wormhole space that I didn't know which way was up. Once, passing through a silent system on the fringes of high-security space, I passed a convoy of four freighters packing up and moving all the resources of an industrial corporation somewhere else. I spent a month in exile, living alone in a derelict Citadel long-since abandoned by the player who built it, while I mined and spent hours in research and industry. EVE truly is a game in which nearly anything is possible.I avoid making specific recommendations, since I don't know anyone else's preferences, but I hope this review encapsulates some of what makes this game so magical for me. Considering the new (and well-done) free-to-play model, it is worth investing a few hours or a few hundred hours.			",34,3,1,9,1,0,2

												Great game- I returned after a 4 year break and am enjoying it. - Do not download through steam- Find a player to send you a trial inite. This gives you 21 days of game time for FREE!!!! - If you then upgrade your account to paid they will get 1.3bil in game isk, which if you go 50\50 will pay for anything you might need for the first couple of months - Can be pay to win with skill injectors, i bought about 24 plex to be able to get close to where i left off which is about £360 and saved months upon months upon months of training and not being able to fully enjoy the game. - The player community can be a hit and a miss, lots of scams though contracts, hauling, offering investment oppertunaties etc. If its too good to be true it usually is. - Be prepared to socialise, EvE is better when  played with a group of friends.

												Eve is not a game. It is pretty much an alternate universe. Eve is an ever-changing 24-7 world of politics and warfare, with you caught in the middle. The game starts with the new tutorial I haven't done. But it teaches you the controls. That's it. Everything else is up for you to learn. (just kidding, you look it up) Your life starts very peaceful, but from there you are at the steering wheel for what you want to do, and it is overwhelming. This is the stage people usually quit. They can't handle it. Don't. The moment you get over this hump this game will become your second life. This game has something for literally every player. There has to be something you like. Like exploring the unknown? Take an explorer frigate and go deep into wormhole space. Want to craft? Make billions by running your own industry startup. Want to slowly hate every other player in Eve? Mine. Want to PvP? Blob up with your friends and go destroy some poor guy's ship. Or do honorable 1v1 duels. Want to scam people out of all their money? You can do that too. Eve is a dangerous world. You will die. A lot. Even the best pilots die. Your ship is gone, and now your capsule is gone. Don't worry, you come back as a clone of yourself, ready to do it all over again. If you really want to get the most out of eve, you need to learn that death is a game mechanic.Eve Online has captured me like no other game. World of Warcraft? I love that game, but the moment I picked up eve I neglected it. The game sucked me in, and it will suck you in too, if you let it. So hit that ""play game"" button, and bring some open-minded friends. Or make your own. The game is all about having your friends and your own little corperation, begging to do something big. To change Eve forever in the vast political landscape. I recommend joining some nullsec corp (you'll learn what that is when you play) and having your own little safe pocket in the universe surrounded by your friends. This review is a mess, but my heart basically just spilled out onto the keys. Eve is my favorite game of all time, and it can be yours too. But don't download it on steam. Please, please don't download it on steam. Download it on the official website for gods sake. Steam integration sucks so bad. So, what I'm trying to say with this review, is play this game.

												I highly recommend EVE Online. It's hands down my favorite game. If you want to know why, continue reading and I'll tell you just SOME of the reasons.EVE Online is an amazing space sim/strategy/mmo/rpg/sandbox game. While it has it's issues just like any other game on it's grand scale, you will not unlock the game's true potential if you try to only play it by yourself.This game is DESIGNED around player community and interaction. Whether you're teaming up with friends to go take down a enemy player(s) or finding a new way to con someone out of their isk (the in-game currency), it's all about interacting with others. The game is so large and has so much depth it is something you can lose yourself in. Whatever your play style, EVE encourages you to pursue it. PVP (player vs player) is a big part of EVE, but so also is Industry and the Market. You choose your role, but could be a jack-of-all trades as well. I'll go more in depth into just some of the things that are possible in EVE Online.PvPIt's not just another lets get in some spaceships and go explode the enemy. There's actual strategy to this game. Imagine a RTS (Real-Time Stragety) game but you're playing as one of the ships in the fleet  and every other ship in the fleet is each played by a seperate player.Each person has a role in the fleet:-Dps (damage per second). These are the ones that attempt to kill enemy players.-Logi (logistics). The ""healers"". Those who repair shields and armor of friendly fleet ships.-Ewar (electronic warfare). Those who scramble enemy targeting so enemy logi can't repair allies, and dps can't target focus to kill your friendlies.-Tackle. These use ""warp scramblers"" which stops enemies from running away from a fight.There are hundreds (literally) of different ships with multiple uses as listed above. But there are more ships for other purposes not related to pvp (and related to other forms of pvp), and funny enough can even be used for pvp situations as pvp can/will happen anywhere in EVE Online.IndustryThere's a lot of different things included in this department. You could produce ships (yes, actually gather resources or ""minerals"" as they are called in game to build ship hulls), ship components, guns, launchers, lasers, pilot implants (increases your abilities for learning, fighting, building, etc), not to mention much more. You also have the ability to go MINE your resources via mining ships, barges, even capital mining ships (aka, a very, very, very large ship equipped with the ability to house actual mining ships and barges within itself and hold a lot of ore from mining). These are just a few things to mention for the industry.MarketThe market is booming, always, and has a constant supply and demand of many, many products. Ships, components, ammo, construction materials, resources, etc, etc, etc. If you've got a knack for playing the market you can, and will, make a lot of isk. There are frieghter ships in game that you can purchase, build, or ""acquire"" to even set up your own trading or courier service. But beware, as with anything else in EVE there's players looking to take what you work for. Which brings me to another trade.PiratesYou don't wanna work for what you gain? Like taking it from others? Well, EVE Online has a spot for you within it's massive galaxy as well. This kind of goes under pvp but is more specific as you are pvping, not for kills, but rather for looting of the kills.Overall, EVE Online has what you like to do in it. And even with all that I've mentioned, I haven't really scratched the surface of all that EVE offers you. PLUS, now EVE Online is FREE-TO-PLAY. Yes. So at least give it a try, and if you've somehow survived reading through all of my review, check my profile and look into joining the corporation (the ""guilds"" or ""factions"" of EVE Online) PANDEMIC HORDE. It's a new and old player friendly corp that will help you get started and enjoying EVE to it's fullest.			",146,36,7,20,15,0,9

												Don't get me wrong, I don't recommend it, but the game itself is great. I love it. The only thing is, its not free to play, its free to try. There are 2 types of players, alpha clones who play for free and omega clones subscribtion players. The restriction for alphas is huge. Only 1/4 of the games ships and skills are available and the skills that are available can't be upgraded to max lv. You can't use drones, omega's train skills faster and the list goes on. Here's a vid with all the ristrictions.

												I’ve never paid a monthly subscription to play a game, and don’t ever plan to. I’ve been having a lot of fun running missions as an alpha clone in the free version of EVE. I plan on checking out some of the epic arcs to see more of the game's story and background. There is actually quite a bit to do and see without having to pay to play. And Eve is a beautiful game. I’ve taken dozens of screenshots. I’d say it’s worth checking out as an alpha clone if you’re interested. It kind of reminds me of a point-and-click Elite Dangerous. From what I’ve seen so far, EVE has a much better mission system than Elite, and cooler things to see. Don’t judge this review by my playtime on steam. I play both EVE and Elite from their standalone launchers. I only downloaded it to write this review.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I highly recommend Eve.  I have over 225 days logged on Eve (outside of Steam) and the game doesn't get old.  The learning curve may seem high, but there are  plenty of resources  to help you learn.  My advice to new players is to join a newbie friendly corp and not to go solo until you have a decent understanding of the game otherwise you may get bored with the new player experience.  Also, don't run Eve through Steam, it'll make your life easier.			",22,0,0,2,2,0,2

												Without a doubt. I would recommend this game to anyone who wants more in an MMO.Pros:- Player created...'everything'. --From your story, to the crap you buy. There's very little that did come from the players- Stunning graphics.- Built for PVP from the ground up.- Massive PvP combat. --It may be a ""blob"" but where else are you going to fight some 300 other players at the same time.- Consequences for everything you do. --Because of the nature of this game. You can do pretty much anything to other players short of hacking their account. You can scam them, aide them, kill them. But, depending on your actions be prepared to either be praised or hunted.- No ""safe zone"". --Well, unless you count sitting in the space station.Cons:- Poor ship controls. --Ships do not handle like they do in Star Trek Online- No ""fast lane"" for character progression. --Skills are trained at a set rate that can't be hastened by actively playing the game. You could literally sit in the station for 4 years and be just as 'progressed' as someone who spent 4 years running around in the 'verse doing missions, mining, PVP, PVE combat. While many will see this as a plus. If you're looking to have your play time rewarded (ie you gained levels/direct character progression). You'll quickly be bored with this game; left with a feeling that you didn't really accomplish anything.All in all, a very fun game to play every once in a while. And those hours of playing definitely warrant a continous subscription. I can't wait to see how this game continues to evolve.			",159,15,0,37,17,0,26

												This is not the space flight sim affair the videos make it look like. Eve is a space management game without direct control over your ship. An accurate THIS IS EVE video should show an EVE Player with lots of open windows that display data you use to do basic operations most games manage to display in sector lists or on radars in seconds.The basic design of the game that of a box containing space with your ship and other limited objects in it that you right click on and choose an action to perform or select and click a button to do stuff too it. Despite the steep learning curve the game is very simple, in a hard to follow or understand kind of way. The hard to follow aspect is why such a simple idea hads a steep learning curve.It may be popular but its design is pretty poor and the steep learning curve comes from its interface being♥♥♥♥♥♥poor. I was really looking forward to this but the excitement drained out of me the second I realised this was a management game and not the space game all the movies and screenshots say it is. I will recommend 1 thing for those who get it, ignore the 4 career path tutorials, they are so badly explained you need a tutorial to understand those tutorials. You are far better off working it out your self. You may even have a better experience of the game than I had if you do that.Not recommended unless you like management games and nasty UIs.

The learning curve may seem high, but there are  plenty of resources  to help you learn.  My advice to new players is to join a newbie friendly corp and not to go solo until you have a decent understanding of the game otherwise you may get bored with the new player experience.  Also, don't run Eve through Steam, it'll make your life easier.			",22,0,0,2,2,0,2

												I do not use the Steam version but I am starting to slowly lose my life and get sucked into the fold. As an Alpha I can still do a lot of stuff into the game. Heck I already own 30 Thorax cruisers in my first week.I need to get my life back... the game is just sucking the life out of me, and somehow I am happy about it.			",165,3,1,14,10,0,14

												I don't have much to say about this game other than that I enjoyed it, despite not really expecting to. most games I think I will enjoy usually turn out boring and unengaging. Eve remains the only true MMO I have ever really enjoyed.a word of advice to prospective players reading this; the best way to enjoy eve online is to enter without any expectations. don't expect a fly-by wire space sim. don't expect deep NPC interaction. don't expect any of the eye candy in the action packed trailers tht CCP puts together (although it is a gorgeus looking game none the less).allow eve to impress you in it's own way. if it fails to do that within two weeks, then like so many others, the game is simply not for you.TL;DR rated N for 'not everyone'			",42,11,0,8,5,0,6

												This game is something else. I started it twice and quit twice. The learning cliff (not curve, CLIFF) is insane. In short it goes like this: here's a ship, f**k you. Still, the mature community, the amazing devs, the possibility to be a part of sci-fi and mmo history is something you can't find in any other game. I played this game through steam for 400ish hours, and on it's own client for another 1000 or so. It takes you in and never lets go. That is if you are brave enough to learn and lose stuff on the way. Don't listen to all these casuals that say it's pay to win or fully time reliable. Its not. All you want to do you can do within a day from the start. The skill queue with the skills for big stuff taking longer is meant to be that way, do you have at least minimal time to learn how to fly the smaller ships. I've been playing this game on and off for 5 years now, and I can assure you all, this game is worth at least the free trial. Fly safe o7			",56,4,1,5,4,0,9

												The fact that this online game is over a decade old speaks for itself. It's a niche game for sure, made before a time that games like Star Citizen were possible. It focuses on medium and large scale PvP perma-loss combat and there is nothing else like it on the multiplayer gaming market. But that would be selling it short, Eve Online is far more than just the sum of its parts.What sets Eve Online apart from every other game is its unique community. It's both well-established but extremely welcoming of new players. Eve features one of the most political player driven environments available, complete with under-the-table deals, backstabbing, high-rolling casino warlords, mercenaries and more. There are player rivalries that have lasted over a decade and things only seem to escalate as time goes on.If you try out Eve Online be sure to join a player run corporation once you have the basics down. You'll get to experience Eve like it's meant to be played by putting in the effort to play the game with others. Without the community it would truly just be spreadsheets in space			",121,10,3,16,12,0,33

												Ignore my play time on Steam because I have played the game on an non-Steam client. I have been playing the game on and off since 2008.Now that's out of the way I'll keep it short. There are 3 main things you have to do to play Eve and have fun:- You will have to invest time. This game has a tremendous learning curve. It is much much MUCH higher than most other MMOs. It is a completely player driven world with its own rules, own history, own professions, own market, own culture, own geography and own community. You will need to learn lots of new♥♥♥♥♥♥ You will have to commit time.-You will have to invest money. Eve do not have microtransactions but you will need to sub. Alpha state (free to play state) is ridiculously restrictive and only good for introducing people to the game. You can't stay in alpha and have fun forever. You may be able to pay your sub with in-game money someday but it will not happen soon. You will have to sub to play it properly.-You will have to interact with people. Eve is a sanbox game, completely different from theme park MMOs where someone is always telling you what to do and where to go next. It is player-driven world, military alliances, commercial corporations, production, market, exploration, building/destroying; everything is handled by players. You will have to interact with people, join corporations, participate in market pvp, avoid scams, join organizations etc. to have fun. Playing Eve solo is usually not rewarding and gets boring fast. You will have to communicate with people.If you acknowledge these three points and still want to experience the biggest player-driven virtual world the gaming has ever seen, you should give it a chance. There is no game near the scale of Eve online out there. No game offers such strategy, organization and cooperation where thousands of players get together for common goals and shape the game world. Take into account the points above so that you can keep your insults to the game for yourself in case you don't like it and move on to other games more suitable for you.Also, don't fly what you can't afford to lose.Peace out.

												Better than No Man's Sky, but that's not saying much, lol. Eve is slow-going, long and boring tutorials, and overall not a very interesting experience. It's free-to-play, I get it, so that's why I'm calling it quits now. If I'm going and watching YouTube or playing another game while waiting for my ship to autopilot to its destination in this game, I might as well not play this at all.			",86,16,4,9,17,0,17

												I bought EVE online back when it costed money on the steam store, upon entering the game i found myself frustrated at the fact that i bought the game AND had to pay for a subscription. I bought the cheapest subscription and played it until it expired, having loads of fun the entire time and thoroughly enjoying it before i took a break for about a year. I returned to EVE online only to learn that you didn't have to pay for a subscription this time but if you wanted to use anything over the first tier you needed a subscription, i found myself once again frustrated with how much money this game was requiring AND the fact that i had bought the game when it costed money but now it was free. I didn't buy a subscription the second time because of the cost and how much money i had already spent on the game. I tried playing the free version but i couldn't use any of the ships i used previously because they were a higher tier than the free version allowed, which pretty much turned me away from the game indefinately. I probably won't be playing this game anymore due to some pretty bad decisions from the developers in my opinion, these include but aren't limited to:- The game requires a lot of money and time- Same tactics that mobile games use, upgrades and masteries required for ships and equipment can take days, weeks and months to complete and even then you might not have what you need. Mobile games use this tactic to keep the player playing, which can be good and bad.- The game requires more grinding than i have ever seen in any game ever- To train enough skills to fly the bigger ships, months and maybe even years have to be devoted to training and grinding enough credits to buy the skill books and once you train through the books upgrading them to the required levelI feel if this game was less time and money consuming, a lot more people would be open to playing but with how much i've spent on this game and only for 104 hours of FUN gameplay, i will not be returning.

												I've been playing EVE for nearly a decade now. I created my first character back in 2005, but I didn't really truly appreciate the game until I created my second character in 2007. I play primarily from the launcher and not via steam due to how old my accounts are. EVE is a game of social politics, economic conquest, and unending warfare. You can do almost anything in EVE, you can be an industrial mogul manufacturing ships and equipment, you can be an unrivaled excavator of valuable resources vital to the unending cycle of creation and destruction, you can be an explorer of the far reaches of the EVE universe's nearly 8000 fully to scale star systems and sell your knowledge of locations and acquired rare goods, you can be a feared combatant of the galaxy of your own cleverness and dedication, conduct truly scandalous acts of ruthless espionage, you can even, as I do, lead and direct truly strategic and tactical combat as a fleet commander. In this game, the only limit is your own ambition and will to find what serves you best. I do what I love in EVE. I lead a small guerrilla style force deep into the hearts of the vast player operated nullsec empires; making hit and fade attacks via the game's vast array of ever changing and unconquerable wormhole systems.  Many will try to disuade you from your dream in EVE and tell you their less imaginative way is best. They're wrong, your own savvy, acuteness, and will to find your own way are your best assets in this game. EVE favors the bold, but make no mistake though allies are necessary to advance in EVE. This is not a game where you can ignore the universe around you and expect it not to interact with you. If you choose to inhabit this universe and then ignore it, as many do, you will often do so at your own peril.  As I said before, the only limit is your own ambition and will to find your way.Edit: As of the time of this posting the latest trailers are:

												Well I was not going to buy the starter pack, but I was burnt out on other space games, and wanted to see what Eve Online was all about. It's a wonderfully designed and developed game, but I cannot recommend this game at all. The community is rife with aggressive players, who are ready to pounce on any newb who hasn't even gotten in a full week of play time. When you start the game, all the new skills, weapons, ship items, and other gear is so heavily nerfed, I just don't see how it's logically conceivable that even a good newb player would consider chancing a fight with a seasoned player. Sure I understand that it's part of the game to use your ships for battle, but it's the main focus of the game, and shouldn't hinder new players from wanting to explore it more, and learn how to become better. The game just seems like it lends itself to anarchy, and I really don't enjoy that at all. If I want to deal with aggressive personalities I get enough of that IRL. I don't want that in a game, from which I seek to get enetertainment.tl;dr I didn't enjoy this game at all.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												AS PEOPLE SAY BUY IT FROM EVE OFFICAL SITE MUCH MUCH MORE CHEAPER! I've played more hours via the none steam version. This game is one of the best MMO's out there, you can do or be anything you want to be and get away with it. First off this game isn't for the COD kids that think this is a fast paste game it isn't, This game takes a long time to get to the point were you want to go. Say you want to train a pertucular skill to level 5 I'm training a small hybrid turret at the moment and it takes about a WEEK to do it. This is one of these games that takes time but when you do get to the point of PVP it's amazing fun!  ",37,5,0,3,6,0,7

												The best game that I don't play.    Let me start with why I have put hundreds of hours into EVE Online and why I would recommend it to a friend.-Graphics and Music: The graphics and overall atmosphere in this game are amazing and will stay that way, CCP continues to update this game over the years visually so that every time you log in and undock into space you just stare with amazement at the beautiful wonder of space and on top of it all the musical score is wonderful and beautifully written.-The Hud: This may seem like a weird thing to bring up but if you have played lots of MMOs you know how important a good Hud is, the interface and hud in this game is by far the best out of any MMO. Customizable in every way, no limit to how many windows you can have open, all the text is small and sleek, hotkeys for everything etc.... Just feels and looks great.-Freedom: This game is a true Sandbox, you get thrown into space, there are no classes etc, you train in whatever you want so you become the kind of pilot you want. You can explore wormholes, scan down old space archaeological sites to get loot. You can be a pirate and gank people just for the hell of it and take their stuff. You can be a bounty hunger or a miner or be part of a huge corporation playing the politics and trading goods on the market and much much more.Now for why I do not play the game haha.          I have plaid this game off and on for years now and the reasons I stop playing are always the same.1. This game requires a large time investment to really have fun, you can get in and run a quick mission in half an hour. However to really do anything worth doing you are talking 6-9 hours.2. The skill system is setup so that you have your character studying a skill book and they study that in real time. This is great because they keep on studying when you are at work etc... However because of this you do not feel any real drive or reason to play the game. Other then making ISK (which is the in game currency) and once you have enough isk you really run out of reasons to play. This could be easily solved by making it so that as you reach certain goals in the game or accomplish certain missions etc... to speeds up your study time but there is no feature like this so you eventually just get bored and lose any drive to play when you realize you need to wait 2 weeks before you can get your new gun or ship no matter how much you play.So do I recommend this game? yes, great game. Do I think you are going to keep on playing it? no, you will most likely have a love/hate relationship like myself and every other person I know.			",379,35,3,51,19,2,37

												My review of this is strickly based on one simple fact : I did not join any groups.  I hate playing games where I have to join groups or guilds. I am of the solo type.  This is a mistake if you do this in this game as it will take you forever to move up the ladders. Just mining to get a decent mining ship will take you at least one-two months and then proably 6 more months for the next level.  So if you want to play it solo, be  warned, it will be a very long game with very slow progress.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												increadibly overwhelming at first and it takes a while before that gets any better. However, the community for the most part is as nice as any mmo i have ever played and is especially accomidating to new players which is a rarity to say the least. With the aid of the community as well as the plethora of useful information floating out there, you can and will overcome the steep learning curve associated with this game. Once you start getting the hang of it and realize the sheer amount of enjoyable content eve has to offer, you'l start to understand why this game is so great.

												first thing yeah this isnt game for everyone.second thing yor whole expirience with eve is pretty much going to depend on how you aproach it.see the thing with eve is that its gameplay really isnt anything special average at best but what makes eve so great at least for me is the people i do stuff with the expirience of planning some op with them or simply figuring out how to save the damsel the most complicated way possible just to kill some time. Alot of people search out the null sec alliances and what not when they start eve because they heard of some huge battle and want to take part in something like that now sure yeah you might find some corp thats in some powerfull alliance or coalition that will take you in but most of the people ive come across that got into some of the bigger alliances in null were just used as a suicicde tackle without any guidness or tips how to get started or how to get those shiny t2 lasers they want and honestly null sec can be a very dull place for example lets say youre just killing some rats near or at your home system to make some isk and you see 2 or 3 neutral capsuleers enter the system and youre forced to dock up because if they find you your ceo or someone else higher up in the corp is gona grind you because it looks bad on their killboard or you get into a bigger brawl and dont get me wrong those can be fun up to a point where TIDI kicks in so hard it takes you an hour to just warp to something so yeah null isnt very fun place to be at least for me and specially since CCP turned it into a tug of war. My advice for new players is to stay in hi sec dont rush geting into big corps stay in your NPC corp and meet some people hang out in factions chats and others theres some good people to meet there and read item descriptions its very easy to get around fitting your ship or figuring out how to build something just by asking someone for some help with it or just reading descriptions and checking out tutorial and try out diferent stuff and find what you like the best not what will get you most isk in certain amount of time or fullfilling someones requests just for braging rights of being in some known corp also dont aproach eve with the mindset ""oh its this huge complicated thing that will take you monts to figure out"" on contrary eve can be easy to comperhand just by reading items descriptions and pay attention to tutorial that explains some basic mechanics most of the other stuff youll either learn through trial and error or simply by talking to people now the comunity i find is one of the best mmo comunitys ive ever come across tho it has its trolls and bu++hurts and whatnot but aside from HI sec wardecers camping trade hubs and some goons theyre pretty rare. also for both new players and veterans try out roleplaying corps its quite easy and can make eve so much more enjoyable just imagine doing an op fully in character. Overall eve can be a great game for you or the most dreadfull one youve come across it all depends on how you aproach it really. and one last tip dont think of eve as a second job of some sort with doing multiple characters just to get that operation running on your own or depend alot on out of game information and tools one alt is all you need really just to be in the wh if youre living in one to scan your self back in if you lock your self out or something. fly safe out there o7			",33,6,1,14,1,0,2

												EVE is a cool game, as a simple man i thought i would Mc♥♥♥♥ up every part of this game but once the semi-steep learning curve has been passed, this game has awesome depth and parts to it! The ship design is brilliant, the atmosphere and the look of the game is brilliant and it has a nice level of character as well. Don't be scared off by the subscription, you can dip in and out through a leniant subscription plan that you can just get rid of without any trouble! However i would get this game only if you're prepared to understand it and maybe take it slow, some areas (pirate filled, null sec etc.) will mess you up if you're not prepared or lost. But seriously ♥♥♥♥ pirates.			",103,25,1,11,4,0,11

												EVE Online is a game where I consistently see ""2000 hours played, thumbs down"" in the reviews.  Well, this game is amazing, atleast from a shear data standpoint.  Everything is on one server internationally (excluding China because of internet use laws) and every descision impacts the universe in some way.  I am not going to lie by saying this game is easy, its a hard game!  Also, the game discerns between the competent and incompetent people who play it.  Do not take this the wrong way, but if you want to be generally successful in this game, you gotta be competent, or follow orders well.  This game, like every game, has a darkside, but that darkside takes the form of certain player-bases rather than because of the game itself.  So I am gonna give this game what it deserves, my thumb up (because im only using one thumb).			",71,3,1,8,17,1,10

												Not your typical mmo.The game is so big a quick review is not possible. The player base will help you if you ask, player interaction will always happen, 99% player base market, ...You have to make your own content, this is nothing like World of Warcraft or any of that kind of mmo.If you make enough ingame money in game you can pay your sub with that, but to reliable earn enough money to pay for it it will take a few months.Best way to test the game is to try it:This is a 21 day trail ( EvE site gives 14 day trails) : https://secure.eveonline.com/trial/?invc=27a823dd-f058-42a0-8a47-867aa11d1c52&action=buddyHave fun, hope to see you in the game.

												Home to world record breaking PvP battles in terms of player participation and monetary losses, Eve Online is a polarizing PvP centric MMO that players will either love or hate. Especially new players; most will hate it while some will love it. While commonly described as an MMO and sandbox, a more accurate description of Eve Online may be that it is an economic simulator wrapped in a political simulator with “roguelite” elements. While initially intimidating to new players and overall unforgiving, especially endgame, Eve Online’s developer CCP has created a meritorious masterpiece that has received a bounty of awards since its inception.The pace of the game will be off-putting to the majority of potential and new players. Unlike the majority of other MMO’s, acquiring new skills and abilities in Eve Online happens in real time; there is no experience to be gained by completing missions or killing rats (NPC’s). Training new skills will take a given amount of time in Eve online, but may be altered by changing a pilot’s attributes, by utilizing implants, which affect training time. Skills in Eve Online may take merely minutes to train or may take months. In ARPG’s, the point of the game is to acquire new, better, and rarer loot. During endgame, the new loot may augment the game in some facets, especially in the case of Path of Exile, but general gameplay elements (endlessly killing monsters) and those of the player’s chosen class largely remain the same creating stale, repetitive gameplay. The seemingly endless amount of skills to train in Eve Online means that there will almost always be something new to do in-game which functions similarly, yet superiorly, to loot in an ARPG.Gameplay in Eve Online is unique and very much different from other MMO’s; a player cannot move his/her ship using WSAD. Instead, you give commands to your ship, such as “orbit at 30 km,” “approach,” “warp to,” etc. However, you can still double click anywhere in space and your ship will head in that direction. This lack of freedom of movement will also be unappealing to many, but it allows for more tactical gameplay especially in PvP.PvP is heavily strategy based; an expensive ship can still lose to a relatively cheap one. PvP requires not only an in depth knowledge of what the function is of each ship, but the synergy amongst them. Also, it requires that a pilot know what modules to best fit his/her ship. However, a pilot’s individual mistakes and lack of understanding of the game may be made up for by other players, since PvP battle may consist of several thousand players.Time Dilation (TiDi), is heralded by CCP as a triumph to reduce lag in epic, expansive battles involving thousands of players. TiDi supposedly reduces the passage of time in the system, where the battle is occurring by up to ten percent as to reduce the stress on the server’s hardware. CCP decided to introduce this so that things players did in the battle would not be processed out of order. However, players who have experienced TiDi will report that actions that would have taken no more than ten seconds instead take between several minutes and up to twenty minutes to complete.Players are arranged into corporations, corporations may thus be arranged into alliances, alliances may thus be arranged into coalitions; all of which revolve around the economy. These arrangements allow for complex player run governments. These governments vie for control of various systems across the galaxy for the right to harvest various resources. Almost everything in-game can be made by players and then be sold on various markets. Unlike other MMO’s, such as World of Warcraft, the market in Eve Online utilizes a brokerage system akin to that of the stock market. CCP allows controversial actions such as extortion, thievery, espionage, and scamming in Eve Online. If a player were to do any of these in the majority of other MMO’s, he/she would be facing a permanent ban. These controversial actions fit well into the governmental arrangement of players as well into the occurrences of wars.The effects of PvP are wide reaching; they can be felt across the game. Such was the case of the costliest battle in Eve Online history; B-R5RB. Prices in in-game markets, especially those in the main trade hub in Jita, fluctuated more than normal allowing traders to secure large profits.PLEX (Pilot’s License Extension) in Eve Online is analogous to gold in the modern world; PLEX is what determines the worth of ISK. Also, much like gold, the value of PLEX fluctuates. PLEX is an in-game item equivalent to thirty days of game time. It can be bought in-game with ISK, hauled to various markets, and sold. It can also be purchased for twenty dollars. Comparatively, a one month subscription that is instantly activated on an account (not PLEX) costs fifteen dollars. While not free to play, it is more than possible to play Eve Online without having to open a wallet, although this will most likely be difficult in the first few months of a new player’s account.While not often addressed, Eve Online utilizes many roguelike elements and thus, may be classified as a roguelite. Ships may cost tens of billions of ISK and when they are destroyed in battle, the pilot lose ISK which translates to a few thousand dollars (USD) lost. Those ships take real time to make; potentially thousands of man hours to make and months of waiting for it to roll off of a production line. When they are destroyed, they are gone. There is no respawn; they no longer exist. The most expensive ships are titans, the Death Stars of Eve Online, are worth approximately three thousand dollars. When a ship is destroyed in Eve Online, a pod is ejected containing the pilot. Should a pilot be unable to escape in his/her pod and be killed in battle, he/she loses a clone which may have billions of ISK in implants. The most harrowing of losses, due to mistakes, involve pilots not updating their medical clones to retain the skill points they’ve trained. Should a pilot fail have failed upgrade the clone and be killed, he/she stands to lose millions of skill points which may have taken months to train.Anyone one can be ganked anywhere by other players. Whether a pilot actively engages in PvP or simply mines asteroids, he/she can be ganked. Systems in Eve Online are assigned a security status. Depending on the security status, the in-game NPC police force, known as CONCORD, may respond and aid the victim by attempting to destroy the aggressor.Players are most often drawn into the game by the epic, lurid tales they hear of massive battles, espionage, or betrayal. Eve Online is a massive game. While events do occur like these on a daily basis, they are rather uncommon. As a result, many players do not make it past the trial version or tutorial because of this realization, whatever or whoever made them decide to try Eve Online made no mention of the incredibly slow pace, or the unusual and very different gameplay style.Eve Online is not perfect; no game is. Developer CCP has claimed through its public relations that TiDi is indeed necessary and successful in its purpose. Despite these flaws CCP has done many things right. According to the Guinness World Records Gamer’s Edition 2014, the battle of 6VDT-H in Eve Online reached a total of 4,070 pilots fighting simultaneously, making it the largest PvP battle in history. CCP is one of the few MMO’s that welcomes immoral actions into its core gameplay. Eve Online is a game in which there is an incredible amount of depth as is evident by the way players produce goods, the manner that player governments who want to do so must hold their own territory in which the resources to do so reside, the in-game economy, and the strategies utilized by players in PvP. While the pace will be appalling to some, Eve Online warrants a try from all.			",112,26,4,12,10,0,17

												Fun, really cool atmosphere and presentation. One of the most immersive sci-fi games I've ever played. Addictive gameplay, though much of it WILL be spent grinding/farming, at least at first as you try to build up enough ISK to enter the (immensely satisfying) PvP portions of the game. Yes the free version is highly restricted, but it's also free, and you can still be useful in large-scale PvP. You used to only be able to play for free for 2 weeks before they locked down your account, be grateful you have unlimited time now.It's tough to get into and learn the mechanics initially. If you have played similarly complex or more complex games before (X series, Dwarf Fortress, SS13, etc) you should get the hang of basically all of the important stuff within a couple of hours, though if not it will likely frustrate you for several days as you try to learn your way around everything. MOST IMPORTANT THING TO DO: Find and join a player corporation ASAP. The game is 100x more fun and more easy once you have people with knowledge supporting you and showing you the ropes to the more complicated parts of the game, and that is where this game's community really shines. You'll see recommendations to join big corps like EveUniversity for example, and while that's a good idea, almost any corp being helmed by at least a few experienced players is a safe bet as they will always be able to show you a lot of good info you'd miss, and typically smaller corps will be more personal and let you make friends more easily.Eve is the only MMO I've ever played more than 10 hours of and still felt like coming back for more, which is also why it's the only MMO I've ever subscribed to. I expect to spend a few hundred more hours playing at minimum, and recommend anyone try it out as well.			",47,2,0,6,6,1,1

												Eve Online is a complex, high learning curve, open end space simulation. It has a real world economy that changes with events within a persistant realm. Its graphics are unmatched in ANY game of its genre, the soundtrack and sound effects are top notch and its over all ease of control makes for an alluring game. The game is very complex and difficult to grasp for new players at first but once some time is spent and some experiance in playing is gained its open ended format can be quite rewarding. Eve Online is more a hobby then a game to play.I rate this game a 4.7 out of 5.			",23,1,0,8,3,0,21

												Great game- I returned after a 4 year break and am enjoying it. - Do not download through steam- Find a player to send you a trial inite. This gives you 21 days of game time for FREE!!!! - If you then upgrade your account to paid they will get 1.3bil in game isk, which if you go 50\50 will pay for anything you might need for the first couple of months - Can be pay to win with skill injectors, i bought about 24 plex to be able to get close to where i left off which is about £360 and saved months upon months upon months of training and not being able to fully enjoy the game. - The player community can be a hit and a miss, lots of scams though contracts, hauling, offering investment oppertunaties etc. If its too good to be true it usually is. - Be prepared to socialise, EvE is better when  played with a group of friends.

												I highly recommend EVE Online. It's hands down my favorite game. If you want to know why, continue reading and I'll tell you just SOME of the reasons.EVE Online is an amazing space sim/strategy/mmo/rpg/sandbox game. While it has it's issues just like any other game on it's grand scale, you will not unlock the game's true potential if you try to only play it by yourself.This game is DESIGNED around player community and interaction. Whether you're teaming up with friends to go take down a enemy player(s) or finding a new way to con someone out of their isk (the in-game currency), it's all about interacting with others. The game is so large and has so much depth it is something you can lose yourself in. Whatever your play style, EVE encourages you to pursue it. PVP (player vs player) is a big part of EVE, but so also is Industry and the Market. You choose your role, but could be a jack-of-all trades as well. I'll go more in depth into just some of the things that are possible in EVE Online.PvPIt's not just another lets get in some spaceships and go explode the enemy. There's actual strategy to this game. Imagine a RTS (Real-Time Stragety) game but you're playing as one of the ships in the fleet  and every other ship in the fleet is each played by a seperate player.Each person has a role in the fleet:-Dps (damage per second). These are the ones that attempt to kill enemy players.-Logi (logistics). The ""healers"". Those who repair shields and armor of friendly fleet ships.-Ewar (electronic warfare). Those who scramble enemy targeting so enemy logi can't repair allies, and dps can't target focus to kill your friendlies.-Tackle. These use ""warp scramblers"" which stops enemies from running away from a fight.There are hundreds (literally) of different ships with multiple uses as listed above. But there are more ships for other purposes not related to pvp (and related to other forms of pvp), and funny enough can even be used for pvp situations as pvp can/will happen anywhere in EVE Online.IndustryThere's a lot of different things included in this department. You could produce ships (yes, actually gather resources or ""minerals"" as they are called in game to build ship hulls), ship components, guns, launchers, lasers, pilot implants (increases your abilities for learning, fighting, building, etc), not to mention much more. You also have the ability to go MINE your resources via mining ships, barges, even capital mining ships (aka, a very, very, very large ship equipped with the ability to house actual mining ships and barges within itself and hold a lot of ore from mining). These are just a few things to mention for the industry.MarketThe market is booming, always, and has a constant supply and demand of many, many products. Ships, components, ammo, construction materials, resources, etc, etc, etc. If you've got a knack for playing the market you can, and will, make a lot of isk. There are frieghter ships in game that you can purchase, build, or ""acquire"" to even set up your own trading or courier service. But beware, as with anything else in EVE there's players looking to take what you work for. Which brings me to another trade.PiratesYou don't wanna work for what you gain? Like taking it from others? Well, EVE Online has a spot for you within it's massive galaxy as well. This kind of goes under pvp but is more specific as you are pvping, not for kills, but rather for looting of the kills.Overall, EVE Online has what you like to do in it. And even with all that I've mentioned, I haven't really scratched the surface of all that EVE offers you. PLUS, now EVE Online is FREE-TO-PLAY. Yes. So at least give it a try, and if you've somehow survived reading through all of my review, check my profile and look into joining the corporation (the ""guilds"" or ""factions"" of EVE Online) PANDEMIC HORDE. It's a new and old player friendly corp that will help you get started and enjoying EVE to it's fullest.			",146,36,7,20,15,0,9

												Ah EVE Online...This has to be one of the greatest and most addicting games I have ever played. Should you play it? That depends. It offers an immense world where you can be literally anyone you want because it has something for all players in all age groups from PVP, to mining, to exploring, to trading, etc... All it asks for in return is time, but if you have a headset, you will make friends while piloting some of the coolest ships around. The game requires a time commitment, that isn't necessarily a bad thing because the game is huge so if you are across the galaxy, prepare to slow boat your♥♥♥♥♥to where you want to be. (*Learn to use jump clones efficiently to avoid this) If you have the time, try it out. The other pilots are great, don't be put off by people saying everyone in this game is toxic and trying to get over on you becasue they aren't. Many pilots will help you with information as long as you ask in a respectable manner and the ones who scam and grief are valued members of the universe. That is what makes this game great, you can be anyone. Learn to scam others, or help others, or pirate, or mine, or trade, or explore, do whatever you want just realize this game takes time to master. Literally, your skills are time based, I enjoyed this idea because they train even why you are away and it is different that most other games. Exploration is a lot of fun in this game, to me at least, it wasn't that you were finding things no one else has found. Quite the contrary. You were finding resources like other explorers but is the fear of getting caught exciting. When you are flying a 60million isk Astero thourgh wormhole/null space with 500 million in loot, you have to be cautious but confident in you abilities. You will die in this game, it happens, but your skills will still be ther and you can always make more isk. PVP is adrenaline enducing because it is deeper than some make it out to be. It isn't merely orbiting with guns on, you have to be calculating how to counter your target/s. I enjoyed the permanent factor of your deaths, you don't just fly back to your wreck and begin again, you have to build a new ship. So never fly what you can't afford to lose to a point. If you finally get a cruiser for mission running, don't go PVP with it because that is how you make your isk. If you make isk exploring, once you have the isk build a mirror image of you exploration ship, that way if you get blown up you can still go out and make isk. If you mine, same thing because you might get ganked in highsec by people looking for luls. This game is another world to lose yourself in, pirates exist in this world. So learn to live with them or become one. You can make a lot of isk in this game and PLEX your account, it is doable but I don't suggest it. Pay your subscription and keep the isk for fun/pew pew. Developers need  to eat and $15 a month isn't that much if you play 15+ hours a month it comes out to $1 dollar/hour for entertainment and this game you will enjoy. You can try it out for free but I wouldn't make your final decision on that, I would pay one month and judge afterward because the game opens up with more ships. This is becoming longer and longer but if you are looking for a good alternate life , I highly suggest this one. I didn't have the willpower to only play at night because EVE is my drug so I have to shelve it for now. People will tell you to ""Fly Safe"" in this game, ♥♥♥♥ THAT, fly however you want. Fly Dangerous/Stupid/Drunk/High/Fast/Slow/Cautious/Etc because in EVE you can be anyone you want while being noone at all. Easily 10/10 and borderline 11.o7 Teclis EisensteinP.s. no you can't have my stuff because there will be a day I return to this world and disregard hours played, have many more outside Steam.

												If you dont like to think, dont play this game.If you dont like to constantly risk everything, dont play this game.If you dont like to constantly feel watched by spies, dont play this game.If you do like waiting forever to learn how to fly ships and use equipment, play this game.If you do like scamming people out of their in-game money, play this game. If you do like getting extremely confused by everything, play this game.That being said, ignore all of it. This game is incredible. The entire economy is run off of player actions, player industry, and even gets affected by the wars that constantly happen. It does take quite a while to really get going but why not start right now.It can seem very intimidating at first but it is easy to get a hang of the basics and once youve got the basics, the rest is easy to learn. I could go on forever about Eve. It is a never ending game that gets better with every patch. 10/10			",117,9,4,19,5,0,9

												The fact that this online game is over a decade old speaks for itself. It's a niche game for sure, made before a time that games like Star Citizen were possible. It focuses on medium and large scale PvP perma-loss combat and there is nothing else like it on the multiplayer gaming market. But that would be selling it short, Eve Online is far more than just the sum of its parts.What sets Eve Online apart from every other game is its unique community. It's both well-established but extremely welcoming of new players. Eve features one of the most political player driven environments available, complete with under-the-table deals, backstabbing, high-rolling casino warlords, mercenaries and more. There are player rivalries that have lasted over a decade and things only seem to escalate as time goes on.If you try out Eve Online be sure to join a player run corporation once you have the basics down. You'll get to experience Eve like it's meant to be played by putting in the effort to play the game with others. Without the community it would truly just be spreadsheets in space			",121,10,3,16,12,0,33

												This game is something else. I started it twice and quit twice. The learning cliff (not curve, CLIFF) is insane. In short it goes like this: here's a ship, f**k you. Still, the mature community, the amazing devs, the possibility to be a part of sci-fi and mmo history is something you can't find in any other game. I played this game through steam for 400ish hours, and on it's own client for another 1000 or so. It takes you in and never lets go. That is if you are brave enough to learn and lose stuff on the way. Don't listen to all these casuals that say it's pay to win or fully time reliable. Its not. All you want to do you can do within a day from the start. The skill queue with the skills for big stuff taking longer is meant to be that way, do you have at least minimal time to learn how to fly the smaller ships. I've been playing this game on and off for 5 years now, and I can assure you all, this game is worth at least the free trial. Fly safe o7			",56,4,1,5,4,0,9

												The game is very difficult to learn and will require patience and dedication from the player, and even when one has understanding of how everything works ""fun"" is not readily found, but effort must be put into making it; however, once these two things are done, EVE offers some of the most profound experiences in the video game industry.EVE Online rewards autonomy, determination, awareness and intelligence. It is a game for the self-sufficient and the proactive. If planning to try the game, think beyond the obvious: other ships are not just players, they are people looking for their own fun and, more often than not, social engagement is the first step to realizing that.Lastly, I do recommend EVE, but only to those who are willing to make mistakes and try harder.Here is a guide for the new players:

												Ignore my play time on Steam because I have played the game on an non-Steam client. I have been playing the game on and off since 2008.Now that's out of the way I'll keep it short. There are 3 main things you have to do to play Eve and have fun:- You will have to invest time. This game has a tremendous learning curve. It is much much MUCH higher than most other MMOs. It is a completely player driven world with its own rules, own history, own professions, own market, own culture, own geography and own community. You will need to learn lots of new♥♥♥♥♥♥ You will have to commit time.-You will have to invest money. Eve do not have microtransactions but you will need to sub. Alpha state (free to play state) is ridiculously restrictive and only good for introducing people to the game. You can't stay in alpha and have fun forever. You may be able to pay your sub with in-game money someday but it will not happen soon. You will have to sub to play it properly.-You will have to interact with people. Eve is a sanbox game, completely different from theme park MMOs where someone is always telling you what to do and where to go next. It is player-driven world, military alliances, commercial corporations, production, market, exploration, building/destroying; everything is handled by players. You will have to interact with people, join corporations, participate in market pvp, avoid scams, join organizations etc. to have fun. Playing Eve solo is usually not rewarding and gets boring fast. You will have to communicate with people.If you acknowledge these three points and still want to experience the biggest player-driven virtual world the gaming has ever seen, you should give it a chance. There is no game near the scale of Eve online out there. No game offers such strategy, organization and cooperation where thousands of players get together for common goals and shape the game world. Take into account the points above so that you can keep your insults to the game for yourself in case you don't like it and move on to other games more suitable for you.Also, don't fly what you can't afford to lose.Peace out.

												Great game. No handholding beyond what is absolutely necessary for a tutorial. No catering to one particular type of player. No centralized economy (other than the currency, everything is regulated by other players only). Good enough players can play for free, though admittedly I've never been rich enough ingame to buy a PLEX (1 month of free game time to be used whenever you want). The GMs are actually fair, explaining things to new players and, in my case, personally messaging them to see if they need help.Grinding is virtually nonexistant. Newer players will need to focus instead on getting player contacts and choose their skills, which are trained in realtime even while not playing (up to a week of being offline).Older players can and WILL be knocked back to newbie status if killed and they haven't cloned, so the game isn't always dominated by the same guys with big guns.Just pick your battles wisely. Death isn't the worst thing that can happen, and that's saying something, considering it's possible to lose months' worth of training for one death if you don't clone.			",166,33,1,58,27,1,28

												I don't have much to say about this game other than that I enjoyed it, despite not really expecting to. most games I think I will enjoy usually turn out boring and unengaging. Eve remains the only true MMO I have ever really enjoyed.a word of advice to prospective players reading this; the best way to enjoy eve online is to enter without any expectations. don't expect a fly-by wire space sim. don't expect deep NPC interaction. don't expect any of the eye candy in the action packed trailers tht CCP puts together (although it is a gorgeus looking game none the less).allow eve to impress you in it's own way. if it fails to do that within two weeks, then like so many others, the game is simply not for you.TL;DR rated N for 'not everyone'			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Its a good game, you should give it a try *cough* saturnknight2247. It is a a huge learning curve but to start off I highly reccomend the starter pack as you get a frigate and♥♥♥♥♥♥ Anyways its a huge learning curve, you have to do the tutorial, like if you dont you dont know what to do. Im not obessed with it either *cough* saturnknight2247, but I do know who someone who is obessed with minecraft *cough* saturnknight2247			",43,0,0,7,5,0,1

												I'm not very far into it.. but would recomend anyone try it and at least give it a good handfull of hours before giving up on it. There's no real messing up (that I've noticed) beyond waisting time flying past things until you figure out the controls, and sitting and reading everything. I haven't been trolled or killed yet.. and have had little to no guidance (3.5 hours in) but so far I'm enjoying the game as much as you can without having a subscription (not ment to be backhanded, it's worth playing for free!)

Posted: August 8, 2014
												Why I bought the game: What I liked about the game: This game opened my view on mmos, and showed me not only another universe of open simulation player driven gameplay, but another sub culture of gamers that is within itself an amazing experience. Everything is player driven, with a minor role of policing by npc and occasional staff. Space combat was ruthless and lawless. Creating an empire, and conquering space is all within grasp. Very easy to play while working at home or multitasking, attention requirement up to you.My experience with the community was quite up and down, the first corp (clan) I joined was run by a person who was in real life on house arrest, and quite the character - in the game he was another person, he seeked power on a certain part of space, and spent hours amassing an army to claim this sector, that was at the time lousely run by a few rogues. We fought for days, throwing resources, going back and forth - I dont think that battle ever ended, I also never heard from the corp leader again, i'm convinced he was spending welfare money on in game currency to fund the war until he lost connection. o7 What I didn't like about the game: Hard to pick up and play with friends, required masochistic patience. The learning curve is really a brick wrapped in your child hood blanket, and it smells like daddy when he comes home late at night and fights with mom before your nightly religious talk that leaves you not sitting down the next few days, and that brick is being swung by your.. ah well you get it, it's rough.Would I buy at current asking price of 14.99 monthly? Yup and I enjoyed the time I spent with the game**Disclaimer**I would like to state all changes made by the developers of the game after this review could potentially make this entire review irrelevant. The current date of review 12/1/14.			",163,13,8,16,20,0,28

												The best game that I don't play.    Let me start with why I have put hundreds of hours into EVE Online and why I would recommend it to a friend.-Graphics and Music: The graphics and overall atmosphere in this game are amazing and will stay that way, CCP continues to update this game over the years visually so that every time you log in and undock into space you just stare with amazement at the beautiful wonder of space and on top of it all the musical score is wonderful and beautifully written.-The Hud: This may seem like a weird thing to bring up but if you have played lots of MMOs you know how important a good Hud is, the interface and hud in this game is by far the best out of any MMO. Customizable in every way, no limit to how many windows you can have open, all the text is small and sleek, hotkeys for everything etc.... Just feels and looks great.-Freedom: This game is a true Sandbox, you get thrown into space, there are no classes etc, you train in whatever you want so you become the kind of pilot you want. You can explore wormholes, scan down old space archaeological sites to get loot. You can be a pirate and gank people just for the hell of it and take their stuff. You can be a bounty hunger or a miner or be part of a huge corporation playing the politics and trading goods on the market and much much more.Now for why I do not play the game haha.          I have plaid this game off and on for years now and the reasons I stop playing are always the same.1. This game requires a large time investment to really have fun, you can get in and run a quick mission in half an hour. However to really do anything worth doing you are talking 6-9 hours.2. The skill system is setup so that you have your character studying a skill book and they study that in real time. This is great because they keep on studying when you are at work etc... However because of this you do not feel any real drive or reason to play the game. Other then making ISK (which is the in game currency) and once you have enough isk you really run out of reasons to play. This could be easily solved by making it so that as you reach certain goals in the game or accomplish certain missions etc... to speeds up your study time but there is no feature like this so you eventually just get bored and lose any drive to play when you realize you need to wait 2 weeks before you can get your new gun or ship no matter how much you play.So do I recommend this game? yes, great game. Do I think you are going to keep on playing it? no, you will most likely have a love/hate relationship like myself and every other person I know.			",379,35,3,51,19,2,37

												This game is pretty good. One of the last true sandbox combat games. The world is massive but the mechanics are extremely dated.

												This game sucks fairly bad , there is nothing to really do under Alpha you are nerfed to hell  there is no real way to earn much ISK  there is no real way to PvP if you wanted to  there is no real anything to actually do , even doing the training career missions you lose ships whats the point of that? there is none.even the ship choices most  are locked out under a paywall same with the better guns and mods you basically get less than  1/4 of a game in Alpha unable to do anything   paywall paywall paywall..this game is just a huge waste of time  purely designed to give Aplhas a terrible gameplay experience in the hopes to trick many of them to spend money getting PLEX  nice try  CCP  you failed with me maybe you can sucker someone else into buying PLEX   your game does suck under Alpha try again and remake alpha....

												Finalmente in F2P, anche se è un F2P particolare.Il gioco in se merita TANTISSIMO, praticamente siete liberi di fare qualsiasi cosa. E' un gioco vario e complesso che richiede un po' di tempo per essere apprezzato e capito in pieno. Nonostante l'età ci sono tra i 20000 e i 40000 giocatori al giorno.Con il F2P potete provarlo in tutti i suoi aspetti principali e ci sono soluzioni per giocare senza cacciare un euro ma personalmente consiglio di pagare il primo mese dopo esservi registrati tramite referaal di qualcuno in modo da avere belle ricompense.Se volete provare il gioco, aggiungetemi su steam prima di creare l'account che vi spiego alcune cose importanti.

												I've been in Eve for 2 month already, and so far it seems really nice. It is so far, the single MMORPG where I don't feel there is arbitrary rules stopping you from doing things and forcing you into a defined path.You can do absolutly everything, from fighting players, npcs, ganking poor miners, create and sell items on the market, etc.Every possible carreer path is viable and as everything is player made, you feel like you contribute to this world even to the smallest extent. The incredible complexity is a really good thing too, as it takes a lot of time to master, and it feels so rewarding.Pros :-Super deep and complex.-Many possible career paths (it's a real sandbox).-No game rules stopping you from anything : you can even do money by scamming players (with ingame items ofc).-Most of the universe is player driven, most manufactured items are made by players.-Every aspect of the game needs learning.-The skill system makes the progression smooth and feels rewarding.-Universe in constant progressions, politics driven by players.-Regular updates-Rookie chat and turorial helps you getting into the game.Cons :-Very very long to master, and very complex (some ppl don't like it)-Time consuming, whether it is in game content or reading wikis to improve.-Very niche game, will not appeal to anyone-It takes a very long time to be able to fly larger ships or to be maxed out in any carreer path you may choose.Overall it's a pretty niche game, but with a huge huge amount of playable content, and everything player driven. If you're really interested don't give up at the beginning and find someone to help you. On november 15th there will be a limited free to play version so you can try and decide if you like it enough to subscribe.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Great game, played the trial version of it. Love every aspect of it. Some people say that it wastes too much time, but that is the point? The only reason why I would not buy it is because of monthly subscription, it is just too much for a game of this type. In my opinion the game is worth around $30-40 without monthly sub. If just the game was $40 I would have bought it but I might be just cheap.. The game itself amazes me; graphics, career path, player based world. 10/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Ah EVE Online...This has to be one of the greatest and most addicting games I have ever played. Should you play it? That depends. It offers an immense world where you can be literally anyone you want because it has something for all players in all age groups from PVP, to mining, to exploring, to trading, etc... All it asks for in return is time, but if you have a headset, you will make friends while piloting some of the coolest ships around. The game requires a time commitment, that isn't necessarily a bad thing because the game is huge so if you are across the galaxy, prepare to slow boat your♥♥♥♥♥to where you want to be. (*Learn to use jump clones efficiently to avoid this) If you have the time, try it out. The other pilots are great, don't be put off by people saying everyone in this game is toxic and trying to get over on you becasue they aren't. Many pilots will help you with information as long as you ask in a respectable manner and the ones who scam and grief are valued members of the universe. That is what makes this game great, you can be anyone. Learn to scam others, or help others, or pirate, or mine, or trade, or explore, do whatever you want just realize this game takes time to master. Literally, your skills are time based, I enjoyed this idea because they train even why you are away and it is different that most other games. Exploration is a lot of fun in this game, to me at least, it wasn't that you were finding things no one else has found. Quite the contrary. You were finding resources like other explorers but is the fear of getting caught exciting. When you are flying a 60million isk Astero thourgh wormhole/null space with 500 million in loot, you have to be cautious but confident in you abilities. You will die in this game, it happens, but your skills will still be ther and you can always make more isk. PVP is adrenaline enducing because it is deeper than some make it out to be. It isn't merely orbiting with guns on, you have to be calculating how to counter your target/s. I enjoyed the permanent factor of your deaths, you don't just fly back to your wreck and begin again, you have to build a new ship. So never fly what you can't afford to lose to a point. If you finally get a cruiser for mission running, don't go PVP with it because that is how you make your isk. If you make isk exploring, once you have the isk build a mirror image of you exploration ship, that way if you get blown up you can still go out and make isk. If you mine, same thing because you might get ganked in highsec by people looking for luls. This game is another world to lose yourself in, pirates exist in this world. So learn to live with them or become one. You can make a lot of isk in this game and PLEX your account, it is doable but I don't suggest it. Pay your subscription and keep the isk for fun/pew pew. Developers need  to eat and $15 a month isn't that much if you play 15+ hours a month it comes out to $1 dollar/hour for entertainment and this game you will enjoy. You can try it out for free but I wouldn't make your final decision on that, I would pay one month and judge afterward because the game opens up with more ships. This is becoming longer and longer but if you are looking for a good alternate life , I highly suggest this one. I didn't have the willpower to only play at night because EVE is my drug so I have to shelve it for now. People will tell you to ""Fly Safe"" in this game, ♥♥♥♥ THAT, fly however you want. Fly Dangerous/Stupid/Drunk/High/Fast/Slow/Cautious/Etc because in EVE you can be anyone you want while being noone at all. Easily 10/10 and borderline 11.o7 Teclis EisensteinP.s. no you can't have my stuff because there will be a day I return to this world and disregard hours played, have many more outside Steam.

												I highly recommend EVE Online. It's hands down my favorite game. If you want to know why, continue reading and I'll tell you just SOME of the reasons.EVE Online is an amazing space sim/strategy/mmo/rpg/sandbox game. While it has it's issues just like any other game on it's grand scale, you will not unlock the game's true potential if you try to only play it by yourself.This game is DESIGNED around player community and interaction. Whether you're teaming up with friends to go take down a enemy player(s) or finding a new way to con someone out of their isk (the in-game currency), it's all about interacting with others. The game is so large and has so much depth it is something you can lose yourself in. Whatever your play style, EVE encourages you to pursue it. PVP (player vs player) is a big part of EVE, but so also is Industry and the Market. You choose your role, but could be a jack-of-all trades as well. I'll go more in depth into just some of the things that are possible in EVE Online.PvPIt's not just another lets get in some spaceships and go explode the enemy. There's actual strategy to this game. Imagine a RTS (Real-Time Stragety) game but you're playing as one of the ships in the fleet  and every other ship in the fleet is each played by a seperate player.Each person has a role in the fleet:-Dps (damage per second). These are the ones that attempt to kill enemy players.-Logi (logistics). The ""healers"". Those who repair shields and armor of friendly fleet ships.-Ewar (electronic warfare). Those who scramble enemy targeting so enemy logi can't repair allies, and dps can't target focus to kill your friendlies.-Tackle. These use ""warp scramblers"" which stops enemies from running away from a fight.There are hundreds (literally) of different ships with multiple uses as listed above. But there are more ships for other purposes not related to pvp (and related to other forms of pvp), and funny enough can even be used for pvp situations as pvp can/will happen anywhere in EVE Online.IndustryThere's a lot of different things included in this department. You could produce ships (yes, actually gather resources or ""minerals"" as they are called in game to build ship hulls), ship components, guns, launchers, lasers, pilot implants (increases your abilities for learning, fighting, building, etc), not to mention much more. You also have the ability to go MINE your resources via mining ships, barges, even capital mining ships (aka, a very, very, very large ship equipped with the ability to house actual mining ships and barges within itself and hold a lot of ore from mining). These are just a few things to mention for the industry.MarketThe market is booming, always, and has a constant supply and demand of many, many products. Ships, components, ammo, construction materials, resources, etc, etc, etc. If you've got a knack for playing the market you can, and will, make a lot of isk. There are frieghter ships in game that you can purchase, build, or ""acquire"" to even set up your own trading or courier service. But beware, as with anything else in EVE there's players looking to take what you work for. Which brings me to another trade.PiratesYou don't wanna work for what you gain? Like taking it from others? Well, EVE Online has a spot for you within it's massive galaxy as well. This kind of goes under pvp but is more specific as you are pvping, not for kills, but rather for looting of the kills.Overall, EVE Online has what you like to do in it. And even with all that I've mentioned, I haven't really scratched the surface of all that EVE offers you. PLUS, now EVE Online is FREE-TO-PLAY. Yes. So at least give it a try, and if you've somehow survived reading through all of my review, check my profile and look into joining the corporation (the ""guilds"" or ""factions"" of EVE Online) PANDEMIC HORDE. It's a new and old player friendly corp that will help you get started and enjoying EVE to it's fullest.			",146,36,7,20,15,0,9

												Eve is not a game. It is pretty much an alternate universe. Eve is an ever-changing 24-7 world of politics and warfare, with you caught in the middle. The game starts with the new tutorial I haven't done. But it teaches you the controls. That's it. Everything else is up for you to learn. (just kidding, you look it up) Your life starts very peaceful, but from there you are at the steering wheel for what you want to do, and it is overwhelming. This is the stage people usually quit. They can't handle it. Don't. The moment you get over this hump this game will become your second life. This game has something for literally every player. There has to be something you like. Like exploring the unknown? Take an explorer frigate and go deep into wormhole space. Want to craft? Make billions by running your own industry startup. Want to slowly hate every other player in Eve? Mine. Want to PvP? Blob up with your friends and go destroy some poor guy's ship. Or do honorable 1v1 duels. Want to scam people out of all their money? You can do that too. Eve is a dangerous world. You will die. A lot. Even the best pilots die. Your ship is gone, and now your capsule is gone. Don't worry, you come back as a clone of yourself, ready to do it all over again. If you really want to get the most out of eve, you need to learn that death is a game mechanic.Eve Online has captured me like no other game. World of Warcraft? I love that game, but the moment I picked up eve I neglected it. The game sucked me in, and it will suck you in too, if you let it. So hit that ""play game"" button, and bring some open-minded friends. Or make your own. The game is all about having your friends and your own little corperation, begging to do something big. To change Eve forever in the vast political landscape. I recommend joining some nullsec corp (you'll learn what that is when you play) and having your own little safe pocket in the universe surrounded by your friends. This review is a mess, but my heart basically just spilled out onto the keys. Eve is my favorite game of all time, and it can be yours too. But don't download it on steam. Please, please don't download it on steam. Download it on the official website for gods sake. Steam integration sucks so bad. So, what I'm trying to say with this review, is play this game.

												The fact that this online game is over a decade old speaks for itself. It's a niche game for sure, made before a time that games like Star Citizen were possible. It focuses on medium and large scale PvP perma-loss combat and there is nothing else like it on the multiplayer gaming market. But that would be selling it short, Eve Online is far more than just the sum of its parts.What sets Eve Online apart from every other game is its unique community. It's both well-established but extremely welcoming of new players. Eve features one of the most political player driven environments available, complete with under-the-table deals, backstabbing, high-rolling casino warlords, mercenaries and more. There are player rivalries that have lasted over a decade and things only seem to escalate as time goes on.If you try out Eve Online be sure to join a player run corporation once you have the basics down. You'll get to experience Eve like it's meant to be played by putting in the effort to play the game with others. Without the community it would truly just be spreadsheets in space			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Ignore my play time on Steam because I have played the game on an non-Steam client. I have been playing the game on and off since 2008.Now that's out of the way I'll keep it short. There are 3 main things you have to do to play Eve and have fun:- You will have to invest time. This game has a tremendous learning curve. It is much much MUCH higher than most other MMOs. It is a completely player driven world with its own rules, own history, own professions, own market, own culture, own geography and own community. You will need to learn lots of new♥♥♥♥♥♥ You will have to commit time.-You will have to invest money. Eve do not have microtransactions but you will need to sub. Alpha state (free to play state) is ridiculously restrictive and only good for introducing people to the game. You can't stay in alpha and have fun forever. You may be able to pay your sub with in-game money someday but it will not happen soon. You will have to sub to play it properly.-You will have to interact with people. Eve is a sanbox game, completely different from theme park MMOs where someone is always telling you what to do and where to go next. It is player-driven world, military alliances, commercial corporations, production, market, exploration, building/destroying; everything is handled by players. You will have to interact with people, join corporations, participate in market pvp, avoid scams, join organizations etc. to have fun. Playing Eve solo is usually not rewarding and gets boring fast. You will have to communicate with people.If you acknowledge these three points and still want to experience the biggest player-driven virtual world the gaming has ever seen, you should give it a chance. There is no game near the scale of Eve online out there. No game offers such strategy, organization and cooperation where thousands of players get together for common goals and shape the game world. Take into account the points above so that you can keep your insults to the game for yourself in case you don't like it and move on to other games more suitable for you.Also, don't fly what you can't afford to lose.Peace out.

												If you ever end up in the gutter without employment, a girlfriend/boyfriend or any form of prospects then THIS IS THE GAME FOR YOU. No Seriously, its a game like no other and gives you all the healthy simulation of actually being at work; Sometimes you get to do fun things, you get to interact and socialise with people, you get tasks to undertake and get a sense of achievement just like most form of employment. However most of the time your (litterally) stareing into space, looking out of the window and wondering where it all went wrong. Eve Online is the ultimate timesink and not in a bad way. If you have nowhere to go during the day or friends then absolutely put down you hard cash and give it a whirl. I would actually really recommend this, it kept me sane during my last period of unemployment. Everyone else is better off staying away and waiting for the P45 in the post before diving in.

												An interesting game but plagued by a horible and toxic community, where scamming, griefing and even online bulling is at home. So bad that a nice concept was destroyed by the horrible in game interactions allowed and even encouraged by the producer... If you are not a sadist or a masochist and you just look for a way to spend your free time and relax with nice people, then this is not a game for you.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Great:True sandbox: do whatever your want. Almost everything is built by players.Incredible UI design: it's one of the few games with a solid futuristic interface.Project Discovery mini-game is addicting, educational, and actually helpful to the academic community outside the game.Newbie global chat where veterans answer all sorts of questions.Great and intuitive character creation tool.Fantastic atmosphere. There's a great sense of wonder and exploration when you are first dropped into the game.Awful:Emptyness and repetition: most stations look exactly the same, inside and outside. Each region is a big empty skybox. Asteroids look all the same. Missions are mostly boring.Your character is just a tiny portrait next to your name. Walking around the station is a single-player experience in confined quarters.Endless grinding, both while online and offline. Training the necessary skills to get anywhere relevant takes literal years.The actual gameplay is awfully uninspired and boring. Mining, fighting, warping: it's all just a mouse click on a menu button.The greatness of EVE lies on its metagame, not on the game itself. And, unfortunately, you're not going to touch the high level metagame unless you had already been playing for years.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												If you are looking for a free to play game this isn't it. The amount of content you have access to vs the paid players can be partially summed up with the image below.http://steamcommunity.com/id/grhayes/screenshots/?appid=8500&sort=newestfirst&browsefilter=myfiles&view=imagewallYou also don't have to ability to progress in skills as well beyond a certain point. In all your access to content is on the order of 1% or less.I wouldn't call this game free to play. Its like giving someone a spoons worth of soup out of a bowl and calling it a free bowl of soup.I'd suggest they move over to a marketing model that works around people paying for stuff to customize ships, characters, and so on. Stuff that doesn't actually affect game play. Then maybe offer boosts or even paid insurance and other stuff.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Well the first part was fun learning to play. Then, for me, it was just die and die again. The Pademic Horde was at every lowsec jump point ganking people. I tried for 2 days to get into lowsec without dying instantly or very shortly after arriving. New player have ZERO chance at all. You MUST sign up with an Corp and get a % of all your earnings taken away with little to no benefit. The existing Corp will be busy helping the Veterans so you will still be left to fend for yourself.You can't play this game solo at all. I was in starting ships and was constantly attacked. Why go for beginners that will yeild very low profits? It is a one sided game and you will never be able to catch up to older players NEVER. Let the game die. It does nothing to help new players. You are subject to Veterans whim at every jump point. Honestly it is unfair and completel pay 2 win. Because you can just spend $$ for skills and money. You can't ""pilot"" your ship. It more of an Age of Empire style play click and wait for troops or ship to show up. NOT A SPACE SIM! I got fed up with being ganked by Pademic buttfutters. I for one will not play....... let the game die it the communities own fault. Enjoy being destroyed by veterans constantly. My beginner ships jumps to an asteroid in low sec .4. I get hit with warp disruptor andthen 1 shot killed. YEAH REAL FUN What a joke of a game.			",24,3,0,2,1,0,1

												time spent playing Eve >>> 17.3 hrs last two weeks /7,047.2 hrs on record <<<     enough said   cept  this pc was in the shop for 10 days.Also note with an Eve subscription you are in a sence always playing as your character(of the moment)  will most probably  be in training while you are off line. So in reality I personaly haven't anymore than probably 2-3 thousand hours of online play time.Many others in the game have much more.Eve is another life to live and if you're bored with making money while mining or making things and or inventing things then you just hop into your  fav warship and go off alone or with friends and kill things or other people (and you can make money doing that also).

												EVE Online is that kind of awkward game that while making over 10 million of dollars every month, still only manages to give out updates guised as ""expansion packs"" that only has a handful of features once every year that any half-arsed small indie team could be blowing out on a weekly basis as every single person ""playing"" this game is essentially just waiting around. The reason for this existing is that Eve Online, simply put, struck gold at the time. And as such, the producers and everyone financially involved in the game are utterly terrified of increasing any kind of spending or significant change.It has an incredibly dumb and seemingly 98% automated combat with no real actual freedom of movement, most design decisions made for the game are overly complex methods of developing certain systems and methods of doing things which while something i can personally enjoy since I've been around for quite some time, It shows that the developers are struggling under both pressure from compatibility of current times and producers. Another note is that this game is more expensive to subscribe for one month than it is to buy a new copy. And that's quite frightening.In short, Eve Online as of right now, is an unfocused pile of garbage, trying to draw out It's filthy breath for as long as possible before everyone paying for it suddenly realize that everything they see and experience are over 10+ year old byproducts of engine limitations and as described above, It will continue to do so until the cost to gain ratio declines. The ""official"" set in place deadline for Eve to cease existing is in about 20-30 years according to CCP.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Ok, to all those who said I'd hate this....you're right,25 hours in and I officially don't give a sh*t. It's a pointless waste of time and can best be summarised as 'Waiting for days to elapse in space'Yes, there is clearly a 'real world economy' and my God is it....probably detailed. Oh and the ships! Everything is generated in game, if there is something you see....a player built it! Isn't that amazing?!These are the things that drew me to EVE, however after spending 25 hours, over a solid day of my actual life on this garbage I am about as close and involved to the EVE economy as a 25 hour old baby would be to the human one. It's spreadsheets and being a dickh*ad in space. There really is very little nuance beyond this. The whole thing plays like a space stock trader game....ok not the end of the world, right? I still think I could get into that, hopefully there is some action and excitement to make it 'feel' like a game whilst you are actually gathering resources to trade, right? Nope, for all this 'It's a griefing paradise' that I was promised, I barely saw another ship. 25 hours in, few other ships, few missions - lots of clicking around and waiting for actual time to elapse to build my skills up. That's another thing worth considering - this game charges a monthly fee. You can only 'level up' by waiting. Not even waiting 'in game' time, waiting real life, human hours that you could spend walking your dog, shouting at your wife or playing anything that isn't this drab attempt at making Excel fascinating. You get better exclusively by paying them money, and waiting. I wanted the sweet economy thing to be true so badly. I even talked down other MMOs because 'EVE has this amazing online economy' and it does, it's clearly going on. I have never come across a game less accessible than this. EVE fans tout this as though it's some great selling point, however I think what's actually going on is people who have invested thousands of hours into this dross now need to convince themselves that it wasn't time wasted. If you haven't already invested a thousand hours, and if you're in any way normal, just don't bother. Jesus Christ this is tedious.If you've got a thousand hours, £120 and a strong desire to be part of the biggest game of spreadsheets in the world, then yeah you can probably watch your summer vanish whilst living your life in fake space.

Product received for free
												The game would fail to start up after the patcher when opened through steam and the only way I could access my steam account was by launching it through steam becuase CCP thought it would be an Idea not to give steam users a discreet login. The game would work fine when starting up from the file browser but didn't work through steam and I had no access to my steam EVE account.Not only that but the way CCP handles the accounts is just plain awful; If you want to get it on steam, you need a new account irregardles of whether you had an account before that or not. This includes the recent free time they gave away on steam that could only be applied to a fresh steam account, despite them saying that you could apply it to an old account. A free trial I didn't even get to enjoy (I was considering buying it) becuase the game wouldn't launch through steam, which was the only way to access my steam account, which was the only account that I could apply the free time to.

												TL;DR Game has a terrible community that drives away newer players.Long Version, for newer players, this game is a catch 22. You need isk to get the things you need, but you cant get the isk without the things you need. Mining, exploration, ect... Doing any of this in high or low sec is usless. You will simply not be able to make enough money. HOWEVER, combatant or not, the second you are spotted in null sec you will be hunted down and murdered. This is a new player unfriendly game with the community preventing any progress. In the end, it's no wonder that this game is dying. I highly doubt this game will survive another year or two, and it will DEFFINATLY not survive past 3 more years unless the creators decide to do something to pretect newer players and allow them to advance in the game.

												Not noob friendly.UI is aweful and hard to navigate.UI blasts information at you with no context so you have no idea what it means. The tutorial is broken and leaves the player wandering what to do and stuck.Prices are too high or low level items are so hard to find.Too much effort to get just the basic stuff. Not even minecraft requires this much digging for a better pickaxe. Do you enjoy mining? Well guess what you'll be doing for the first three hours of the game.""Non-Capsuleer"" NPC's might attack you for no reason.The game will pentalize you with no explaination. (this is what broke me)Online help is so detailed that the majority of the game play is actually learning how to play the game.Finaling it's boring boring boring.

 THIS IS A PVP GAME. A PVP THAT YOU CANNOT AVOIDIf you are not seeking for pvp. Leave this game and comment section alone please.-Yes game is difficult for newbies. However it kinda simulates the real life. It's highly social massive multiplayer game. Variety of personalities of people are so wide. Yes bullying is legal. You gotta find a shelter. Yes there are shelters. This is not a single player game. I see people cursing pvp in this game. Because they are afraid of facing real skilled people. They like NPC's. They are same in every mmo like WoW etc. They like playing in peace and looking for a fair fairy tale world. Eve online is not like other mmo's that let you play in pure pve servers. So I warn you once again, do not play this game if you don't like PVP. This game doesn't offer you a fair PVP environment as well. Bullying is legal, smurfing is legal. Otherwise you'll come here and cry after 1k hours of gameplay, because pirates shot your ship. Yes it happens mate, because they are pirates and there are many ways to overcome this issue. Plese go play Sims in peace.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												First to get this outta the way with, I AM aware of the sickening gankers, and other types of socialpathic mischaps, but lets get this outta the way with, because i've been flooded by messages about how this game is.This game should be considered something not easy to accomplish. The game is a pay2pay game, if you don't follow: After you pay for a starter pack on steam, you must pay monthly subscriptions, or try getting an item named ""PLEX"" (Pilot License EXtension.)For those who don't know what PLEX is, and how expensive it is read on below:- PLEX is an item which allows you to gain one month of gametime or to be redeemed for one of the rewards below:  - Gain 3500 AURUM, a currency which allows you to buy Ship skins, and Character clothing, and other services (see below)  - Gain 30 days of a ""Multiple Training Certificate"". If multiple characters are used (to a max of 3) on a single account, and you want to train both characters, the ""Multiple Training Certificate"" gives you an additional training queue. Under  no circumstances you may train 2 skills at once on a single character.Now that PLEX is out of the way with, i want to talk about the statistics of how money is being made, and how easy this ""PLEX"" is availible to get.""PLEX"" at the moment of writing scales from 1 Billion ""ISK"" (Ingame Currency: InterStellar Kredit), to 1.5 Billion ""ISK"". ""ISK"" is relatively easy to get in small numbers (especially with project exploration, if youre willing to be bored to death), but getting something about 1 Billion in ISK is something very hard to accomplish.It is very hard to explain how this game works (VEEERRRYYY STEEEEEEPPP LEARNING CURVE), but as far as i know, theres 4 main roles in the game (as stated in special edition tab):- You can be a skirmisher, who runs through ""combat sites"" to eliminate bad ships (PvE) and gain loot in exchange. I am not familiar with this, because i never took this path.- You can be an explorer, someone who traces down space anomalies (Wormholes, Data sites: Read down below, Relic Sites), ""hack"" the sites, and gain (expensive) loot in exchange. This is quite a hard path to go down, because it takes a lot of money to get the equipment to be prepared for this.- You can be a colonist (youre not really ""the colonist""), which ""colonizes"" (more kinda industrialises) planets and exploits them in order to gain materials, which can be processed at the planet into end-products, which are worth quite a couple of ISK on the market.- You can be a industrialist, which mines asteroids (ore can be sold directly) for use in blueprints, whereoff the end product results in either a ship, a module, or whatever you can come up with, as long as its nothing out of the ordinary (Special (event) loot)But its quite hard to get started as i stated before. It takes a lot of time to get the starting skills trained (Skill system), even with the Prototype Cerebum you'll get from start (A one-time use item, which you can't buy, which speeds up training speed considerably). Training times can scale up to 1 MONTH, which basically means you should've either sold your ""PLEX"" by then (to speed up using skill injectors, for ~667 MILLION ISK) or you would've used your first ""PLEX"" by then.So, i wouldn't recommend this to the average player, unless youre sitting on a pile of cash, and you want to pay your first 12 months training skills using the subscription system. DO NOT (unless you want a lot of ISK at once) BUY PLEX, because its a LOT more expensive than actually taking a subscription.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Listen, this is a stellar game, I mean that in every sense of the word. I am very happy with the gameplay and the way the game works. I am also on the verge of quitting for life because it's so incredibly dull and even though I see everything I want - it's just temptation. For Free 2 Play, this says subscribe me like crazy. Eve was better off sticking to the subscription mandate and leaving me in the dust when i swore them off. I mean, I came back because of the free to play being a thing; only to realize how terrible the free 2 play aspect was. I'm not sayin' this is a bad game, I just can't rightly justify $20 a month on this when I could easily afford another game with that money that has no expiry on content and is /much/ better suited to my playstyle. If it wasn't such a huge risk to PvP I might enjoy it more, but really when your stuck mining forever and never even make money off your trade deals because everything worth having is essentially 1 BILLION ISK...you do the math. I just can't stand losing money on this game and the free 2 play aspect is kinda harshly limited...They did better back when they only gave you 30 days to play for free (atleast then you got EVERYTHING for those 30 days)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

How is that something not to like?People say the grind is unreal, no its real and that is why they complain so much.     EVE Online for me is Firefly in space and it is as brutal.

												A great intersteller expierence. You may be sitting in a space station for hours or shooting lasers at rocks to fund your internet spaceships, but once you delve into the game a bit further learning all the basics and even the advanced stuff it becomes quite an experience and one that hasn't been provided from current gen games. Everything in this game is player based which creates for some interesting and dynamic scenerios. Want to just shoot lasers and rockets at one another? Well do it you're in space what else are you going to do...wait oh♥♥♥♥♥♥you can do more actually... space lol; you could seriously just mine rocks all day long and play the market like you are Leonardo Di Caprio in that Wall street movie thats coming out. Like seriously, you can do whatever the hell you want. You like space drugs? harvest that♥♥♥♥♥♥and smoke it, crazy ♥♥♥♥ing learning boost(do space drugs kids). You like pirating haulers for their precious booty(cargo or their actual booty)? Do it, I dare you. You want to make someone your ♥♥♥♥♥ and camp them until they rethink their life choices of investing in this game to the point where they contemplate to cross dress and wanting a sex changing operation payed for by their parents?

												Very dissatisfied with this game. Even tho it delivers an amazing amount of diversity, details, an entirely different approach to gaming i would not recommend this game.In my opinion it lacks any endgame, it feels like a great framework for a story to be implemented. Community is quite friendly and helpful... afterall this game aged kinda well, runs on old computers and still features an acceptable amount of eyecandy.I feel that if someone were to learn from eve how to make games that actually offer an appealing amount of diversity and would mix it with more appealing kind of endgame - you'd instantly land a hit.I am really into mmos, WoW initially pulled me in, but I haven't yet found anything that comes close to the experience of early WoW, but admittedly this one brought me close to believing it would be a successor to WoW - something I haven't encountered before.This game will allow you to play less than a typical MMORPG, but might pull you in just as much.Also - keep an eye out - subscription based payment does autorenew.

												I've made several attempts to try and get into this game, the ONLY way to play this game is by forcing you into a corporation of people you hardly no. New players are given garbge, and if you want to actually make decent money on your own forget about it. You'll go to low security all excited with the progress you've made, just to have another player com into your zone, lock you the ♥♥♥♥ down, and destroy you with ease when you can't do a single thing about it, your just done. I'm about done wasting my time on this game trying to actually make an attempt to enjoy it, just because of its mechanics it should seriously be a free to play game because it is a painful game to play and ends up being more of a chore than actual enjoyment. I'm not going to spend $15 a month to have my Eve game in the background in a high security zone mining for hours of end without needed to lift a finger to do any actual work JUST to make safely make money.

												Known as Spreadsheet Simulator...Eve Online is one of the most advanced, tactical / strategic starship strategy MMORPG/RTS out there, whether you prefer to fight in PvE against a wealth of AI missions, encounters, deadspace zones, or incursions of pirates swarming from the dark sector, Eve Online both rewards players for their PvE / PvP Style of gameplay. A True Market;Everything in the Eve Online community, from ships, weapons, technology, research, and equipment are player manufactured, found, or created, less than 1% of items in the game are procedurely generated to assist players in their skills and general manufacturing processes. As the value of ores and materials change, so do the costs of ships, equipment and items, a true inspirational community market of unsurpassed genius and integrity. No one person dominates the the market. With thousands of places to shop, 4 player driven / founded market sectors, players will have no problems finding the resources or items they need at a reasonible price. Real Skills / Real Time / Real Changes:In Eve there are no levels, there are no experience points for destroying enemy AI's or players, there is simply time and money, as you go around killing other ships and players their ingame money system (ISK) is token to you in bounties and rewards depending upon who and what you kill. Reputation is your experience in Eve, for everything you do, if felt positively in the nation you fight for, and negatively in the nation you fight against. Skills in the game drive how quickly and how effectively you use items and ships in the game. Having more than 1,000 skills, each requiring real world time to develope, but have no fear even the time you are logged off of Eve still contributes to the learning process of skills. 30 Days of Membership means 30days of Skill Training provided you log in to change your queue of skills being learned. Real Skills / Real Time / Real Consequences:Skills aren't everything, how you setup your ship, events that play out on the battlefield, and the people you fly with can change everything, in Eve, even the most robust and wealthiest player can be taken down by the most noobish and uncoordinated player depending upon how you play.Unparrelled PvP Fleets and Squad Honor:Eve Onlines PvP Fleet / Squad System is known far and wide for its companionship, real world leaders of both men, experienced and unexperienced, leading people into the fray, giving orders and handling issues while under pressure define some of the best combat experience fleet organization and player PvP Battles you will ever immerse yourself in. There is only one rule, The Fleet Commander says Jump, you jump, and don't jump early, don't jump late, and whatever you do, don't rebel, or you'll find yourself in a pod, slow boating it back to secure space praying you remembered to upgrade your clone. Rating:Not for Level Junkies, not for young players intent on showing off, Eve is for the mature, action driven player that wants to change something in the world. There is only one server and your choices are felt across it like a stone in a pool of water. Will they be good choices, or will they be bad, who's to say, join the Eve Online Community today and find out for yourself.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Where do I even start with a game like EVE Online? This game is really like no other. I have seen and experienced things that I have never in any other massive multiplayer game. I tip my hat to CCP in their ongoing development of this title. A decade strong, and they are still pumping out one or two expansions per year.Now, what to actually say about this game. You spend your first week playing the game learning the basics of how to navigate through New Eden, but the learning doesn't stop there. When I say basics, I really mean the basics. Once, you're released into to universe you come out with a puffed chest and you feel like the world is your oyster (and it really can be!). You jump into a corporation or you start one, and you begin your journey. You, the player, are in control of everything that you decide to do. You can train up your security-based skills and head out on missions to burn pirates & and make some ISK. OR you can head off into the pvp realm of the game and bring chaos and disorder amongst your fellow capsuleers. Maybe you have a mind for business so you set up contracts and buy/sell orders on the market, and rake in the ISK. Maybe you like to work and explore, so you load up your mining/salvage vessel and you head out into the far reaches of space and look for the ""mother-load"". It's really all up to you, and that is just part of what makes EVE such a fantastic game.Then there's the under side of the coin. Flip that over and you find that you have not only opened Pandora's box, but you are neck deep in the worst way. Remember that oyster that you thought was yours at the end of your training days? Yeah, you find that you don't want it anymore. You hate it. You despise it. EVE Online is a great game to play, and the things I listed out earlier really are fun and prosperous, but those same exact things are what can get you into trouble. That's right, this game is so community driven, and cut-throat that you never know who to trust out in the stars. You could have a really great operation going, but if you irk the wrong person or even maybe just pass by the wrong person at the wrong time, then you could potentially watch everything that you've done crumble before your very eyes. Now, this may really make you think, ""Yeah, I don't want that to happen. So what's the point if you are just going to lose it all?"" I agree, it sounds so wrong, and unappealling, but you have to accept that eventually your empire will crumble into ash. The beauty of it though is that this happens to everyone. No one in EVE Online is a god amongst ants. Sometimes, you'll see a situation that feels that way, but there will always be someone else who will topple everything over. It's all a matter of how you take your steps, and how you act accordingly.All in all, I know that this game isn't for everyone, but I at least encourage everyone to give it a shot for a couple months. If you don't like it and you can't handle the cut-throat aspects of the game, then that's fine. We understand, and it's probably best that you aren't among us. Otherwise, if you find that you really like the game and want to amass your fleets to take on all of New Eden, then well, all I have to say isWelcome to the stars.-Evalyn Vaeltros, CEO Modal Auxiliaries			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												If you are new to Eve you WILL find it a daunting prospect.  The tutorials ease you into the basics and are a lot better now than they used to be.  Do them all, don't miss any and at the end of them you will have some useful skills, more skillbooks waiting to be activated and a few frigates along with a destroyer if you complete the advanced combat tutorial.  Also, don't skip the mission text.  Many new players get stuck because they couldn't be bothered reading.  After the tutorials take a breather, relax, sit back and really think about what you want to achieve because specialisation is key.  If you want to make millions as a miner then take the time to look at which ships are specialised for that career, what skills you need to fly it and what skills you need to equip it correctly, like the ability to control drones etc.The most useful piece of advice I can give is to find a good corp.  Don't be shy, put yourself out there.  Find a corp that will help you realise your vision and in turn you will become a vital part of theirs.  The real fun is down in 0.0 space and you need friends for that ( unless of course deep cover and stealth is your thing ) :P			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												While the F2P addition is nice, CCP still don't understand what F2P actually means. With this update, they're just being like World of Warcraft, allowing players to play up to a certain point, and then charging them if they want to get to another level. It's just plain ridiculous. CCP should learn from Elder Scrolls Online. While it is not free, at least they don't require any form of subscription to play the game. Contents that are considered to be DLCs in normal games are optional, not really affecting the game in any way, thus allowing people to play the game without getting harassed on subscription fees every few months or so. They need to get themselves together & decide which path they wanna follow. World of Warcraft isn't exactly flourising like it was 10 years ago, and EVE Online will not do any better unless you, CCP, decide to either go with ESO-style, or totally F2P.

												Spreadsheet Stimulator. I would play this game so much more but the monthly cost is the only holding me back. It has everything a Sci-Fi lover would want plus more. The entire market place is run by players, which is good and bad. You get galactic started by corporations for their own gain and can even have wars with other corporations over areas for control. All of this is player controlled. EvE has something for every player because if you just want to be playing the game by completing AI controlled missions you can. Want to just mine minerals to sell and make a massive profit you can do that. You have full control of how you want to play.			",364,60,10,22,20,7,56

												This is not a fun or enjoyable game. I don't understand how people can enjoy this game. It's slow, tedious, a poor story, overly difficult, and has an impossibly steep learning curve with a horrible tutorial. It is well constructed with not many visible bugs, but it completely misses the point of actually being FUN.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Although the game does have a steep learning curve (i have to admit that i didn't know what the hell i was doing for the first couple of hours) after giving it some time it does grow on you especially if you spend enough time to understand its numerous functions. However the monthly subscribtion , at least for me, is completely unacceptable. I could accept paying 30-40 $ for the game upfront and even give 10-20 $ a year for major expansions but spending 15 $ per month or 130 $ a year is just too much. If the company reconsiders its pricing policy i would eagerly jump right back in the world of EVE online however as it stands right now i just can't. Some people might find it strange that i give the game a thumbs up but besides the monthly subscribtion i really liked this game.			",71,13,0,26,23,0,39

												This is one of those games that divides people. If you like instant action and little thought, then this won't be for you. This is a slow-burning, strategic game. There is plenty of action, but you have to prepare properley, otherwise death is all too easy. The population tends to be, on average, older than most MMO's as well, probably because of the nature of the game, patience is required if you want to progress. It is a vibrant community, and the game structure lends itself to community action more than any other game. It is a sandbox type of game, giving the user a whole universe to play in, but also a myriad of professions to take up. Even after several month of playing, I am still learning new things about the trades I have specialised in. The game has also expanded in many ways over the years, leading to more diversity and a richer universe, with more to come. The design is also incredible, with iconic ships following a set style depe.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The amount of content in this is comparable to Dwarf Fortress, but the learning curve is less so. Reccomended highly with a group of expirienced players in a corporation, and a wiki on a separate device (Becuase we all know how badass it is on both monitors). If the fee is a problem for the first little while, don't worry. PLEX becomes affordable in-game as soon as you have the initiative to get it. Read up first and you'll love EVE online. Plus, can't go wrong with a trial week.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I managed to play this game thanks to the Steam sale and i liked it as it was rather laid back and chill. I did not prolong my subscription just because i do not have the time to play these days but made it quite far within a month. I took the miners path and made it quite far within the time i spent in it. But as far as i know i managed to cover like a few per cent of the game content so this game is huge. The risk factor of losing your precious ships surely makes this a dramatic game.Allows for a lot of flexibility in terms of weather you go for risk and rewards or take the more careful approach.

												It's a different world entirely. And I like it.Learning curve is hard and even though they are experimenting with tutorials and opportunities, you probably need someone to guide you into the game. Once you have found a great corporation (clan) and figured out what you would like to do in EVE, you will probably enjoy this game. The economy is best I have ever seen in a video game, and space battles are great even though you control your ship via clicking buttons instead of a joystick.And sometimes you wake up 3 AM just to shoot couple hours a POS (Player Owned Station) with your friends to get the phat loot.Recommended.

												Game is heavily based on lore and instructional commands that lead to auto pilot/action. Once the beginning tutorial sequence is completed through mostly instruction induced automated actions, the player then will choose what kind of role/job for the set of missions. Then the rest of the game is based on those jobs/missions. You will get more spaceships along the way during the tutorial and jobs/missions. During those jobs/missions, the player can play solo or encounter other ambushed players either with or without being in a corporation or group. I think the game is not the most popular anymore because it is too much lore based automation instead of real world action as you would see in most other games. Also there is too much auxillary functions/options/upgrades that can be a little bit overwhelming for new players. But this game is one of a kind and only similar to the not-yet-released SC. But as a very popular free game, definitely everyone should try this out to be better prepared for other games such as SC or FS, etc.			",7,0,0,2,1,0,2

												READ MY REVIEW IT IS IMPORTANT IF YOU'VE NEVER PLAYED BEFORE!This game is very tactical. if you are like me i would not purchase it unless you are a decent tactican or willing to do the searches for groups and gangs online that are willing to take you in. This game will take all your money away in a heart beat. At the same time it could make you richer then you'd ever imagine. This is one of the few games thats ingame economy is supported outside of it. You can turn few million Isk into a decent profit if you Know how. If you are below the age of 14 or you're more of a charge in solo player then Please stay away. This game is subscription and already filled with insanely strong players. I do not know the total of player which have the max level ship but I do know there are stories of EVE Online player who lost a little over 400K if not more from this game. Not because they put the money into it. But because they made that 400k worth on there profile. This is why i said it can make you rich or take away your life savings... or your parents for some peoples case. Do i think the game is good. Eh. I thing elite dangerous is better but again you cant compare them. Do i think the community is good? half-half. There are the dudes are way to powerful to waste a single railgun shot on you or anyone else below there level and are more then willing to help at the cost you aint a ♥♥♥♥♥ and you'll be respectful to the top dog (aka them) and then there are the serious♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥bags that have alt accounts and multi box by ramming another low level starter ship into you commiting suicide just so another ship of theres that isnt wanted by the damn space police and swoop in. Steal your cargo. Sell it. And not  worry about the space cops or any other player knowing they are dangerous. Please beware purchasing it. For all that it is worth to EVE players shaking there heads at my review. Im upvoting this regardless because I know how much this game has done for some people. But remember how much it has TAKEN from certain people			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												♥♥♥♥ you all EVE is a ♥♥♥♥ing great game! And here's why: ""EVE is the most beautiful and sexy woman ever, but every now and again she kicks you in the balls for no reason. -CyberJanus 2017""So EVE has a HUGE open world which personally I absolutely love to bits, and just to add to the exitement you roam around in big♥♥♥♥♥battleships just to♥♥♥♥♥♥of all the poor ♥♥♥♥s on the game. Now some of you might be thinking ""Oh but there's no man's sky for that!"" ♥♥♥♥ THAT♥♥♥♥♥♥ EVE Allows you to pretty much do anything you wish from mining, planetary interaction, and even PvP battles where there are thousands of people involved. Something very interesting is the EVE Market. Now this is where you can make money lose money and even get scammed. Yeah I said it scammed. It's quite a big part of the game and there are many players who use it to their advantage, gaining from other peoples misery. This is personally the best part of EVE. The PvP as solo players or corporations form together and go to kill one another, reaping the rewards if they manage to survive the hell they intend of initiating in. Make it or break it. It's one hell of a sight.The Graphics in EVE are spectacular with many astonishing views. Look I've been waiting to be introduced to a game like this for 18 years of my ♥♥♥♥ing life. I'm glad I FINALLY get to play it. Overall Great game but may take a little bit to get into at first. Advice: Don't be a♥♥♥♥♥ Stick with that♥♥♥♥♥♥			",37,3,0,4,4,0,1

												I'd say this game is an aquired taste. I started playing and really couldn't get into it but something clicked when i lost my first ship to a player. It felt like there was so much more than the mining I was constantly doing. Towards the end of my trial i wanted to get all my friends on. The F2P option is NOT for the person who really wants to get into pvp or really anything. The ships and skills you can use are way to minimal to keep you competitive in the market or in combat. The alphas (F2P) are accepted into some corps but are really only meant for the supper casual players or people who are unsure of if they want to play the game or not. I'd recommend if you want a real taste of the game and you feel like you will like it then buy a month of membership and see how it is. I have been playing since may 2016 and i have just made my first alt through steam and the game is constantly getting better. Fly Safe o7			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Yes I  recommend this game.....maybe. And that is a strong maybe. A very strong maybe. Such a strong maybe that if they had a maybe tab I would choose it. I would also choose the ""Pay a monthly fee to get your ship blown to bits by some useless prick coward"" tab as well. If they had a ""Then spend the next few weeks trying to get your ship back to what it was just to have some prick NPC blow it out of the sky because the warning they gave you lasted 0.1 seconds"" tab. I would also pick the ""then get hounded by dickless wonders when you ask what happened because you should have known because they knew"" tab.get what I am saying....To enjoy the game stay away from useless prick cowards. Which is really hard since the game is filled with them. And I mean filled with them. Not as much a WoW is today, but it ranks up in the top Anal Category.			",132,15,1,25,20,2,25

I see how boring it is. and even with subscribtion you can buy ingame money for real money, you have timed skill upgrade (wtf? to keep me playing?).it doesn't worth 6$ even w/o subscribtion. 15$/m is insult.but again, i would not play it even for free.

												Game is heavily based on lore and instructional commands that lead to auto pilot/action. Once the beginning tutorial sequence is completed through mostly instruction induced automated actions, the player then will choose what kind of role/job for the set of missions. Then the rest of the game is based on those jobs/missions. You will get more spaceships along the way during the tutorial and jobs/missions. During those jobs/missions, the player can play solo or encounter other ambushed players either with or without being in a corporation or group. I think the game is not the most popular anymore because it is too much lore based automation instead of real world action as you would see in most other games. Also there is too much auxillary functions/options/upgrades that can be a little bit overwhelming for new players. But this game is one of a kind and only similar to the not-yet-released SC. But as a very popular free game, definitely everyone should try this out to be better prepared for other games such as SC or FS, etc.			",7,0,0,2,1,0,2

												The mist boring experiences in gaming, punctuated by some of the most fun I've ever had. Your choices have real consequence, and the fear in the pit of my stomach  when I venture into dangerous space is real. But the task of developing your skills and funds to pay for the great interactions requires real investment of time. EVE is a game of high complexity that will reward those willing to invest the time. And for what it's worth, the feeling of splice exploration, and of SCALE, is simply incredible.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
