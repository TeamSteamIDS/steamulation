												This game is quite flawed, walk into it knowing that. The first thing I did (as I do with most games) is open whatever configuration options the game makes available, and unfortunately for us, the graphics options leave much to be desired. The configuration screen seems more to set your resolution and generic quality dropboxes than tweak the game to work on your system. Thankfully, most PCs should be able to run this fine (I run it at a native 1366x768 at High on a laptop released two or so years ago) and it looks quite nice.This is also a game you must play with attention paid to the story. The game has excellent writing and a sense of humour that gets me every time. Heck, the tutorial teaches you how to play by telling you to ruin this world's version of Christmas, and then the main game encourages you to go seal clubbing. The great writing often carries the game through rougher bits, like the odd graphical glitches that can cause a minion's eyes to momentarily dislodge from its body or the wonky minion AI that compels my Reds to walk up and punch the vicious hunter. But playing as many glitchy, underpolished games as I have rather immunizes me to these kinds of things so I can look past them and still find the plethora of fun.Many improvements have been made over the first. For instance, the player is now a dangerous force in combat, spells are much more useful, and minions are less inclined to drown themselves. Minor nigglings like the amount of effort needed to craft weapons have been addressed, and minions have much more personality now. In fact, you can even choose to have certain favourites come back from death, and you ca track the title and level of each throughout the course of the game. It makes equipping certain minions less of gamble because you don't lose the fancy gladius when Beezer the Seal Slayer gets mauled out in the field.Overall, Overlord II is a game you need to adjust your expectations for. It's not the most complicated game (puzzles are often just assigning certain minions to a task) and the combat often devolves to chucking brown minions at anything that so much as breathes but it's the heart the game wears on its sleeve that makes it a worthwhile purchase. And at an impulse-friendly $10, it's not really that big of a ounch to the pocketbook if you walk away feeling unfulfilled with the game's antics.			",79,12,6,12,6,2,11

												This is a much bigger game that the original Overlord. Here you command war machines and ships. The areas are more detailed and offer more adventure. Also, your minnions can gain ""mounts"" to ride into battle. Brown, Green, and Red each get a unique mount. The is plenty of enjoyable fun. Some areas are better than others but I'm sure that will be a personal feeling for each player. I enjoyed the greatly expanded world. New play mechanics like ""minnion possession"" are really fun. The Overlord series is about enjoying yourself and ravaging the world with your minnion hordes. The ability to choose and combine 4 different types of minnions means every battle can be replayed countless times. I really liked these light-hearted Overlord games that always provide new challenges and keep player enjoyment foremost during the entire game. Replay for Overlord 2 is very high and honestly fun. This series is a big sleeper that many people missed but thanks to Steam you can enjoy the experience.I rate Overlord 2 and 8 out of 10.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Improved visuals, improved customizations and more interactive elements than just turning levers.I loved the addition of mounts for the brown, red and green minions but the blues didn't get a mount for some reason.One notable addition was the singing or caroling of the minions in a few occasions. I wish the game had more of these moments where the minions could hum marching tunes or random music to add an extra level of immersion to the game. You can revive lost minions but at a cost. I really liked this featured b/c reviving your minion that is wearing a peacock feathered helmet must always be part of any regal and feared minion formation.Only complaint I have with this one and it's predecessor is that the overlord walks too slow for me. I wish there was a way to improve its walking/running speed with either spells or equipment. Overall the game is solid and fun.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Score: 8/10The original Overlord game was essentially a cult classic and I gladly consider myself one of those that absolutely loved it. I actually prefer how the original game handled some of the aspects such as armor/weapon upgrades. The upgrade options make more sense, but I felt you had to grind for money way to often and just ended up almost skipping it entirely. The addition of mounts for your minions was actually amazing and probably the main thing that sets this game above the original. My main complaint with the game is honestly it just doesn't feel like it is as fleshed out as it could have been when it comes to things like controling the towns. I loved putting down a revolt, but since it only happens once per town it isn't even really a spoiler. The mistresses are handled the way they should be. The magic felt weak for some reason to me. The spells help and all, but I never really felt like an all poweful cast sacrifcing minions for personal gain. I enjoyed the idea of minion level up system and bringing back high levels from the dead, but to be honest I never used it.The game still has the same minion types as the original which is very balanced still. The tactics of killing commanders and using catepults was very enjoyable. The ability to mind control a minion and lead an assault or stealth mission was great. The games dark humor is always enjoyable. It still seems to have choices which are essentially evil vs chaos evil.The main thing that I wish it had more of was funny bosses like Melvin Underbelly from the original. I did als find it strange that blues never got a mount when I kept thinking they would get a frog or a slug mount. Overall the humor and variety of gameplay make it a neat nitch market title.

												I may be a bit bias with the Overlord franchise because I remember playing them when I was younger, but now, I feel they are better, I mean, they are so amazing, they are fun, innovative, and almost never repetitive, which is what so many suffer from, maybe it would be better in this context.Pros-FunInnovativeChallengingNever boringRPG elementsNice watching your ""EEEEEEVVVVVVILLLLLL EMPIRE SIRE"" grow into this gigantic, well empire.ConsCan be too difficultSometimes unfair.I hope you enjoyed my review, and my conclusion is, buy it, buy any of the Overlords, especially Overlord 2. :)			",167,9,1,15,12,0,7

												This game is an absolute classic and even though online multiplayer is dead, local co-op still works via Split Screen with a variety of modes, so if you want to plug a couple of controllers in and sit on the couch this is a great game for it.The jist of the game is that you're a dark child of destiny who can use magic and control imps, so you set out to get revenge on a town that cast you out, club baby seals to harvest their life force, rain firey death on innocent fairies, and build your netherworld dark tower. As you explore and get new minions and powers you can unlock things you previously couldn't access. Also if you decide you have a favorite minion, with enough life force you can bring them back.The game has an alignment system split between domination and destruction, so if you go around killing everyone and everything you meet you get destruction points and your armor changes and you become more destructive in combat. If you enslave everyone you meet, you get domination powers and your armor changes and you get better at enslaving and dominating things. You can also choose to walk the middle path and keep your default overlord armor and abilities, it's not a bad thing if you do.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												If you liked Overlord 1 you should get this one. I personally think Overlord 1 was better. You can read my review of Overlord 1 at http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198011310716/recommended/11450 Some differences from the 1st one:You can resurrect lost minions. I did find this take out the thrill of keeping your favorite minions alive.You can fight soldiers in formations, I found this a welcome addition because it created more warlike moments. Added mini-map. This helps you find your way around the world.No arena in the the PC version. I think this weakens the replay value of the game.			",31,7,0,18,9,1,30

												Honestly. this is my favorite game series. The first one was great, and so is this. The wii one was a tad short for my liking, but still fantastic and humorous like all the others. Dark jokes, sex appeal, getting to be evil and DESTROY EVERYTHING THAT IS GOOD IN THE WORLD AND MAKE IT BEND TO YOUR WILL. well what else could you ask for in a game. I do hope they make a 3rd game, i know they made horde of evil, where its like a 4 player version. It looks great, but a continuation of this type of game would be great as well. it might weird out the controls but some new minion types might be good, or might not, i mean new game mechanics would be a possiblity if there were more types of minions. I mean getting to control minions at certain points is awesome and so cool to do.			",353,91,6,46,39,6,43

I enjoyed it so much I played through to completion and lost a couple of days.The negative reviews I've read seem to be mostly people with tech issues, I had none (Win8).And if you played the first game you'll have had good practice at the controls, again I had no issues.If you have issues with camera sticking then quit squeezing your mouse so darn hard, just click again to reset, then click again to control.

												More of the same from Overlord 1, with some improvements, not enough improvements. The good stuff is still here, and the bad stuff is mostly still here.The good stuff:- Funny and fun game! The cheerful villainy of Overlord 1 is still here, with plenty of cheeky British humour and a parody of Tolkien tropes.- Controlling your minions is as fun as ever. They are a lively bunch, scooping over their targets in a frenzy, picking up helmets and swords and what not for their own use. Their delight in evil is hilarious and strangely endearing.- The four types of minions have different abilities, strengths and weaknesses. Acquiring each type is a quest in itself, and then you get to utilise them in various combat puzzles during the rest of the game.- If it's your thing (it's not my thing) you can customise your evil base, invest in different buffs and level up your gear and your minions. There's a whole metagame in there.- The story never takes itself too seriously, and the whole thing has a light, fun feel to it.- It's an open world, and you can switch between quests at your leisure, there's no linearity.- I'm glad there's now a minimap - Overlord 1 didn't have one and it was pain to navigate sometimes. Much better here.The bad stuff:- The minions might be fast and nimble, but your player character (the Overlord) is as slow and lumbering as he was in OL1. I get that it's supposed to be this way - you're the heavy tank and they're the quick little rogues - but your slowness is really tedious when much of your play time is spent slowly tromping from point to point. Yes there are portals, but not often enough.- Controls can be rather fiddly. You're trying to manage 4 different minion groups, setting waypoints, moving them around, while also moving yourself and fighting with your own weapons and spells.- I haven't finished the game. At least not as of this review. Maybe because I played OL1 and started this right away, but I got rather bored at some point. And the slow movement pace really doesn't help.----------------Overall, this gets a big recommendation from me. I suggest you start with playing Overlord 1: Raising Hell, then take a break, then start with Overlord 2.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Product received for free
Overlord 2 ReviewOverlord 2 pokes fun at the cliche video game protagonist and shows the world that being evil can be just as fun.Please ignore the low playtime, I accumulated offline gameplay time as I played it away from home.  Sorry I forgot to clarify :)Gameplay 5/10Overlord 2, despite having been released in 2009, still stands as an acceptable game 7 years since its initial release.  The player assumes control of the new Overlord, a manifestation of evil itself.  The game provides a variety of minions to the Overlord's disposal, each with their own role in combat.  The Overlord must enter the fray with his minions by his side to progress through the game.  Overlord 2 should work much better on console than on PC.  Reason being that the controls on PC are extremely janky and certain commands issued by the Overlord are obviously designed for an analog stick instead of a mouse.  Despite my difficulties controlling the minions, the majority of the game still served as a fun and humour-filled experience.Aside from the game's combat, the player is tasked with using the minions at his disposal to solve puzzles to progress through the level.  These puzzles are usually fairly simple and don't serve as too much of a challenge.That being said, the gameplay for Overlord 2 is merely slightly above average.  Not only were the controls for the mosue and keyboard extremely unpolished, but the lack of a proper waypoint became infuriating.  Overlord 2 gives no guidance to the player, not telling players where to go.  This becomes a problem as the player is allowed to backtrack on the map, which becomes incredibly confusing as the game lacks a waypoint system for marking quests.  ON the other hand, this encouraged me to do some more exploring, finding new items for upgrades along the way.  An overall enjoyable experience.Story/Lore 8/10Overlord 2 focuses heavily on parodying fairlytale elements, as seen with its comically ridiculous character models for the antagonists of the game as well as the voice acting.  I particularly enjoyed the hippy elf.  Anyway, the story of Overlord 2 should not be taken too seriously, as the game is extremely lighthearted and casual, so it should be treated as such.[h1/]Style 8/10[/h1]Overlord 2 pulls of its style almost flawlessly.  The presentation of the game's antagonists is comical and may yield a quick chuckle, regardless of what taste you have in humour.  The Overlord feels worshipped by his minions, the antagonists are properly portrayed as tree-hugging, ""soft and fluffy"" creatures.  Given the game's age, the visuals of the game shouldn't really be brought up, but for a game released in 2009, they're great.Pros+Stylish+Charming+Good story+UniqueCons-Difficult to navigate-Very slow progressionConclusionOverlord 2 takes pride in its unique and creative style, backed by a charming fairy-tale inspired story.  However, its gameplay lacks excitement and thrill.Rating: 21/30If you liked this review or want to see more recommended games, be sure to follow our curator group: Follow Original Curator Group ",102,15,5,9,5,0,3

												A proper sequel to Overlord: Raising Hell.And I specify Raising Hell, because it follows that particular story arch, where your predicessor is stuck in the Infernal Abyss and all the stuff that happened in the mean time.I really like the fact that, although a very short section at the start, you get to play as a little kid, the son of the previous Overlord. The game mechanics are similar but there's only so little you can do with magic. But I do love Evil pressence for the mind controlling.While in the wastelands it does show you what happened to the Halflings (which I found to be an awesome cameo) it doesn't explain what happened to the Dwarfs. A game like this, especially since it has Elves, needs Dwarfs.If you're sinister of mind, you are going to love this game, but I do insist you play Overlord and Raising Hell first because of the references tp those in Overlord 2. You won't understand them when you're presented with them.I give this game a 75/10!			",20,3,1,3,13,0,11

												I'll order by pros, cons, summary and conclusion to make this as uniform and readable as remotely possible. Spoilers have been omitted out of respect for those with prying eyes.+Minions are as nuts and jovial (albeit only to you/allies) as they've ever been+Absolutely gorgeous visuals compared to the first game+More original comic remarks from Gnarl and your mistresses to keep you chuckling, along with the hilarous antics of others complimenting the overall tone of the satisfying precipice to the game's inevitable cessation+The addition of numerous contraptions makes gameplay more interesting, and they're intiutive to use+Just like the first game, the music is fitting but not overbearing, but this time around much more memorable and even a treat to listen to out of the game+All of your spells are actually useful in this game+The pleasure of raining goblins on your opposers is still satisfying+They give you a map to end the days of monotonously wandering in circles+Satisfying ending-Whiplash-inducing story progression from the start-Minion AI is not really improved (will get to this), enemies the same story-Gets somewhat repetitive, slows down a lot (might I add the continuity was a bit broken)-As far as I know, there are two ways to easily get stuck and be forced to quit and load the last save-Less ""Overlordy"" than the first game (also covered ahead)-Without an expansion, despite trying to be less hub-like and more open-world, it still manages to be more linear than its predecessor-Can be a bit too complex for its own good with upgrades and collectiblesI absolutely love this game. Maybe not quite as much as the first one but I still love it. I admit, it really grew on me after some time. Just like in the original, you assume the role of an evil Sauron-lookalike and rain absolute hell on the world as you embark on a series of quests to ultimately subdue it. There is always the option of being a nice(r) guy but the primary goal is to be the nastiest SOB the land's ever seen. Story progression is quick, but it will, in turn, slow down considerably which can bore some. You're crossing stuff off a to-do list the whole time. Regardless of these shortcomings, I still consider myself part of the cult following the series has.Some nitpicking as referenced by the cons index:(1) Your minions are stupid, demented, unhinged, and unfathomably cute, but this is no excuse for their shortcomings. Targeting an object/enemy on a ledge is not worth attempting since your minion will probably run to the ledge, stare a bit, and run back even if there is an obvious path leading up to the target. You must either sweep by stick/mouse or confirm they can run straight forward to what you are aiming at. Even the gimped Wii side game developed by Climax has pre-mapped courses; one instance is if there is water blocking a path, your minions will fall back and, in record time, follow a detour and make it to where they're going. None of that here, or the first title. The same bug with spawning minions from a pit and having them clip walls is a nuisance even though they warp back to the Netherworld after about a half a minute of realizing they're stuck.(2) Overlord originally encouraged you to be a wicked harbinger of destruction with its story-altering irreversible controversial decisions. This time around, you step down to lesser power often throughout the game (some might argue said instances only demonstrate the incredible strength at your disposal) but most of the time, you're just a threat to an always-present higher power and only fundamentally equally-as-powerful as those who occupy your Netherworld ""home"".So, with that mouthful out of the way, I very much recommend this game even with its problems. It has all that made the first game good but it also brought along the same exact problems that plagued the first one, and then some. You should enjoy the game but you cannot reject the presence of the flaky stuff.If all this looks good to you, buy this.If you are new to Overlord and seek a spin of the unusually original gameplay the main series has to offer, demo or play the superior first game.If you play primarily for the humor and minions, you will be more than pleased. Buy this.If you play for the story and gameplay, watch some videos and play the demo before making the plunge and tread lightly. (Let's be honest, controls and gameplay were never a strong suit of the series, your minions clobber everything for you as-is.)If you enjoyed the original as much as I did (VERY thoroughly), buy this.If you thought the first game was alright and you expect real improvements this time around, steer clear and perhaps take a look at Dark Legend for the Wii for a more traditional experience.

												Overlord's a pretty unique game. You play as an evil Overlord who commands a small army of goblin-like minions to do his dirty work for him. At the outset, you'll be able to keep 15 under your control at a time, and that number will rise as you move forward in the story. There's something viscerally satisfying watching your minions wreak havoc on an enemy town - the little guys gleefully destroying everything in sight while the occupants run around in terror, many of them with a minion or two clinging to their backs and clubbing them to death. Mayhem and chaos ensues and it's entertaining to watch, and you can wade into the fray and knock things around with a huge axe if you don't feel like sitting on the sidelines.If it sounds too dark, don't worry - the game has a great morbid sense of humor and doesn't try to play it straight, so it's never depressing or disturbing. The game pokes fun at fantasy conventions too - early on you make enemies of the elves, who are literal tree-hugging hippies who are pretty upset that you've been clubbing baby seals to death to harvest life force for your growing army. The primary villians are a Roman-style Empire, who are rounding up and killing magic beings (like you and your minions), and the story takes jabs at ancient Rome sterotypes. Your senior minion advisor also narrates things for you, and the detest he expresses for the more beautiful side of fantasy settings is pretty hilarious.The game plays well, but there are problems with the controls. Later on, combat demands precise control over your minions, and the game doesn't really do that well enough. It leads to some frustrating moments where you're fumbling around trying to give the right orders to your minions, while your enemies are picking them off - giving you a taste of the confusion you normally cause. Some of the genre's typical sins come here too - there's a couple of clunky vehicle sequences, and at least one forced stealth section. To the game's credit, these segments aren't nearly as infuriating as you'd expect, but they still felt unnecessary and weren't very fun.Overall it's a fun game, and I recommend it despite its shortcomings - especially to players who enjoy ""summoner"" type characters in other action RPGs (such as Diablo), or those who are looking for something different in the genre.

												Minion management and mayhem continue in the sequel to the evil domination themed game, Overlord II. The story begins with a lone demonic child sought out by the forces of the previous overlord whose kingdom had come to ruin as the result of a magical cataclysm. You must reclaim your magical minions, fight bosses, and solve puzzles all the while dominating or destroying everyone in your path.Most mechanics such as minion movement and combat remain the same as the previous game, although the spell system has been simplified. Now instead of having to have a specific spell selected, you have different types of magic depending on whether you have no target, an enemy target, or a minion target. Spell effects are also changed by how dominant or destructive you are; a result of either enslaving or purging the cities and leaders you come across respectively.Your brown, red, and green minions also receive specific mounts which allow for new strategies to be employed such as wall ambushes with spiders, formation breaking charges with wolves, and drive-by fire balls with salamanders. Enemies are tougher this time around, with the empire forces in phalanx formations that are difficult to break without killing their commander. Your evil self is tougher too, and you can now charge into battle alongside your minions, doing considerable damage with the right equipment. One thing that might bother fans of the previous game is the new forge system. In the first game, all you had to do was grind gold and souls to eventually unlock every armor or weapon you could ever want. In Overlord II there are a finite number of dark crystals and spell catalysts which means you’ll need to pick your upgrades carefully as you can’t get all of them (I found health-stealing weaponry  and fire minion upgrades to be particularly useful). It’s not that big of a drawback though and even a casual explorer will have more than enough materials to get the job done.Overlord II is a straight upgrade made in an era where sequels were generally about keeping most of the good ideas unchanged while adding new gameplay to keep things interesting. As such it’s a bit of a rarity and definitely worth picking up along with its prequel for the full experience. ",217,101,1,22,12,4,23

												A return to being the ""Evil Overlord"", you play as a seperate character to the Overlord seen in the first game (which this is set after) you go through the lands slaughtering any who threaten you with the option to enslave or kill any who don't with a combination of magic and the ""minions"", another game with elements of Pikmin and, although it's not as difficult as the original, it still provides some amusement.The cutscenes and the comedic lines see to that.

Posted: December 25, 2016
												so let's talk about overlord II. I'm going to chunk this into the good parts of the game, the bad parts, and the more neutral upgraded parts of the game. The Good   First of all, the game has the most important element: Fun. You are a tall, armored giant reminiscent of Sauron. You wield a big weapon that allows you to go toe to toe with a few enemies and win.  you control a horde of goblin creatures called minions that can and will gleefully dissassemble entire squadrons of troops. The concept behind minions is pretty simple: Browns hit things, Reds throw fireballs, Greens sneak attack, Blues are medics. You unlock the different types as the game goes on. Puzzles revolving around minions and different minion types. You have a massive underground complex called the netherworld where you reside and is very thematic and fitting for a evil overlord.  Varied levels. Challenging, unique bosses Game world has aged decently well, the models and cutscenes not so much. Fair amount of dark humor and amusing moments from both gnarl and your hordes. Some truly epic moments when mass combat comes around. Subjugate or destroy towns, the choice is up to you. Ability to interact with more of your tower, such as sitting on your throne. The Bad aka my nitpicks   Not a large variety of grunt enemies. I'd say around 50% of the fights you get into are the Legionaires or some recolor of them.  Frustrating Water Level still exists.  The Netherworld, while pretty and thematic, is very large and takes some time to lumber through. While I personally appreciated it, others will feel annoyed at having to watch the same cutscene everytime they want to go to a different level of the base. The game does not have the same feeling of progression the prior one did. In Overlord I, your Dark Tower is a crumbling, decayed mess in the beginning and by the end is a gleaming/brooding bastion of good/evil. In Overlord II, besides some minor cosmetic changes to interior elements the Netherworld largely remains the same.  The new horn sound when you call back your minions is stupid. It's petty but it sounds like a french horn where the old horn was low and menacing.  Camera occassionally bugs out when sweeping minions. It takes a long, long, LONG time to unlock all the minions.  While the heartlands of the Glorious Empire are suitably large, the amount of towns you wrestle away from the empire is tiny.  Fans of overlord I will be disappointed to learn that most of the old game is nonexistant due to a magical cataclysm. Still gives a nod to the world however. The ""audience"" mechanic present in the game is clearly an unfinished portion of the game. While it serves its purpose for the small sidequests, and can be fairly amusing, I can't help but feel conquered towns and areas were meant to have more depth.  Ending leaves something to be desired. The Upgraded  Your control of areas of the world is much more pronounced than Overlord I. You leave behind a garrison in each town you conquer and can choose to enslave or exterminate the populace. Enslaved populations leave offerings, exterminating towns gives large gold and life force boost on top of making the overlord more lethal. Morality system has been overhauled. Instead of being Evil or Good in Overlord I, Overlord II features the Destruction or Domination system. Where in overlord I you could actually help the populace, leading to a paladin-esqe look to you and your tower, Overlord II lets you choose to commit genocide in the towns you control or enslave them. Magic is very simple. Overlord I had 4 distinctly different spells- Fire, Shield, Minion boost, and Debuff- with 3 different levels to them that changed the effect and area they cover. Overlord II has 4 ""spells"" with 2 variations to each. As you first unlock magic, you have access to a weak form of both variations. You can upgrade the spell but at the cost of further weakening the alternate option. EX: The lightning spell can be made more lethal if you are a destruction overlord, but at the cost of slowly losing the ability to enslave townsfolk. Domination overlords have a weak lightning spell that enslaves quickly. Great variety in levels. Some levels have you piloting a boat between flooded islands, others have you operating catapults against literal armies of enemies, while others have you costuming your minions to infiltrate military outposts. 3 mistresses instead of one. Take from that what you will. Ability to revive favored minions. Especially cool when your favorite brown with the boss hat accidentally gets too close to a bomb. Minion mounts add a new element to both combat and puzzles. Grindy armor smithing has been done away with. No longer will you need to sacrifice hundreds of minions for the perfect stats.  Forged weapons and armor offer unique effects and statistics. Blue minions no longer rush off to die in battle, but instead phase through enemies to grab downed troops.Tl;Dr: A fast and funny game, occasionnally repetitive, mostly linear, but an enjoyable and sometimes challenging experience from beginning to end.

												For as long as I could, I remember struggling with an issue of my identity. I had always felt different. When boys had wanted to play football, I wanted to sit in my evil lair and think of how to destroy the universe. While other people played video games, I looked up the most vunerable parts of the U.S.A.'s defense. I've tried to hide this ever since I was born, but I can't do it anymore. I had thought about ending it all, but i've always stopped myself at the last minute, until moments before I played this game. I was holding my staff of magical evil directly to my head to burn it on fire, when I saw this game pop-up on the sales list. I bought it.I have know accepted my true evil overlord self, and i've begun taking over the state of vermont.10/10			",160,33,0,14,18,2,6

												This game is the one of the few gems that come around once in a lifetime. Very few franchises can keep their good points on the same level and yet they've made it better.Overlord 1 was amazing due to its uncaring option of extreme brutality, or the option of a slightly less brutal.

												First, a short explanation of why I dont recommend the game (an actual review will follow).Unfortunately, the Steam version of this game is incomplete.  The DLC that goes with this game is console exclusive which, besides being total ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t, means you will never have the full experience if you purchase this game here.  Too make things more depressing, this was a PS3 release, meaning the only way to experience the full version of the game (if you cannot find a used version) is through the PS Now as either a rental or through the subscription service.Now, all that is a shame, because I ♥♥♥♥ing love this game.  (I recommend playing Overlord: Raising Hell before Overlord II, and this review will assume that you have and will contain spoilers from the previous game)Overlord 2 takes place after Overlord: Raising Hell and you play as the new child of the previous Overlord (by Rose) retaking the world from the ""Glorious Empire"" which arose since your sire's unfortunate incarceration in an Infernal Abyss (It happens).  You do this by raising a horde of minions and proceeding to ram them headfirst into the enemy until the enemy drowns in the bodies of your dead servants.  Well, I suppose you could use the guard system and the new tactical considerations (like various mounts for your Brown, Green, and Red minions) and overcome the enemy with your strategic brilliance.  But, to be honest, I often would start like that, lose my horde to an ill timed exsplosion, and then proceed to simply throw minions at my opponenet until the blood of my minions choked their airways.Your horde will consist of the classic specialized minions from previous installments (convienetly color coded by evolution) whose special abillities will allow you to progress further and strike at your enemies in new and often amusing ways.Browns are your front line fighters, they can both take a punch and dish them out.  But they cant really do anything else.  Reds are ranged attackers who through fireballs and can set your enemies ablaze and leave them screaming and running in panic, but are so fragile that a light breeze could kill them.  They also can absorb fire that blocks your path allowing you to progress.  Greens much like the browns, only weaker, but with the abillity to stealth on guard markers and jump on to enemies back and deal massive damage.  They also absorb poison, much like the Red's absorb fire.  Finally the Blues, which are even weaker than the Red's, dont really deal any damage, but can ressurect minions who fall in battle and swim.  As Gnarl says, ""Browns, Reds, and Greens cant swim.  They are, however, remarkably good at drowning.""The story isn't particularly noteworthy, and actually feels quite short.  (hence the complaint about the missing DLC)  Still, it covers its bases and gives you reasons to use the new and improved magic system.You still do collect spells as you go along, but upgrades for the spells take on new and excitting possibilites depending on whether or not you feel like Dominating a population, or Destroying them.  Your Evil Presnce spell allows you to dominate weak minded individuals, making them your slaves to fight with your minions in battle, or support you in towns by mining gold and making weapons for minions.  Or, you can use the spell to turn them into ash and have done with it.Whichever way you choose affects how you can upgrade the spell.   A Domination Overlord will eventually be able to subdue entire crowds with ease, and a Destruction overlord will get better at reducing them to ash.  All of the other spells have similar choices as well.  Buff a minion to be incredibly strong, or consume its essence to restore your health.  Increase the power of your horde temporarily, or release a massive shockwave.  The choice is yours... mostly.See, this is where the lack of the DLC really hurts, because it introduced three more obtainable spell catalysts (which you use to upgrade your spells.) lacking those, you cannot upgrade all your spells and have to pick and choose.  Which sounds like fun decesion making, but actually takes away from the feel of being an Evil Overlord of supreme power.This is a shame, because I really really love this game.  I picked it up here because of how much I loved it when I first played it on console years ago.But sweet as it is, it leaves a bitter taste in my mouth to know that if I want to have the full experience I have to subscribe to PS Now.

												I think it's funny that while I had a lot to praise about the first Overlord, it's harder for me to do for the sequel. It doesn't do a lot different and there's the idea that, well, it doesn't really need to do anything different. You control your minion types, wreak mayhem and destruction, and retake your domain from the Glorious Empire aka Romans.I guess I'll start with the positives. Minion pathing is a little better, and if you get seperated from your horde, they'll just teleport back to the spawning pits, meaning you won't lose minions to glitches this time around. On top of that, Blues have gotten magic blink powers so you can move them through objects to pick up unfortunate dead minions, rather than having them attack yet another obstacle in their way. Battles typically are structured with you taking your minions and strategically throwing them against an equally large horde set up a la Legionaire style, which kinda feels cool. And finally the scale has been upped, locations are vibrant and alive while feeling suitably epic when it matters. It ends up blurring that line between dark epic fantasy and comedic romp at times, but unfortunately never enough to strongly stand for one over the other or blending the two seamlessly, it just feels a little muddled in the wrong places.As for the negatives... Minions are sadly pretty damn stupid still, blues will try to do resurrections nearby where a minion died rather than fall back to a safe horde like they did in the first game. But that doesn't matter too much as you don't get Blues this time around until over half the game has passed. Yeah, for some reason you don't quickly build your army back up compared to the original where you got all four types within the first couple of hours. Enemy types are varied in some places, but you're dealing with the Glorious Empire Legionaires for nearly half of it, so most of your memories are focused more on the chaotic pile of bodies clashing with one another with no real strategy to it. The game itself is also structured very linearly, while the original was also rather linear, it hid that illusion well through branching paths that eventually came together at the end. This time around you go from location to location - typically by teleporation - with the occasional very short almost pointless sidequest.Finally, I have this nagging sensation that Overlord 2 - despite its grander scale - is actually a step down from the original Overlord. The original has you fighting corrupted heroes in a normally generic high fantasy world, it works because of how different it is to be playing the villain against the sometimes more villainous heroes. Overlord 2 has the same fantasy world with some different scenery, but against Romans with the feeling of progression being in conquered towns rather than growing hero body count. It handles its setting at face value rather than spitful sarcasm and dark humor with underlying tones of ""sometimes heroics isn't far from villainy.""Overlord 2 plays well and is an exciting romp through a high fantasy landscape - with all its flaws included - but it may wear a bit by the end despite how the larger scale. Because like the Glorious Empire you're facing, there's a lot of style in place but not quite enough substance. At least the game sells for ridiculously cheap these days. Recommended, but more to fans of the original who want a little more. Newcomers may enjoy it but that's a big if.			",180,53,0,13,9,3,11

												This game rules! And that can be taken literally. Rule like an evil Overlord over your minions and take what u want. Its pretty much like the first one but with a shorter story. Use your minions by telling them where to go what to attack and what to take for you. Occasionally u can get ur own hands dirty if you're up for it.It was really fun to play both parts so i really recommend to get the game, especially if it is on sale!			",329,50,10,23,28,2,33

												Great for conquest gaming action series funny minoions and even funny enemies lots of smashing but most of all losts of goblins bashing everything to peices :), Need a Overlord III With more ideas then just the fun and action though with like strategy and defesene because realistcly the latin proveb is the conquered mourns the conqueror is undone, Meaning you only truly own the land when you either chose 2 choices which the first one they will problay pick first take out the entire populace and enslave the rest and make a goblin empire or 2 reach to the souls of the ones you conqueror and overlord II Is to chaos kinda of game to pick choice 2 :P That and its just a game so does not really matter what you do in it :P. Although you got to admit then when you conqueror the land you really truly gain nothing other then the land when you chose choice 2 but it be nice if they just give its chaos theme none the less.

												Overlord II Yeah, its pretty sweet. It improves on just about everything that the original lacked or did not have and it added a bunch of its own elements, a good example is when you get to play as a minion.... or the times that you get to drive a freak'in boat like a pirate. (It did degrade on the magic for some reason, tho as much as I hate it, its not bad) The Spire Thing that you live in has alos been upscaled, there is alot more to do in the tower say... revive your favorite fallen minions (yes there is even that and they all have their own names). Multiplayer: There is none anymore (which I dont care for really much anyway) 8/10 overall, and if I was a ♥♥♥♥♥ I would have givin it a 7.6.

												This game is very good but the controls seem to be a bit odd, although play it on console first, still the button layout is not like most game, not a big deal you just have to change them.( also you need to rememer what you changed becuase the in game tutorial doesnt change and the options dont show the controls.Anyway a side from the controls overlord 2 is a incredibly fun, all round, combat, controlling minions, the dialogue and that you get some choices that can impact your game(mainly its 1 of 2 choices). The game should last a while, if you enjoy it and dont use guides to breeze through it. However the fact that achievements dont exist on steam version makes it a little less enjoyable, consoles have them and it forces you to play through multiple times or find a few exploits for some of them. Overall i would recommend this to anyone who enjoys humour(mainly darker) and being evil or who wants a really good game to play which will take up lots of their time.""its good being bad, but its better being evil""			",62,5,0,8,3,0,1

												Overlord 2 picks up where raising hell more or less left off, with the Overlad and his rise to take his father's place. While admittedly I'd have preferred spending more time as the young Overlad before he comes into his full measure, the game is a capable sequel with a couple of anti-frustration bells and whistles attached as you once again ravage the landscape and allow your minions to outfit themselves as they see fit.On a side note, it was nice to see one of my decisions in Overlord was apparently canonical.

												I personally love this game series , the flavor and ambience of the game is very well done , if you like comedic writing with a dark twist , this game is certainly going to be right around your alley . Gameplay wise , it can be clunky at times with slight movement and camera issues at certain stages , but it can still function as it should and it certainly a bucket of fun , though repetetive at times . The story and character development is fantastic as you dive into the story of the Overlord (you) and his role as the commander of evil and minions . This is a terrific game for a rainy sunday afternoon . Overall , this game is ultimately better than its predeccesor . If you're new to the series , this is for you . But after all , its only my review , you are the Overlord of your own games (pun-intented) .			",40,9,0,4,5,2,5

												While I could never personally get into the Pikmin series, Overlord 1 and 2 had me enthralled after a half an hour of play. While the main mechanics of the game are very similar to Pikmin, with minions that have different abilities such as being able to cross water, fire, etc. the game also features spell system that the player can take advantage of as well as the ability to use multiple types of melee weapons.   Another big difference between Pikmin and the Overlord series is the tone and story of the game. Pikmin is a more child friendly game, while Overlord is definitely more geared towards the adult audience with a story that is actually fairly well written and not so generic with the premise, as you are actually kind of the villian in these games.    The graphics have a different style than most games, with a very claylike feel that you will notice more in the winter areas of the game. Not to say that the visuals are bad by any means, they're just not outstanding.  Definitely worth picking up if you can get a good price on these games. Just a warning, the first game is a little more dated in visuals as it's a bit older but it's still not eye-bleedingly terrible.			",168,17,1,18,9,0,10

												Overlord 2 is unfortunately a game that takes the franchise in the wrong direction. While the original was never a great game, or as closely related to the Dungeon Keeper franchise as some of us had hoped it was still a decent play, a game with a good sense of humor and a couple of strong gameplay points.Overlord 2 is a game that has lost a lot of charm though, although it plays much like an Overlord 1.5 the humor has all been heard before now and it's not quite as entertaining as the first one was.Also the multi-player is completely broken and dead.Although Overlord 2 oozes a certain desire for mediocrity it still maintains enough of the original to be an enjoyable playthrough. Not a great game, but not a bad game either.			",980,332,42,138,118,11,215

												imagine if u combine strategy + Rpg u will get overlord :). Overlord 2 is a really really fun game from the get go it makes you laugh with its dumb sense of humour. Basically in Overlord you are a lord of the underworld (well sort of) u get ur own castle which u have to build up , building things such as your own armour,swords and even things such as the flags, throne etc of ur castle. You will gradually see as time passes how much your castle has grown or you could live it in a pos shape its your choice. This game has a light and dark meter similar to mass effect renegade and paragon system which is really fun due to how your choices can effect the game. You will also get minions which are your army (goblins) that follow you into the world and you can order them what to do, station them where you like and even guard stuff or take things. This goblins has a decent amount of depth to them too because you get to see who has been with you the longest , their level, their names etc etc. This is brilliant compared to overlord 1 so in my opinion its a good addition. To summarise it overlord 2 is a great game however it gets repetitive after continous gaming so yeah a 8/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												While a bit less in difficulty than Overlord 1, it has less grinding... ish. Minion wise you usually never have to grind for minions unless you are overly reckless with them. In Overlord 1 I got to one boss who had a ton of HP and just threw all my greens off of him and I think killed them instantly because of that... but other then that, it feels a bit shorter in my opinion. The usual sequel plague is with it though. Improves some areas, lowers other areas. Buy it if you liked Overlord, but honestly I got them all for PC since they were 5 dollars. I played Overlord as a child and loved it. I suggest Overlord 1 before Overlord 2 if you were thinking of picking one up.			",199,23,1,36,15,0,43

With more expanded gameplay, more puzzles, and even the option to hold audience with your villagers and those you lord over.

A Paladin’s Review: Overlord II. Evil Found A Way To Be FunGenre: 3rd Person Tactical RPG. Developed & Published by: Triumph Studios and CodemastersPlatform: Windows only. Business Model: Base Game. Copy Purchased by Myself Read the full & unabridged Review on A Paladin Without A Crusade[wp.me]In my review of Overlord I, I took issue with the conflicted themes presented by the game. It constant insisted that I was an evil Overlord spreading evil across the land. But it was in stark contrast to the game mechanics and story that I largely felt made the Overlord more of an anti-hero than anything else. Overlord I failed at its objective of treating you like a Lord of Evil in my mind. However, Overlord II didn’t. Overall Story ThoughtsYou are the new Overlord. The story starts with you being scouted and tested as a Overlad by Gnarl. Eventually, it leads to you being banished from the mountain village where you grew up, doing lots of damage to the town’s betrayal and going into The Netherworld. After you grow up, your job is to strike out from The Netherworld to the lands above. To set the lands in darkness and/or to conquer the minds of men. To find the one ring, to rule them all and in the darkness bind them.Originally posted by KingIsaacLinksr:Uhh...hold on one second, this explanation of the story sounds off. Let me grab the notes I have…rustles through paper...AHA! Here it is. Whoops. It uhh, hehe, isn’t this. My bad, back to the review of Overlord II.Ok, so there is no one ring and the overall plot is a bit odd. You go from town to town, dominating or destroying everything. Putting down a few rebellions and finding out what happened to The Tower Heart of the past game. All the while the Glorious Empire is constantly trying to stop you and/or take over the world. It then concludes in a rather long and drawn out siege of a castle. Culminating in a fight against a great, monstrous evil. Yeah, unfortunately the game doesn’t quite stick the landing with the ending. I would have rather fought a more “good-guy” bad guy such as some Holy Knight or a Julius Caesar character (to fit the Roman-esque theme they were going for). Someone who was actually trying to defend their people or ideals rather than their own selfish desires. Ok, maybe Julius was a bad example but I think you get the point I’m trying to make. Ultimately, I feel like they missed out on what could have been a really solid ending.Overlord II's ThemesThat all said, it’s these little touches and more that I probably forgot to mention that give you the sense of becoming a lord of darkness. While the corny humour is still present, it feels restrained enough to compliment the dark themes at play. In this case, less is more as the times that it tries to be funny actually work, rather than backfire and become tiresome. Overall, it’s a great thematic improvement to the original title.The Combat SystemAs a whole, the combat fluctuates from reasonably challenging to borderline-ridiculously-spammy. Some enemies are a little too quirky for my taste and can flatten armies in seconds. Which I can’t really decide if I like or not. But what I do like is the pacing of the combat. Not only does it have a diverse range of enemies and fights but it also has stealth sections. Multiple sections of the game require you to take control of a single minion and lead the army without the Overlord’s body and complete the objective with what minions you have. This stealth aspect really adds a nice change of pace to prevent the RTS-esque fights from getting too samey or overdone. It’s also pretty forgiving as there aren’t any instant failure states. I really enjoyed these sections and they were a welcome addition. PC Settings & MultiplayerVisually, this game is much better than the previous. Lush forests, sunny beaches and cold mountain villages really spice the world up. Most of the settings for Overlord II (Video, Audio & Controls) are changeable in the game’s launcher. There’s options for pretty much every custom visual setting I can think of. Most are on/off switches with Texture Detail, Debris Detail, Shadow Detail, View Distance and Particle Detail having sliders. Separate audio sliders are included (in-game) for sound, music and speech with support for up to 8.1 surround sound. Controller and keyboard + mouse are supported with key remappings for both. Controller is, in my opinion, the most optimal. Overall, the game is well optimized with consistent framerates and good looking visuals. Outside of the one crash I experienced, (towards the end of the game), the game seems relatively stable. I didn’t get a chance to experience the multiplayer because either the servers are down or no one is playing the game.Final ThoughtsOverlord II enhances everything about the first game. It brings a more consistent theme, new minion abilities & spells, lusher environments and a feeling of being a true Overlord. It doesn’t quite stick the landing though. The story’s last chapter is drawn out and the ultimate bad guy you get to fight is disappointing. The combat is better this time with subterfuge, new enemies and different tactics/spells that can be used. But it’s still….janky at times when I don’t think it should be. There’s a good amount of content though, you'll definitely get your fill of each place the game can take you to. The replay value is a bit weak especially with multiplayer not functioning. Ultimately, this Overlord game was actually a fun time despite my problems with the combat system. The combat is improved enough that I can recommend it. With the caveat to expect frustration while dealing with some of the more eccentric bosses and monsters. Still, evil did find a way, to be fun and enjoyable. So, kudos to Triumph for that.Read the Full Review on A Paladin Without A Crusade[wp.me]A Paladin’s Steam Review: OverlordA Paladin’s Steam Review: Overlord: Raising Hell ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Ahhh, this game. Possibly one of the best games I spent money on. (Disregard 1.4 hours, played on xbox 360.)I got the first one when it came out, and at this age I was a goody two shoes kid, didn't like being mean, couldn't really curse without saying sorry. But it brought out the evil in me. A game, where you are the evil mastermind, where you are the being with hordes terrorising the country side. You are Sauron, you are Voldemort, you are the Overlord.Anyway, with the cheese bit out. I ♥♥♥♥ing love this game, I have possibly spent over five hundred hours, easily, playing this on the xbox, going through and trying different styles or even just replaying for the memories. It has an amazing protaganist that doesn't speak but instead lets his actions speak louder than his words. You control an army of minions in order to bring chaos back into the life cycle of what seems to be the Elven terrorists and the Roman Empire. When you return to the Underworld, you can spice up your home with one of three misstresses you can obtain throughout the game, each rewarding you the way you want to be when you buy all their things, like honestly, buy drapes and carpets, your misstress will just be like, 'Yo, lemme just take you to the bed real quick.' even have your minions watch for comedic effect and then be kicked right in the ♥♥♥♥ing face. At your base you can even upgrade weapons, ressurect dead minions for new minions, even go into a battle arena if you get the DLC that just adds more time to the game.But real quick, let's get a history lesson of this. Basically you play as the fourth Overlord, or Witch boy as you are called at the start. You are the son of the Third Overlord from the first game, who is locked in an internal abbyss of sorts. You are basically claiming your right to the dark throne in an attempt to bring chaos back into the way of life. Done.It's sad. Really sad how this game has a cult following because it will never get another sequal like everyone wants, no one really wants the Overlord Fellowship game because it isn't Overlord. It doesn't challenge you, give you moral choices or even make you laugh just like Overlord would. You may be thinking, eh, the game must be overhyped by the cult following. Nearly no game out there can provide me with a plot that is so well done and full of questions that is like this, there nearly isn't. (Except for C&C 3. Not 4, we don't talk about 4 here.)There is of course flaws, like any game. One is the controls, which you can but can't blame due to it being made for console. Second is the crashing, again, made for console. Third is some areas being ridiculously just annoying to beat. Now, I've played the game, and the first, soo many times to tell you there is always parts which just cause so much pain to go through. In the first one, it was Hell's kitchen, which was the DLC, along with the mission where you go into elven territory. In  this it was the blue mission and the stealth mission for the greens. Oh god, just the amount of paitence it requires is too damn much to get the greens. It just pains me going to get the greens. Nonetheless it is still a good game, a game that needs people to notice.Onto characters, (Realised I have zero structure to this whole review.) you have your main Minion, Gnarl, the man minion thing just tells you what you need to do, gives you the right hints, and makes fun while doing so. He leads the minions mainly as in keeps them busy when they aren't out with you and even served your father in the first game. Even dropping hints of a sequel that everyone wants and knows what will be about.You have Jester, basically comedic relief and someone who the other minions pick on, can be funny or just stupid to listen to. First scene with him is good.I won't list the mistresses because each of them are good in their own way and do help the Overlord explore what type of Overlord he wants to be. One is nordic, another is snobby roman and the third is an elven goddess.In this now you have magic that is different than in the first. This magic you wield can either enslave the population, or drain them of all life force. Allowing you to either allow your people to live without question or will, or kill them. Evening allowing you to replenish mana during a fight too.The list of the game can go on, but to make  TL:DR, the game is fun, keeps you occupied, allows you to be evil with no bad morals, gives an interesting plot twist, has fun mechanics and is one of the only games where you can be the bad guy and have fun. Lots of fun.Jesus this was all over the play at 8:38am in the morning. Buy this game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Awesome game with a frustrating save-point system.  No manual saves to be had, and dying leads to doing a lot of (sometimes very frustrating) things over again.  It's like Fable... only you're evil whether you like it or not.  -and the only interaction you have with citizens is murdering them or brainwashing them.  -and you have an army of evil minions that do your bidding.  You know what, it's nothing like Fable.  You do collect currency and charms to level your character's attributes, upgrade armor & weapons, etc., so it has some RPG elements.  It has a great art style, it's charming, and you should play it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												S great concept and a fun game.  Very limited so dont expect too much depth or much longevity even if, like me, you try and squeeze every last drop of entertainment out of  it because you like the concept so much.   It has a very quirky style and some progression which makes you feel like your doing a little more than reading a script.  But it is so very linear that even some clever game design cannot really hide it. There is no open world and the way the progression is limited within the context of the game can be obvious enough to be annoying.  However, its on sale a lot and while I wouldnt pay full price.  For the low price I paid it was worth it. I like the game for its humour and quirkiness but it could have been so very much more.  What I would have liked to see would have been the following:Open worldBetter development of the tower less tied into obvious story markers.Remove every trace of being a linear progression.Less puzzle solving, more battle. More depth in the management of captured towns and cities with the effort making it harder or easier to defend.All round depth. Getting a thumbs up because it is well worth buying..

												I've only played a couple hours, but honestly, this game annoyed me so much, so quickly, that I doubt I'll ever play any more. I loved the original Overlord; it was charming and fun to play. But this game took the playful satire of the first game and cranked it so far up it's well beyond annoying. They took the mopey elves of the first game and turned them into the most annoying caricatures possible. Their lines and voice acting are so over the top and so exaggerated that it's not even remotely funny, just obnoxious. The formerly mostly silent minions now seem to have plenty of their own obnoxious voice overs, and they are clearly trying so freaking hard to be ""quirky"" that all the charm they had in the first game is obliterated.The animations are also horrible. Every cutscene features characters snapping from odd unnatural poses to bizzare puppet-like poses constantly, completely independent of whatever they're saying or whatever else is going on. It is incredibly jarring and obnoxious to look at. Instead of a smooth flowing minion horde following you around like in the first game, your horde is now jittery and spastic, every movement being overly abrupt and poorly animated to the point that they all look like living embodiments of glitches. The AI also seems to have gotten dumber, which is sad, since the first game already had its own problems with the minions being sometimes incapable of figuring out what you're directing them to do.If you loved Overlord, I suppose this sequel is better than nothing. But it falls short in so many areas, and seems like such a step back from the original game that I genuinely don't understand why it has such a high rating here.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												1: Main Toughts on 2nd Overlord: in my opinion it is the first overlord that replaces the broken first overlord (see my overlord review post to understand) and its a proper refined version of the 1st overlord that the devs actually completed instead of giving up halfway and not properly refining it and calling it a ""game""2: The good things:-You can actually complete it without getting stuck! a campaign to be completed without getting stuck is a better one.-More balanced enemies! Finally the real overlord game has come out! -Its got more to its campaign! Shame the devs cant just repair overlord but waste more money and time to make a 2nd!-Forging System a downer! Shame you cant forge like the old overlord and a bit like the 2nd overlord, a good mix. devs cant see that then they must be terrible at making game systems of forging (in that sence)-Minions can ride things! depending on their colour depends on the mount! (brown/wolf, green/spider, red/salamander)-A better tower! Finally some decorative places, the original was lame. why not just have corridors to rooms and thats it it wont even change my boredome levels!-A better Overlord! finally a overlord who knows how magic works.-More Mistresses! 3 more! one good, other greedy, other can be evil, or a ghost good!-4 Love Scenes! the overlord has 3 mistresses to choose!-Possess a minion! with a minion gate possess a minion!-A proper waypoint system! heal on a waypoint gate! finally a good fixed V2 of overlord!-More INTERESTING! Now we can listen to interesting talk than boring gnarl spams while roaming the tower!-Prevented money camping! (most of it) Now players cant cheat on money harvesting that often like the angelis keep gold harvest!-Actually FEEL like a true Overlord: All the whelps from the 1st just fear you, YOU NEVER RULE OVER THEM! YOUR JUST A JUDGE WITHOUT THE PRESIDENT'S BADGE!Overall, a good Version 2 of the 1st Overlord, good job Devs. CANT REPAIR A SIMPLE GAME!?			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Sooooo, Idon't know how to explain how awesome this game is. BUT, it is awesome. So enjoy some cake while you download it.Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour 2 9-inch cake pans. In a bowl, sift cake flour with baking soda.2.Mash the vegetable shortening with 1 1/2 cup of sugar in a large bowl until thoroughly combined, and stir in the eggs, one at a time. Pour the red food coloring into a small bowl, and fill the empty food coloring container with water; add the water to the food coloring. Stir in cocoa powder to make a paste, and mix the paste into the shortening mixture.3.Stir the buttermilk, salt, vanilla extract, and apple cider vinegar in a bowl, and mix into the colored shortening mixture, alternating with the flour mixture, until well combined. Scrape the batter into the prepared cake pans.4.Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center of a cake comes out clean, 30 to 35 minutes. Allow the cakes to cool completely.5.To make frosting, whisk together the milk and all-purpose flour in a saucepan until the mixture is free of lumps, and bring to a simmer over medium-low heat. Cook, whisking constantly, until the mixture is thick, about 1 minute. Pour the thickened sauce into a mixing bowl, and chill until completely cooled, at least 30 minutes. When cold, place the butter into the mixture, and beat with an electric mixer to combine; add the vanilla extract and 2 cups of sugar to the bowl, and beat with the mixer set on Medium speed until the frosting is light and fluffy, about 3 minutes.

												The game itself is a welcome sequal to the first. The minions are smarter, the powers are cooler, the elve's are dumber (hippies), the jokes are allot more clever, and the setting is twice as glorious as the first, and the things you can do are more open (possession, mind control, dark magic incineration) + lighting powers. O.O Oh and the occational puzzle (super rare)There is also allot of monty python style comedy for those who enjoy the more complex and intellegent humor. And please check the requirements first.  No-one wants to see someone having a paddy because they couldn't set up their PC and felt the need to blame it on someone else.Now..I will say this, if you're a bit of a dumb dumb or entitled individual then this game is not for you.If you however are a bit of a smart♥♥♥♥♥ complex thinker or an emotional wreck, then this game is definetly for you.

												Although Overlord 1 was a heap of fun, this seems like an extension that didn’t add much to the first game. It’s also extremely annoying with the excessively long gaps between AutoSaves, making a very linear level harder and more time consuming than it should be for a perfectionist. Not to mention the bugs that took hours to figure out and bypass. I literally spent 2 hours and retried the level because I thought I missed something causing the game not to progress. After watching YouTube on what was supposed to happen I finally realized it was not my fault then had to search forums how to get past the glitch. This happened in 2 different instances. The game is still lots of fun, but I wouldn’t point anyone to go out and buy this unless they were a hard-core overlord fan.			",65,1,1,4,3,0,3

												Lord of the rings: Tiny Orc edition is the sequel to the critically acclaimed cult hit. To those not in that cult the first game was called Wraith of the Hobbit King. So how does one even begin with a garbage dump like this game? The story is a direct rip off of Call of Duty: Ghosts. The gameplay is pikmin, its literally a different skin on pikmin. As Sauron you decide it is best to do ever last little peice of grunt work yourself, and he is way weaker than he was in the movies. Like a panda killed me, like four times. And the soundtrack simply didn't live up to the normal electronic and dubstep we are used to. You can't even get that weird orc with no eyes and all the teeth to sit outside your tower and welcome guests all like, ""Yisssssss, welcome!"" Its not all bad though, you are able to brutally murder cute and innocent animals, so im gonna have to give it 4/5			",102,14,4,17,9,0,8

												These Overlord games are great fun. They are unfortunently not good games overall, but their fantastic fun. It's a console game more then a PC game, simple movements, simple maps, simple controls, horrible menu-system.But the humor and the evil part and the schmexy vixxens are all awesome. It will get tiresome though, so i for one need frequent breaks from the game.Another bad thing come to think of it, is the lack of information in-game. Some quests can be completed in more then one way, but you get no information on what you can do. Same lack of information can frustrating when you have an upgrade system like in your Tower where you end up not knowing why you upgrade.And yeah, the small cutscenes between lets say taking the ""elevator"" takes too long, and some of the dialog is also to long and to frequent...It's fun though... in small doses.

												The game is really funny, charming, and overall enjoyable to play.Minions are smarter and no longer chase things into water (where they will drown). They can do more things like ride mounts. Your spells are also a lot more fun to use once you collect them. They make an impact, but aren't easy-mode mob obliderating (I'm looking ar your Inferno spell). Everything is just BETTER then the last one, and is improved upon in almost everyway. The MOUSE CONTROLS on the other hand are rage-enducingly buggier then they used to be and will more often then not accidently get half your minions killed. Like HOLY♥♥♥♥♥♥have I had some times where the game just decides to flip out and send a dozen minions into a boss monster and just die. ♥♥♥♥ing FANTASTIC.I really liked Overlord 1 and Overlord 2 is nice too, but the RAGE the control bugs will cause amongst other game-breaking bugs you might run into make this a 7/10 for me though.If you liked Pikmin, you'll probably like Overlord.

												If you haven't played the first overlord go and do that and if you're still hungry for more, come back here.Basiclly everything in overlord is better then the original one. This dosen't mean that this game is a solid 10/10 but if shows that the developers knew what they were doing. In overlord 2 you will get better pacing, more varying gameplay and a decent story (i guess)I don't feel like ranting about this games flaws becuase it's only cost 9 euro.Decent game 7/10 - BROWNS ",97,15,0,15,5,2,3

												This game brings me the nostalgia . i used to play first part of overlord when i was around 9 years old , the good old game brings me so much memories , it was the first game i ever playd on my first computer back in 2009. I wish that they made overlord 3 but instead they made a♥♥♥♥♥♥version of diablo or some sort , which i though they will change their minds and make the overlord 3 , we waited and nothing happend , i bet it would have been the most sold game, cause of it's content and the fun it has .It is one of the best games i playd on my pc and if you're reading this review , you should try playing this :).

												Big improvement over the original. Still not as good as it should be.If you played the first game and actually liked it, you'll love this game. Everything is better fleshed out here. Upgrades to the tower serve more of a purpose. Art is better. You can actually sit on the throne in this game. You don't get handmaidens this time but you get more mistresses. You get a minimap in this game, finally. You feel like more of an overlord in this game. Rather than being split into evil and eviler (which was really good and evil when you added it all up) This game splits between domination and destruction. Either you're here to conquer or to watch the world burn. You can dominate villagers and actually put them to work for you producing goods. There will be tribute waiting for you with each visit. The game is also focused more on actual inflitration and battle and less on arbitrary puzzles. But its not perfect. The humor is as bad as it was in the first game. Very cheesy, very obvious and not in an over the top good way. You also aren't going to feel like this is your character but that was a problem in the first game. And the adviser is still calling the shots. You have to do basically what he says. If you can catch this on sale and you're looking for some hack and slash with minor tactical elements, this game is fun enough to justify itself.			",114,34,0,39,6,1,3

												Now i have played this game for about 15 hours and still yet to beat it. Ok so let me talk about the game you play as a little kid in the introduction that is very demented and than gose on to try to rule all the land> Now this game dosent have the best quality of graphics but it dose look very good and in. Some parts of the game even beutiful. This game has some jokes in it that might make you laugh and you get ""Dark mistress's"". Now you get three dark misstress's in the game i belive and each mistress has a different personallity to the others one is like a country nordic type. Another is a empie woman that ephisizes beuty. Another is a fariy queen you bend to your will though your dark magic and and then wants to rule with you. So thats all of the wives you can have or ""Dark mistress's"" as they are called in the game now the gameplay is standerd and really easaly understood and you get. 4 types of minnions Brown your standard all round minnions. Reds more ranged minnions that use fire. Your greens witch are your steath minnions that deal lage amounts of damage by back stabing or. just laching onto enemys and whaling at them. And then you finally have your blues wich are your healer minnions that resersct dead minnions and they can swin the only minnions that can. Now you use these minnions differently epending on the area you are in or the thinga you have to face they are very. For the most part not that smart and most likely meant to be a lovable part of the game other than the mute protaganist. Now to the point this game is very enjoyable and i would give it a 7/10 it is very fun and dose have some parts to leave you frustated but it is overall an enjoyable game.			",169,33,2,18,9,3,17

												If you haven't played the first overlord go and do that and if you're still hungry for more, come back here.Basiclly everything in overlord is better then the original one. This dosen't mean that this game is a solid 10/10 but if shows that the developers knew what they were doing. In overlord 2 you will get better pacing, more varying gameplay and a decent story (i guess)I don't feel like ranting about this games flaws becuase it's only cost 9 euro.Decent game 7/10 - BROWNS ",97,15,0,15,5,2,3

												This game is an improvement over Overlord 1, but there's a critical flaw: the puzzles in it are terrible. A good puzzle is where you have all the pieces you need to start and get an ""ah ha!"" moment when you put them together. In this game puzzle pieces are such that when you find how they fit together, it's more of a ""really? that's the solution?"" A lot of the difficulty is telling apart the parts of the terrain you're supposed to interact with from the parts that are just fluff. ""Oh, so that one vine I can send minions up, despite every version of that vine up to this point just being a decorative piece."" Also, minions get stuck A LOT, and when a minion gets stuck then you're down a minion for the rest of the level. This means that by the time you get to the end, half your minions are stuck on terrain and you have to try to beat the boss with just a few minions. Note: If minions die, you can easily replace them. If they get STUCK, you're screwed.			",65,1,0,10,2,0,6

												Not quite the game i was hopeing for this one felt like overlord 1 lite.... You will spend the entire game finding your minions and then rushed into a drawnout final fight. I was really hopeing for an extension of the first game but not even the story felt right. ya i know it follows the 'evil' line of the first and all that but the entire story just dident feel right. Stacked on top of a rerun of 'these are minions and you must spend the whole game geting the hives' the new elements of reviving minions and addition of mounts is quickly forgotten. The castle and mistresses also missed the mark drasticly. You dont really get to upgrade your home aside from a small selection offere by 3 mistresses. No arena, single pass levels and resource restricted forgeing basically strangles all the fun stuff of the first game clean out of this one.The next overlord to be released is not even gonna be a overlord game but a spinoff coop thing that dident really get me excited so unfortunately this may be the most uptodate overlord you can expierence and i cant bring myself to recomend it. So im sad.....			",169,8,2,7,7,1,17

												An excellent that takes what made the first game great and builds on it. If you're tired of the whole ""third person action"" genre, which has now become a chiche, in my opinion, this is the game for you. You needn't have played the first game to understand this one as the stories are self-contained and the game does an excellent job at teching you the ropes.I only have 2 problems:1. The crafting system in the original game was replaced in this one. In the original, forging and upgrading weapons/armour allowed you to sacrifice minions to give the weapons/armour specific properties, according to the amount of each of the four minion types that was sacrificed when forging/upgrading. Here, that system is replaced with a selection of pre-made weapons/armour. Lame.2. It isn't a knock on the game itself, but Steam doesn't seem to have the Battle Rock Arena DLC avaliable for Overlord 2. It's a shame, as this DLC effectivly added the dungeon from the first game into this one, as it is strangly missing. Wish they would add it but probably won't.At the time of writing, Steam says that I've spent 18.5 hours on this game. Let is be known that I got this game 2 days ago and I also sunk about 2 dozen hours into the PS3 version. 9.5/10 would Overlord again.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A prettier, larger, and slightly more complicated version of the original. It still has the witty dialogue and funny gameplay, but I have had trouble keeping my interest in it.  I might try again eventually.-Beat it on my second try. Problem is that it isn't very challenging and it doesn't have any of the 'newness' the original had. A clone, you could say. I'd encourage you to burn through the Hell version of the first, and while your appetite for the gameplay is still fresh (or wait until you get the itch), burn through this one too. Don't take your time, it might defeat your patience.Good game though.10 / 12			",721,226,15,79,62,10,111

												A frustrating mix of great concept and terrible execution. I can't tell if I had more fun than controller-hurling rage.Every challenge is a wall of invulnerable guards that you get past by positioning a horde of reds at just the right spot to take out the captain. Sometimes you get to use a catapult or ballista. Strategy is fairly irrelevant.Every game has bugs, but it's the design choices that will drive you batty. What should have been a simple set of menus accessed from a keypress is instead a vast dungeon with rooms spread to the far corners, where your slow-walking avatar must trudge too, then wade through pointless ""elevator"" animations, and then even more animations before you can interact with the ungangly UI to manage a single resource. We're supposed to feel like we're entering a whimsical world, but mostly you just cry when you realize you have to trudge back across the entire dungeon to perform an upgrade.The magic system could have been completely removed without any loss to game play. You get four spells. You'll see a tutorial once. Then the spells seem to work by context, but despite a lot of experimentation, I couldn't figure out what the parameters were. I suspect it requires very precise targetting and timing that is more likely to happen by chance than by intent. But when you do get a spell to work, the effect is so underwhelming that it never seems worth the bother, and you certainly don't need them to complete the game, nor do they make it any easier.Then you get awarded women as trophy mistresses. It's just as shallow and pointless as it sounds.			",22,5,0,4,0,0,0

												Overlord 2...why?Id absolutely love to recommend this game, I really would. Sadly, I cannot due to gamebreaking bugs that make it impossible to progress the storyline.The gameplay is fine (when it works) and the humor is spot on as it was in the first, very enjoyable to play...if you can play.Sadly the game has various bugs which inclue mobs 'standing still' and floating in the air dead, mobs glitching out through walls and in my case that Ive seen now, a completely gamebreaking bug not allowing me to progress the storyline due to the game accepting a specific hive but not allowing those type of minions to be spawned. After trying various fixes, retracking my save file, etc etc, all to no avail Ive sadly given up on it now.The camera itself is a bit wonky and the minions arent easy to control, they more then often bug out and dont let themselves be controlled as fluidly as they should. I will say that Im playing the game itself with the controller, so I have not tested how the controls are with a keyboard and mouse.Its a real shame because I was enjoying myself quite a bit, but sadly, at this point far past the refund mark, I cant even get the money back I payed for this product. I wont completely condone the game due to not everyone having issues with it, but in my specific case and what I have seen now I sadly cannot reccomend this game.Before you do buy it I would advise you to check the discussions to see if your rig has any similiarties with others that are also complaining on the forums that they for instance cant even start the game or get it to function.This review is subject to change if a patch comes out addressing all those issues and fixes the various bugs, but as it stands now, its not worth its price seeing as its not even playable for some people.Edit: After much porting around..trying to find out who what when where and why etc, I have gotten past the 'gamebreaking bug' by..porting to various places and then back to the current place I was where it oddly completed 7 or so quests enabling me access to the rest of the storyline. I still stand by the review though that the bugs that occur are very trialing on ones patience and a real damper to the entire game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												It's not a bad game but ultimately it's simply not worth your time. The minion mechanic is very interesting and I applaud the devs for trying it, but the game itself is probably a solid example as to why other devs have ignored the idea.  On top of that,  the implementation is unnecessarily  clumsy, cumbersome and imprecise - significant problems given this is the core mechanic in the game and the tool you employ against just about everything. Similar things can be said of every design decision in this game - it's not awful, but simply playing it is a chore. A basic awkwardness premeates the entire game as your minions are annoying to control, your avatar is plods around the map, mini-games are chores to complete and the game is seriously padded out in places.Finally the fortress that serves as your hub between missions is aesthetically suitable but in all over ways awful. I understand why they didn't simply use a menu to organise your empire but plodding back and forth down hallways and through multiple loadscreens to do two buttons worth of work is nightmarish. And much of what the Fortress offers (customisation and minion management) is grossly unrewarding.The setting and dialogue is novel enough, I didn't find it particularly funny though it tried hard to be, but it didn't annoy me either, which is notable enough as most 'funny' games tend to be outright annoying.Visually it's actually pretty decent for its age.Overall, there's some cute ideas here but the implementation isn't good enough. It's not even really 'if you can stand X you'll like Y"". Just play something else.			",126,15,1,18,23,1,27

												I tried to like Overlord II, but it wasn’t easy.  This isn’t an awful game, but it's not one that I would recommend to others.To me the controls seem a bit odd, certain actions like sweeping with the minions are strange.  Other controls like madly clicking the left mouse button over and over will leave you with a permanently damaged digit.  The premise of the game is a let down too.  The summary states that you finally get to play as the bad guy, I was hoping for something far less cartoony and silly.Most of the game is trying to figure out how to get certain types of minions to complete a certain puzzle so that you can progress in the weak story.I’ll have to check out the original Overlord and see if it’s any better.ProsThis is a very unique game.  I don’t think you will find anything like it.ConsGraphics are a little ugly, the game doesn’t look great.The game just feels like a variety of pointless puzzles that you have to overcome in order to cause some comical mischief with your minions.

												I had high hopes in the beginning, but by the end I was kinda disappointed. The boss fights felt like they stretched on forever, I experienced a hearty amount of glitches (including a couple instances where the game would crash to desktop with no error codes or anything), I noticed that I was only able to save up ~150 lifeforce of each color at any one time, armor/weapon upgrades are like uniques from raising hell where they require a number of minions of each color along with some red flower gems and sometimes a few black flower gems, minion upgrades didn't seem to make any difference, and I must've missed a huge chunk of the game because I never found the fourth mistress (I don't know if there actually is one, I've just read things that claim there are 4).I would only suggest getting this on sale for a couple dollars.

												If you absolutely loved Overlord and want more of the same then this game. If you enjoyed Overlord and were hoping that this might add something a little different to the franchise then don't bother. There are a few new things. It is pretty cool that the minions can ride mounts and the times when you posess one of your minions are a nice touch, but in general it just feels like a retread of the original, still with all the annoying controls that involve you having to hold down multiple keys and buttons at the same time to control your minions. There's also a huge bug whereby you can accidentally pass by a main mission without noticing and then not be able to properly complete a later mission without realising why.			",15,0,0,8,0,1,3

												More linear than a call of duty campain. A sad sequel to the original Overlord, characters are too cartoonish in nature constantly making terrible jokes directed at a younger audience and the game gives little option in how to progress. Ultimaetly thats the best way to sum it up, you have too few options in everything, even combat has a certain sequence you need to follow to defeat enemys.			",54,5,0,7,4,1,1

												I think I made a big mistake with this game. That mistake was playing the original first. You see Overlord 2 isn't much different from the first. It's pretty much the same concept with new ideas mixed in a little. So it tends to get boring real fast. Plus the story and characters seem to be a lot less enjoyable. Bad even. I don't know, i'd recommend just sticking with the original. Overlord II just feels like a watered down repeat of the previous game.			",241,26,2,22,13,3,22

												This game improves on almost everything that made the first game atrocious, yet somehow manages to still be terrible. It's not as bad as the first one, but sure is close. The controls are still terrible, locking on rarely works right, the minion AI is somehow worse than it was in the first one. The spells are stupid and even more confusing to use. The weapon upgrade system is worse and more confusing. The story or lack there of is the exact same thing as the first one, which I wouldn't so much care about if both games weren't complete crap. Some of the quests are so stupid and boring, that you will likely just choose to skip them.The enemies are annoying too and take too long to kill, because they block everything. The fact that the combat is so boring makes this so much worse. It is an extreme struggle to play though, especially since its bad for all the wrong reasons.Update:I just sort of beat the game and it is worse than the first game. It is a horrible game from start to finish. I didn't even bother trying the last boss a second time after I died, because the fight is completely stupid, extremely long and even more boring. You basically just have to hope your minions do what you want (which is rare) and you have to pretty much depend on your reds, which can't hit a moving target so you're screwed. One of the worst games I've ever played			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Dissapointing. After all that work to conquer and acquire in Overlord 1, we find that this edition is the same story. The last overlord defeated (how?), you must rise up and rebuild his empire. Oh look, the hives are lost again, and the entire game will consist of finding them in a series of convoluted puzzles. Even moreso than in Overlord 1, as soon as you've really acquired the power of the overlord, it's time to end the game, and thus lose it.New enemy moves everywhere, yay! I like that part. I REALLY like the formation and panic mechanics. There were definitely better mechanics to deal with combat wise, if only they weren't built around puzzles.I have to say though that most of the new moves and features contribute to the endless one-off mini-games. Puzzles puzzles everywhere. what happened to just marching through blowing everything up and overwhelming it with my minions? Pity that nearly every battle is now a minion-movement puzzle. And I mean EVERY battle. No more overwhelming your enemies quickly or charging in yourself.Forging is now pre-set recipes, and my preferred recipes are nowhere to be found. I guess winning isn't on the menu. Playing with the best recipes I could find I still felt profoundly inferior to my character from overlord 1.Add in the nany engine prevening me from auto targeting the intentionally irritating townsfolk, the cliched way the bad guys ALWAYS get the drop on me (I detest cutscene combat), and the fact that I cannot even farm up life-force for the war of attrition anymore (yes, farming spots exist, WAY out where they are hard to get to, they normally only occur as the plot progresses).My final opinion? Some wanna be genius in marketing or senior management decided to re-target this at a younger,  stupider audience, while forgetting that it is a game concept that attracts older, more intelligent customers. It could have been done SO much better.			",5,0,0,9,0,0,0

												Simply put, garbage. If you liked the first Overlord game, stay away from this one. The controls have been slightly improved from the last one, but the overall feel of the game has been ruined. The dry evil humor from the first game is gone, replaced with ""I'M SO EEEEEEEEVIL"" unfunny humor. Also, the story is boring. I could not care to continue this game too far, even though I was a big fan of the first. Save your money, play the first one again. 3/10 for good controls/decent graphics and awful everything else.			",113,9,0,24,16,0,10

												This game isn't a total loss. The characters are amusing and the dialogue hits a good balance of ""you're a badass"" and ""dont' take yourself so seriously"" that I like in games. The graphics stand up pretty well despite their age at this point.The reason this is a don't buy from me is the level design and controls are too often more frustrating than fun. ""Oh I had to hold the mouse while sweeping and using this minion to get them to go there and do this thing"" is a recurring issue. The puzzles often involve too much back tracking and repeating yourself to be anything but tedious and so far none have been a real challenge. The ideas are fun, the execution unfortunately is lacking to the point of getting in the way of enjoying the game for me. I'll probably finish it someday but it's one of those that I dread playing because I know it's only a matter of time before I say ""oh come on"" when I realize I have spend ten minutes running around looking for the one thing I need to click in some odd way and it makes the level take twice as long as it should to complete.

												This is a game for age ranges 4-9, and I might be being a tad generous here. It was a take on the whole evil overlord thing but its not what you expect. Its more of a video arcade type of game where you throw minions at things and watch them do stuff. The storyline characters (soldiers, leaders, and pirates) are all portrayed as cartoonish characters that flop around like you see in shows like Barney and friends or The Muppet Show. The $2.49 price tag is too much to pay for this game. IMO, just don't.			",2,5,0,10,4,0,9

												While I loved the first game to death, and found it replayable... I did not play this game previously, and find this sequel to be a flawed, rushed cash grab. This is also a badly ported PS3 title, with a clunky key layout for movement and looking etc. Minions are somehow less intelligent in this sequel than the first, and the level layouts and designs make less logical sense than again, the previous title. In a sense, it feels like the game is a generic copy with all the POP elements like graphics and explosions and fire to appeal to a mindless audience. Unlike it's predecessor, which had a very nonlinear feel to it; This sequel feels very barred and grindy. I would not recommend unless you have a fondness for expensive time wasters. A fairly expensive timewaster.			",71,9,0,13,18,1,9

												The tutorial looked nice but unfortunately after that the computer crashes after a few seconds of gameplay. Neither the task manager, nor the reset button work.Installing the latest driver of Nvidia Physx like suggested doesn't work either. I am not willing to spend more time trying to get this game working. Maybe it was a good game some years ago but selling it like this with lots of people complaining about similar problems is close to fraud.			",38,17,1,8,9,1,25

												Honestly I thought this game was terrible.  There is a dude on Gamefaqs liked it enough that he wrote up a detailed write-up of it.Yeah I don't even know how to describe it.  Basically it sucks, and it doesn't seem to be much different from the first one from what I have read so apparently it didn't occur to anyone to improve it.  Basically it is not challenging, and then you will have to do something that is annoying.  So now you are, literally, running around doing something stupid that is only making the game hard because you are asking yourself how long you can keep doing this.

For a game that's been out for so long and such a close event to the start of the game to have a game breaking bug is outright completely unnaceptable and the developers should be ashamed of themselves.Not enticing enough for me to waste my time going through the entire intro again just to see if the bug won't be present on try number 2, not worth even the 3 bucks or whatever it's on sale for right now.

												Spend your money and time elsewhere.I went in with the idea that it was a spiritual successor to Dungeon Keeper, and did try to enjoy the game despite its many flaws.

												This is a personal favorite from my childhood. If you're into playing the badguy and aren't afraid to get your hands dirty with the blood of the innocent then give it a shot. As the Overlord you control minions to swarm and fight your enemies. If your favorite minions die you can simply bring them back at your lair, for a cost. The minions are often required for puzzles to help progress the story, but the story has a great sense of humor, so it only adds to the fun.The camera can be a bit wonky at first, but you'll get use to it with play, same with how you control the minions. Other than that, I haven't had any problems with the game.Also, you don't need to have played the previous game to enjoy or understand this one, but I'd still recommend you give it a play too!

												Overlord the original was better in my opinion but choices affecting your social standing and army power is still probably one of the greatest concepts in videogames, even so Overlord 2 is still  very enjoyable  plus gives many hours of storyline and strategy on which of the 4 types of minions to use and when to use them on certain bosses and enemies, it has decent replayability such as maybe you killed this person now you want to go back and see what happens when they live, in addition there is some pretty comedic parts of the story with minions and the storyline itself throws in many jokes and puns, all in all pretty good game with a from what I can remember pretty okay multiplayer you can play with friends			",91,9,0,14,18,1,7

												To sum things up, sadly Overlord 2 is worse than the first Overlord. I want to keep this short: Overlord( The original one) was dark, with its typical dark humor. Overlord 2 has this humor but, for real if i am leading a horde of mutated peasants i do expect to kill real enemies, not #420 elfs and obese people from Houston, USA. Another point i disliked ( Well my personal opinion ofc) was the setting, i dont like snowy regions and the elfs looked like being 24/7 on dank haze. Conclusion: Some nice ideas like the ship but overall not as good as the first Overlord. 6/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												So first off I have to say that this game is a great game to play if you're looking to just relax and run around in a game. It's not a great challenge, and most puzzles are pretty straightforward to figure out, but that's exactly what I love about it. If you want to play a super complex action/puzzle game this isn't the game for you. This is a light hearted, sometimes hilarious romp about being an evil overlord that includes some action as well as basic puzzles for you to solve with your minions.I will say though, that the game adds some new elements that add complexity over the first overlord. I really liked how easy to pick up and play the first overlord was. I have yet to finish overlord II yet, but once I do I will update this review with my more conclusive thoughts.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Overlord 2 is a game where you are a evil overlord having command over 4 types of minions, the developers have added many new features and improved in several ways, they have minion disguises (which are very rarely used), you can now operate machinary and ships, life force is dropped more often, and you can upgrade your minions now.  The game requires you to be able to handle being very evil, they have removed the moral choices between good and bad, and have replaced them with domination and destrucion choices, where you either enslave people (new power) in towns or quests (controllable towns have been added), while the destruction choice is just killing them. if you want to see what level of evil you have to handle, play the demo. The atmosphere is great, you go from glaciers, to tropical forests, to roman sytle cities, to disease ridden wastlelands (which is the map from overlord 1). I think it is a very good game. (if you have an old computer which can run overlord 1, it might not be able to run it, or you will have a delay between button presses and the actions on screen.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game truely does make an effort into making you feel like the ""boss"" It's funny and charming. It sort of feels like a parody of your typical medival fantasy world but instead you're playing as the villain. I do miss the choice making from the first game though. The corruption mechanics and stuff but besides that it's quite the adventure. The addictive part of the game is seeing your empire grow and your overlord becoming more and more of a badass as the game progresses. I enjoy what this game is going for. It's not perfect but it's extremely charming in its own right.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												So after finishing the Overlord franchise finally, I just wanted to say few words of the game.First of all I feel like this franchise is seriously underrated, that being said let me add few things:The game is full of dark humor. It's not the greatest peak of gaming history but well worth the money.Story, characters ,settings are all good. The soundtrack has pretty good tracks in it.You get nice laughs from it and it's nice to be the bad guy for a change.+ You get to hear minions sing a marching song			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Overlord and Overlord II is one of the games you should buy if you are looking to have a great time becoming a badass leader that no one can step up against. This story will have you spending a well deserved amount of time for the 10$ giving you satisfaction all the way through. So get some minions,your mistresses, and start stabing baby seals because your going to have a great time.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Over the first game, this one has few improvements, like mounts for you're minions, the ability to poses minions, boat rides, turret sections, 3 mistresses and if you chose to enslave people, the ability to collect taxes(which you will do alot, because equipment is expensive).However, it abandons the dungeon where you could grind lifeforce and equipment for minions, proper development for your mistress, interesting bosses, decent length even without the expansion, the ability to get all the equipment, without the need of entire hours just to get enough gold for it.Without the comparison to the first game, it is a entertaining game, even though sometime the controls are unresponsive, were you can crush or enslave everything that stands in you're way, unless the game wants to provide a linear corridor where you do what you are told and have no freedom. It is a fun game, but has its caveats. The difference between the two ""playstiles"" (domination or destruction) is do you want a strong army or a strong character.			",152,102,0,23,9,2,7

												For me this game wouldn't have existed.The first episode is a little gem in the gaming world.This game  has a lot of considerable technical improvements, especially about commands,but it was a disappointment for me.I loved the first game of this series, cause the plot was simply, but at the same time very intriguing.The plot of this game is flat.. the game offers few content, the only choice in the game'll not change anything and the ending is very poor and it leaves nothing to the player.Furthermore, maybe I may seem a ♥♥♥♥♥cat, but I was disgusted from the developers' choice of put cute animals as quest monsters to kill with the purpose of exasperate the role of LORD OF EVIL.  Really.. the overlord seems more evil in the first game and you don't have quests in which cute animals are the target, but you have a beautiful thing called ""FREE WILL"" this make a character really evil, not stupid, offensive and useless massacre of animals.However this game has nothing to do with the first episode, buy it but avoid this second episode or play it for completeness, but don't buy it at full price.

												Vastly superior to the first game in every way, this game is a real evil treat as you send half brainded gremlins out to do your bidding pikmin style, the game has thrown in a real self aware sense of humor as well as new aspects and mechanics that keep gameplay fresh, it still has some area's it could use some significant polish, particularly the cutscenes, a few seemed to suffer from drunk cameramen who fell asleep on the job. Still the game is worth much more actual gameplay time than the first which can get you stuck on an area for hours, there's still a tiny hint of that in Overlord 2 but not so much so that it becomes a problem. If you can catch it on a sale (Halloween is usually a good time) Overlord is well worth your time if you enjoy a bit of slapstick, pikmin, and some crude evil humor.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Not as good as the first one, however I still love it! The world doesnt feel as connected as it did in raising hell, and I dont like how the camera hovers above the overlord instead of how it used to be (behind him). Everything else is great, highly reccomend! Yall need to hurry up and make overlord 3!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												If you are old fashioned Canadian, this game is for you. You can club to death baby seals.If you hate hippies, also a good choice. Elves in this game are hippie, PETA ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s and you can chop them to pieces.Also minions get new cuddly mounts like giant spider and wolves. Plus your dark tower is more complex.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												It's only one game every few where one gets to take the roll of the bad guy.  It's rarer yet that such a game would be able to put you in the shoes of a wannabe Sauron to conquer the known world.  It's a refreshing change when instead of holding back the destruction of the world you actually get to cause it.  Nothing does that better than Overlord II.			",167,22,2,21,17,0,36

												One of the best games i would reccomend. I Beat this game awhile ago on PS3 and planning on doing it soon on PC. Overlord and Overlord II is one of the games you should buy if you are looking to have a great time becoming a badass leader that no one can step up against. This story will have you spending a well deserved amount of time for the 10$ giving you satisfaction all the way through. So get some minions,your mistresses, and start stabing baby seals because your going to have a great time.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Over the first game, this one has few improvements, like mounts for you're minions, the ability to poses minions, boat rides, turret sections, 3 mistresses and if you chose to enslave people, the ability to collect taxes(which you will do alot, because equipment is expensive).However, it abandons the dungeon where you could grind lifeforce and equipment for minions, proper development for your mistress, interesting bosses, decent length even without the expansion, the ability to get all the equipment, without the need of entire hours just to get enough gold for it.Without the comparison to the first game, it is a entertaining game, even though sometime the controls are unresponsive, were you can crush or enslave everything that stands in you're way, unless the game wants to provide a linear corridor where you do what you are told and have no freedom. It is a fun game, but has its caveats. The difference between the two ""playstiles"" (domination or destruction) is do you want a strong army or a strong character.			",152,102,0,23,9,2,7

												Though I haven't got many hours into Overlord 2 on Steam, I have played it for many, MANY hours on the XBox 360.  Everything about the game is fun to me even though there may be some lip issues and a slightl sound looping/glitching in the minion warrens at the Netherworld Tower.  Other then the sound glitches (the same in the 360 version), there is nothing I can say bad about this game in the least.  It's one of my favorites and one that I will keep in my library for a long time to come.I'd definitely recommend this game to anyone who was looking for something to put at least two playthroughs into, one for the good side and one to be a pure evil Overlord (as the name entitels).

												Great game with unique gameplay, awesome story, and all around evil fun. In this game, you empower the evil overlord in charge of hordes of minions and proceed to wreak havoc and destruction on elves, gnomes, baby seals, and a pseudo-roman empire.Pros:• Unique gameplay. Another reviewer summed it up perfectly: it plays a bit like Pikmin turned evil. You control a series of expendable minions, which you use to kill, loot, and pillage for you. There are many types of minions, and so a wide variety of strategies are available when deciding how to assault an enemy horde. Furthermore, you yourself can enter the battle wieilding a giant sword in one hand and magic in the other, and so you can choose exactly how to approach enemies. From afar with fire-throwing minions? Up close in a head on attack? Spider-mounted spiders for a sneak attack?• Great funny story and really good voice acting. Furthermore, the emphasis on the need to do evil is, quite frankly, hilarious.Cons:• Camera movement is crude, and can be annoying at times.• Minions seem to lose themselves and/or get killed accidentally surprisingly often. Having said this, it is true that minions are meant to be stupid, so maybe this was done on purpose.OverallGreat game if youre looking for a game to laugh with, if you want a game with a gameplay that differs from the generic mainstream shooters or RPGs in todays market, or if you want to unleash the inner evil overlord inside of you. The only thing its missing is more maps, minions, and perhaps a workshop format with the ability for people to play community-made maps.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												7 out of 10 Overlord 2 is a very decent puzzle game.  Yes it is essentially a puzzle game.  You have to figure out how to get from A to B and do C with minimal casualties. You play as the dark Overlord battling a powerful ruler who's bent on ridding the world of magic. The good: 1. Think carefully how to achieve your objectives.  Throwing in your minions without thought is a good way to get them killed. 2. Game is just the right length. The bad: 3. Some rather tedious bits. 4. More autosave spots are needed in certain areas. 5. The minions like to run off far away from where I directed them. 6. I would have like a better stats system.  What is the difference between two minions in terms of attack and defense?  What about the armor and weapons you craft? The ugly: 7. My game crashed every time I switched to desktop.  Also other crashes.  Not so bad that I could not play. 8. The controls did not work when I tried to change them. The game is worth playing.  It just did not blow me away.  Too often it made me curse in frustration.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is sequel to the first, very well acclaimed Overlord game. It tries to improve on the first, but fails miserably, revealing itself to be in fact an unfinished game driven by an uninteresting story.While the story tries to be interesting, it is pretty bad executed. The premise is that you should have control of what you do, but it ends up just being a ""go there, do that"" game. The minions play a less important role in the gameplay now, they feel a lot more like puzzle tools than your combat army, because they deal 1/10 of your damage, if you just want to kill something, you should not use the minions, it is easier to kill it yourself.The game is filled with glitches, such as minions and enemies getting stuck, objectives not triggering. I finished the main story but I could not complete several side quests due to bugs. I also had a hard time progressing, had to reload several times to get past bugs.Worst of all, the upgrade system. You have several types of upgrades, such as minions, armory and spells. Resources are very limited so you have to be careful with your choices. I completed all levels of minion upgrades and could not notice a difference in damage. The spells you can use are driven by your alignment, since my alignment was good, I did not have any good damage spells, the ones I could use were pretty much useless.You should be able change your alignment based on kill or slave decisions, but the game does not clearly tell you when you can slave, so you end up killing and you cannot go back on these choices, since the autosave overrides everything.Stay away from this game. If you have not played the first, do it because it is much better than this one.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												88/100 -Pros: As a sequel, this game is an improvement compared to the original game. It has a good story, and it has a lot of the features that I liked from the first game such as minions, tactics, upgrades, and loot.  In addition, the catapult gameplay and larger battles makes the game extremely fun. Cons: Your decisions have less of an impact on the story in this game compared to the previous game. In addition, Overlord 2 is also lacking spells that were available in the first game such as the fire spell.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Great follow up game to the first Overlord.  The first Overlord has gone missing so part two has a brand new overlord that looks the same as tthe first one.  There's a lot more to do in this game and cool options such as using a boat to get around certain places. The minion AI is sooo much better in this game than the first one, which was frustrating at times.  MAJOR CON: GRINDYYYYYYY!!  Overlord II took a different approach than the first one with really making you grind it out for gold and minion spirits.  This will take some time if you are trying to upgrade or get  equipment.  There's no reason for a casual game like this to be that grindy.I also felt this game was less tactical than the first one. Overlord II is definitely easier than the first one by far. The only boss I had trouble with was the final boss. Overall, great visuals, a worthy part II, surprisingly strong music, an okay story, and fun. 8/10  Would have rated higher if less grinding.

There are many kinds of minions, those that tank, those that heal those that backstab and those that do ranged damage. You have to master them all in order to crush the evil empire. It's not particularly hard but the visuals and the music make  this really fun game. 7/10			",236,129,2,30,12,0,37

												Overlord 2 is the long awaited sequel for Overlord and It's expansion. What a sequel it is to! Overlord 2 packs so much more than the first two games. Now your minions can ride on animals to solve puzzles, be upgraded to a far greater level, and now you can name, and resurrect favourite minions.You also have a better tower in Overlord 2. Upgrade it to suit your style and always head back home to visit your waiting mistresses. Or why not go to the armoury and craft some home-made armour, or weaponary?The Overlord series is one of the best series I've played in my life. Overlord 2 is far greater, and also has the most fantastic scenary than any of the other overlords. If you're looking for a good christmas game, then this is it! Start off in a magical winter wonderland, only to then visit tropical beaches, wild rainforests, roman temples, and much, much more!Overlord 1 + 2 gets a 10/10 for me.			",177,29,5,20,20,5,29

												Like the first Overlord game this is also a homerun for me. Everything about the game is great. From the story to the simplicity of the gameplay and the slaughter of pesky innocent creatures. The missions are simple; go kill this guy and then go slaughter some of these guys. My only two concerns for this game is:1. Tricky keybinds that are somewhat difficult to master (and are not changeable).2. No ingame control of graphics, or any advanced options for that matter.These drawbacks stems from the fact that the game was ported from Xbox 360.These two points aside, this is a must buy for RPG fans and gives you a good 20 hours of carnage.Edit: I overlooked something in the configuration utility. You can in fact change keybinds (and suddenly everything was easy).			",163,14,7,10,9,1,15

												Overlord 2 is a game where you are a evil overlord having command over 4 types of minions, the developers have added many new features and improved in several ways, they have minion disguises (which are very rarely used), you can now operate machinary and ships, life force is dropped more often, and you can upgrade your minions now.  The game requires you to be able to handle being very evil, they have removed the moral choices between good and bad, and have replaced them with domination and destrucion choices, where you either enslave people (new power) in towns or quests (controllable towns have been added), while the destruction choice is just killing them. if you want to see what level of evil you have to handle, play the demo. The atmosphere is great, you go from glaciers, to tropical forests, to roman sytle cities, to disease ridden wastlelands (which is the map from overlord 1). I think it is a very good game. (if you have an old computer which can run overlord 1, it might not be able to run it, or you will have a delay between button presses and the actions on screen.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												To sum things up, sadly Overlord 2 is worse than the first Overlord. I want to keep this short: Overlord( The original one) was dark, with its typical dark humor. Overlord 2 has this humor but, for real if i am leading a horde of mutated peasants i do expect to kill real enemies, not #420 elfs and obese people from Houston, USA. Another point i disliked ( Well my personal opinion ofc) was the setting, i dont like snowy regions and the elfs looked like being 24/7 on dank haze. Conclusion: Some nice ideas like the ship but overall not as good as the first Overlord. 6/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												My brother bought this one years ago and I played with his CD plenty of times. When I saw it on steam I did not hesitate and bought the full pack, refreshing my old memories of this marvelous piece of art. Graphics are still pretty good. Surely not great for present day standards with visible ""tiled"" textures in bigger areas and some minor derps here and there. But you can burn down enviroment for the sake of burning down enviroment so that's fun and adicting as you'd want it to be. Pros vs cons+You're the evil overlord of many, many mindless minions. The good guys in their shining armor persuing justice? They're the ones you either slay yourself, or you order a couple numbheads to do it for you. +Every minion has indepth name, level, armor, weapons and so on. When your favorite dies you can sacrifice a couple of low level ones to reclaim it, and if you want them back, or just like their hat, you can bring em back anytime. +Magic and melee. That's right, no compromising for the lord of evil. +Domination or destruction! Both greatly rewarding, and depending on who you want to be as evil overlord. -Standard mouse sensitivity is too damn high. That's all i can nag about.			",96,21,1,21,6,2,9

												Overlord 2 is obviously the sequel to the first Overlord, it is a strategic rpg adventure game with a big focus on using your mind over your strength to defeat your enemies. There is a multiplayer option as well as split screen so it looks like coop but the servers are nonexistant.The game isn't that bad, but some aspects of it are an annoyance, such as the pathfinding on minions while enslaved civilians are following you or picking up equipment when they need to get out of the way, farming treasure, life force, and crystals to get that armor you wanted so badly in the forge.There's 4 minions based on colors and 3 mounts for 3 of the minions, each with their own abilities, appearance and combat style. They're all pretty much demons.Browns: They look like goblins, they specialize in melee and are the first you should send, their mounts are wolves who can jump across gaps and while using the ""sweep"" command gain a boost that can break defensive stances on empire units.Reds: They are imps that specialize in fire ranged attacks as well as putting out fires in a weird way but hey it works, keep them away from melee conflicts or they will die, their mounts are salamanders and while using the ""sweep"" command, the reds can run and gun as well as access ramps. There isn't much action for the salamanders though. Just about one level which is disappointing.Greens: Also look like goblins, are melee assassins that specialize in attacking enemies from behind, keep them out of head on attacks by sending them after the browns. Their mounts are spiders they don't add much to combat but they add to mobility by allowing them to go on walls with webs while ""sweeping."" Blues: Aquatic demons that have a high impact on puzzles in the late game who focus on revival and 0 combat effectiveness. Holding the ""sweep"" command will give them a ""blink"" status where they can run through enemies unseen so long as they keep moving as well as temporarily destroying pools of excess magic. No mountsThe story along with it's humor is pretty good and the choices between death and destruction or enslavement is decent but there's not really much of an impact on those choices besides affecting your ""Alignment."" The alignment system I haven't been able to test at all because of how slow it shifts based on killing or enslaving civilians or quest objectives.The greatest disappointments for me were the credits and ending cinematic, major boss fights, the soundtrack which was okay, cinematics being synced to your world (an example of this would be some fleeing archers in freeze frame while x talks about y), and the side quests of controlling a town. I don't know if the disappointments were caused by a budget or anything else. But many things in this game could have been better for its time. Overall a nice buy on sale.3/5Also don't be a ♥♥♥♥ing baby when your game doesnt want to start. Go to the ♥♥♥♥ing forums and look up the problem like a smart human bean.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												88/100 -Pros: As a sequel, this game is an improvement compared to the original game. It has a good story, and it has a lot of the features that I liked from the first game such as minions, tactics, upgrades, and loot.  In addition, the catapult gameplay and larger battles makes the game extremely fun. Cons: Your decisions have less of an impact on the story in this game compared to the previous game. In addition, Overlord 2 is also lacking spells that were available in the first game such as the fire spell.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												For me this game wouldn't have existed.The first episode is a little gem in the gaming world.This game  has a lot of considerable technical improvements, especially about commands,but it was a disappointment for me.I loved the first game of this series, cause the plot was simply, but at the same time very intriguing.The plot of this game is flat.. the game offers few content, the only choice in the game'll not change anything and the ending is very poor and it leaves nothing to the player.Furthermore, maybe I may seem a ♥♥♥♥♥cat, but I was disgusted from the developers' choice of put cute animals as quest monsters to kill with the purpose of exasperate the role of LORD OF EVIL.  Really.. the overlord seems more evil in the first game and you don't have quests in which cute animals are the target, but you have a beautiful thing called ""FREE WILL"" this make a character really evil, not stupid, offensive and useless massacre of animals.However this game has nothing to do with the first episode, buy it but avoid this second episode or play it for completeness, but don't buy it at full price.

Everything about the game is fun to me even though there may be some lip issues and a slightl sound looping/glitching in the minion warrens at the Netherworld Tower.  Other then the sound glitches (the same in the 360 version), there is nothing I can say bad about this game in the least.  It's one of my favorites and one that I will keep in my library for a long time to come.I'd definitely recommend this game to anyone who was looking for something to put at least two playthroughs into, one for the good side and one to be a pure evil Overlord (as the name entitels).

												I picked up this game in a sale because it was rather cheap and i was looking for something to just quickly pick up and play to keep me entertained for a small while. But what i had received was so much more. Not only had this quickly satiated my boredom, but also had intrigued me to the point where i could not put down my gamepad. It's dark humor will give you the occassional chuckle and the fighting system is rather diverse. Using a variety of different minions at your disposal to deal with different foes. If i am entirely honest i would have picked up this game for full price. Would recommend to anyone who doesn't mind a bit of dark humor and some seal clubbing.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
