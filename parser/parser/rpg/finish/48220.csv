												Edit 12/30/13:I didn't expect such a vast amount of comments for this quick review. I will try to explain why I can't recommend this game and how I came to +250h ingame time, just scroll down to the text under the original review.---- Original review ----Do NOT buy this game - even if it is cheap!Why?The game is still full of bugs even after 2 years and UBISOFT stopped supporting the game.No new patch, no apology, NOTHING. They just got your money, why should they care?The game itself could have been great but with all the fuss I had to endure I won't recommend this piece of garbage to anyone. Trust me, you're better off with buying games which actually deserve your support.I repeat: DO NOT BUY THIS GAME. Show UBISOFT that they can't treat customers like this.------------------------------1) My rig at the time I bought this game:- Intel i5 2400- Nvidia N560GTX-Ti Twin Frozr II/OC- ASRock P67 Pro3 (B3)- Spinpoint F1 1000GB, SATA II (HD103UJ) then ADATA S511 120GB, SATA 6Gb/s SSD- ADATA 2x4GB 1333MHz CL92) How did you freak manage to get to +250h game time?You can subtract at least a third for the time I encountered crashes, game bugs which forced me to restart a map or simple idle time.I'm also a completionist, an achievement wh*re. In maps without a time frame I usually pick up every treasure, kill every monster and do every sidequest. This type of playstyle is time consuming :).Now take into account that I encountered nasty bugs which forced me to replay a map or browse the web for a solution. And there is also my profile swap which I will explain later.3) Is this a rant against Ubisoft or the game? Why didn't put the game aside and waited for a patch?The game itself could have been great!But it is still bugged and you have to find a way if you want to continue the story. Some achievements are luck based - you get them or not. The only way to get them is to replay the campaign map.I put the game aside for a couple of months in between patch 1.5 until 1.8. The discount on the DLC (-50%) drawn me back.Hope dies last. I wanted to give UBISOFT and their new developer team a chance to fix the game. It's better now but the NVIDIA black screen bug is still there and now they dropped their support.How can I recommend a bugged game to anyone? I simply can not.4) Which (nasty) bugs did you encounter in your long journey?My guess would be 90% because I explored the whole map ;). Just a simple summary about the fixed bugs I encountered in previous game versions and the ones that are still there.I. Nvidia Black Screen Bug (still there)You play the game and suddenly it freezes. Most of the time it's a black screen while the sound is still played. It can happen randomly or it can be reproduced via savegame. Sometimes it can happen in a fight or (no kidding) by walking over a certain spot on the map. I managed to continue the story by loading the savegame and trying every angle.As mentioned above I had a HDD at that time which had a horrible loading time :). From patch to patch there have been improvements or it would get worse. I never rolled back my drivers but I can play it almost without crashes now.I can not safely say which GFX will work without problems. Some do, some don't.II. The achievement swap bug (fixed)Right after a patch a new feature was introduced - looking at achievements of other players.Beeing a jolly fellow I wanted to test it and look where I stand. Bad idea ---My ~85% done achievement list was copied from the one I looked at - a 30% done player.I spent some time to find someone who had at least 80% done and never used that feature again. Guess what - I still had to replay a lot of maps to get that ONE damn missing achievement :).I talked to the UBISOFT customer service that they get my achievements back but they told be that they can't do anything which I do not understand even today. After the short ""We're sorry that we f*cked up but you have to fix it on your own"" conversation I bit my tongue and played on.UBISOFT was so kind to give me a dynasty weapon that I already owned as a compensation :).I contacted the customer service three times about different game related problems and none of them have been resolved.III. The plague bug (fixed)One of my favorites. I happened to meet this little fellow three times.There is no creature growth, in fact it is negative. You can't get any creatures because ""week of the plague"" is active all the time. No creatures means that you have to end the map with the creature stacks you have as your army. Might sound funny but it slows your combat down because you can't afford to lose any unit :).IV. The little bugs (fixed and still there)- Achievements that only trigger sometimes (an example would be in the DLC - the treasure achievement which I tried to get recently)- Crash spots in the the map (also in the DLC and the original game)- Spell or creature related bugs e.g. the famous griffin bug (The creature would not deal any damage when using their special ability). Still a vast amount out there. Some players couldn't finish the tutorial (!) because their creatures wouldn't heal. A game which has a lot of different spell/creature combinations can have a few bugs but not to that amount.- Dynasty weapon which would get lost if you didn't put them on a charater and saved (reloaded) the map. There is still a nasty bug which will happen if you reload the map and use certain class spells (e.g. dark) while having certain dynasty weapons equipped (the spell power goes down, permanently).This is an endless list. If you want to dig any deeper just visit the UBISOFT forum and click on the 334 pages long bug thread.---TL;DR:I could write a little bit more about the game's story and how the maps are designed.The story is fine and I enjoyed it quite a bit. The map design, especially the new DLC (new developers) is brilliant.Why won't I still recommand the game?Because the release version was horrible, the customer ""service"" doesn't deserve the name and the game itself is still a huge pile of bugs with a few moments of happiness.With a continued support (multiplayer = bug-ridden) and an open communication between the fans and the developers this could have been the best game in the series.It is not.I will change my review in that way:If you have an ATI GFX or don't mind restarts, if you are not interested in achievements and are able to restart maps without getting angry then this might be a game for you.About the DRM/Uplay, it is annoying but not that important to me.We're using Steam which is the same but has a lot more time on the market.Granted, Uplay is horrible and I got kicked out of the game every time their servers went down.I developed a habit to press the quicksave button after every turn because I had to reload an older savegame a couple of times. I have a 50Mbit cable connection and traffic is not an issue.On the other hand I never played Mass Effect 3 because of Origin :). I will though.Well, I am done. Thank you for reading and I wish you all the very best!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

I would play my heroes game - all offline -  for 2-3 hours and then mysteriously the game service would disconnect and I would lose all my progress.

												The game it's not that bad, but didn't enjoy it as I did with Heroes III. But the support from Ubisoft it's one of the worst I've seen. Couldn't play for a week because they ran out of keys or something, and when asked for a refund they said I had to talk to steam and then steam said to talk to ubisoft, etc. etc. Not mentioning you have to install Uplay to play this, which you should take care because it installs add-ons in your web browser without your consent.EDIT: Forgot to add that you shouldn't buy it for the multiplayer, even after nearly 2 years of release, you'll get desync and/or corrupt your save which won't let you play any further.

												For the following reasons, avoid this game at all costs:1- It's a single player game that requires you to always be online.2- Steam is not enough, you have to register and log int Ubisoft's Uplay3- Ubisoft's Uplay is a piece of garbage. It NEVER works. Thus, you are UNABLE to acess your game.4- Don't even bother to contact Uplay's customer support. They don't bother to answer.5- By the way, Ubisoft NEVER FINISHED THE GAME, and by the looks of it, they never will.As you can see from my records, I did manage to play this game for a while. The game itself is not bad, though it's dlc is buggy and unfinished. The big problem here is the uplay thing, as it will prevent you from enjoying yor game.  ",54,1,0,7,2,0,12

												No matter how much discount youo get, do not buy this game. Simple as that. I get it that some people say this game is fun, i spend xxx hours on it well worth the money blah blah blah. Whats the point of having a game, if you cant play it when you want to? Whats the point of a game being fun, if you cant play it at all?Many a time during weekends, I boot up my gaming laptop looking for stuff to play, and I open up MnM6. Its just♥♥♥♥♥♥♥stuck at Uplay trying to find upgrades or Conflux cant connect and stuff. I have completely given up and I accept that Ubi soft scammed a few dollars from me with a vastly inferior product. But you guys still have a chance! DO NOT FALL IN THIS TRAP LIKE I DID!This thing cant even be called a game. Its like buying an iphone realising it is a piece of plastic with a lockscreen painted on it. Its not worth the money and the frustration. Great way to kill a great franchise. With such an attitude towards its product and such an excellent engineering quality, Im sure Ubi will continue to succeed in whatever they do. This is the worst money spent on a game ever for me.

												Guys, as much as we've all encountered a Heroes of Might & Magic game in the past, this one is just another in the trash pile that has been around since Heroes of Might & Magic IV. There are bugs. Lots of bugs. Ubisoft took over primary support of this game since its conception and the bankruptcy of Blackhole in 2011, and there have been 11 official patches to date, all of which fixed one thing, only to break another thing. It's hard for a support company (Ubisoft) to do all the work the parent company was supposed to do, but as it stands, with the announcement in September of 2013, Ubisoft is moving on to greener pastures, and Patch 2.1.1 is the last of the ""fixes"" issued. There are still bugs that can spoil a game, for example, in the campaign mode, where the Town Portal spell has been disabled because there was no town to be used, and that data is saved with your character as they progress to the next level (even after a new map and load screen) and are unable to use the spell even there. The only fix is to restart the campaign all over and ""hope"" that the spell will work anew.Too many things in the game variables are hit-or-miss - random to the point of useless. Though the idea behind dynasty weapons and progressive character leveling, and select campaign character class traits is something innovative, the game really falls short of delivering all its potential because there is no way to avoid even one of these numerical/action-based failures. To be fair, I did find myself enjoying the campaign, albeit generic in some places, even through the bugs.Now, the multiplayer function is where the fun is supposed to be. If there is one good thing about this game, its the 'Hotseat' multiplayer function. I say this to the shame of the online mode which, like its single-player counterpart, has many issues all its own. Technical difficulties abound in the online-mode: random disconnects, frozen turns, black screens, jumpy combat and frazzled animations to name a few. Hotseat seems to avoid the vast majority of these issues, and runs almost identically to the single-player custom and campaign modes.In my final analysis, this game is not at all worth the money Ubisoft has it priced out as, nor is it worth the time I (selflessly) invested in it. There are plenty of other turn-based SRPGs out there, like the earlier versions of the Heroes franchise, like Heroes of M&M 2, or earlier still, Age of Wonders, or even Master of Magic.This particular game just isn't worth your time or money.

												Not sure why I bought this. I didn't like videos of this and what they did too my precious mercury, too, I didn't. But yeah, first about parts I actually enjoyed.The setting of Falcon Empire Era is pretty neat, with all that skulldruggery, old ways of Ilath, orcbros, oceanic weaboo empire, necromancers not as power-hungry cartoon villains, but bizarre keepers of balance (more like it was in Diablo II). Story is good enough too. The split dynasty, the rise of Railag, the crazy adventures of Crag Hack (though I found this one quite boring, but then again, I was playing this for a while at that particular point) and a little fanservice with Sandro cameo (OHGODIT'SREALLYHIM). Dunno about vampire campaign though.Sanctury is a good addition to the world, it's unlike anything you saw in Ashan before and I hope we'll see more of Naga Samurais and Sharkmen in the future.The system of unlockables through seals is decent. Provides a bit of stimulus to play it if you feel you are bored here (and it happens pretty fast).Now, the bad parts.Soundtrack. Quite unremarkable.The balance. The problem here is not overpowering something, but making it too difficult to figure out (the same mistake devs did in HoMMIV with cross-classes and tons of perks). See, there are just too many perk combos you can't really predict, because spells are perks here. In HoMMIII you could point your finger at a guy playing Necropolis or Conflux and call him an a-hole, In HoMMV you could point your finger at Kaspar starter, here...well...you can't. And it's not really a good thing (but it may appear so). Still, if you like overcomplification, you may just ignore what I said.While devs created complications, they simplified the resource part. Which feels...unfair,Ah yes, map layouts. Region - based map isn't a good solution for me. You can't raid mines behind enemy lines, now you have to sabotage them or keep you secondary hero there all the time. This is a huge problem when we come to next point...Overuse of town portals. No really, this is a big issue. While they provide mobility, they are, well, too damn essential. You can easily evade encounter with enemy via it. And...everybody gets it for free. No spell, no perk, you just need enough mana to cast it.Oh, about Conflux service. It wasn't down at the time I played it, so maybe Ubi fixed it. Maybe. Still, I'm okay with being online to play.Still, the review is ""mixed"", so I have to claim ""non-recomendation"" here is gentle here, not strong. You wanna your 60 hours (well, I lasted nearly that amount) for that price - fine, go for it. If not, or you have bad experience with Uplay - better save the money for sale or whatever product on Steam you want more.Heh, probably the longest one I've written so far.			",176,37,0,45,16,1,33

												If you came here looking for the best in the Heroes of Might and Magic series, turn around and buy Heroes Of Might and Magic 3. Ideally the complete edition.If you came here for a more recent game play feel and fun game, go buy Heroes V: Tribes of the East.If you are still reading this let me tell you why Might and Magic: Heroes VI Shades of Darkness is bad then you are in luck. The biggest problem with the game is it takes what made the previous games so good, the uniqueness of the different factions, waters them down and makes sure they are all bland different colours of each other. Every race has a creature that operates as a harpy used to, with a strike and return ability. Whole factions have been removed or completely redone, racial abilities and advantages have been removed. None of that made the game unenjoyable for me. No what did that was the horrible Hero system that was implemented.Heroes now come in 2 flavours, Might or Magic. You can no longer see what your hero specialises in beyond their flavour until you have already selected them and are playing away. Most of the heroes and factions are also locked behind a in game store front, they are free but they have to be manually unlocked one by one. We aren't talking a few heroes, there are over 20 that need to be unlocked, with whole factions like the Demons and Stronghold blocked off. Once you are in game it doesn't get much better, if you buy a hero, there is no way of dismissing the hero, other than sending them to their death against a monster stack or enemy hero.  Another bad change that has been made is giving every faction and town two versions of town portal. The first version allows you to teleport a hero and army to any other controlled city, the second one teleports a hero and their army to the nearest town with a portal building. This sounds great, right? Wrong. It completely destroys tactically positioning your heroes on the map and means the enemy just portals away to a town. End games become a constant back and forth of heroess teleporting to at risk towns, a very un-fulfillingg way for games to end.I have had lots of problems gettign the game to run, it has 3 different forms of DRM at work, Steam, Uplay and Conflux. I often find the game wont actually load unless launched through Uplay and only then about 2/3 times. I have had no luck with multiplayer, the game telling me I need to connect to the internet, when I am already connected, which the game knows because of the afore mentioned DRM. The official word from Ubisoft is this requires port forwarding. I have a no desire to go messing around inside my hub's settings. I find the idea that you need to port forward to get the game working, even through Steam, Uplay and Conflux is a joke.Seriously just avoid it at all costs.			",108,9,0,13,14,0,28

												Yesterday, I tried to play this game for the first time and couldn't, because Uplay registration failed with the message ""We're unable to create your account right now as a Ubisoft server is unavailable."" Today, I attempted the same thing, with the same result. I literally can't play this game because of the Uplay DRM, and if I'd known before what I know now about the endless issues other users have had, this among them, I would have prevented my girlfriend from buying this for me and for herself. This product literally does not work, so it gets a solid -1 out of 5 - AVOID AT ALL COSTS.			",181,32,5,35,17,1,19

												This game is crippled by always on DRM. The game booted me back to the menu while in the middle of a battle. My internet connection didn't drop, just their DRM servers. I would have thought by now (over 3 YEARS after release!) Ubisoft would have removed this broken and draconian DRM system, but it appears not.Even after Ubisoft said they have abandoned always on DRM back in 2012 in favour of a one-time activation, it looks like they didn't bother to patch it out of their older games - even after 3 years!DO NOT BUY.

												Disclaimer: I only played campaigns. I really wanted to like this game, I really did. The problem is that M&M:H is not HoM&M. Heroes of Might and Magic games were strategy games with RPG elements. This one...even the name is just wrong...  I don't know what it tries to be. It's no longer strategy game because of all oversimplifications in the mechanics  and AI blatantly cheating. Yes, computer needs some advantages to make things challenging but in previous games it was limited to giving AI better starting position, some free resources and ability to win fights withour losses. In this game however computer is not bound by the most fundamental rule of this game: production limits. This means player and AI no longer play the same game. This is intolerable in strategy.So perhaps it's meant to be RPG with strategy elements, like Kings' Bounty? Well, the game doesn't do that either, because it's turned based and thus lacks the liveness and pacing of KB.Then there are 'dynasty artifacts'. This is possibly the worst idea in the history of the franchise. Acquiring good artifacts before your opponent used to be imporant aspect of the game. Now, you open a menu and equip a relic of your choosing at the start of each map.  Because UPlay.There are some good ideas in this game. For example: I like 3-tier unit system. If it's better than 7-levels from H3 and 5 is a matter of taste, but it worked better than I expected. As much as I like (or used to like) the franchise, I cannot really recommend this game. For die hards Heroes fans only.			",60,11,0,12,9,1,25

Might & Magic: Heroes VIReleased: Oct 2011Developer: Black HolePublisher: UbisoftPros: Campaign story lines are some of the better written and more interesting ones in the series. Pleasing aesthetic, good overall visual design. OST is a mixed bag but there are some very nice tracks as well. Factions and their units are well designed. Each faction has their flavour, and almost all combat units have unique traits and abilities.Cons: Uplay.  Not that I am that much against it, but Uplay has deleted my saves for this game a number of times, it is infuriating. An additional THIRD DRM layer called Conflux that you must be connected to at all times to access Dynasty weapons or traits, even in single player.  If you for any reason lose connection to it while playing a game, it will drop you to the main menu without even saving your game first. Technical issues.  Black screen when loading Town or Battle screens happen frequently, forcing game restarts.  With many mice, just moving the cursor on the screen makes the frame rate literally freeze to 0. Bugs.  Dozens, if not hundreds of bugs, minor and major have been in this game since release.  Not one frak has been given by the developers and the publisher to fix anything, focusing instead of pumping out DLC.  Some examples:  Many hero skills either do literally nothing, or act REVERSE.  Picking 'Pathfinding' for example doubles the rough terrain penalty instead of reducing it!  Almost all Dynasty weapons can severely cripple your hero permanently, when equipped.  Some will reduce your hero's magic power each day it is equipped, 'Affinity' weapons increase your spell costs to unmanageable levels.  Maps also have a number of bugs. I've several times had to restart a map from the start, after finding out for playing for hours that a keep I had to capture for a quest, simply did not spawn on the map properly, for example. Instead of getting a choice of skills, when heroes level they put points into a talent tree.  I personally dislike this method, it takes the fun out of hero development.  Once you learn what skills are good, you typically build all your heroes the same way. Atrocious AI.  Some of the worst I've seen, possibly rivalled by the HOMM IV AI only.  It literally doesn't play the same game as you.  It is given huge amounts of resources each day. but even then doesn't understand the concept of upgrading its towns.  It is given heroes and large armies for free every week to send at you, with a larger army each week.  Wipe them out too slow and their free unit spam will soon vastly outnumber anything the players can buy in their towns.  Adventure map armies also grow in the same manner, a strong design flaw that makes rushing for the win the single most important priority on every map you play, every time.  I was very disappointed to learn how the game actually works in the regard. In combat, particularly during the campaigns, nothing comes close to the importance of healing and resurrecting units, to minimize casualties in each battle.  It is basically the only really viable way to play the campaigns without losing too many units to be able to finish the maps.  I would have liked to see other viable ways to play.Other thoughts:There isn't that much else to say.  This is one of the weakest and most disappointing games in the series, which could have been pretty good if it was only given the chance.  It is disgusting to see how this release was handled, with zero effort taken into patching out all the bugs and problems it suffers, Ubisoft instead only focusing on producing more bugged DLC's to sell.  Game design wise I was not a fan of the simplified resource management and hero development either, but I could have lived with it if the rest of the game was in a playable state.It's a big shame, since I was actually really enjoying the campaigns, having tested the Haven, Necro and Sanctuary ones, but the gamebreaking bugs prevent me from being able to finish any of them.  I am not interested in restarting them over and over to play around the bugs.For those looking for a high fantasy strategy game to play I would recommend steering clear of MMH VI and instead getting HOMM III Complete from www.gog.com, or perhaps try my personal favourite in the series, HOMM V with both its expansions, its patches and the superb AI improvement third party mod.

												This was a gift and you have to register through Ubi-soft's UPlay which doesn't work and hasn't worked for over two weeks.  I reinstalled the game and it still required UPlay before playing and it would simply not load.UPlay support is off-line or won't respond.  A TOTAL WASTE OF MONEY.  But Ubi-soft has always been bad, almost as bad as EA.  Save your money and buy Age of Wonders II.			",10,5,0,12,6,0,24

												I Ignored the warnings about Uplay and Ubisoft because i am an unconditional fan of the series, i own Heroes 1 till 5, and i´ve been playing since i was a kid, so i couldn´t resist.But Uplay faked me up and decided to fall down when i was registering the game, and now it wont register, i want my money back Uplay sucks, Ubisoft sucks, I WILL NEVER AGAIN BUY A UPLAY GAME, NEVER!! Good luck to you guys who choose to ignore these warnings like i did, give you money to these thieves and make them millionaires with your hard earned money.PD: Ever since I installed the Ubisoft launcher my computer is messed up, internet keeps falling, steam keeps hanging up, i have to reset my router every 10 minutes. I recuperated a safety copy on my PC just before I installed this crap, and now 2curiously2 everything works fine. NEVER INSTALL UBISOFT MALAWARE. ",65,4,3,2,7,0,3

												Did I have fun while playing? - Yes, when I wasn't busy cursing it for all the bugs it had.For players looking to buy the game, here are a list of bugs I remember offhand  that really spoit my gaming experience.-Bugged pathfinding, that your talents make you move lesser instead of further.-Bugged spell dynasty weapon, that made you lose spellpower EVERY TURN and EVERY RELOAD (you will not be able to see it in your character doll tooltip). This actally forced me to restart my first campaign after 2 maps... as my magic character was totally useless by the time I discovered it.-Bugged spells that don't work as indicated. This isn't a game breaking thing but when I pay for my game I expect it to work as intended.-Conflux which forces you to be always online in order to use and level your dynasty weapons, among other things. I don't mind being always online, but when it loses connection and it does it often enough, it kicks you back to the main screen WITHOUT saving. Yea so you lose all your progress. With auto save it is not nearly as bad as it sounds but it's bad. REALLY BAAAADDD.All in all I wouldn't really recommend it to any new players. After reading weeks of forums it does not appear that Ubisoft will be putting much effort to supporting it further, that is no more major patches, if any at all. In the current state (patch 2.1.1) it is playable, but just barely. And if you do play it, be prepared to swear. A lot.			",43,10,0,10,6,0,3

												It's a decent game, you'll really enjoy it if you do like the Heroes franchise, there's really nothing else to be said.HOWEVER... It does force Uplay on you and in most of my experiences with the game its been messing with the online play and it doesn't really matter if its fun because in the end, Ubisofts DRM makes it unplayable and it grows really tiresome after a while and when you want to play with friends, well you can't. Simple as that.The mix with servers not working, online play not working and Uplay is ruining the experience, this is not the 90s we shouldn't have to spend hours to try and fix problems with our games when all we wanted to do was to play online with friends, its disgraceful to release a game with software like this.This is how i would rate this game:7/10 - Single player1/10 - multiplayer because its unplayable and it will drain the fun right out of you.This is the game that made me boycotte Ubisoft games because they're just not a PC-friendly company.

												Overall, I think this could be a great game. It holds your hand a little too much for my tastes, but it is still true M&M amazingness. HOWEVER - and this is a huge deal - I do not reccommend purchasing this game for the crazy protection it has. It requires you to install uPlay so it is redicilous that I have to run uPlay through Steam just to play Heroes VI. And if at any time you disconnect from the internet, the game just quits. No autosave, no nothing. It is completely unacceptable to punish someone for playing your game, when I could play it happily offline with a pirated version. Won't be getting any Ubisoft products in the future.			",27,14,0,29,11,0,16

Slower than any other HoMM, unnecessary animations everywhere, slow turns  and a smaller map with bigger units just makes the whole experience unpleasant. To make this whole game any ♥♥♥♥♥ier, add a DRM which doesnt work most of the time and a built-in DRM by the name of CONFLUX which forces you to stay online, even to play a single game, power goes off ? you lose the internet connection ? CONFLUX kicks you out of the game. Sub-par HoMM gameSlow and  bad TBRTS with bad factions and horrible unit designIntrusive DRMs at every corner. Skip it like the plague. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I realized early that Heroes 6 is the weakest installment of the series. It has an utterly generic story that has nothing to do with the events of the previous titles and a gameplay that lacks any inspiration. But I could have ignored that, since, despite being not a very good title, the game still has some solid entertainment.What really killed it for me is the ""always online"" issue, even if you really just want to play a single-player game and don't even care about multiplayer. While being always online in Steam is usually a non-issue, having to be always online on the notoriously unstable Uplay network can be a pain.Also if Uplay servers are down for any reason and you try to work around that by starting the client in offline-mode the game will begin giving you trouble. For example it will refuse to let you load any of your savegames, because games you played while you were online are not available when you are offline. And if it has a particularly bad day it will deactivate completely, tell you that your version of Heroes 6 is ""unregistered"" and demand that you go online to register your already registered game another time before you are allowed to play the game again. So that's my real issue.However, if you need another reason, then here is a word for those of you who just happen to be die-hard fans of the series like me: please take my warning. This game does NOT continue the events of Heroes 5 and/or Dark Messiah of Might and Magic. It is a prequel that surrenders the previous story-line completely.I mean: Bloody hell! It's not like Ubisoft left us with a cliffhanger after Heroes 5, where the dark messiah, possessed by a half-naked, smoking-hot succubus, stopped the necromancers and their alliance of the willing from dropping weapons of mass-destruction on the underworld, destroyed the skull of the seventh dragon to free the demon-lord and open the gates of hell. So that the dark lord would rise from the abyss speaking the magic words: ""I am your father"". You know - introduce some global warming: the lucifer-way. And right before we found out if the world was going to end and if beelzebub actually can be a picture-book daddy... curtains dropping! The end.And here comes Heroes 6 and it starts with the words ""2000 years earlier""! Wait a minute, Ubisoft: I thought we just had some serious armageddon and succubus-action going on here! What happened to good old: smash skull first, eat brains later?So honestly: unless you are really desperate for another Might and Magic title, just skip Heroes 6 and wait for Heroes 7. You won't be missing out on anything at all.			",39,10,0,20,3,0,10

												After being in love with Heroes 2 and 3 i thought this game would be great. Now that UBIsoft own the game franchise I feel there is no more passion being put into it.

												I was a big fan of the series and in particular, I really enjoyed Heroes III and V. This new sequel has left a bitter taste to my mouth. If the campaign is not resolved in a particular way that the AI wishes then you are either stuck on the scenario until eternity or you have to restart it. Another negative point for me is that the AI ""cheats"" meaning that they get disproportionate bonuses or irrational advantages in order to stay competitive relative to human players. Although considerable ammount of work has gone into this title, the game does grow stale and tedious after a while. You get the impression that you're a hamster in a trainning wheel. So despite being a big fan of previous titles, I'll have to decline giving a positive reccomendation for this one.			",18,17,1,18,20,0,21

												Game itself is 7 or 8/10. It has some good ideas. Campaigns are ok. Battles are ok.Reason I strongly disencourage you from buying this game is Uplay/Conflux and Ubisoft policy.I wasted 15+ hours dealing with Uplay, bugs and crushes.I lost all my clouded saves. Support haven't responded yet. So I replayed half of Campain.I met game breaking bug with stucked enemy hero. Bug known for year on forum. I had to replay map 3 times to avoid this event. Screen go black sometimes when you enter city or battle or game just crush without anything. This occurs every 1-2 hours.Every time I need to reload the game I see unskipable logo of company I will avoid. GJ Ubisoft.			",155,40,1,24,21,1,38

												While the game itself ""as is"" is not so bad, the following are the points which are just plainly put, true facts which heavily outweight the positive points of the game:- Gamebreaking bugs present- No continuing support from Ubisoft- Broken 3rd party DRM that you have to forcefully shut down with task manager (after you closed it with regular means via UI).- Tactical field in sqares and not hexagons (simply put - from software engineering perspective squares are ""easier"" to implement).- No communication with community in forums.- Game must be 24/7 connected to internet (Conflux). Not a problem, except in cases where the ""Conflux"" is down whole weekends.- Scenario has a ""canon"" story progression which must be played in specific order to really enjoy the campaign; there are many people who simply played a single faction from start to end and just spoiled the whole story. The campaign must be played with each faction in parallel...these details were not present anywhere ingame...details were provided in forums not by Ubisoft, but by the fanbase which analysed the story progression across all factions mission by mission.- Might & Magic system which is totally ridiculous and not connected with original titles (Gain new spells by putting your level up point in a spell...there are no random spells to be found, or spells researched in towns).- The supposed morale (Tears and Blood) system which should have led to many many different kinds of endings, yields only just a minor difference in the final missions (you end up with one or another hero accompanying you). Therefore this system is there just to sprinkle confetti around in E3 presentations and etc.Some good things:+ Art & music i guess.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I purchased a single player game, why do I need to sign up for a secondary account to play a single player game.  If I wanted to sign up for an online game, sure, make me sign up for an online account, but I dont really game online very much.  I might even be able to tollerate having to sign up for a secondary gaming account through the game creators, but the game keeps telling me it cant register my account because they have no available servers.  Thus, I cant play the game.  If I cant play the game, Ive wasted my money.  Trying to tell me otherwise will be wasting your time.  If the game creators fix this issue and I can finally play, I might change this review, but as it stands, I would not reccomend buying this game.Edit and update:  The service they want me to sign up for is called Uplay, and is similar to Steam and Games for Windows Live, which are both services meant to sell and confirm that I legally own a game.  My problem with this is when I buy a game off ONE of these sites, I dont expect to have to register it to a second one.  Ive spent months trying to get this ""Uplay"" program to update and run properly.  Ive tried updating it, checking to make sure it functions properly with my firewall, and just about everything else imaginable.  When Uplay runs properly, I managed to get this game registered to a Uplay account and logged into Uplay via my new account.  I did everything as was part of the deal and it either crashes upon launching, or it loads properly and claims it ""cant find the game file"".... and THEN crashes.  I did manage to get the game to load ONCE, and it crashed within 5 minutes of loading.  I didnt even get past the menu screen.As of now, Im done trying.  I cannot recommend any M@M games that involve this Uplay farce until it works properly.  I purchased a game, I should be able to play said game.  Because I cannot, I fail to see why I should ever buy another game from this company.			",199,46,1,59,6,1,40

												I bought it on weekend -75% sale and it wasn't even worth those few euros. Uplay makes the game 100% unplayable - I wasn't able to run it after creating the Uplay account at all. Maybe I'll just have to crack the legally bought game in order to enjoy it.As usual, legal customers are the ones that get screwed by irresponsible publisher.Mar 15: Now that I somehow managed to run the game, maybe it's time to say something about the game itself, not the DRM.Within those 5-6 hours played I'm in 2nd scenario of Necropolis campaign. Here's my experience:+ Heroes can travel without army and scenarios don't end with failure after one lost battle, the hero can be resurrected+ I may be the minority that likes the concept of teritorial control in order to profit from mines and dwellings+ Option of converting cities and dwellings to your fraction is a big gamechanger~ Abandoning creature levels (1-7) in favor or ""tiers"" (Core, Elite, Champion) is something I did not expect and I'm unsure whether it's a good or bad thing~ Not sure how to feel about Altar of Wishes, as it gives you possibility to ""purchase"" bonuses improving your heroes. I'd be okay with it if it was only for profile customization, like titles etc.~ Interface is pretty much a copypaste from Heroes 5 which can be either perceived as lazyness, or an intentional move to stick to something that players are familiar with- Be always online to play the campaign- Some of the soundtrack (as well as some sound effects) is just a rehash from Heroes 5 and Dark Messiah (I'm looking at you, Inferno town theme)- Did you like full 3D town screens in Heroes 5? I loved them. Bid farewell to them, because here we're back to 2D drawings. Of course they are pretty, but I loved town screens in H5.Overall, the review is still a ""no"", even though I'm somewhat enjoying playing it, but that may be just a long desire to get a new taste of Heroes. I'm not saying ""you shouldn't buy this game"" - it's more like ""I can't pinpoint to whom I'd recommend this game"". If you like Heroes series and 7,5 euros isn't too big deal for you, sure, go for it. If not, maybe other reviews will help you make up your mind.			",62,4,2,1,4,2,5

												Honestly, just don't buy this game. Ubisoft did a number on the game, especially with their support.I seriously love the series, and have been playing them since the first installment. So I started playing VI, and quite enjoyed, except that I was surprised by the amount of bugs and game-crashes it had. But then, in October 2012, the game just froze everytime the city-screen opened. Searching through the fora I was not the only one with that issue. It took a few weeks for any update on this issue.The reaction of Ubisoft for 6 months long (!) was: ""just don't update your NVIDIA drivers, and go back to an older version of NVIDIA, untill we release a patch in April 2013"". I bought a game and have been unable to play it for 6 months. It's now december 2013, ubisoft have stopped the support for the game since september, and it is STILL riddled with dozens of bugs.Just don't get it. Hope for another publisher to revive the series and put some love into it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Might be a great game, but since Ubisoft forces Uplay upon me I can't play the game anymore because I upgraded my pc.Tried to reset the password several times but the great application Uplay and the fantastic support system at Ubisoft have not managed ( after several attempts over several weeks) to reset my password so that I can log on and be allowed to play the game I have bought. Also note that if your internett connnection goes down or if you want to play somewhere without a internet connection. Sorry no can do because you must be connected to ""unlock"" your game with the great oh so stable Uplay app which is crappy and unstable.Sorry Ubisoft you have lost me as a customer forever. It should be enough that we autenticate thru Steam.Uplay is just a stupid low life paranoid controll freak application.EDIT:After getting some Assasins creed game as a prensent from my bro I once again had to try to get uplay to work. Tried the unbiisoft homepage and password reset yet again without luck. Then after nagging on ubisofts FB page i finally got in touch with support and the person i talked to was very helpfull and we figured it out and could reset my PW.			",29,20,0,9,2,0,1

Posted: April 9, 2014
												I have been a fan of Heroes of Might and Magic since Heroes II The Price of Loyalty.  Heroes III is arguably the best in the franchise.  I really enjoyed Heroes IV though.And then came UbiSoft...It seemed their mission was to destroy the beloved franchise.  With Heroes V came lame, watered-down spell-casting.  The graphics were good in 2007, I had no problems there.  The inability to divide your troops in your army was bad.  I had all but given up on Heroes of Might and Magic.Then I saw Heroes VI.  The graphics are fantastic.  The animation is good.  The storyline is interesting, if a bit underdeveloped.  I like the ability to convert towns, forts, and dwellings.  I have played this game for over 240 hours, and beaten all of the campaigns and expansions.  I like the hours of playability it provides for one player.  It doesn't hinge on multiplayer like so many other games do these days.  I love the Necropolis in this game.  The Altar of Eternal Servitude provides a deliciously twisted advantage as your army never dies, depending on if you have enough resources.  The Haven is excellent despite only one shooter.  I'm better with the Sanctuary than even the Necropolis.  The Stronghold is just impressively strong.  I like the Dungeon expansion.Now for what I don't like:1.  I don't like how you have to go through UPlay whenever you turn the game on or off.  ""Synchronizing Your Saved Games With The Cloud"" takes a very long time, and only works maybe 12% of the time.  It is highly frustrating.  I want to be able to click on the game and have it load.  When I quit to desktop, I want the game to quit.  This is the first game I've had to deal with these issues.  The benefit UPlay seems to provide does not outweigh the cost of time and sanity.2.  I don't like how I reached Platinum level before I completed all of the campaigns.  On paper, I should be one of the best players in the world.  Once you max out on experience there really isn't much to play for.  On campaigns the maximum hero level happens too quickly.  The maps are epic in scope, and there is so much to do, but if you max out your levels one-fifth of the way through the map then it's not fun anymore.  I understand that the experience keeps going into the dynasty weapons, but you really don't see that happening.  Let us players continue to grow!3.  I don't like the Haven's faction ability.  They are pretty much the antithesis of the Necropolis except for the faction ability.  Necromancy heals troops, but Guardian Angel doesn't?  At least until level IV.  No, the Haven faction ability should be healing.4.  The Necromancers differ in this game in that they don't raise skeletons after each combat.  Other than that, I love the Necropolis.5.  I do not like that troop growth is centered around your overall kingdom.  I miss having a lot of troops.  Instead of only getting 8 Core creatures a week, for instance, you should get those 8 Core creatures from every castle you own plus every creature dwelling every week.  That is one upgrade I do not like.  At least you have the ability to divide your troops in your army, and among secondary heroes.  Give us more troops!6.  I have a very nice gaming computer, and Heroes VI still glitches to where I have to just shut the game down and start back at the last save.  And that takes forever because I'm waiting for Uplay to sync.  Glitches happen, I know, but I haven't heard of any patches in months.7.  The Inferno has been completely castrated.  It's so hard to look at.  I get the Chaos aspect, but still...Inferno has been done better.  Get rid of the Inferno and bring back the Sylvan elves.8.  I absolutely hate spell recharges.  The whole point of having a Magic hero is to be able to obliterate enemies with spells.  Casting Lightning Bolt once every three turns sucks when in previous games you could cast it every turn.  The mana is mismanaged in this game too.  Your hero may have 200 mana, but each spell costs 45, 37, or some other random amount of mana?  No, take some lessons from what 3DO did correctly.  Unleash the spellcasters again!9.  Though I like having the skills and abilities options Heroes VI provides, the levels are few and far between, so it's hard to take the path you want to take when you level up.  That's just a minor issue with me though.10.  I hate how the Boss fights give you a pre-set number of troops.  What is the point of building an army for the whole map if you can't use all of your troops in the final Boss fight?!  I understand the need for a challenge, but there is something so satisfying in having an overwhelming army that you just spent 3 hours running around assembling.  I like the introduction of Boss fights into this game, but please let us bring in our full army and wreak havoc!11.  Maybe it's just me, but the AI is super hard on the Scenarios.  I can barely beat a single AI on Easy let alone levels with multiple enemies.  I have no idea how the enemy assembles such a huge army before I do, etc.  Maybe I just suck, I don't know (I don't think I suck that badly).  That's just another issue I have.Overall, I love this game.  It has given me hours of playability, and for that I am grateful.  It is a visually-stunning and beautiful game.  The Inferno is so hard to look at, but the beauty of the Sanctuary makes up for it.  If they make a Heroes VII I hope it is a lot like Heroes VI, but with the changes I have suggested.  Take away a cliche Demon threat and give us some other storyline.  Let the armies grow like they did with 3DO and Heroes V so the Might heroes can thrive, and take the recharges off the spells so the Magic heroes can thrive.  I recommend this game highly, but with those caveats.What is dead may never die!-- Kingsley ",1,0,0,1,0,0,4

												For the record, this could be very good game. Soundtrack is great, graphics too. Progress of story gives motivation to continue. Fights are (mostly) enjoyable. Still, there are things in this game which make me furious.I have game on Steam. When I launch it I must wait several minutes because Uplay must search for proxy, login and occasionaly update. Then finally game starts - and it logins to another network junk called Conflux. And now it becomes interesting. Because if you play with conflux there are additional items you can use in game. If you start game and loose internet connection orsomething similar, these saves you had are not available at all and you may start from beginning. Multiplayer game in HOMM 5 was possible using lan network. In this game you can forget about it, only internet based multiplayer game is possible (again using conflux). Even if you want to play with someone sitting opposite of you. It doesn't sound too bad - but all attempts to play I have tried end after few turns because conflux looses connection or something similar. Multiplayer game is essentially impossible.Singleplayer game is ok, but some maps quickly become boring. On normal difficulty setting it is common that 'level cap reached' show up while half of the map is still hidden. However important enemies are still terribly strong and armies defending gold and artifacts are usually very simple to beat (or so difficult that it doesn't make sense to fight them - all income is not enough to buy lost units back). So after promising start there is lot of sitting and waiting and buying new units each week. So far the most enjoyable game was for Haven fraction.And finally, there are still bugs. When combat should start sometimes screen remains black and there is no way out just switch to taskmanager and kill the game. There are some workarounds mentioned in forums (change in settings of nvidia driver)  but even then it is not 100% reliable. If you can make several important fights in one turn, save after every one of them!So if you don't care about multiplayer, you like HOMM series and you see this game on sale then you may give it a tryBut I am terribly dissapointed. I will try to finish the game for the story but I am putting Ubisof on my blacklist.			",16,23,0,11,1,0,14

												Ugh, sunk a lot of hours into this (60), tried really hard to like it, as I played all other Heroes games... but this game is such a complete fail at its core that its just impossible to really enjoy. When every mission is based on AI cheating through the roof to make it challenging, thats just unacceptable for a game in this day and age. I read the developers blog after they finished the game and were closed down, looks like UBI Soft really screwed them, which is a shame, and they didnt get to finish half of the game mechanics they were going to, which is also a shame. This game is a massive mess with fairly pretty graphics, but for Heroes series fans, its a tomb.			",37,8,0,11,2,0,17

												Utterly broken game. Multiplayer is a shambles, disconnecting all the time, giving black screens between fights that means you have to bomb the game out plus a multitude of other bugs. The worst crime however is the difficulty level is ridiculous! I don't mind a difficult game, if I SET it to difficult. On EASY, in the tutorial, it's almost impossible to win. Myself and a friend have tried to no avail. If you CAN win, it's not by playing the game in a fun way--- it's by ignoring all of it and steaming ahead. Bad game with dreadful developer support. Avoid.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I've decided to mini-review the M&M Heroes 6 + expansions pack, after finishing the entire campaign series.Without further ado, gameplay-wise!Gameplay Strong Points:Fairly Competent AI most of the time.Last series of fixes have reduced exploitability by a fair marginCampaign objectives make sense.Decent series of units, most complement each other.Heroes matter, a lot.Gameplay weak Points:Migh vs Magic heroes...Magic heroes often end grossly overpowered for campaign play.AI during skirmishes either wins all neutral battles flawlessly, or gets stuck without a fair army.AI coded to do the same series of attacks over and over again.Game still liable to CTD, especially with nvidia graphics cards.AI failmoves, but what game doesn't have that?Story, Graphics and Misc. Good Points.Campaigns last you quite a few hours each.Dynasty goodies, special side quests and hidden bonusses makes exploring a reward.Maps offer different approaches, lots of goodies and quite a challenge at times.Bad points.Story and dialogue wise, it's pretty generic. I personally didn't really care for the story much, deeming the theme and way the theme was handled overused.Campaign mission difficulty gaps. Some missions are insanely hard, only to be followed up with a cakewalk, or vice versa. Some missions also require replays because they punish a mistake you made early on a few steps from endgame.Tear of Asha. Cute that it's included, but ends up being overkill on half the maps it's given on.No Random Map Generator, killing the replay value of the skirmish maps very, very much.Item Placement at skirmish maps makes no sense, oftentimes giving you a completed moon disk/tear/full set/epic artifacts/et cetera ad nauseum before even getting past flagging your first mines.Overall though, it's not as bad as people yell at times and certainly worth a try if you're into the type of game, especially if it goes on sale.The full package, even when lacking a RMG for skirmish + obvious flaws during the playthroughs, still holds a bit of appeal.If I'd have to grade the game without comparing it to previous games of the series, it'd come out on a 7-(6.75 for those unfamiliar with +s and -'s).Worth a try if you like the series or the genre, do pass if it's not up your alley.

If you like the Heroes (strategy) games, then this is probably worth 10 bucks but not more. I recommend waiting for a nice sale or buying Heroes V with Hammers of Fate and Tribes of the East addon if you haven't got them.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Might & Magic Heroes VI. My first observation about this game is why did they have to change around the name? What was so wrong with Heroes of Might & Magic?Probably the most important thing you need to know about this game is that it uses Ubisoft's draconian ""always-on"" DRM meaning that if the Ubi servers or god forbid, your own connection cuts out, you can expect to lose any progress since your last save and quite often get a corrupt save as well.Heroes is a very pretty game and disregarded the weird caching issues and the slow loading times it is a visually very impressive game.The problem with this game however is that you aren't trying to win battles, you are trying to win battles without losing any units. Because the AI is 100% predictable this becomes more like a puzzle game quite quickly, trying to find the perfect tactic.Major imbalance in the RPG system doesn't help either and this just feels like a game that was released purely to cash in on the name.

												I'm not going to spend much time on this, and to be honest it's been a while since I played it, but since it annoyed me so much at the time, I might as well voice my complaints:The main issue is, for me, the fact that this has a 3rd-party DRM - the Ubisoft launcher. This is also the reason for the high number of hours in my profile. I spent them having it on in the background, waiting for Ubisoft to fix their &§$% DRM, not playing. In my opinion, having a DMR tool when a game is already on Steam is pointless, and then having it malfunction is close to unforgivable.As for the game itself: I found it rather uninspired. It's a slightly more polished version of Heroes V, with a few units switched around, the option to convert all cities to your main type and control of mines regulated by capturing forts instead of individual mines. The latter is actually a good idea, but the former makes the game more boring. Storyline and animation are also seriously sub-par for the time it came out. Finally, the difficulty of maps seemed to stem more from the incresible amount of troops the AI could field and less from using those that it had effectively. All in all: Don't buy this, save your money to get a complete edition of Heroes V (or better yet, Heroes IV).			",89,34,0,51,22,0,25

I don't usully write a comment, but i feel so angry that i do it now.The game is quite different compare to V, i will just say that it's a kind of new game, maybe easier.. You don't have so much choice to ""personalize"" your hero. Nvm this is not the bad point. The thing is, THIS GAME IS BUG!!! Black screen, uplay, some spell not available (First campaign, good luck). If you are not affraid to kick and restart the game 2-3 times in a row, buy it. If you just want discover this game, leave now!			",13,1,0,8,5,0,14

												Having been a Heroes fan since first playing #2 in the 90's I have to say there is something lacking. I can;t quite put my finger on it, but I just didn't enjoy this as much as previous games in the series. I couldn't even force myself to play through and beat all the campaigns. Maybe it's just me, but Im sadly going to have to recommend people pass on this one. Try previous games in the series, they are a blast and are very cheap now.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												When i first bought this game, i was on a high from M&M V, which was an amazing game. I was really looking forward to play a new Heroes game, which better graphics and good old school gameplay.... So what did i get? A game, which is actually worse then V in pretty much all factors. The gameplay is worse, the graphics are worse and the world itself is confusing and really not well put together. The campaign itself is also pretty bad, and while it has some great boss moments here and there, the game just dissappoint.If you have not played Heroes V, DONT BUY THIS GAME. Buy Heroes V instead and if you really like that, then you can proberly survive this game aswell and enjoy to some extent.Now to the very bad part. The game alone is proberly a 6,5-7/10, eventhough it is worse then V, but the thing, which nearly makes this game unplayable is the goddamm Uplay integration. But what is so bad abou the Uplay thing? Well, let me sum up:1:It blocks you from playing the game an account on their service, which would not be bad if the servers worked all the time, but you are gonna find yourself limited by how the servers work.2: Unless you have internet connection all the time, the game blocks features from your gameplay. Hero weapens and ingame achievments are blocked and the game is nearly unplayable without these weapens.3: You will constantly battered with announcements from Uplay while you play, which can really stop a good gaming stride.All in all, the game is alright, maybe even a bit bad, but this game really made me hate Ubisoft. They have ruined the Heroes genre and they are only making it worse with Heroes 7. So my advice? Play more of Heroes 3 and 5, they are amazing games and you are not forced to stay connected all the time to play these games. You can actually go on vacation and enjoy some strategy, without Ubisoft interfering.			",50,2,1,12,7,1,29

												First of all: I always liked the Might & Magic series. It followed me through my childhood and youth and though I could never really get good at it, I still enjoyed the mechanics, visuals and the idea itself.Now we're at Might & Magic: Heroes VI and boy what a long way lies behind us. But what kind of game do we have now?I knew that UPlay would come along with this game so I struggled a long long time before I finally bought the series in a sale. After I played approx 2 hours I totally regret this decision. Why?1. Uplay. This thing is so clunky and annoying. It gives you nothing but yet another piece of software that somehow holds your games hostage. Ubisoft is one of the big publishers but seeing and using Uplay makes you think: damn, a bunch of small budget devs could have put together something better. Even the GOG Website is done better than Uplay. It's just an insult. 2. The game keeps crashing. How is that even possible? This game is made by a damn big publisher and could have gotten several updates. But no, it keeps crashing 2 hours in the campaign. That is just not acceptable. 3. The AI is a joke. They predict your moves and know everything you know. It is just no fun to play against an AI that has basically 0 element of surprise and just plays unfair. It sure reminds me of the old Rainbow Six days when the enemy AI had instant knowledge of your moves and actions as soon as you were 100m close. That is yet another insult and infuriates me. 4. The interface is very questionable. While it looks kinda neat, it is just not useful. It is big, full of blingy graphics and other damn beautiful crap but hell it just does not appear useful in any way. Maybe we have grown to a ""everything MUST be minimalistic"" state of mind, still a strategy game does not need to be super shiny. It needs information on the spot, not after clicking and mouse overlays.I will try to get a refund as this is just not acceptable or at least playable. Yet another series ruined Ubisoft.

This happened about 3-4 times before I just uninstalled. I am reminded why I don't buy games from Ubisoft at all. I forgot this and bought Farcry 3 when it was on sale...first time I tried to play...2 different errors and a uPlay reinstall before it would let me play my own game.  Screw these guys.

												The story is amazing, but that's about it.All computer controlled units (including neutrals) scale so fast such that it becomes impossible to engage in any combat unless you have all your units/resouces pooled onto your main hero, meaning that any secondary hero you happen to get is nothing more than a glorified unit courier; a feature that was absent in all other games of this series. Consequently, losing a single unit on a single stack is enough to warrent a reload. The game has been out a long time and still the final 'dynasty perk' slot hasn't been unlocked for use; even at max level and with all DLC. Finally, the game has a random crashing issue that has yet to be resolved; the crash may occur within five minutes of starting or after six hours of play.Despite all this though, the game is surprisingly balanced (again, assuming all your recources are pooled to your main hero) and the units are refreshingly diverse across all races.TL;DR If you're a fan of the series and have played one of the predecesors this game is a big disappointment. If you're new to the series or the genre in general: wait for it to go on sale.			",12,4,0,9,5,0,5

												BEWARE: The game tend to freeze on certain Nvidia graphics cards, with no fix to my knowledge. I have Geforce 640M and the game freezes about every hour. That is the reason for my short game time. I'm still waiting for a fix.However it's a good game which brings back some of the features people loved in Heroes of Might and Magic 3 - like isometric view far superior to the 3D view from HoMM V. The skill system, however, is restructured to a static tech tree stripped from random elements from the Mage Guilds, which is removed. I don't particulary like it.			",133,30,1,20,22,0,40

												I loved the might and magic series and even liked this game while it worked, after a patch, about a year ago, the game remained unplayable, I searched for solutions, and even tried it on two of my systems and the game would crash upon load.  I have uninstalled and reinstalled to attempt to load the game on each new video card, and mb/cpu combo, even 3 video cards later, have just tried again to load this with the same issue.  This is not the only game I have had dificulty with Ubisoft, I will refrain from buying any UBISOFT games that requires Ubisoft's front end to play.  Goodby Ubisoft... companies like this hurt PC gaming leaving PC'ers in frustration and moving to other systems.  Suggest you pass on this game untill its rock bottom priced!..and then hope for the best.			",339,85,9,75,34,4,79

												I would honestly love to give this game what its ancestors deserved. But it just doesn't cut it. It is not what i learned to love in Heroes of Might and Magic III and it doesn't fill the void that Heroes of Might and Magic IV created.The campaign seems to be loosely sewed together, it is not the tragic destinies that made me want to go on. At all.The menus are damn confusing because things like an ""ingame currency"" has been introduced with which one can buy more heroes etc. Hell, i already bought the game. If i go for a ""Free-for-All"" game, i want to be able to pick everything available. I want to get to KNOW the race i'm playing with.Apart from that, Uplay sucks. Hard. It is honestly one of the biggest reasons i never touched this game again. Simply because i don't wanna go through the struggle to start this Hump-in-the-Face of Software. It is annoying to have a second DRM behind Steam just because the publisher forces it upon their customers.TL;DR: Graphics and Level of Detail nice, Campaign and Long-time motivation sucks, so does Uplay.

												I strongly recommend you play this game if you love turn based strategy games, RPG games, or are a sucker for a good story. Easily one of the best strategy games I have ever played (and I have played a hell of a lot!) - don't be scared of UPlay and Conflux (more on this later).The game is at its core a Turn Based Strategy game, but also has strong RPG elements - levelling up, skill points, hero inventory, reputation points, faction variations etc. I would strongly suggest watching some YouTube videos to see how the game plays out.Briefly speaking you have a game map where you move your heroes around, collect various items/dynasty weapons for your hero's inventory as well as wood, ore, crystal, gold and fight neutrals. There are also various structures you can interact with which confer various bonuses, or grant units for your army etc.On this map there are various towns and forts which you fight to capture, and once captured you build up to allow you to recruit more units, higher level units or get bonuses for your battles.Battles involve moving stacks of units around on a grid, destroying enemy stacks in a variety of ways. There are a large variety of units in the game, roughly 7 types per faction - each with an upgraded version so really 14 per faction. Units often have special abilities, like being able to puppet enemy units to do your bidding, or charge through stacks slaughtering ally and enemy alike. All the factions have very different units so it never gets boring.In addition to units being moved around, your heroes can also use various abilities each turn, you can unlock more by spending skill points as you level up. There are loads of hero skills split in to Might types or Magic types, and these are futher classified into many sub-groups, too many to list here, but for instance for the Magic branch you have separate skill trees for Fire, Water, Light, Dark, Earth, Air, Prime (not all are accessible for each faction)Hero Dynasty weapons can also grant more abilities, as can items - many items come in sets (Diablo style) and wearing the full set can give you some very nice bonuses.There are Five factions in the main game (Haven, Inferno, Sanctuary, Stronghold, Necropolis), and a Sixth faction (Dungeon) in the expansion Shades of Darkness - which I also strongly recommend you get! Each faction has completely different units, different available skill trees, faction specific abilities, reputation abilities, different game play and look very different too.Sound and music in the game is awesome, the battle sound track is stuck in my head.Graphics are amazing too; the detail on the maps, on the units, structures, flora is great. Even the main menu has switchable themes - all of which are great (personal favourite is the dungeon one).The loading screens have some really nice drawings too, I had the Haven one as a wallpaper for some time.Units have really nice animations, and even have idle animations - Dungeon's Assassin starts spinning his daggers above his head like helicopter rotor blades and gets lifted off his feet and then drops down headfirst (all an animation - has no effect on gameplay..!), Vampires start playing rock music and using their swords as an electric guitar - really shocked me the first time it happened -""where is that rock music coming from..?""The storyline is amazing - I was eager to learn more just after the intro video!The game is split into many different campaigns - each campaign has up to 4 missions. The core game has one tutorial campaign, and then one campaign for each of the five core factions. The expansions add four more campaigns.The story is great but as the core campaigns all run simultaneously in the story chronology, it is possible to play one mission in one campaign and then ruin the story for yourself as you now know the outcome of another mission for another faction that you haven't played yet.I would recommend you play the Custom games and Campaign missions in the following order:Heart of Nightmares (Custom game accessed via the Custom game option in the main menu!), Prologue 1, Prologue 2, Stronghold 1, Sanctuary 1, Haven 1, Inferno 1, Necropolis 1, Stronghold 2, Sanctuary 2, Haven 2, Necropolis 2, Sanctuary 3, Stronghold 3, Inferno 2, Necropolis 3, Inferno 3, Sanctuary 4, Stronghold 4, Haven 3, Necropolis 4, Haven 4, Inferno 4, Epilogues, Pirates of the Savage Sea Campaign, Danse Macabre Campaign, Dungeon Campaign,  Necropolis Campaign 2.Maybe copy-paste that list into a text file somewhere and delete missions as you complete them!The only issue some people have, is with UPlay. Upon installing the game via Steam, you may have issues launching the game. Just install the latest Uplay off the Ubisoft site, see this link: http://steamcommunity.com/app/48220/discussions/0/45350245398257355/Another issue is that fighting neutrals can get repetitive as they are often so weak. Turn on Quick Battle in the options menu, and if you have a decent army, the battle will be resolved for you automatically.Gameplay tips - The Reinforcements skill is the key to victory in most scenarios early on- use it on stacks that are going to attack / get attacked and you will never have any losses from your main army.If you have other issues, just ask in the Steam Forum for the game, there are plenty of people that can help there!I'll say it again, I strongly recommend you play this game! Or you can just wait for Heroes of Might and Magic VII which is currently in development - can vote on factions to appear in the game etc on the developer's website!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Reviews clearly don't mean anything to the Steam community because somehow this abomination keeps doing well in sales.If you're a fan of the Heroes of Might & Magic series, avoid this defecation of a 'game' at all costs, because it removes just about everything interesting and fun about the previous games and replaces it with a generic cut and dry style of play that robs the factions of their uniqueness and dumbs the game down into an extremely predictable, formulaic experience.If you're not a fan of the HoMM series, please, go and buy ANY OTHER Heroes game. If this is the first game in the series you play you'll probably wonder why they made 6 of them considering what an absolute piece of unfun trash this one is. I would recommend this to new players even less than I would to fans because at least fans might appreciate some small scrap buried deep down in the remains of what is now barely recognizable as HoMM.Oh, it's also horrendously buggy two years after release. It got I think 3 patches released before Ubisoft stopped supporting it and just started releasing DLC. This is nothing but a shameless cash grab, milking dry a classic franchise that could've had so much left to give if Ubisoft wasn't such a terrible company. They drove the original developers to bankruptcy and brought in a team of unknowns for a very short time after release to salvage the mess as much as they could - there were constant crashes and glitches that would totally halt your progress through a campaign mission and force a restart, and some of these persist to this day.And then there's the highly intrusive uPlay integration for those of you who dislike aggressive 3rd party DRM on your Steam games.Overall there is no reason for anyone to buy this game. If just one person sees this review and chooses not to give Ubisoft their money because of it, it was worth typing out.			",119,13,2,15,8,1,28

												Gets an unnecessarily bad rap for Uplay.Doesn't try to do anything too different, but Sanctuary is a great addition and the patches/expansions have done the same thing to 6 what they did to 5.  Some boss encounters are ridiculous in set-army levels and will cause you to tear your hair out at higher difficulties.Dynasty weapons are entirely too grindy but a cool idea.Still leaps and bounds better than VII.

Try a DLC code, nothing, Retype DLC code  ****YOU HAVE BEEN BANNED FOR 24 HOURS*****  The reason being, I attempted to validate a game code too many times. Are you freakin serious Ubisoft? How about giving me a game code that works?!?!?! $5 or not, if you can't give me what I paid for, I expect a refund. Once my ban is lifted, I will attempt to validate the codes again and if they are not valid, I will be contacting my credit card company and denying the charge.

												It could be the best Heroes of Might & Magic game until now. (Well, it's not)First of all, if you angry with this game, you shouldn't be. You should angry with Ubisoft and their game policies.When the game came for the first time, it was awful. But with time and updates it's quite better now. (Also, I'm still play HoMM 3 which is the best Heroes game.)Here are the pros and cons basicly (according to complete edition)Pros:- Might & Magic universe- Heroes III like town screens- Nice storyline- Gigantic maps and very long playtimes for hotseatCons:- UPlay- Conflux- Less ores and minerals, so it makes the game easier.Last word: They must remake HoMM III with this game engine. (Edit: They'll release HoMM III HD Edition, at least it's something.)			",449,108,16,50,45,4,73

I just played a normal Match to have some fun but I didn't have much fun.Why didn't I have much fun with this game?Because the KI sucks as hell. I was on an isle and had 3 castles there. Whenever I wanted to explore the map and go somewhere else an enemy came up to my isle with the aim to get my castles. So I teleported down to my castle and he ran away.So much so annoying. But I couldn't do anything from now on. Whenever I left the island to explore the map this mf came back to attack my castles and whenever I teleported back to the castle to get him he ran away.It was like a loop and so annoying that I haven't played this game since.

												For people that is looking to buy the game on today sale (75% discount, 7.49 EUR)As you can see from my play time, I did play this game (including all DLC).I played all games in the series since Heroes II and Heroes VI is far from being the best in the series (most players will agree that it was actually the worst so far). However I still did enjoy the game, and I do recommend the game, but only to people that are into this genre.Pros:- The HOMM feal is there.- The graphics are great.- The creatures and their abilities are highly enjoyable.- The game is now bug-free (this was not the case on release and for at least one year afterwards).- The Dinasty mechanics and related Hero weapons are a great addition.- You can easily see that the Hungarian developers put a lot of dedication and love into this project.Cons:- Ubisoft/Uplay integration. (Yes, it is true that their uptime is not the best and sometimes your ability to play will be limited).- Worst AI ever.- Too easy.- Too much grinding.- Unlike other Heroes games where you could actually lose, here you will never lose.To summarize. This game is not for everybody but if you have played HOMM games before and you enjoyed them, then you are probably going to enjoy also this one, despite its shortcomings.			",344,104,17,82,84,1,95

												I like the game story, and all that. The computer cheats like always, but who's surprised any more?Uplay made this all but unplayable for me, though. I could only get to play 1 out of 6 times i launched, otherwise it wouldn't even get to the Conflux login, and that only worked half the time. So the game is only playable about 1 out of 12 times i launch. Bought this game because i'm a fan of the series, probably one of the most stupid decisions i have ever made. Do not buy unless you really like restarting the game a *lot* and hoping it works.			",83,12,1,14,8,0,13

												I've seen plenty of ppl raging about not being able to play.READ THIS IF YOU CAN'T GET IT TO WORK:1 launch Uplay as admin(that way it wont crash)2 click the Play button for heroesVI on STEAM(not in the uplay launcher)3 turn ON your firewall. yes ON. (that way the game will be able to connect to the CONFLUX)My real review here:I love this game. I love it I love it I love it. It's awesome. I didn't run into any bugs so far. I guess they already fixed a lot. I really really enjoy playing this game and will continue to do so. I just wish stupid ppl would stop complaining and put a tiny bit more effort into stuff so they could also get the game to run. Yeah, it's a bit stupid that uplay and the conflux and what not doesn't work properly from the start, but hey, WACHA GONNA DO 'BOUT IT! :) Just a little bit more effort to gain so manny hours of entertainment is a lot more fun than being an asshat and sitting on yo dumb bum complaining about a situation you could easily change if you tried :P helloooooooooooktnxbye			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is a great game. There are many people who have written about why it is good - and they are all true.The issue with this game is the constraints added by the third party DRM:1. Additional account required2. Additional software required3. Additional login required every time you play4. Syncing online and local games does not happen5. Online servers not availableThis ruins a great game.Do not buy till they remove the DRM.Edit: 20th Aug 2016:I reformatted my PC due to some issues, and as usual, went about re-installing my favorite games.SUPRISE - This game (the only one out of around 15 I re-installed) will not validate. It says ""key has already been activated"".I have contacted Ubisoft support. Took a week for them to get back, close the ticket, and say I need to provide proof of purchase (also lots of other details).TL;DRUbisoft support sucks			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I've read reviews where the game is buggy, where the design is a little janky, where the balance is a little off. I'm not entirely sure about that, because the game requires an Always On connection to some manner of server called Conflux. And even though my connection with the internet remains stable (as far as I can tell--everything else works), I repeatedly lose connection with Conflux. I just wanna play the ♥♥♥♥in' game. Which, from what little I played, is a step in the wrong direction from its predecesors.			",111,40,0,33,22,0,27

												It's too dilluted.It lost the magic of the first games in the series.This instalment is similar to other recent ones : It's no longer a game about exploration, discovery, building, being heroic and enjoying a fantasy game. Now it feels like PACMAN, you start a map, and start COLLECTING ressources and things all over the place. I don't feel the strategy, or the tactics, or anything interesting or really fun. I suspect the only people who enjoy this game are the OCD ""gotta build everything and pick up everything"" types.You will spend hundreds of hours on this, then look back and can't recall a single memorable moment. Again, this is just a ""collect them all"" gathering game. It says turn based strategy game on the box, but there is no strategy. Also, it needs Uplay (ugh) and a constant internet connexion to use the so called ""Dynasty"" system. As always connexion is shaky and you lose progress because it can't always keep connexion to Dynasty.Not recommended.			",360,75,5,72,42,2,66

												I really wanted to like this game. I've played every single HoMM, and this one is the worst of the series in my opinion.First thing, Uplay... So many things wrong with this.. The fact that you're basically forced to be online, or miss part of  the game... Online saves can't be saved on your machine and so CANNOT be continued offline... Who's the incompetent fool who thought it was a good idea????Second, the AI... GOD THIS AI IS SO DUMB... I cast an ice storm on his ranged units, so for 3/4 turns, they will take dmg because the ai IS TOO DUMB TO MOVE OUT OF THE WAY. Same with every kinda traps you can think of. AI have a very simple pattern in how they attack and move their troops, and the precense of traps or ice storms in my case doesn't change their strategy. A simple example. With haven, I left my sisters right behind 2 stacks of praetorians, but within range of the ai. Unapgraded sisters are useless yet the ai desperately tries to kill them. So he goes after the sisters, triggerring counterattacks from both praetorian stacks... resulting in a stupidily easy victory despite him outnumbering me 3 to 1...That brings me to the second issue, AI's only way to pose a challenge is he WILL outgrow you no matter what you do. Even with 5 bases to 1 he will get more units than you, because developpers somehow couldn't design a smart AI so they just went and made him grow large armies to simulate difficulty.Leading again to another problem. As a result, you cannot take your time to explore a map because you have to rush to defeat the ai before he does grow to large to have any hope of defeating... or in some maps you cannot afford to lose units in any battle cough *undead campaign* cough...My next  issue is more personnal, but I hate the new way you level your heroes and manage their spells and abilities. Really makes me feel like I have to grind my hero to get him the necessary abilities.The current factions feel also less unique. I guess they attempted to balance them out (with more or less success) but now they feel more or less the same.On the plus side, the story is rather interesting to follow, the graphics are good, and you can customize teams in multiplayer battles (and yes I hated that I couldn't make the teams in HoMM 5)My advice is, take your favourite previous version or HoMM and stick to playing that one. Bought this on a sale and now I'm regretting it.			",51,2,2,13,4,0,29

												If you're new to the series and want to know why it has so many fans, go play HOMM5. It's a much better game. Or maybe try some of the older ones, they're pretty good and absolutely hold up in this day and age (the third one's even better than the fifth, if you ask some people).HOMM6 requires you to use Uplay in addition to Steam. This leads to a whole bunch of issues (Steam not tracking your playtime, game refusing to launch for this or that reason, you get the idea). It also introduces a weird element of meta-progression (called ""the Dynasty"", essentially a way to get incremental advantages by playing a lot of games. It offers some things like additional equipment and passive abilities for your heroes. Luckily, all this can be turned off in the skirmish mode). IMO, the meta-progression is an absolutely pointless and token addition to the game, as it adds no real depth. Pointless unlocks didn't make HOMM the venerable franchise that it is right now, it was the profoundness and quality of its gameplay that laid the foundation of its popularity.To add insult to injury, this one's essentially abandonware. The people behind the vanilla HOMM6 went bankrupt after the game's release, and Ubisoft passed development rights from one team to another before finally dropping all support for the game completely. As a result, HOMM6 is still kinda raw and incredibly buggy. Check the forums, there's a sticky thread with a list of major game-breaking bugs that you'll have to try and play around if you dare purchase this one. Personally, I haven't encountered any of those, but that may be just because I wasn't able to play the game for long. It simply stopped launching for me at one point, after hanging up on me for like three times in a row whenever I tried to save. Also, after uninstalling the game, I found a bunch of 1,5- to 3,5-gig files in my savegame folder. Yeah, the game basically crapped into my C drive as a final ""screw you"". The sad thing is that the game itself isn't terrible, really. Still, probably not worth your money. As I said earlier, go buy HOMM5 instead.			",90,25,0,13,9,0,19

												It is not that much about Uplay's accessibility that I do not recommend the game. Actually, I played more of this game offline than online (mainly because for a long period of time after buying it, I had no regular access to internet from home), although Ubisoft implemented a punishment for doing so by not alowing you to collect rewards after finishing scenarios of the campaign. So yeah, always online is kind of mandatory and I think that is pretty lame.But I also have concerns about the game. Now Ok it is pretty and all there is no denying that, but there are some really bad design decisions in my opinion. For example, when you want to attack a enemy unit, you have to do it in one step, meaning that if for any reason you misclick and end up right in the square where you wanted to be but failed to issue the attack order, you cannot do it anymore. Another example is your hero who can cast spells and also attack, actions you have to take as long as one of your units still have the possibility to act; move all your units and that's it, your hero action is lost. I recently obtained a more stable internet connection and decided to get over with Uplay/always effing online but those ""features"" quickly annoyed/bored me.Otherwise, again, the game is good looking for sure, but it is also really different from the cult HOMM3 or the more than respectable HOMM5. Some would say ""overly simplified"" (aiming at a casual audience?) as the several resources of its elders are gone (now its just gold, wood, ore and a unique ""special"" one). The hero progression is also completely rehauled and despite not going into it too deeply (played like 20 hours offline and 2 hours online) it did not appeal to me so much I shall say, as again it seems to lack the diversity and options found in previous installement of the series.It is not a bad game (and I am happy I only wasted 75% of its price considering how little this episode of the franchise appeals to me - luckily I tried the demo and it only convinced me half-way so I waited for a sale) but it is far from having excellent game mechanics and in any way a good and contemporary implementation of the latter. I wished focus had been put more on making the game fun than on making it pretty to look at. Ultimately I wished Ubi's vision had been slightly less autoritarian, paranoid and business focused and a bit more into catering respectfully the heart of the gamers who contributed to make HOMM a great franchise by supporting it over more than 20 years.Most likely if you never played any previous iterations, this may still be a ""shiny"" introduction to the franchise as it certainly has the best graphics and accessibility. Veterans of the franchise though may be wary/reluctant to buy this one (although for most it is too late I guess) and maybe the next iteration ""VII"".			",120,19,0,45,28,1,83

												Heroes VI has its problems: required internet connection to play, shoddy save syncing, and a long string of support patches that fix certain bugs while causing others.However, one thing alone will make Heroes VI a worthwhile purchase for many: Heroes VI is a love letter written by the develoeprs to the fans of the golden days of the Heroes franchise (1, 2, and 3). A plethora of small details in this game recall the older titles that Heroes fans fell in love with. Just to list a few: they've brought back some of the best of the old musical scores, done away with the worst (although sadly not all) of the shoddy gameplay elements of 4 and 5, and they've even included a Heroes 6 version of one of the most iconic Heroes maps ever created: Broken Alliance.Long story short, if you've never played a Heroes of Might and Magic game in your life, then the flaws with this game may make it more frustrating to you than it's worth. But if you're a die hard Heroes fan yearning for the glory days, and you're willing to put up with a few bugs, this game is a real gem.			",148,50,0,39,6,1,14

												I have played this game for a long time in the campaigns and they are hard as all hell. Seems like the devs have copied most of the pages of the Bad Gameplay Manual. Forget making your own unique hero in the campaigns, unless you spec them very specifically and very carefully then it's close to impossible to beat the missions.As side for the super cheating AI with it's heros respawning with full armies, the game is rather good. Has some good features and nice visuals. It also feels less cluttered unlike its older cousins in the HoMM series. I think they recycled the music from HoMM V though as I feel as if I have heard every track before.But my issue is and remain the super cheater AI and the lack of creative freedom in the campaigns and possibly custom games thus why I will not be recommending this game to anyone. Want a great HoMM experience then get HoMM 3. It is easily the best one in the series.			",137,20,1,42,33,0,55

												I tried really hard to like this game, but in the end there is just no way I can.  For me, Heroes 5 was the pinnacle of the series and every step 6 takes is a step backwards in my opinion.  Here are the 5 biggest problems I have:1. The AI programming completely ruins the game.  In the single player campaign, the AI does not play with the same rules or even close to the same rules as the player.  Every creep monster it encounters runs from it, which allows it to pillage everything on the map as quickly as it can walk to it.  It also doesn't actually build its cities up.  It starts with a predefined city build and just gets flooded with many times more troops per week than the player gets.  Additionally, defeated AI heroes respawn with very large armies.  This forces you to rush through every map as quickly as possible because the longer you give the AI, the exponentially more numerous his army becomes.  Its rate of growth is far beyond what you can keep up with.2. The skill system is awful.  Every hero has some base stats and beyond that, they are all otherwise exactly the same since every hero can be trained in any skill you want.  Have a warrior?  Spend your skill points and turn him into a spell caster.  Have a wizard?  Spend some skill points and make him the strongest warrior on the map.  It's silly.3.  You can convert towns to different factions.  Some people surprisingly like this, but its actually just a bandaid to help compete with the terribly unbalanced/poorly scripted AI.  Yes, with just a few ore, wood and gold, you can convert any town of any faction to your faction.  Just like magic, instantly.  Again, it's just stupid.4.  The campaigns aren't really campaigns.  You can bounce around between campaigns mission by mission and ironically have to in order to actually follow the story chronologically.  It basically kills any attempt to keep a coherent story line going.5.  It has 2 additional layers of DRM.  Uplay is bad enough, but the Heroes 6 ""Conflux"" always on internet connection requirement is just too painful to bear since half the time it doesn't even connect.  There are plenty of times where you can't play the game because the conflux servers are down.All in all, the game is a nice looking, shallow disaster.  Avoid this like syphillis.			",49,4,0,16,5,0,7

												So, I finally got around to giving this game another go seeing how reviews for HOMM7 were tanking, and the reviews for this game had actually improved over time. HOMM games in general are, after all, great, and I was pleasantly surprised to see that UPlay finally allowed me to start an Ubisoft game. Its taken many years - when was this game released? - since I have had a trouble free start to an Ubisoft game - for these same reasons, I rarely buy from this developer. Anyhow, it was a fun few hours, but I saved up and went to bed. Tonight; no saves. Hard to say why. I've tried creating new games, make saves, quit, reload - all gone. I believe the fix to this is changing UPlay so that it is in offline mode, however, if I right click UPlay in the system tray and go to settings, it tells me ""UPlay has detected an unrecoverable error and must shut down!"". Every.single.time. Seriously? We can finally play our games after.... 5 years?! It only took you 5 years to make your DRM launcher work and now it eats all of your save progress instead? FFS Ubisoft, get your affairs in order!Also, the Conflux - an in game message board where people can write things on various posts at different locations on maps, is up there with worst ideas in the history of gaming. I don't understand if Ubi intended for it to be used for people to post how to 'beat' maps, or just to swear at each other or about the dev - if so, mission accomplished - but it adds nothing useful to the game other than forcing an otherwise unnecessary always online function, which is really the core problem with the whole game - unless you are playing multiplayer, there is no reason to necessitate going through all of the rubbish with the UPlay DRM which breaks even the single player experience - I can't imagine it would actually be successful in connecting a multiplayer match for the duration of a game.

												The game itself is relatively fine however it suffers from very serious issues with forcing a single style of play for each campaign. Also like many other reviewers have mentioned you have to install Uplay to play this, which is not mentioned or advertised anywhere on the store page. This didn't just take over an hour to patch and install but also installs a tool bar in your web browser without concent.Honestly the earlier HOM&M games are far more enjoyable and do not come with invasive bug ridden DRM.

												Bought the game on sale, being a fan of HOMM 3 and 5. Even after all the negative reviews I still bought it thinking it cannot be so bad. Man I was wrong. The AI is stupid and cheats, gameplay is very dumbed down from previous iteration it is getting very boring. You can transform the town to any faction you want therefore cut down the strategy and prioritizing and developing some town types meaningless. No random maps generator and therefore poor replay value. Game is also quite buggy. The only redeaming value is the nice art style. overall an very mediocre attempt to revive a great serie. 4/10.

												Do you love Uplay, bugs and random crashes that ruin the game? This is the game for you!For real though, this game stays more or less true to what we know in the Heroes franchise. The story is kind of cool and what not. But the endless amount of crashes made it impossible to enjoy. 2/10 - Play Heroes III, you'll be better off in any aspect... With that said don't buy the Steam HD version, ubisoft are simply trying to bamboozle your money... again.			",225,62,4,25,22,0,32

												Been playing the HoMM franchise since Heroes II was incluced in PC Gamer's monthly Coconut Monkey demo disc samples. Minutes turned into hours. Hours to days. Got Price of Loyalty and did the same. Was enthralled by the masterpiece known as Heroes III and all of its expansions. Figured out the puzzle that was Heroes IV, New World Computing's last contribution to the franchise. Suffered through Nival's inability to create copetent map AI in Heroes V. And now this game, which I cannot truly comment on, because the ""double layer"" of DRM through Steam and Ubisoft renders this game unplayable. Really, it's Ubisoft's fault because U(don't)play always crashes regardless if I install from steam or fresh form the website or wherever. I can't even log on without the interface crashing. So really, this is a review on how bad Uplay is. It breaks everything. Thank goodness it's a digital download instead of back in the day, when garbage DRM would forever ruin your disk drives. Some of you may be old enough to remember those days.			",261,52,3,17,9,0,17

												Have you played Heroes 2-5?  Remember how the game would give AI enemies massive armies they could not have possibly have recruited in the same way you built your armies?  Remember how aggrivating it was?  Well, guess what, Not a damn thing has changed.  If anything it's gotten worse.  I played a couple games in a row where I was riding high on an army of literally every unit I could possibly build and the game decided to drop an AI hero with at least 3 times the units.  This last time, I was playing inferno and I had just managed to build 5 Pit Lords, the Champion for that team.  The AI guy had 53 of his Champion characters.  10 Times what I had been able to build.  Unless he had 10 cities I couldn't see, that's impossible.  So annoyed I uninstalled, and I have to advise people not to pick it up if they want to have any fun with single player.  Multi Player may be fine, but I'm too annoyed to find out.			",180,45,3,46,23,3,36

												The best thing about this beautiful game is replayability. And it is not just that you can replay it whenever you want, this is much better! Thanks to the Conflux and its random disconnections, the game will FORCE you to replay some 2 out of 3 battles... even if you save the game at every opportunity.So, again... the most replayable game EVER (crying)(and yes, I tried every single fix I could find on the forums and on Ubisoft site. To no avail.)So beware... this game might just be unplayable for you... think before buying..			",62,28,0,12,6,0,15

												Might & Magic: Heroes VI is a turn-based strategy game from Ubisoft Entertainment. It is another installment in Might & Magic franchise.Might & Magic: Heroes VI has kinda unique gameplay, you start with one castle, develop it, build a barracks, train troops in a turn-based gameplay, but to move your troops around you will need a hero. When you move your hero and the troops he command around, you can engage random enemy, found resources or found something that may upgrade your heroes, increase experience or even someone to join your troops. When engaged in battle, you will enter the battlefield view where you will play the battle in a chess like gameplay. It's kinda fun. But in terms of hardcore strategy play, well, this game is not that hard. In fact even though you can create many heroes, using only one hero is enough to win the game.Might & Magic: Heroes VI graphics are good, not great but good. The detail and the model and texture are beautiful enough. The performance of the game are also good, and the game runs smooth and stable without any issues.Might & Magic: Heroes VI is a good game that if you like turn-based strategy game, Might & Magic: Heroes VI can occupy you for many hours. I recommend this.Rating 7/10			",1158,351,58,143,167,12,228

												Requiring an always online DRM, still unfinished after years of development, MMH6 is a prime example how NOT to develop  & manage games within a renown franchise. It was given to a cheap developer with zero experience only to be given to someone else because of all the f**k-ups including bugs causing disappearing online rewards, swapping of all achievements with your opponent and the like.This game is the single reason why I will never again buy an Ubisoft game on release (and even at a 75% discount, I still hesitate). It left a sour taste in my mouth back when it was released, ruining one my favourite franchises of all time.  ",284,105,4,38,37,3,73

Posted: April 24, 2015
												After over 100 hours of playing this game, but yet to be done, I think it's time to write about this game.First of all. I have been playing heroes of might and magic since Heroes 2, and I think that they are one of the best games I've been following through my life. Good memories and good stories!Well first I wanna talk about how you are gonna start playing this game, as it's not just simply to click the game and start it. First of all you gotta make an account for uplay, which gives you a few ""presents"" if you play the game enough. It is also saving your save into a cloud using this program. After saving ""save password and log in automaticly"" you won't see much more of this problem, as the game will enter as you click the Heroes 6 icon.Now at the menu screen you see a whole lot of buttons! Confusing? Ye, a bit maybe. Some of it are related to social stuff, like skype, while there is also a store you can buy different titles, icons and heroes + some abillities for your hero. The important reason for Uplay here is that you can go to a page: http://heroes-6-conflux.us.ubi.com/soulforge to upgrade weapons, and litterary do the same thing as ingame, except the weapons part.So so far you have: Made uplay account, seen the store, seen the page where you can upgrade weapons.Phew! Now that that is written, lets take a look at the game.The first I realised is how much time it takes for each level to load. It is pretty slow, but I'll guess you gotta live with it. The levels are also quite big, but I'll take that after I've talked about a very known problem. As I played the first level and got into a fight, everything went black...and this problem occured to me over and over and over and over again, until I made it a common thing to quicksave after every single battle. Luckily I found a solution online for my nvidia graphic card that recommended you to go into the controll panel (for nvidia graphic card), 3D setup and pick the game. Then put the option so you only pick the Nvidia graphic card. I have a laptop, so it shows two graphic cards. Click the named graphic card, and not the integrated one.As we have now solved everything we can finally play! The game got huge magnificant levels, with lots of nice music, sounds and hours on hours to play the game. In the previous games of heroes 6 there might have been alot more levels per campain, which for me made it easier to play. These campain levels are huge, and even the tutorial level will require a few hours to get through.Heroes are also built point by point, through a skill tree. Kinda good idea, but really different from the earlier games. I am not sure if I liked it that much in the start, but it got better as you learnt it. Towns are almost the same as before, and the gameplay is pretty much the same. As I now have played through 4 campains I can say that the story and campains are really good. You follow the story about Duke Slavas ""children"", and all of them got an affliction with one of the different playable teams that heroes 6 offers. I think that's kinda cool, because every team is different and every hero got their own story. As the teams are different you will allways have to play a different way with them. You can also pick might or magic afflication, which means you will excell in one of them (Might = can use armor, Magic = more items for a mage).I said earlier that the gameplay was mostly the same, but there is a huge difference. The way of telling the story this time is chatboxes, with dialogue. This works really nice, and makes you able to follow the history when you finish of tasks/quests/missions to do, and move on. I feel the AI, even on normal can be a bit dumb, and can sometimes feel like it's pretty easy to win. There was one level I remember that I spent a few days on to complete, but it was the layout of it, that made it hard, and the fact that the enemy had so much more than me.The last thing I am gonna talk about is dynasty weapons. You find them in different campain levels and you can upgrade em from level 1-5 either using your hero (getting experience for the weapon), and level it like that, or use the link I put in the start of this. If you use the page it takes 10 minutes (level 2), 1 hour (level 3), 24 hours (level 4) and 2 weeks to complete level 5. I would recommend levelling a weapon if you plan to use it on a character. It goes faster, than the two weeks.ANYWAY! The game has been great, all though it takes up alot of time to complete. Some things are new and you just got to get used to it. Eventually you will, after spending so much time on it. Would recommend playing on normal, which should be suitable for most people. Enjoy the game, and please like this recommandation if you feel it's good.P.S. Still got 3 campains for the main game, 2 DLCs and the expansion pack left, so I am far from done, but what is written here is what thoughts I've had so far.			",150,43,1,13,5,0,6

												I've played every entry of the Heroes of Might and Magic series (except VII, but I'll explain that momentarily), and I wanted so badly to like this one. Since people seem to respond well to the pros/cons list, I'll use that format.Pros:-The single player campaign is reasonably fun. It has some frustrating moments, but overall the missions are at least enjoyable, if not particularly original. The cut scenes are best skipped though.- In all the previous games, there was an element of chance to skill gain, while in this game you can customize your heroes' skills freely. This does tend to reduce the variety of skills used, but it takes out some of the irritation of not getting a skill that you consider vital to your hero.- Combat is similar to all the previous games, but with significantly expanded creature abilities, which I like. Rather than just attack-attack-attack, there are options for using most creatures in a secondary role. I'm not a huge fan of the square combat grid (as opposed to hexes), but it's not terrible, just not ideal.- Graphics and animations are quite a bit better than previous games. Not that graphics are a vital feature in a turn-based strategy game, but it's nice little side feature.Cons:- Multiplayer does not work. I know people will say ""oh, have you tried ____?"" Yes. I have tried whatever you were going to suggest. It does. Not. Work. I even opened a ticket with Ubisoft support, and after several weeks of trying everything they suggested, I never succesfully joined or hosted a multiplayer game. It doesn't matter how fun the single player is, Heroes is a game to be played with other people.- Ubisoft went ahead and released Heroes VII before fixing this game, and (surprise surprise) it had the exact same connection issues as this game, plus some all new game breaking bugs. As I said, I didn't actually play VII, but you can go read the reviews for it and they will almost all cite some comparison to the broken status of VI. As of the end of 2016, VII has also been abandoned and will never be patched.I realize that it looks like the pros outweigh the cons in my list, since the pros are all in-game features, and the cons are out-of-game problems with Ubisoft. Regardless, my recommendation is to avoid this game, and all future releases from Ubisoft. One thing is for sure, I will absolutely not be purchasing another game from them until they stop releasing broken, buggy games that never get fixed. Ubisoft does not deserve my money, or yours, or anyone else's for that matter.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The game does not work as is. Once you download the full version, you still have a large patch to download! Once that is complete, it started another patch! It then made me sign up for multiple sites to be able to use the software. It then forces you to connect to the ""Conflux"" to be able to play a single player game yet the servers are never up.

												While not as good as its predecesor, this is still a really fun game. The graphics are unparalleled by most of today's strategy games, and the pacing is very good. There are plenty of missions, as well as DLC to keep you occupied. Thing is, there's not enough in this game to dignify playing this over some other games. If you have some time on your hands, this game could really be fun.Oh, and the online multiplayer sucks.Like, really bad.Waiting for people to finish their turns, without the screen really doing anything, is just one of the most boring experiences I have ever endured in a video game.

												The Good:- Interesting unit abilities.- Good art styles for each faction.- Plays like every other HoMM game.- AI is pretty good.The Bad:- Requires UPlay to run. So you'll need to create a UPlay account and be dependant upon the UPlay service being active and operational.- Each faction's campaign is not ""in story order"", so you'll need to jump between different faction missons. These aren't clearly laid out, so you'll need to search online for the ""correct order"". This really frustrated me as the campaigns have their own story line but cross over at points and there's no indication on which campaign/mission to play next to continue to story line.- I experienced some bugs, but nothing game breaking.Summary:If you're a hardcore fan of the franchise, then get this. Otherwise, you can skip this one. ",105,7,0,26,10,2,23

												OK, I'm fed up with this game, seriously! I played HoMM 3-4 and loved them both because those were playable and enjoyable games. HoMM 6 isn't!1., I've never understand why in the love of God the developers restrict you from playing? I mean why the hell I'm forced to play through the two boring tutorials to be able to play the real campaigns?! I don't care about the griffin♥♥♥♥♥♥knights I bought a game which consist more than 6 or 8 campaigns, why force me to playthrough you ♥♥♥♥in tutorial campaign and restrict me from the real ones until I finish the completely uninteresting, unmotivated tutorial campaign?!?!? Restricting gamers and not allow them to play how they want is the most ♥♥♥♥ed up thing by designing a game!2., This game is worse than HoMM 4, no matter on what difficulty you play, everytime you left your castle and leave you weakest units behind and prepare to attack with full force on the final enemy, the AI brings up some medium/small army and starts to capture your mines, barracks etc., and due to the movement points in many cases you are not able to reach it's army to stop this madness, and your army which you left home is not as strong as your main forces, so you are ♥♥♥♥ed up, you can reload your game because it's an endless cycle.3., Why Uplay? Sometimes Uplay updates then Conflux is not available and there you go, you can't play!4., On nVidia cards you have to ""hack"" or lower your graphic settings to prevent random freezes before tactical battles, no matter how strong card you have.These are the first impressions by playing only the ♥♥♥♥in tutorial campaigns on normal and even on easy because of the unfair AI unit spawn. Yes, I remember HoMM 4 was similar in that case but it wasn't as heavy as in HoMM 6. You can imagine how good this game is according to the first 10 hours which was only the ""basic"" tutorial campaign. To hell with this game, to hell with Ubisoft and well, Black Hole guys, I'm sorry, but you failed too, no matter how hard you tried to create something new. You owe me 19 Euros and 10 hours of my life!Gamers who like 4X fantasy strategy, go play Age of Wonders 3, Disciples, Fallen Enchantress or King's Bounty, the Heroes franchise is dead. There are tons of other great 4X strategy games out there, it's time to release HoMM to it's grave and get a grip of something new and good franchise.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Maybe I haven't played this long enough for glitches to actually come out, but there is another thing that broke the game for me. I'm HOMAM veteran and I've spend countless hours on third one, some time with fifth and I wasn't prepared for this.What it is? Difficulty. I wasn't able to finish first level of this game. I've completed tutorial campaign without any problems, then after playing first mission for two hours, I've realized I just can't win against AI player that suddenly appeared with army three times big that I had. I wasn't feeling like wasting two hours on every try, which is very nice if you're a game designer and you want to make your game feel incredibly longer, but it's abysmal if you're just a simple player. So I went to steam forums and found out that every mission is pretty much meant to be played one of two ways, and if you do anything else, you won't make it.And that's why I've stopped playing. I've actually liked how game's story continued, it was nice and well put together. Graphics are decent, soundtrack too and overall, I would be gladly playing the game, if it wasn't for this crippling difficulty. Their idea was to make few levels, but as difficult as possible. This is truly for hardcore players, or I'm just an incompetent  dumbass, which is possible, but after research I've done, I'm convinced that I might be too dumb to play this game, but it's definetely ridiculously hard.

												This game is unplayable on this platform.I've tried numerous times to no avail, and I'm not even able to get to the title screen of this game. Required to make a ubiplay account upon startup, but the servers are consistently down. Their webpage is still up, still active, you're able to make an account there, but it requires you to download and use a Uplay system, which is Ubisoft's gaming platform.  Ok done.  Finally it asks you for double-verification, and wants to you download a googleplay ap on your phone, to use the double verification feature.All to play a game purchased on the steam platform.Refund denied. Sadly, this is a lemon steam is offering. I'm a big fan of the Heroes series.			",46,6,0,8,6,0,4

												Not a bad Heroes game, all things considered.  I'm not entirely certain how I feel about them homogenizing all of the rare resources into one.I like that you can now specialize your hero in any direction you want, but I'm not a huge fan of the talents that they give you.  They don't see as fun as part 5's.Still a solid game, pretty fun to play, interesting teams.  I wish that you had 2 choices of upgrade for each unit like they did for Heroes 5. Unforunately their online service is a nightmare and I have yet been able to get a group of 4 into one game.  There's always an issue where 1 player cannot join a game, and that excluded player changes based on who is hosting.  Player 1 can't join Player 2's game, Player 4 can't join Player 2's game and so on and so forth.			",82,13,1,8,1,0,16

												So let me tell you a storyYou start off in your own base. Sweet!You're collecting resources around your base, killing neutral monsters and recruiting them, you're a hero!You've spent a solid hour and a half collecting resourcesYou realize you're low on gems, ****!You find a gem factory, Sweet!You fully upgrade your town, awesomeness!You finally catch sight of one of the enemy champions >_> He's coming towards your main base! You scream ♥♥♥♥♥ please!You home teleport and wreck him (barely)You find that sneaky dudes baseYou attack it and barely win! Sweet!You've received a notification that Green team has been eliminated, only red and yellow left!You suddenly get Yellow team has been eliminated message two days later. 1 v 1 !You assume Red team must be battered and broken just like you from taking on yellowSuddenly a red champion appears on your map, you've been waiting for this, he must be weak!You teleport to your main base where he is, geared up with the max creatures you can possibly buy!You scroll over him, seeing just how weak he is.....You notice he's classified as 'deadly' to your top hero....He attacks your main base, destroying your hopes and dreamsRIP 4 hours of your lifeYou realize the difficulty was set to easyYou uninstall the game4/10Overall the game is really really fun, the only problem is the enemy hero appears out of nowhere with an INSANELY OP army that you're like 'wait how the hell do you have 70 shadow dragons when I only have 40 spider ladies?' not to mention they've got literally every spot full of an artifact where you only have like... maybe 3-4. Compared to Heroes 5, which I played hundreds upon hundreds of hours before the days of steam.... this game is simply silly in terms of AI balance. It's like the AI is like 'oh hey you have 2 more soldiers than the other AI team, gg AI green team, you get their base for free, now go♥♥♥♥♥♥the player'..... and yes, I had it on easy because it was my third playthrough, normal I got rinsed before a month was past by a AI that apparently could recruit everything known to man on his way to my base since day one.

												I loved this game, but I'm really upset that the uplay launcher was added. When I finally got that to run properly (It crashed every time until I found some information), I discovered that my CD-Key could no longer be used since it was ""already claimed"".I purchased my key on steam in 2011 and started playing shortly after. I'm not sure where along the way I 'lost ownership'.  The extra kick in the teeth was the uplay application crashing after informing me I could not use my key.I'm waiting on a response from customer support, but I'm not optimistic.Seriously was a great game, but if you have to worry about losing access to it and having a terrible launcher, it's not worth it.

												From a Developer capable of great things comes unforgivable mediocrity.  After you get it working (download uplay direct from ubisoft), it will run like crap on a computer that runs bf4, arkham knight, etc at 1080 on ultra smoothly.  Turns take the AI forever.  The fun parts of homm are virtually non-existent, and the annoying parts are now the main part of the game.  Combat graphics and animations are frivolous and uninspiring.These devs need to go play homm3 complete and learn to steal from the right place instead of adding more code to this frankenstein.

												This game is complete fail. No playable balance in single player skirmish (not the campain mode), hero primary skills not working properly (physical and magic attack and defence), complete racism (if you play HMM 3 you'll see that mix from 2 towns are more effective than just yours but even than you able to choose - in HMM 6 no choice avalible), too low max level cap... The list of fails is too long for this topic.     I advise all players to try Heroes of Might and Magic III (or King's Bounty series)  - there you will see the great game mechanics and exellent balance between towns.    Too sad that for 15 years no one developer didn't learn anything from old school heroes - greed and hunger for glory are bad friends and advisors.  11.30.2013 i've tested HMM VI Shades of Darkness - game balance still 0: too many small numbers of buffs and debuffs make solo game without Ubisoft ""Conflux"" and bonuses from dynasty imposible - AI cheating too much (even know how to intercept you when you don't expect it). So my recomendation still true. In general - too many artwork (units has very good view) but no game mechanics, no HMM potential (combined forces from other towns, no working stats (example: vampire under your command do less and receive more dmg then under AI command - even your physical attack and defence equal to AI opponent), useless skills, teaching magic for skill points, level cap 30), P.S. I don't know who's responsible for this DLC...don't waste your money.P.P.S. Buy King's Bounty game series - much more fun and true legacy of HMM III (especially new one: Warrior of the North).

Posted: December 29, 2013
												This review is written with players of previous games in the series (III and/or V specifically) in mind. If you haven't played those before, I'd recommend playing either of them instead, as I feel they are both significantly better games.First and foremost, the game runs pretty poorly for me. I have an Nvidia card, so I have to work around the game to stop it from freezing every second time I enter a battle. Even with the workaround of changing the priority and CPU affinity (which I have to do every time I boot the game, unless I want to revert to an old GPU driver just for this one game), I still get the occasional freeze, mostly when attacking castles. The loading times are long and annoying, to the point where there's actually a loading screen the first time you enter a town. It takes a good 5-10 seconds of blackscreen to load a castle fight, while other fights barely load at all for whatever reason. Granted, I don't have an SSD, but really...Skills and spells aren't random, instead you choose 1 ability or spell to add or upgrade. The amount of skills rivals V's skill and sub-skill system, but there are far, far fewer spells (since you can only pick 1 per level, instead of just visiting a mage guild).Units are pooled, so you can buy units from anywhere in your kingdom in any castle or fort that has access to the appropriate dwelling. Towns also have buildings that allow you to teleport to other towns by casting a spell, with some restrictions. Sounds good, but it leads to (at least against AI) stacking all your units on 1 hero and simply bulldozing through everything, because you can always just teleport to any castles that need defending. To add on to that, you can convert dwellings, castles, and forts to your faction, meaning a Necropolis player can convert a Dungeon castle into a Necropolis by paying resources and sacrificing buildings that can't be converted. Because of these things, you're going to end up having massive armies on 1 hero in pretty much every (PvC) game, which is extremely boring.The number of resources has been cut down; there is now only Gold, Wood, Ore, and Crystal, where Crystal is the rare substance and the other three are as they are in previous games. It leads to less situations where, for example, a Stronghold in III doesn't have the crystal to get cyclops or behemoths, hamstringing them. It does make everything feel samey, though, with resource costs practically the same across the board.Castles and forts have a zone of control around them. What this does is prevent enemy heroes from taking any dwellings or mines within their zone unless that hero stays put at that building. So no more annoying heroes running through and taking all your mines and dwellings while you're away. Hurray! It does pretty clearly telegraph who owns a castle nearby, though, since you can see a big blob of their colour on the minimap representing the zone.Towns are also structured a lot differently. There are almost no prerequisites in the manner that there are in III and V; you just need a certain level town hall for most of them. There are no more Tier 1 - Tier 7 creature dwellings; instead there are 3 tier 1 (called ""core""), 3 tier 2 (called ""elite""), and 1 tier 3 (called ""champion""), and none of the dwellings are required to build any other dwellings. All towns have the same dwellings (though obviously with different units for the faction), town hall, fortifications (which only increase creature growth by 1 instead of 50/100% like in previous games), the marketplace, the previously mentioned portal buildings, the ultimate building which is equivalent to the Grail or Tear of Asha building from previous games, and a hall of heroes for hiring heroes plus its upgrade to resurrect them. Literally the only difference between factions' towns is two unique buildings (a tier 2 and a tier 3), each of which has two possible options. There's usually one with an effect that works in the town's control zone and one that's global; the tier 2 generally improves the faction's unique ability, and the tier 3 is generally something strong that fits the theme of the faction.Heroes also (by default; you can speed it up for non-campaign games) seem to level really slowly, which really hampers the game, since your spells are directly tied to your level in addition to regular old abilities. I might not have looked hard enough at exactly how fast you level, but it at least feels a lot slower.Unit speeds in battles are almost the same across the board; melee and flying units can generally move across the board in 2 turns with few exceptions, and without even looking it up I honestly doubt there's a unit in the game with a speed under 5 (the size of a normal field, for reference, is 12 wide and 10 high) and I doubt there are many, if any, with a speed above 8. There just aren't slow units like Dendroids or Zombies or wicked-fast units like Archangels that can cover massive ground even when slowed. As mentioned before, creatures are split up into 3 tiers instead of 7, meaning all factions have 3 creatures with similar stats, 3 stronger creatures with similar stats, and then their truly unique top-tier creature. Just like towns, creatures often feel samey.They also went back to the III style of turns (as opposed to V) in part; units with the highest Initiative go first (Initiative and Speed are split like in V, meaning the unit that can travel furthest doesn't also automatically go first), and each unit gets one action in the round, unless they get good morale, which gives them an immediate second turn with reduced speed, damage, and the inability to use abilities. I'm pretty indifferent to this, but I feel like V's system of not having 'rounds' has more potential and variety available.Like in V, each faction has a unique ability they can use in battle. They each charge up in a different way and have a different function. Necropolis can resurrect troops (surprise!), and the ability is charged up when units (enemy or friendly, though friendly charge it faster) take damage, while Sanctuary can buff their units' stats and charge by attacking any unit that hadn't already been attacked in the round.There's also boss fights and other unique encounters with special fields or conditions. So far I've played 2 non-tutorial campaign missions to the end, and both had a unique fight at the end. In one, you control a boss fighting against a massive army. I happened to be playing on the hardest difficulty for this, which made that army really massive, to the point where I just gave up, since a little bit of bad luck or an imperfect move could easily turn the battle to a loss just like that. In the other, you have a certain number of turns to kill a massive army of units that all have No Enemy Retaliation and Strike & Return. I know, fun. This one was pretty easy after I took a practice attempt to figure it out.Random maps. They're not in the game. At all. And there aren't even a whole lot of custom game maps, either. It's sad. I'd even take V's pretty bad random generator over none. Really disappointing.Then there's the Dynasty. There a meta progression thing going on, where you earn passive abilities, weapons, and things like that by playing the game. Naturally, these things only work when you're online, and only when you're *always* online. I don't know how strict it is, but I do know that one time I started a map, disconnected a few seconds in, and was promptly booted from the game. Not simply disabling the Dynasty, seeing as I'm not playing against other people and so it likely doesn't matter if they're enabled or not. Kicked from my own player vs. computer game; that type of behaviour doesn't typically endear a person to a game.It also requires Uplay.If you don't have Heroes III or V, get one of those instead. If you absolutely need more Heroes, I'd recommend getting II or perhaps even IV or I after that.			",510,161,14,123,44,10,135

												This game is awful.The game itself, I suspect, wouldn't be all that bad... except that you have to BUY most of the races... and some of the races that are in Heroes V simply aren't in this game. I'm not a fan of the creatures either, but that's just my own opinion. In short: double what you spend on core game, and that's how much it will cost to get the rest of it. The stuff that really should have come for FREE.			",186,19,0,17,9,0,25

												Piece of crap product.Need to install yet another DRM ""solution"" (i.e. UPlay) and even when putting -offline in the launch options so you don't have to  use UPlay (sacrificing online features obviously) the game won't wokr. Can't create a campaign, can't play a custom game.. nothing.Thankfully this useless product came at ""only"" 5 USD (with 75% discount) but I fail to see how it's even worth that, seeing that I can't go past the Menu screen. If you would like to download 10 GB of stuff so you can see a pretty (albeit useless) game menu, by all means rush to buy this ""game"". Otherwise stay clear from this.			",66,23,0,3,12,0,17

												I've been playing Heroes a long, LONG time. The games scratch that wonderful itch i get for a tactical RPG but in a western setting and normally do a great job of hitting the balance between tactical thinking and forward planning but with a lot of the fanbase, we noticed a lot was up when the brand name changed from ""Heroes of Might and Magic"" to ""Might and Magic : Heroes"", a change that made no sense. This whole trend - Changing of the brand - follows it through the whole game. From simple changes like how the battles play out to multiplayer being a ""create your own hero"" rather then having a list of heroes. It feels like less work was put into this game, just to test the waters to see if people cared. It's a little hard to explain what went wrong. First off, the story is set BEFORE the heroes 5 game (a game i really rather enjoyed) which means not a lot of the events are really explained outside of ""AND THIS COULD MEAN STUFF LATER"", with some rather dull line-reads and the Haven once again being kinda just used as ""We totally are good guys, but..."", the lack of effort in the story keeps the story going for far far too long and by the time you are doing anything considered fun, you are passed bored. Have i mentioned the bugs? 2 years. No patches outside of basic ones. The game STILL forces me into offline mode. It says i've played 1.7 hours but im over 100 hours. I wanted with all my heart to like the multiplayer but after a while, it just gets boring when my heroes skills are chosen by me. I like random for a reason. :( Just...skip it. Sales be damned.

												This game is complete fail. No playable balance in single player skirmish (not the campain mode), hero primary skills not working properly (physical and magic attack and defence), complete racism (if you play HMM 3 you'll see that mix from 2 towns are more effective than just yours but even than you able to choose - in HMM 6 no choice avalible), too low max level cap... The list of fails is too long for this topic.     I advise all players to try Heroes of Might and Magic III (or King's Bounty series)  - there you will see the great game mechanics and exellent balance between towns.    Too sad that for 15 years no one developer didn't learn anything from old school heroes - greed and hunger for glory are bad friends and advisors.  11.30.2013 i've tested HMM VI Shades of Darkness - game balance still 0: too many small numbers of buffs and debuffs make solo game without Ubisoft ""Conflux"" and bonuses from dynasty imposible - AI cheating too much (even know how to intercept you when you don't expect it). So my recomendation still true. In general - too many artwork (units has very good view) but no game mechanics, no HMM potential (combined forces from other towns, no working stats (example: vampire under your command do less and receive more dmg then under AI command - even your physical attack and defence equal to AI opponent), useless skills, teaching magic for skill points, level cap 30), P.S. I don't know who's responsible for this DLC...don't waste your money.P.P.S. Buy King's Bounty game series - much more fun and true legacy of HMM III (especially new one: Warrior of the North).

												There seem to be a lot of mixed reviews on this game. If you loved Heroes 5, you'll probably like this one as well, but I can see why some of the die hards would complain. Pros:-It's Heroes. I've played the incarnations of this game since the original, and have enjoyed every version (except for 4, seriously what were they thinking). -Every creature has a special ablility. I like that, because it means if you only have low level guys, you can still use stratagy to outwitt a larger army.-There's a bunch of new creatures to explore.-All of the town types are evenly matched. I found in the previous games Necromancers (my favorite) had generally weaker monsters compared to other towns, but would make up for it with numbers as you fought. The Necromancy skill has changed in this one so you don't mass up a swarm of skeletons from your enemy's corpses, but your army can hold it's onw anyway.Cons:-U-Play. I've never liked using U-Play, and this game is the best example of why. Aside from the bulky and unecessary U-Play shell that runs, you have to have a connection to their server to access most of the game. Also, if you're not connected, you can't access any of your saved games. And most annoying is the autosave. I found that after about two weeks of in game play, my computer would bog down to the point of freezing the game. I was able to fix the problem by not allowing the auto save, but that means I have to save my game myself often.-Skills. I honestly don't know what I don't like about the new level up skills format, but something about it rubs me the wrong way. I do like that you have to earn your spells by leveling up, but there is something about the new system that just feels .... blah.-Enemy Heroes are really tough. In a custom map, you can spend a couple hours building up your castle and hero. You'll find that the random map monsters are fairly easy to dispatch, but then an enemy hero will show up. ""Holy Crap, where'd he get that army from?"" or ""How did he vaporize my stack of creatures with that one lightning bolt?"" I find them wickedly powerful. The campaign though, which I havn't yet finished, seems much easier.-You really only need one hero. You beef up one guy and go smashing. If an enemy is sneeking up on your castle, no problem, just use your town gate spell and you're home. It's also too easy to get your hero back every time. While I get nobody wants to loose their big main hero, I find this takes away the stratagy of defense for your castles.Overall, I do enjoy the game and would suggest it to anyone, both fans of the series and newcomers alike!

												Great game, the AI is really challenging and the hot seat feature is, as always, amazing. I didn't not finish the campaign, the story isn't really immersive...Unfortunatly... you need to be on U-Play to acces the game or else, you can't save your progress.This is the only bad feature of the game. U-Play is really killing Ubisoft games. But if you don't play when any major game launch or any major problem with U-Play server happens, you will be fine. So I recommend this game, even if U (don't) Play is needed to play with all of this game feature.			",65,7,1,15,14,0,32

												It's a good game. Doesn't hold a candle to Heroes M&M 5, but it can hold up on it's own. Biggest gripe I have with this game is the Always On DRM. If your internet gets a little hick-up, the game quits (even in mid battle), doesn't save your progress and exit's you to the main menu. This is extremly bothersome. I dont think I ever finished a game session without getting booted out of this game.  Even though I bought this game, I am seriously considering Pirating it, so I can continue playing without getting disconnected all the time.  Save youself the trouble and get Heros 5 instead. More content, more factions, better spells and skill tree. AND NO STUPID DRM!!!!			",88,44,0,43,6,0,33

												The worst game system ever!  I got the game and after 4 hours I still cannot start playing because of the idiots that designed uPlay. My new account got locked so game is not starting. And yes, you need to create account with uPlay besides having Steam.Next day it loaded the game up to the main menu, I try to start playing but is not connecting from the game now. ""Connecting to the CONFLUX..."" popup on the screen but no message to say if it failed or not. I was waiting for 30 minutes and is not connecting or displaying any message. There is a Cancel button on the popup and I pressed it which takes you to the game but in offline mode and it looks like you have limited access to the game offline.I get to see the game menu but on the UI is clear that they did not finish the game yet. It looks like I spent $ on a BETA version. They did not update the map items titles ""Episode Name goes here..."".After some time I was not able to get to start a new game because the buttons were disabled but at one point after 15m or so the UI resets and ""boom"" the Start button enables.Finally after a lot of frustration the game starts and I get to do the first Campaign map (offline mode) but after finishing up I got bored because it was the same game play I was experiencing on prev versions and nothing new to it to make me excited to continue. If you played Heroes before and got bored after so many repeating game play you will probably have that right from the start now.On the map there are items that you cannot interact with in Offline mode and after 5 days of trying the game never connected.Also advancing from a map to another the menu is not letting you to select items in Offline mode.

												That HOMM is nice! Well, It's like HOMM I,II, III & IV. I hated HOMM V and only could have played it like 15 Minutes, it was a complete disappointment for me. I was also afraid of buying this one after that bad experience with the 5th but after reading some positive reviews from the fans of the older series I snapped it and it's really like HOMM III&IV. Thanks!There is also the 3D zoom-in feature but who would wanna use that? You don't always have to use all the resources and technological developments to create a game. They shouldn't have touched the concept of HOMM I, II, III and IV while creating the 5th. It seems that they already learnt from their mistakes and gone back to the original concept in the 6th.Well; Don't be afraid to buy this one if you are fan of the real HOMM franchise. Some details have changed but in the means of general game design it's very similar to the original series(I-IV).			",195,142,9,45,35,6,40

												Well... I enjoyed playing the first three titles of the series, and was looking forward to reenjoying it with modern day graphics during the fights. What I got was nice for the first start, playing a little bit, but then I had that Nvidia graphics bug, and since them I'm only able to play with minimum details. A disappointment to say at least, I thought I still might give it a try, and started to play the single player campaing. There, you play nicely, until you find that you seriously can't beat the opponent, since he constantly has more units than you, generates them quicker (even if you conquer his spawn buildings outside his castle), and then you figure you can't beat him. That's when I quit playing. Now I'll uninstall it and see another 10€ fly out the window. If this would have been a boxed game I would be considering sending it back for a refund...

The bug crashes the game or makes screen black when opening town screen or starting a battle.I advise you to buy it only if: - You have a non-Nvidia video card- The game is on a cheap sale- You save often and don't mind restarting the game every time it crashes.- You are a die-hard fan (but in this case I'm sure you would have already bought it before)If you love this type of games, try Heroes of Might and Magic V, it doesn't have the severe crash bugs and it's even more fun than the VI.

												That HOMM is nice! Well, It's like HOMM I,II, III & IV. I hated HOMM V and only could have played it like 15 Minutes, it was a complete disappointment for me. I was also afraid of buying this one after that bad experience with the 5th but after reading some positive reviews from the fans of the older series I snapped it and it's really like HOMM III&IV. Thanks!There is also the 3D zoom-in feature but who would wanna use that? You don't always have to use all the resources and technological developments to create a game. They shouldn't have touched the concept of HOMM I, II, III and IV while creating the 5th. It seems that they already learnt from their mistakes and gone back to the original concept in the 6th.Well; Don't be afraid to buy this one if you are fan of the real HOMM franchise. Some details have changed but in the means of general game design it's very similar to the original series(I-IV).			",195,142,9,45,35,6,40

												I love the series, and the entire universe.  I have a been a fan since the original came out nearly two decades ago when the rogues looked like the Hamburglar.  However, the site through which I have to log in just to play the game, Uplay, has been broken for a very long time, and remains broken right now.  I *would* recommend this game if Ubisoft, Uplay, or Steam could fix this problem.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

From black screen during loading to random freezing in game (just google Heroes VI and you will see the horde of problems). I highly recommend everyone out there to AVOID THIS GAME.

												The game itself is great fun, but UPlay has pretty much destroyed the game's playability. Additionally, there have been significant, game-breaking issues with certain video cards that have persisted for OVER A YEAR without a fix. I cannot recommend this simply due to game-breaking issues that are not addressed by the devs.			",196,65,0,40,9,0,31

												Well... I enjoyed playing the first three titles of the series, and was looking forward to reenjoying it with modern day graphics during the fights. What I got was nice for the first start, playing a little bit, but then I had that Nvidia graphics bug, and since them I'm only able to play with minimum details. A disappointment to say at least, I thought I still might give it a try, and started to play the single player campaing. There, you play nicely, until you find that you seriously can't beat the opponent, since he constantly has more units than you, generates them quicker (even if you conquer his spawn buildings outside his castle), and then you figure you can't beat him. That's when I quit playing. Now I'll uninstall it and see another 10€ fly out the window. If this would have been a boxed game I would be considering sending it back for a refund...

												This game is piece of crap. Some people do not like it due to forcing Uplay on to their heads, but for me it is not the reasonPros: Has beutiful battle fields and greatly animated creatures.Cons: Lacks most of the creatures that I loved, or they are changed and are not the same as before (Dwarfs, crussaders). Castle design is horible without and with DLC, some of them are missing (rampart, tower) and some are only unlocked via DLC (dungeon), Human castle is based solely on religion and other ones on some boring nonsense. Senitel's shield has Poland's coat of arms on it instead of clasical griffin, some of the heroes names are russian (Anton, which means Anthony in English), There are ONLY 3 RESOURCES INSTEAD OF 7: wood, stones and blood crystals. This thing doesn't even have a map editor! . There's even more, but I alredy tired from writing.To sum things up: This part of heroes sucks, go get 5th or 3rd instead			",36,4,0,3,2,1,3

												If you are a fan of Heroes 3 or turn based strategy game, this is a must get.Story Plot : 9/10 All stories linked to each other and working towards revealing the mastermind @ final campaignNew feature: Dynasty weapon & traits adds more spice to the game, i wish there are more dynasty weapons!High replay value: Once you clear the campaign, you will be wondering about how to clear the campaign again with opposite choices (i.e. Might vs Magic, Blood vs Tears). You will be want to use your favourite race to re-play at higher difficulty level and/or single scenarios.Character development: Experimenting with talents trees and controlling multiple heroes of different talents as the story progress keeps me addicted to the gameDownside:    - Might and Magic is not really balance, which steers many players towards playing just the stronger side. Same goes to Tears vs Blood.   - Requires UPlay active connection [I've not been able to play the game due to UPlay server down which is frustrating]   - Still some bugs which are not fixed till now (eg. max level magic heroes are suppose to summon 22 Earth Elementals but it's down to 12 if you spec Earth Magic)Conclusion:   Overall is enjoyable and especially with 8USD promo price now, you don't even have to ponder!

I recommend this for everybody who like fantasy, turned based games. The only negative thing that i've noticed is that you need Uplay for it.

There are multiple expansions for this game and I got all of them from the start. I then after downloading the whole game AND then getting Uplay, could not activate the 3 dlc's and was restricted to two factions that are in the base game.See I recall the glory days of heroes 3 a timeless game indeed as I stated before, get the older heroes games off GOG.comhttp://www.gog.com/ Go now, have fun with better games.

												Terrible excuse for a ""strategy"" game, they couldn't design competent AI so they just made them blatantly cheat, it's not even hidden like in other strategy games. You either rush all main objectives ASAP (ignoring all creeps/items/side quests) and cheese the AI with elemental summons, or you lose. Also: Maps take hours to complete, there's no such thing as a quick game. The 3D models are pretty ugly, I think Age of Mythology, which was released about a decade before is nicer looking. Loading times are excessive. You are forced to use their crappy proprietary launcher. It's filled with obnoxious nitpicky things like clunky interface, not muting sound when minimized, game tips that don't properly display/disappear, buggy skills or skills that don't work as is obvious, etcI think they definitely paid off all the reviewers, the game is maybe a 3/10 at best. Maybe multiplayer is more fun but at this point, I can't be♥♥♥♥♥♥♥to try.			",28,6,0,13,0,0,5

												Love this game. I really do. But there are a few crippling things that mess with it. The game play is solid, the AI is challenging and you will be kept entertained for the entirety of the game if you can get over the few (but massive) hurdles involved with it.Bugs Murder its' face, even a few years after it's release and they're not getting fixed. Black screens upon entering combat and there are no fixes for this other than to kill the application outright and start again.it also requires the encroaching DRM software known as UPlay like many other Ubisoft games.Uplay made me buy it twice :D Now i have two copies and I can't share one of them with friends! Thanks Ubisoft!Uplay isn't the reason I don't recommend this game though, it's the bugs and absence of support from Ubisoft.10/10 would twicebuy broken product again.			",174,26,6,29,29,1,62

There are never enough troops, I cannot fathom how one can use multiple heroes effectively, giving all of your troops to one hero is often never enough.

												In general its a good game, it gives many hours of fun. Pros:+ ""New"" concept with set items on the heroes+ An online connected item system (dynasty) which enables you to level up weapons as your hero gains experience. (too bad for people who cant connect to the internet all the time)+ You can choose your hero type and still select abilities from both might and magic classes+ All heroes can learn spells of higher ranks, and not randomly+ Challanging campaigns and nice boss battles!+ Interesting mix of abilities.+ Good looking graphics and designs.Cons:- Set items are a bit booring, they give general stats and mostly nothing awsome. 6 set items should give a big bonus.- Dynasty items require ALOT of experience to level.. During campaigns you are stuck using the same weapon all the time, because it has a healing spell... So not much variation possible.- Campaigns are very long, and creeps increase in size so fast you are not allowed to lose any units. (therefore you need all the healing spells available)- Enemy heroes magically always knows what castle is unprotected and the exact size of your army. Enemy armies also grows in an rate far greater than your 10 vs 1 castles.- Stunn spells doesnt work. Examples:* Succubus charm/seduce spell clearly states it stunns for 2 turns. The creature is in fact stunned for the remaining turn(even after their turn has passed).* Time statis spell clearly states 4 turns, it randomly stunns between 2-4 turns.* Chilled/frozen usually works for 1 turn as well (they can attack the next turn, after they got stunned).* All stunn spells counts one turn even though the creature has already done its turn. Makes sense?- Auto combat always makes you lose units, which mentioned earler you cannot afford. every battle (up to 100 times) has to be done manually as a result of the increasing size of the creeps, which also almost never retreat, even if your army is much, much larger.- Still bugs in the game. I could buy 100 units when there were 11 available and won the map. Stunns are buggy.- Hero movement is buggy. I got boots, hero trait, stable, etc etc and still cant get far. But the enemy can always ride further. A hero without an army however can ride through the whole map with the same buffs.- Very less information of the hero stats.. How many movement points does the hero have? How does it get increased mana? What does one might power do? Some spells cant be cast because of lacking information..- Lacking tool tips everywhere..- Campaign doesnt follow a chronological pattern, its very confusing.- I can go on for ever.HOMM 3 beats all the games. HOMM 4 was very fun as you could make OP melee heroes who became imortal with magic spells from an assisting hero. HOMM 5 was ok. HOMM 6 had lots of potential if more time was put into polising it.A mixture of HOMM 6 and HOMM 4 would realy do the trick, i like the ORPG direction the game is going. ",68,2,0,18,6,0,13

												Huge fan of the series with part 3 and 4 being my absolute favourites.HoMM 6 implements radical changes (zone control, less resources, teleporting everywhere, town conversion, skill system...) which completely break the game in my opinion.You can now freely pick skills instead of being offered 2-3 choices upon level-up. That leads to the ever same character progression, boring...Add to that the uniform factions which now all play the same and you end up with the worst HoMM game ever.There used to be completely unique factions. Now every faction has healers, archers, grunts etc., the units within a faction a coloured the same. It's just awful all the way.3/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Caveats.. The older I get, the more I find that DRM stacking is a dealbreaker. It's true, perhaps I am remiss in basing my overall recommendation on game design itself, but I will not recommend a game that has an extra DRM gate attached to it, ever.Here are some of the things I think are interesting, though:PROSWorthy addition to the HoMM series - all the things you've come to know if you're a fan of the series. Interesting monsters, magic spells, hero development.Good graphics.I like the Hero development system, which allows for many different styles of play, each of which peaks in power at a different point in development. Might heroes are generally more powerful early on, then Magic heroes dominate. Hybrid heroes are strong midgame. Finally, at maximum level, the power levels are back in synch. I like this pattern, as it informs my strategy as the game progresses.CONSSO much like previous HoMM games that it's hard to see why you wouldn't just play one of those. For the money, HoMM V can be purchased with all extant expansions, and that's a better value.DRM stacking. Get ready to log into Steam only to have to remember another set of credentials to log into UbiSoft's UPLAY service. You can't play the game properly without it. Internet down? Sorry, you miss out on content.Voice acting is... well, sometimes it borders on the offensive. Hearing a bunch Americans put on slapdash pseudo-Japanese voices made me uncomfortable in the way of those old illustrations of Asian people with lines for eyes and protruding front teeth.

												After downloading and installing 10GB, I was excited to finally play the game.  I had an hour free while my daughter's napped, but unfortunately it took 2 hours to start the game.  Once the patches were applied and it finally began I was confronted with a the Uplay interface.  I could buy more content or talk about the game, but there was no way to start the game.  Eventually I found that if I went off line in Uplay, then I could play the game, but I was warned that some features would be unavailable.  I thought it was an interesting warning because there were no features available when I was online so any available features seemed like a big improvement.  The game was finally starting but now I was in a lengthy movie sequence that I couldn't skip.  I have fond memories of playing Heroes of Might and Magic as a teenager, but I don't remember all this hassle.  I installed it, ran it, and played it.  After too many hours I finally gave up.  I'll play PVZ the next time I have a free hour.			",1,1,0,4,1,0,20

												Dont get me wrong, game itself is lot of fun and great continue in HoMaM series. I still prefer HoMaM 3 over all, but from the modern 4-6, I would pick 6 anytime if there just was not ...... CONNECTING TO CONFLUX ...I bought Shades of Darkness addon, what a waste of money! I cant even unlock this addon because CONFLUX keeps connecting for HOURS! You cant play online, you cant unlock new addons, that a mess! Not even once I succeeded in connecting to CONFLUX even though I opened every possible port and disabled every possible firewall! It totally ruins the whole game, DO YOU LISTEN UBISOFT, you totally ruined this HoMaM for EVERYONE with stupid non-working CONFLUX!! It doesnt work not only for a few individuals, but for thousands of discontent players!Until CONFLUX connection is present and essential for playing this game and unlocking Shades of Darkness, AVOID at all costs, otherwise its absolutely wasted money you pay.

												I really enjoy the earlier Heroes games, but Ubisoft's stupid UPlay requirement has made it hard for me to get involved with this version. The game has gotten more complicated and not more fun. Ubisoft is trying to replace my Steam overlay with their UPlay service and it annoys me. You also get an advertisement for other Ubisoft games every time you finish a session.  If their servers are down or having trouble handling the traffic, you can't play your game. Heroes III is one of my favorite games of all time and Ubisoft has sucked the soul out of the series. I don't know why they can't wrap their brain around the idea that strong arming your customers stunts your sales.			",116,55,0,38,17,0,27

												Progress: Completed Tutorial Campaign. Made it to second scenario (Towards the Within) of the Necropolis campaign. Did not get stuck and give up, simply lost interest in playing.A decent game marred by some major design issues.  Scenarios are too long and the slightest missteps in the beginning (losing too many units, picking abilities poorly) can set you back hours or take you hours to get to a point when you realize you have to restart.  The greatest downfall for me was the lackluster story.  After 20 hours played my only engagement was a few lines of dialog.  My interest eventually waned.			",251,138,5,46,16,3,40

												Do not buy this game especially if you have an NVIDIA graphics card as the card is probably not supported by the game.  I made the mistake of buying this game without doing any research into it since I had played previous games from the series and enjoyed them.  I had great hopes for this game and if I could play it I am sure it is great.  After spending several hours trying to find a work around for the NVIDIA issue I was able to play for about 15 minutes at a time before the game would crash.  Then on the second day of owning the game I was completely unable to launch the game from Ubisoft after unistalling and reinstalling the game several times.  I really would like to play the game but I am just unable to and it is impossible to get a refund for the game.  Do not buy the game.			",36,12,0,24,8,0,20

How hard is it to design a turn-based strategy game to make it functionable? 3dO did it in the past with the earlier Heroes of Might and Magic games, and they configured it for the apple products as well!So I guess it's not the game that's bad, it's the company supplying/supporting it: Ubisoft.

												Ubisoft has some disfunctional DRM called Uplay, and there's something else called ""Conflux"" that doesn't work and you can't connect to. So multiplayer doesn't work, and there's chunks of the campaign which are tied into Conflux so doing them is just a waste of units. I filed a support ticket over the break, and I imagine they're backlogged, but it's day 5 and there's not even a 'We're still looking into it' or anything.			",73,15,0,21,8,0,25

												Coming from one who has played all the Heroes (TBS) games, and most of the Might & Magic (RPG) games, this ""re-boot"" of the franchise is a slap to the face. (Scratch that, an arrow in the knee.) Granted, I didn't even get any farther than the third or fourth scenario in the campaign, but it was just too unbearable to continue waiting out the AI as I slowly built up my whole-is-less-than-the-sum-of-its-parts weekly creature gen. This new format is a terrible move on Ubisoft's part. Add to that the whole Uplay thing, that runs simultaneously with Steam, and I say NO. No, I am not a consumer ♥♥♥♥♥, Ubisoft, No, I haven't forgotten the old success of 3DO and New World Computing, RIP. No, I wil not play this game, which is an insult to its ancestors.There is nothing convincing me to continue playing Might & Magic: Heroes VI. At least they did the rest of the franchise a service by changing the name around (This is NOT a 'Heroes of Might & Magic' game! They may as well have said ""inspired by the popular franchise Heroes of Might and Magic""), so people wouldn't ask if the previous 5 installments were related to this new one. They are not. The repeat playable heroes redone from earlier games are a farce. Everything great about the series has changed, and I for one am NOT a fan.			",17,6,0,4,1,0,7

It will freeze after a while for one of us and then we have to ctrl-alt-del to get out of the frozen game. They still have hotseat, but that is tiring on the nerves not to mention a pain. No thanks.

												I have played countless hours of Heroes of Might & Magic 2 & 3 but I played it so much I kinda got a bit bored of it. After seeing 6 on special I decided to give it a go and see how it has changed and grown.Firstly I had issues with Uplay (which every one else seems to have) and I couldn't start the game until I manually had to reinstall all that. (everytime I install uplay I seem to have some sort of issue causing that process to take a hour)I got to play about a hour of the game before their conflux server lost connection and it booted me out of the game (why? It's single player just save the packet and send the info later!!!) again, this is a issue many other people are having and considering it is a game back from 2011 and these issues have not been addressed I can not recommend this game on these two facts alone. As for the game, it is much the same as HOMM3, well all the good bits are the same anyway. While they have tried to give you more flexibility with the heroes in allowing you to assign skills the problem is that you need to pile all your units into your main character, so the other heroes just act like couriers and you never really ""use"" them.Remove uplay and conflux and you have a decent game that has a few minor improvements over HOMM3 which is a bit sad considering there has been over 10 years and multiple iterations between the versions.

												I would love to give a good review of this game.  I bought it roughly a week or so prior to writing this review.  For the two days I was able to play it, I had a good time with it.  Nothing different than any other turn-based M&M: Heroes game but still fun.   And then I started receiving connection errors.  Error code 1s.  Error code 2s.  Unable to connect to Conflux.  Unable to connect to Uplay.  Etc.  Etc.  I spent about a day troubleshooting these issues.  (More or less half a day, really.)  Nothing I tried worked.  Uninstalling/reinstalling.  Opening ports that I had already made sure were open.  Disabling/tweaking virus protections, etc.  Deleting HOSTS files, etc.  Nothing worked.  Nothing anyone in any forum I could find suggested worked.So, once I exhausted every avenue I could possibly think of, I turned to Ubisoft's tech support.  After waiting 4 days for a response, they got back to me with your typical automated response.  ""Open ports, reinstall, etc...""  You know, the usual horrendous level one IT garbage.After waiting 4 more days for a response when I told them I had already tried everything they recommended plus many other things that they clearly had no idea about -> I finally just gave up and threw in the towel.  Since you are unable to get a refund on a game you purchase through Steam, I basically paid whatever amount of dollars (20 or so I think) for nothing.  Which leads me to my final conclusion:  Don't buy this game.  Don't buy ANY Ubisoft game, in fact.  While I want to love their games, I abhor their DRM software which causes these problems.  It was clearly written by monkeys.  What is happening should be illegal.  Anyway, I hope you have better luck with this game than I did.   If you choose not to listen to this review, that is your freedom and right.  But when the same thing happens to you, there can be no excuse.  You've been warned.  Boycot all Ubisoft games.Update: I still have yet to hear anything back from them.			",38,5,0,13,0,0,15

Happened to me too many times, and it meant me and my friend (playing hotseat) having wasted tens of hours without a conclusion. Very infuriating!The worst thing is that Ubisoft decided to stop support for the game, thereby removing all hope the game will ever get fixed.			",43,3,4,16,4,1,4

												Seriously should have looked into this game harder but steam summer sale was to good to pass up. NO LAN MULTIPLAYER and the online servers suck for anyone who is playing more than one computer on the same network. I bought a copy for me and my other half and we can not play multiplayer at all. It will freeze after a while for one of us and then we have to ctrl-alt-del to get out of the frozen game. They still have hotseat, but that is tiring on the nerves not to mention a pain. No thanks. Single player is typical Heroes M&M so that part is ok but not what i wanted to do.			",16,4,0,7,2,0,2

												I have played countless hours of Heroes of Might & Magic 2 & 3 but I played it so much I kinda got a bit bored of it. After seeing 6 on special I decided to give it a go and see how it has changed and grown.Firstly I had issues with Uplay (which every one else seems to have) and I couldn't start the game until I manually had to reinstall all that. (everytime I install uplay I seem to have some sort of issue causing that process to take a hour)I got to play about a hour of the game before their conflux server lost connection and it booted me out of the game (why? It's single player just save the packet and send the info later!!!) again, this is a issue many other people are having and considering it is a game back from 2011 and these issues have not been addressed I can not recommend this game on these two facts alone. As for the game, it is much the same as HOMM3, well all the good bits are the same anyway. While they have tried to give you more flexibility with the heroes in allowing you to assign skills the problem is that you need to pile all your units into your main character, so the other heroes just act like couriers and you never really ""use"" them.Remove uplay and conflux and you have a decent game that has a few minor improvements over HOMM3 which is a bit sad considering there has been over 10 years and multiple iterations between the versions.

												I would love to give a good review of this game.  I bought it roughly a week or so prior to writing this review.  For the two days I was able to play it, I had a good time with it.  Nothing different than any other turn-based M&M: Heroes game but still fun.   And then I started receiving connection errors.  Error code 1s.  Error code 2s.  Unable to connect to Conflux.  Unable to connect to Uplay.  Etc.  Etc.  I spent about a day troubleshooting these issues.  (More or less half a day, really.)  Nothing I tried worked.  Uninstalling/reinstalling.  Opening ports that I had already made sure were open.  Disabling/tweaking virus protections, etc.  Deleting HOSTS files, etc.  Nothing worked.  Nothing anyone in any forum I could find suggested worked.So, once I exhausted every avenue I could possibly think of, I turned to Ubisoft's tech support.  After waiting 4 days for a response, they got back to me with your typical automated response.  ""Open ports, reinstall, etc...""  You know, the usual horrendous level one IT garbage.After waiting 4 more days for a response when I told them I had already tried everything they recommended plus many other things that they clearly had no idea about -> I finally just gave up and threw in the towel.  Since you are unable to get a refund on a game you purchase through Steam, I basically paid whatever amount of dollars (20 or so I think) for nothing.  Which leads me to my final conclusion:  Don't buy this game.  Don't buy ANY Ubisoft game, in fact.  While I want to love their games, I abhor their DRM software which causes these problems.  It was clearly written by monkeys.  What is happening should be illegal.  Anyway, I hope you have better luck with this game than I did.   If you choose not to listen to this review, that is your freedom and right.  But when the same thing happens to you, there can be no excuse.  You've been warned.  Boycot all Ubisoft games.Update: I still have yet to hear anything back from them.			",38,5,0,13,0,0,15

												I want to recommend this, i really do, but i cant. The game is great, but, like most reviewers have pointed out already, way too buggy!Main problem is the black screen bug, after which there is no way to continue playing the game. Happened to me too many times, and it meant me and my friend (playing hotseat) having wasted tens of hours without a conclusion. Very infuriating!The worst thing is that Ubisoft decided to stop support for the game, thereby removing all hope the game will ever get fixed.			",43,3,4,16,4,1,4

I love the Heroes games, what part of this game I could play I also loved, however at one point I couldn not progress anymore into the game because it kept crashing. Ubisoft has no support for these crashes. I and many others have placed support tickets with Ubisoft and for myself I got a very generic answer and they closed the ticket without informing me.

												A big step down from HoMM5 - Tribes of the east. Content is either dulled down or absent entirely, and not just small things, but entire factions. There is also no alternative creature upgrade tree, meaning each factions has one less of each troop type than TotE. Action camera seems to be absent entirely from combat, which is slower than the previous game. Heroes no longer have their own turn in combat, but can instead cast a spell when on a creatures turn. UI is smaller but more cluttered, making for a worse experience. There is no map generator for custom games, which is terrible. I cannot recommend this over the previous entry other than for online features, or a prettier but clumsier presentation. Uplay is also required, be that a possitive or negative for you. Go buy tribes of the east instead.			",125,27,1,20,17,4,33

												Sadly, the game is much lacking compared to its predecessors. The combat is fun and the skill trees allow for a large amount of customization, but overall, the previous installments do much better at providing dynamic and challenging gameplay. MMH6 does provide some fun moments but they are sadly overshadowed by the one dynamic gameplay/hero progression and crappy Uplay requirement. Not worth the large price tag when you can go to GOG and get 3 and 4 for much cheaper and which both provide much better gameplay.			",35,1,0,5,0,0,6

												Oddly enough, unlike almost everyone here, I didn’t have issues with Uplay crashing every few minutes or not loading at all. However, Uplay/Conflux is one of the most atrocious game delivery platforms there is, and the horrible DRM ball and chain around this game made me not even want to play it after I put it down for a month after launch.THE GAMESo, to the game. It’s no Heroes 3, that’s for dang sure. It’s a hollow shell of the Heroes series and this was the one that made me lose hope in Ubi ever making a proper Heroes game since they obtained the license.It’s not horrible, but it just boggles my mind that they could make a game decades after earlier entries in the same series, and still somehow make a game that’s inferior in almost every way from its predecessors.DON’T BUYStay away from this game and arguably the Ubi/Uplay in general. It’s fine to make megabucks as a company, but that’s their whole focus, with customer satisfaction not even on their clipboard of concerns.			",128,12,0,24,7,0,12

Caveats.. The older I get, the more I find that DRM stacking is a dealbreaker. It's true, perhaps I am remiss in basing my overall recommendation on game design itself, but I will not recommend a game that has an extra DRM gate attached to it, ever.Here are some of the things I think are interesting, though:PROSWorthy addition to the HoMM series - all the things you've come to know if you're a fan of the series. Interesting monsters, magic spells, hero development.Good graphics.I like the Hero development system, which allows for many different styles of play, each of which peaks in power at a different point in development. Might heroes are generally more powerful early on, then Magic heroes dominate. Hybrid heroes are strong midgame. Finally, at maximum level, the power levels are back in synch. I like this pattern, as it informs my strategy as the game progresses.CONSSO much like previous HoMM games that it's hard to see why you wouldn't just play one of those. For the money, HoMM V can be purchased with all extant expansions, and that's a better value.DRM stacking. Get ready to log into Steam only to have to remember another set of credentials to log into UbiSoft's UPLAY service. You can't play the game properly without it. Internet down? Sorry, you miss out on content.Voice acting is... well, sometimes it borders on the offensive. Hearing a bunch Americans put on slapdash pseudo-Japanese voices made me uncomfortable in the way of those old illustrations of Asian people with lines for eyes and protruding front teeth.

												It's the average, less exiting M&M experience. The combat is about the only thing that keeps this game together, as the rest is really sort of meh. Options are limited / dumbed down, there's only 1 way to go for most heroes for optimum effect and the AI cheats their asses off to a point where it's just frustrating, rather than a challenge.And let's not talk about the multiplayer, or the lack of a proper working one and there's no LAN option at all. It's absolutely horrid and Ubisoft refuses to fix the problem, or even reply to the made complaints. In my case (and many others) I get 'out of sync' after 50 or so turns. I reload the game from 7-10 turns ago, still 'out of sync'. This happens with every multiplayer game.It's rather hard to recommend the game because of these flaws, but, the combat is really well executed.It may be better to get this when it's 80% off or something, it's deffinatly not worth the full price. That said, I forgot to leave out that it has the Uplay requirement and after that, you're required to be always online (yes, it will kick you out of a single player game if you disconnect).

Sure there's an offline mode, but theres no excuse for not being able to cache the single player info on a computer then push it to the server the next time it connects.

												If you are a fan of Heroes III or Heroes V, DO NOT BUY. Pros: Very nice graphics, good spread of decent units. A few nice concepts, but not well executed. Story isn't bad, though let down by horrid voice acting. Seriously, King's Bounty had better voice acting. Destiny stuff is a neat idea, though all of the extra heroes were free for me, maybe from DLC? The music is mostly ripped off from HOMM5 and reochestrated, so it's alright. I do like the idea that your hero can go on any allied turn instead of having to wait for a specific place in the initiative. Also, when you recruit from a town, It automatically recruits from surrounding structures and other forts etc. No wait time, the troops are just there (by magic I assume). Saves time on re-arming, even if it makes no damn sense.Cons: HOLY CRAP IS THE VOICE ACTING BAD. Necromancy is nerfed to uselessness, The other racial abilities are frankly meh, All heroes have all of the same abilities to pick from, and spells are just abilities. You get to pick one per level essentially, and a lot of the core spells aren't there (No summoning to speak of, no raise dead, almost no direct damage spells.) Nice 3D rendered towns like HOMM5 you can circle around in? Nope! Static images with overlays. Also, the interface overlay crawls, even if the rest of the game runs great (AMD quad core, Geforce 560)The real shame is the sheer homoginization of the play styles accross races. Since all heroes have the same ability access and trees, you just pick the tactic you like and then hang some set dressing on it by picking a race. Literally no other flavor involved. The units are a nice mix, but they all are roughly the same at each tier. Also the AI is balls. Aims for highest tier, or ranged and ignores everything else. Sieges are about as challenging as water baloon fights. Also adds in the idea of territory control, which is kind of nice and kind of dumb. To control a mine or sawmill etc, you have to control the fort or town it is in the territory of. You don't get any resources from it unless your hero is parked on it otherwise it continues pumping to the local town as normal. This would be neat if you could at least stop production from it by attacking it and sacking it, thus denying resources, but no, the moment you leave it it just reverts back. So again, cool idea, with a flaw in execution.Overall, if I had played a demo of this game, I would not have bought it. I payed $10 on the autumn sale and uninstalled it within 24 hours, and wish I had my $10 back.			",87,31,0,32,19,0,39

												DO NOT BUY! I made the stupid mistake of buying a ubisoft game before checking up on additional DRM and as you might guess it didn't end well. Uplay is REQUIRED to play the game and it would just be another annoyance if you're lucky. I am not. As others have reported there seems to be an issue with registering an account where it doesn't connect to Ubisoft servers. Forums, workarounds, support were all ineffective and I am now stuck with *nothing*, can't even access the game offline. Of course you might not encounter these issues but be careful, it's a horrible product when it's functionality depends on luck.			",100,22,1,36,20,0,34

												To everyone thinking about purchasing this game: Don't. This game is literally unplayable. After you have installed it and get to the main menu, you are unable to play anything because the game doesn't register the key correctly. It keeps saying that the serialkey you have used is already in use. I tried to solve this mess by contacting ubisoft via ticket and it was resolved without solving or giving me anything else but ""we are looking into this problem"". And this was a year ago when I first pre-ordered the game, and when I tried to install it again today, same problem.I repeat: DON'T BUY THIS GAME.			",62,14,0,14,6,3,6

												I'm going to start by saying I really wanted to like this game. It actually has the makings of a good game in there but for one major flaw. I can live with uplay and I've only once had any trouble logging in. My problem is with how the game handles the difficulty.It has been mentioned before but your resupplies are granted weekly. The enemy's troops are also topped up weekly. The problem is that as you're exploring the map getting into fights and loosing troops the enemy isn't. On my first play through I wanted to get around the map, get into battles and collect prizes (usually armor). By the time I got to the boss his army was so big they were undefeatable. I started again, this time racing through as fast as I could. This time I pushed on to quickly and was caught out by a roaming enemy.Both times I played on normal because I don't do easy. I'm sure with another couple of attempts I could get it right but there's the problem. There's a difference a game being hard and a game being cheap. If the game took your play style and army size into account it could have worked. Instead the developers figured it would be best to have the enemy army grow at a consistent rate regardless of what you do or how you play. The game is too much about time management and too little about fun and so I can't recommend it.If, like me, you like the look and idea of this game keep looking as there are countless other games that do a much better job of being a good fun game.

												The Might & Magic franchise has been known as one of the greatest producers in these kind of turn based strategy games, and I believe that Might & Magic: Heroes VI, has yet another great addition to its forefathers. I really like strategy games, especially strategy games that take a long time to actually complete. With many customization options, you can really craft the game you are really wanting. Anyway, on to pros and cons...Pros-Graphics, simply put, amazing. The graphics for the characters and enviroments are completely what I was expecting from this game at this time. The characters themselves look really good, although they have limited animations, so the characters tend to get a little boring, but that isn't really a big problem.Controls, the controls are very efficient and very user friendly. You can complete your turn with only a few clicks if you use the menues correctly.Interface, the interface for the overworld if very nice, you get all of the important information right in front of you with the ability to make changes on the spot.Combat, personally my favorite part! The combat is similar to the games previous to this one, but in this one the combat is more user friendly, but also doesn't reduce the amount of strategicness (strategicness isn't a word, but you get it). Combat is played like a turn based RPG, just picture a literal boardgame and that is exactly what it feels like. Your hero doesn't actually take part in the combat on the board, but does attacks and skills from the sideline. This is not a common thing in games like this, but this game has done a great job at doing it this way.Local Multiplayer/Hotseat, I am giving this its own section, because it is just plain amazing! Although having a large group of people playing on one computer may seem at first inefficient and slow, playing with friends is great fun. Being a Dungeon Master (Game Master of Dungeons&Dragons) has taught me that bringing people together to interact with something is a great way to have fun with your friends. Anyway, moving on now...Cons-Repetitive, the game can seem repetitive after playing it a while. The combat is basically the same thing every time, so I can see where people can get tired of this game quickly (personally, I am fine with the repetitive nature of it).Campaign, although the campaign was overall nice and what was to be expected from Might & Magic, it just didn't get me into the story. The story itself didn't really seem relavent to the game itself, the game could have been completely fine without even having the campaign. The voice acting just didn't seem realistic/believable enough was another issue with the campaign.Other than those minor flaws, this is overall an amazing game that I definitely recommend.Conclusion-I definitely recommend this game to anyone who wants a gameplay experience similar to any number of classic tabletop roleplaying games. It is a fun game and it is especially fun if you have others to play it with. Strategy games are perhaps my favorite kind of games, and this one is high on my list of recommended ones for sure.May your adventures be many and always end in reward!-Donoknight, Founder of Tabletop RPG Gamers League			",93,38,0,60,31,0,28

												Do not listen to the naysayers. This game is excellent. Is it as good as Heroes of Might and Magic III? No. Is it as good as Herose of Might and Magic V? I'd say they are about equal. Since their newest update, I have experienced no bugs, no crashes, no problems. The story is droll, but it was droll in V as well. The voice acting is a bit better than it had been in V, but not by much. The gameplay is excellent, the variety in units and races is pleasing, and the graphics are pretty damn beautiful. I wouldn't pay 60 dollars for it (which I did not) but I sure as hell would fork out 10 for the entire collection! What a steal!			",128,9,2,28,33,0,93

												i absolutly dislike the fact that the game itselfe is not functioning.

But then the wohl process crashes an error window occurs and states; ""can`t apply the patch because Heroes of might & magic VI isn`t installed yet"" which is annoying as hell. The reason for that is that my mouse cursor turns invisible after starting the game without the applyed patch.I tryed purchasing just the shades of darkness version and after that problem occured i tryied the whole thing another time with buying the Goldedition with every expansion pack there is so far. But the problem remains and really destroyed my interest in this game.with all this said; thank you Ubisoft and uplay for giving us a game which isnt even playable.(please excuse my bad english)			",1,0,0,2,3,0,3

												I keep forgetting that I preordered this game. I keep forgetting I even preordered it through EB Games and got a T-shirt. I keep forgetting how excited and impressed I was with this game. I remember now because all that lasted for a week at least and a month at best. This game is broken to all hell from the beta to now. The name gave a bad omen and like the company the game suffered popularity issues and decided to turn against itself and the community. It's Heroes of Might & Magic Ubisoft, you idiots. The fact they made a might and magic game based on the engine and universe they created even further soiled the game's franchise. Then the company made a new one, it is even worse. But at least it's getting support unlike this poor anal abscess. From being taken hard and wild with no consideration by the company this game is that a bad of a state.At first this game was ok, fun at times. Then patch after patch with severe bugs not being fixed sort of killed most of the enjoyment this game could have given. At one point I had to install uplay's standalone installer just so I could play this freaking game because Ubisoft fails to provide adequate support across steam. The addition of swords and staffs broke the game beyond belief. Some were outright ignored when there are those that give you an additional army stack at the beginning of the battle. Making early fights pathetic and downright unfair to anyone who didn't use said sword. Some staffs barely worked in your favour if you were up against the wrong faction. As if Necropolis cared about inititive. The story that came packed with this mess was bland, boring, and uninteresting. But not uncreative. I will give that they actually did an ok job of some original story to go with it as the game series have been fantastic in regards to the story it gave.But near the end it got stupid and ridiculous. As if the plot was rushed because they worked so hard on trying to make it interesting or definitive. In the end it was a let down of almost epic proportions. Throughout the campaign I recall many moments that neutral armies would endlessly grow. There came a point where an army of 10000 Pearl Priestesses was more of a threat than the main army I was supposed to defeat. In the end I just ignored the enemy and just killed those to get experience for said overpowered swords. Which btw was almost impossible to level and results of said leveling was much to be desired. It angers me so that Ubisoft has ruined a series with their fugly dirty hands. I should have seen the signs and accepted it was bad when I saw it on preorder.			",168,11,2,23,16,3,52

												The people who are putting this game down are complaining about Uplay, not about the game. The game is good. Uplay is redundant, unnecessary and cumbersome. However, it does not detract from the game itself. Someone said there are multiple steps to registering with Uplay. There is one (admittedly redundant) step, and it consists of pasting your CD key from Steam into Uplay. Someone said Uplay has too much downtime. I've played every Assassin's Creed game through Uplay as well as Rayman Legends, so I have a lot of time spent on Uplay. I have yet to have one incident in which I could not play because Uplay was down.Would I rather not have Uplay? Damn right. Redundant ""services"" like Uplay and Origin should just move everything over to Steam. They are trying to fight piracy by punishing their paying customers. It's the most ridiculous and ill-conceived plan imaginable. However, people should not be putting this excellent game down because of Ubisoft's paranoid, control freak mentality. If you like HOMM games, you'll love this edition.			",260,66,3,41,26,3,44

												This game is great for a new player to the franchise. Fans of past games see it as one of the worst, but the way the game teaches you how to play is very easy to understand, and since it has the least amount of resource types, its easier to manage buildings and units. I like the fact that there are bosses, reputation classes, dynasty heroes, a bestiary and the campaign that is actually really good. If you have never played a Might and Magic Heroes game before, this will probably be a great strategy game for any library. The biggest downfall is Uplay, which is the unneccisary second step to logging into the game which must be updated to the most recent version to even access. If you have troubles starting the game, uninstall Uplay and then reinstall it a couple times, thats how i got mine to work after.			",130,8,0,22,20,1,14

												The absolute best the series has to offer, Might & Magic Heroes VI is an instant classic for me.  If you've never played the Heroes games, essentially it's a vivid medieval fantasy world where noble humans, towering demons, ghastly undead and an array of other factions all clash together to fight their way to victory on a living, breathing chess board. Unlike chess, though, the combat is a rush, with each unit having its own set of skills, strengths and weaknesses. This installment also features the most extensive multiplayer suite yet, with some very exciting features like character persistence, customisation and some very dynamic maps to play on. Definitely recommended, even from someone who rarely appreciates turn-based strategy.			",281,45,9,41,24,3,40

												I have a couple of dozen games that were so bad I've created a garbage category (garbage is polite) and stopped playing them in minutes.   Some I can't review since I haven't even put in the required 5 minutes they were so bad.I LOVED the M&M series and loved the Heroes series even more.  But somewhere around 5, it became too convoluted.  This game just seems to go out of its way to sap the fun out of you.  They've concentrated on making the game not fun.  Play Kings Bounty instead, any of them really, they concentrate on the fun.Not to mention King's Bounty was the original of the series back in the 80s.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												There are many conflicting opinions over Heroes VI. Some of it is because of the community spirit: Heroes fans are so conservative that everything was better before the universe existed. On the other hand, I cannot remember many games that have had this many technical difficulties. The publisher, and the two studios that have worked with the game, have made progress... but it is still ongoing. The core gameplay is to my liking, however. The subtle changes take away much busywork, and the battles are fun. The story is such melodrama I cannot see anyone not smiling at it			",153,47,0,24,9,1,36

												I would not recommend this game.  This game witholds powerful items from you if you can't connect to the musertious 'Conflux' servers. and Guess what? You can NEVER connect to the conflux servers.  So, in addition to basically denying you powerful items, the game is immensely imbalanced.  The developers couldn't take the time to balance the game properly so you know what they did? They gave the computer terrible, unfair advantages.  The computer can generate huge armies in little or no time with little or no resources, while the player is discouraged from exploring the map by the ridiculous rate at which the computer gains armies.  This makes the campaign feel completely unplayable and unfair.  Combine this with U(don't)Play forced into your mouth everytime you turn it on, and a 50% chance that UPlay will crash your game, and this will make a throughly BAD GAME.  DO NOT BUY.

												As a Heroes of Might and magic long time fan it is with great disapointment that I must say I cannot recommend this game.Heroes VI had everything to be a solid game, but it's intrinsic connection to UPLAY DRM and the plethora of gameplay bugs makes this one of the weakest entries of the series.The gameplay is still solid thanks to the stellar formula of the game, however, the game in itself has many bugs that have not been solved in 2016, and the UPLAY Conflux mechanic simply disconnects you without even saving your game whenever your connection fluctuates with their servers. This leads to much frustration.The music of the game is overrall uninspired, even after the expansion (that made remixes of classic tracks). The voice acting is downright terrible. The graphics and concepts are good and the late inclusion of town screens was a great addition to the game.This game is flawed in the little things, but its flaws are not at all small - they are very noticeable and contributes to a negative experience.If you are a Heroes fan and can get this game on a sale, by all means do it. However, buyers should be wary of acquiring this game at full price. Overral, I would give it a 6/10.			",101,35,1,15,12,2,20

												Only bought it because it was on discount, complete edition for 7,45 euros, in my opinion real price is 5 euros, reason is too much effort to start the game, double DRM, requires steam + Uplay buggy launcher(you have to delete default version of Uplay wich you get from steam and download latest from ubisoft website!! Its easier to play this game if you pirate it than on steam! Double sync with cloud on both uplay and steam (WTF) autosync on Uplay always fails!! And thats just starting the game! Game is dumbed down with only 3 resources and mine controls are noob friendly if you control castle you control all mines, i dont mind this because im lazy i find this as a good thing, what is bad is the lazy programing concerning game AI! I mean lazy developers wanted to gimp players who just play passive and stockpile army so they can go on later and steamroll the scenario/campaing, i dont really mind gimping this but the way they did it is completley wrong! Ai ignores economy it just spawns armies out of the blue and gets fresh troops through some sort of Harry Potter sorcery, so if you want to win only way is rush and realoding battles since you cant afford to loose a single creature, so all of you who like to explore the map you gonna have a bad time....I only marked review positive because of the price i feel seriosly sorry for folks who paid full price on this!

												The game itself is quite good, but having to use steam to launch Uplay to update and launch the game and then connect to another server when entering the game almost ruins the experience. It takes 5 minutes from launching the game from steam to actually playing the game!The game is good and a worthy succesor to the series, but getting to play the game is a lot of waiting on services you don't really care about. Maybe just buy the game and then download it from an illegal site just to make it easier...			",88,10,1,8,5,1,9

												I love the Heroes of Might and Magic Series though I never got into playing #4.  The 3rd release has always been and seems it will always be the best even if lacking in graphics!  The 6th release is very playable, but it lacks the depth of even the flop release of #4.  Being restricted to playing online for your complete features is just stupid and should be choice rather than mandated to receive your features.At this point I will edit my review...  The game itself is fun if it does get a bit monotonous at times, but then you will find getting to play the game your biggest challenge as UPLAY constantly drops connection sending you back to the main menu or just will not access the internet.  After much digging, it is not Heroes 6, but an inconsistent UPLAY Server; it seems that Ubisoft cannot seem to keep the main server running consistently...I can understand their concerns over antipiracy and cheating, but I have a feeling UBISOFT loses more money using UPLAY than people could ever steal from them...  Until UPLAY starts working consistently or it is cut out of the loop I no longer recommend this game or any game from UBISOFT!If you buy the Heroes 3 HD, buy at your own risk in January...  By the way, the disks still work perfectly...If you buy the Heroes 7 coming out next year, buy at your own risk...  If you need example, catch Heroes 6 on a friends computer and try playing after midnight...  UPLAY rarely stays logged in after midnight and stays offline until 6 am...			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I think this game is almost a worthy successor to HOMM 1-3 which is a really big compliment from where I stand, though it lacks the intuitive gameplay to a degree and vcampaigns can be very clunky, I still massively enjoy this game... However, 'Uplay' is a pain, so what's new I hear you ask. Indeed, I'm staying in Indonesia, and don't have a great internet connection, so every once in a while I just get booted from games because my internet connection stops for 10 seconds. Not to mention that I can't ccess save games without internet connection, or have my progress registered. You can in fact play the whole game in offline mode, and forgo a level bonus, so it's definitely worth bearig that in mind before you jump into the campaigns. But I cannot stress enough how useless, unsupportive, and interfering the presence of Uplay is, and what a terrible drain its methodology is on games like thiswhich should be aa lot of unhampered fun, I'm honestly losing track of how many levels of DRM are being demanded at once, and am not totally convinced that is the sole purpose of the wanton invasion of my computer that seems so populr amongst game developers!!!!!

												The single story is as excelent as every other Heroes game out there and quite enjoyable guaranteed to give you dozens and dozens of hours of gameplay howevever if you want this game for the multiplayer i heed you to a word of caution that multiplayer will most likely not work for one reason or another such as connectivity issues or issues with uplay it just wont let you play with other people i and quite a large % of the heroes community cant play multiplayer games so if u want it for multiplayer you have been warned.Also Uplay and Ubisoft support along with their forums are by far the worst i have seen in any game and most of their responces are plainly from a textbook and without any effect.i recomend it for the single player only do not buy for the multiplayer unless it is clearly stated that it has been fixed.

												In my opinion it is a good game, especially with the Shades of Darkness addon. Played the whole Heroes series and even though is not the best title in it, it certantly worth it.Pros: - Fun to play- Good story- Pretty well balanced considering the multitude of creature skills and racial abilitiesCons:- The game has a few places where it crashes that can be verry annoying, but you can get over them. For example it was crashing during a fight with a specific enemy hero, when he was casting mass heal. To get over it I lowered graphics to the lowest, won the fight then maxed it back up- Uplay log... kind of sucks but... well... I got over it when I noticed I'm able to get dinasty weapons/pets with achievement points- They renounced at beautifull 3d castles from H5, and multitude of resources from the whole series (replaced mercury, sulfur, gems, crystals with one resource called blood crystals)			",67,26,1,39,8,0,19

												HoMM6 is altogether a solid installment in the series. For those who have been with the series for a long time, it's a bit of a mash-up between III and V. For the rest, I'll break it down into PROS and CONS, since I know that helps me when I'm looking through reviews at games.PROS- Separate campaign for each faction. You might not think it's a big thing, but it is. Very exciting for each faction to get their own story in some shape or form, for those who enjoy playing campaigns.- Familiar but different resource management. Gone are the days of managing common resources (wood & ore) and a slew of uncommon ones (mercury, crystal, sulfur, gems)... plus your gold income. With VI we are down to just wood, ore, and crystal, and while it seems strange at first it actually balances out rather well.- Forts and the ability to convert dwellings & towns to your own faction. No more hodge-podge army. Oh, and you can recruit all available units at any town you have that has the dwelling for it. So you don't need a train of 3+ extra heroes to keep bringing new units to your main.- Skill points. Tons of options to customize your hero as they level, and while your might-based heroes can still take magic-based abilities, you tend to get more bang-for-your-buck sticking with the same theme.- Champion units are CHAMPIONS. HoMM3 is great, but a glaring point that you cannot overlook is that some level 6 units were just better than the faction's level 7 (I'm looking at you, Necropolis). This installment has units divided into three ""tiers"": Units 1-3 are your Core units, 4-6 are Elite, and your 7 is your Champion. Within the same tier you won't see much power difference, but there are noticeable leaps between tiers, especially between Elite and Champion. Regardless of your faction, your Champion unit will be a force to reckon with.- Melee units can damage walls in a siege! Yes, you read that correctly. Previously when laying siege, you relied on your range and fliers while your catapult took its sweet time bringing those walls down. No more! Send those ground-pounders in to beat down the gate with their bare hands.CONS- Skill points. The skills and abilities are so numerous that going through them to pick the one (1) you want to spend your point on for the level you just got might take a bit.- Spells. WAY fewer spells than any previous HoMM installment. Spells are integrated into your skills as well, which will be confusing at first. You also don't have a Mage Guild in your town anymore, since spells are directly tied to your hero and faction.- Interactives do not stand out well. Call it a side-effect of the nicer graphics the game is running, similar to HoMM5, but it is easy to miss interactive buildings and items on the map due to blending so well with the background.In all a solid game that is most certainly worth your time if it's on sale. I see a lot of negative reviews because it installs and launches through Origin, but I cannot say I have ever run into a problem with it nor do I find it to be a hindrance to playing a game I enjoy.

												As a game it's like a 5/10 with more bugs than a bethesda sandbox game.  Considering the Uplay requirement it's a -10/10.  I play offline a lot and that is impossible with uplay.  When I play with the internet connected the uplay app is constantly sending packets back and forth.  I don't know what exactly the point of them is, but it's significantly more than any other background application, usually beating all others combined.  I don't trust ubisoft to begin with so that made this game something that will probably sit in my library for the rest of time with the likes of divinity II and other garbage games.

												Bought the complete edition on sale @$9.99 USD. Few installation problems with Uplay and Steam but I found a way around it.PROS Very long and illustrious franchisewith its ups and downs. Up to HOMM6 now.Certain classes of heroes (Sanctuary) can swim without a ship if all units in the army are amphibious. Similar to Disciples but a good addition. Would also have liked a hero that can fly. Makes each faction less generic.Pirate race of neutrals sounded great (Crag Hack campaign) until it became all Orc Class / Stronghold Faction. Good attempt.CONSThe game feels like it is incomplete. After playing Might and Magic : Duel of Champions and seeing all the different creatures, spells, classes, buildings and heroes, Heroes feels like it is still in alpha.Diplomacy mechanic has not been changed. It is is still very weak and almost useless. It only increases the number of creatures that join you and only affects neutral creatures. Creature stances are fixed in stone and do not change e.g. Hostile creatures stay hostile all the way throughout the game.Minor issues like illogical campaign speeches e.g. Orc Campaign : Acama speaks on your side when you have yet to convince him to join you.Campaign choices for Tears vs Blood may always favour Tears since letting neutral creatures run away without a fight gains +10 Tears.Dynasty weapons take way too long to grind up beyond Level 2.Logging into CONFLUX before the game starts is getting on my nerves.Edit:Story is pretty boring for all factions, except the Necropolis. Only Anastasya's story is somewhat interesting.Faction abilities are not of an equal level. 1. Having the Necropolis have the most powerful faction ability to resurrect AND heal is quite overpowered. Not to mention. Having the Altar of Eternal Servitude makes it even worse with an immortal army.2. Gating ability for Inferno takes too long to activate. It has to first gain points then wait in queue to be summoned. Although being able to summon anywhere on the map seems enviable, it is quite easy countered. Gating units does not help to prevent unit loss since gated units do not stay. While the L4 gated ability (instant gate + copy of original stack) is ridiculously powerful, it takes way too long to activate.3. The Haven ""bubble"" is not very useful. Enemies almost always have another valid target to attack. The main benefit is being fast to cast and preventing your range units from being targetted in the first round of combat.4. Castle architecture is very bland. They resemble coloured boxes. You can't differentiate a barracks from a market.RECOMMENDATIONBring in all the stuff from MMDOC into Heroes. E.g. Wizard Class/Academy Faction which already existed in previous versions of Heroes, Tier 4 creatures like the Ghost Dragon, Wyvern Riders for the Stronghold.You can even bring in unique creatures to prevent classes from turning stale.g. Al Betyl Ghoul is a way more powerful ghoul compared to normal Ravenous Ghouls for the Necropolis.For Diplomacy, allow it to change the stance of the creatures towards you. e.g. Diplomacy makes Hostile to Aggressive and Agressive to Passive and Passive to Friendly. The ability to bribe safe passage. The ability for Diplomacy to work on enemy heroes not just neutrals.Flying heroes. On dragons.Co-op campaign maps.REFERENCEShttp://www.mmdoc.net/card_list/thumbs/type_card/creature/ ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												DRM Maddness talked about here was not an issue for me however this still gets a big thumbs down.Slow-paced and devoid of new mechanics with a decent b-movie grade plot. I cannot think of one memorable moment from playing this game for nearly 30 hours. I can not think of any reason why I would prefer it to or recommend buying it over the previous two installments.I hear the plot is unfinished as well. I can not say for sure since I am done wasting my time.4/10.....There's still a hint of the M&M charm in this title but again your better off buying IV or V and forgetting this was ever released.

												As Heroes V was my first played heroes game, I do not know how it was earlier. My review is hence based on experience with Heroes VI and a relation to heroes V.I really have to say, the ambience is really great in this game. Great graphics, great sound, great design. It is still clearly a heroes-game as far as I can tell. The new features like reputation, which make the game more replayable and interesting and the new skill system, which I admire with every playthrough, I must say the devs realized a game which uses old concepts with new features seamlessly. Building up the own dynasty is a cool thing, not really necessary though. Just makes your games easier.Just for the sake of completion:uPlay sucks!			",64,19,0,24,11,0,11

												While not needing nearly as much strategizing as the third or fifth installments in the series, it is still better than the fourth by a landslide. It is hard to say if it is better, because too much is different, though the pacing certainly feels much faster. There are 6 full length campaigns in the game, and each campaign takes at least 12 hours of nonstop gameplay to beat on normal - longer on hard. Glitches and bugs are thankfully for the most part nonexistent.You'll definitely get your money's worth on this, though waiting for a sale or price drop might be your thing if you don't like how 'casual' the game seems to have become. Don't wait too long, though.			",215,39,2,79,72,0,83

												It's kind of hard to rate this game.  It is a part of the M&M Heroes series, which alone makes it worth playing.  However, there are some things about this game that I just really don't like very much.  Probably the biggest complaint I have is the rushed feeling that this game has about it.  Unlike the other games in the series where you were given more time in each level for exploring, this game comes at you fast and furious.  It seems like every level you are simply trying to just stay alive long enough to finally build up an army which you can use to rush toward the enemy.  There are quite a few areas that you want to explore, but every time you start going toward them, suddenly another large enemy army is marching towards your city(ies), and you have to turn around and defend yourself (there's no way that you can produce a generic hero strong enough to defend yourself, only your main hero has a chance to win.)  Even on the easiest level this game just doesn't want to give you the chance to explore and discover all parts of the map.  Plus, the longer you take to explore, and look around the enemy quickly becomes so strong that you can't possibly win.There have been quite a few changes to the actual gameplay and interface as well (some good, some not so good), which is probably more of an individual preference as to whether one likes them or not.The story doesn't seem to be nearly as strong as was that of HoMM V, plus you have the option of choosing which campaign you want to play, rather than having to unlock the campaigns as you go along (which also kind of takes away from the continuity of the story).Another huge problem with this game is having to use UPlay to actually play the game.  UPlay and Steam just don't want to work well together, and normally I have to try to launch the game 2 or 3 times (sometimes even more), just to get it to actually work.  Once I turned Uplay's sinchronizing feature off, it did help a little, but only a little.If you are a big fan of the series, then you will want to play this game (even with all of it's irritations and quirks), but just don't expect the same epic experience that you got from HoMM V - it just doesn't compare.

												TLDR. Pretty good and enjoyable game (it was a mess on release day i have low amount of hrs on this cause i played nonsteam version and then bought HOMM6 with all datadisks here). Its set before events of to HOMM 5. It waries from predecessors wih its skilltrees, rewamped magic, bonuses to set items(legacy weapons that are cool feature) and diferent path that u can do in ur campaign.Rewamped teritory and mines. But if stays true to HOMM franchise.This game walks steps forward and steps backward. I think the HOMM 5, tribes of the east. Was the best game in HOMM framchise. Hands down. It improved from its original game and took care of problems that original had. Its also a standalone expansion(i know right, times long past, where one expansion pack feels like new game).Story is placed before the events of HOMM 5 and while it is still good it is not as good as HOMM5(also dungeon dlc butchered relag for me).  It tells the story of siblings that all have big role to play in upcoming events. U can play the campaign that u choose, so if u want to play haven or ignore that and play inferno. Each campaign has 2 paths u can choose for ur main charakter and it gives u set of unique abilities. Pretty cool mechanic that has not been in HOMM before. It keeps things fresh and replayable. Also boss batless that are super fun.That being said, the spell efects are worse than HOMM5(dont even look up HOMM 7 u will be depressed), but it got rid of the wheel formula of old.  So if u want to have best spellcasting abilities u go for them and u dont rely on randomnes of please roll for me fire magic cause i have only fire spells etc.  Now it becomes also fun to go for ofensive builds, rather than have only stat bonuses and ocasional ability from race skill.  It also got rid of HOMM5 iniciative for hero, u can cast spell or ability once per turn as it was in homm3. Battles stays true to HOMM franchise tho u have rewamped morale and luck. Most of the troops has its own set of abilities. Tho its a shame that u dont have 2 trees for units that u had in tribes of the east. as i said steps forward and steps backward. U now dont have warmachines but its ok. Other than that TP system was reworked. And map gameplay was rewamped/butchered/degraded in my opinion. From lots of diferent resources u have only 3: gems, wood, ore and gold. Idk its simpler but i took something from the franchise that it didnt needed to go away. Instead of capping enemys resources now u have area of control where u need to take castle before u can control their mines. This is better for casual players, that got frustrated by lvl 1 hero taking their mines. But u get used to this very quickly. Heroes can now travel without troops, but get destroyed when catched by enemy heroes, pretty nice modifyed adition from h4. All in all pretty good game, wery enjoyable, and when u finish it u want to play next game in series. U are so ♥♥♥♥ing hyped when they anounced heroes7.U wait...and...then...u...play...heroes7...and...oh...god...its...bad(but thats another story).			",52,7,0,8,8,0,25

												I have to say I hate heroes vi- they dumb down the city building, you mainly make creatures market and a town portal... no blacksmith no magic school no small different houses that add a bonus here and there.-no unique magic for every faction.You don't have a magic school you can lean spells in the outside world you mainly lvl up and then pick 1 spell\power you want.-no siege units, they took off the balista and the tent.-heroes were simplified to the point of twins, only difference is their starting passive buff. - dynasty system suck, if you are offline all the heroes you opened are locked again and you got basic male female(2) heroes for every faction			",233,12,1,36,14,0,25

												Like most of the Negative feedback already posted I would have to agree not to buy it.  I really enjoy playing the game and as some say probably could be the best so far.  BUT.... I cant play the game anymore.  Had to uninstall the game due to windows issues and when I finally got it resolved I went back to reinstall and continue.  I saved to cloud all the time so no issue continuing. Or so I thought.  I cant install the game because Steam cant connect to the Conflux servers.  They are down ...well im not sure if they have been up at all since I started trying to reinstall.  So save money and frayed nerves.  Also save money on broken keyboards and mice due to frustration of not being able to get anywhere with Ubisoft/Uplay customer ""support"".  Doesnt exist.			",49,8,1,48,7,0,51

Gameplay is pretty much the same.. a few graphic updates here and there but it's the same core game (which is good).The problem is Uplay will randomly decide to disconnect which causes the program to force quit you out of whatever you're currently doing and restart the client in offline mode - losing all progress since the last save.

												I like the well-planned campaigns and storyline. Graphics is colourful and eye-pleasing. Gameplay is excellent, it's very much a HOMM. I dont actually having problem with Uplay, by going online you get to play with some extra goodies which are quite nice like the dynasty weapons and dynasty traits etc. But I think that to be able to play offline is important as well especially for some players that have no constant internet. Uplay is still not good enough for seemless play between online and offline. Overall, it's a very good game. Im looking forward to play H5 ToE as well after finishing H6. As for H7, its much criticised bugs refrain me from buying it. FYI, H6 is not as buggy as I read from the user reviews and so I give a recommendation to H6 with reservations.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is great when you are able to play it, but with U play constantly disconnecting and losing your save data, it's more frustration than anything.  I didn't pay to be frustrated.  There is no reason why this game requires an always online for a single player game.  Sometimes, you can't even log into Upay, When this happens, you cannot play the game.  UBsoft will blame the problem on your poor internet connection, but I have no problem with Steam or watching Youtube while I wait to play this game.  I bought this game awhile ago, stop playing due to frustration.  Came back years later, and problem has not gotten any better.  Really not worth it.  I really did try to make this game work.  it is such a shame that this game cannot be played appropriately.  It says I have 1.8 hrs, but really 70-80% of it was trying to get the damn thing to run.  I do not recommend this game becouse you will just be frustrated.			",52,14,0,24,7,0,28

												This game was great for the 12ish hours that I was able to start it.  But then I woke up one day, tried to run the game, and it crashed on the start-up splash screen.  And then it did it again.  And again, and also Uplay wouldn't properly sync my save data, but that didn't matter because I couldn't even launch the game.  So I looked on Steam forums and support, and appearantly this has been a well-known problem to them for over a year, with no fix according to the rest of the internet, which is resorting to numerous failed attempts at getting the game to work.  You've gotta love it when you're having to run Steam (DRM), and from that run Uplay (more DRM), and once the game launches you have to enter a product code (as if two layers of DRM attached to records of money spent wasn't enough), all to find out that you've gotten hornswaggled, getting a discount on a game that Steam and Ubisoft have known is bug ridden and unplayable for years.

TL;DR - The best Heroes installment since the third one. Amazing graphics, suprisingly good story and a great price to gameplay value, but it comes with the horrible Ubisoft DRM system (UPLAY) that forces you to be always online. Campaign offers about 120h of gametime with core game and additional 60-70h with all available DLC (Pirates, Dance Macabre, Shades of Darkness).PRO's+ Overall gameplay improvement - Although I played Heroes V for some time and recall some improvements implemented before, the overall gameplay overhaul in Heroes VI is, for me, its greatest advantage. All the flaws of the Heroes III (which I am very fond of) are fixed and remade into intersting mechanics. I could name many examples, but I will focus on the two selected, the first being the Town Portal mechanics. In H3 all you ever wanted from your Hero was to have Earth Magic on Advanced level and a single Town with Town Portal spell to learn. If you could get it, you practically won the game, as you could jump around the world to collect your units and utilize a devastating mobility advantage. In H6 all units from given faction can be purchased in a single Town, provided it has all the necessary dwellings so there is no need to jump from town to town to accumulate the army. As for the mobility advantage, Town Portal is no longer a spell you have to learn - its a building you can create in any of your castles. Level 1 Town Portal allows a visiting hero to teleport to any other town or fort of his choosing and Level 2 Town Portal allows any here to teleport back to the city (nearest with L2 Town Portal) from any place on the map. As you can use only one of those spells on a single turn, Town Portal becomes a commodity and a feature of its own. The second noteworthy feature is the complete revamp of unit tiers. In the past units were categorized by 7 tiers, first one being the cheap weaklings and the last one being an all-powerful destroyer. Now you got pretty similar units but reworked into 3 tiers: Core (three first units), Elite (the next three) and Champion (the old Tier 7). All Core units are comparable in their usefulness and so are the Elites, but they got their traits that would work best for certain heroes (as the rule of a thumb, there is a Might unit, a Magic unit and a shooter in both Core and Elite tier). This makes creating your army more flexible and greatly increase the basic unit performance in comparison with Champions. Unit reclassification was the real gamechanger and a very welcome one.+ Astonishing graphics - The environment is pretty amazing, especially in the campaign maps. The world is filled with random magical objects or unique decorations that really help to maintain the magical character of the world of Ashan. It is also very well optimizes for older graphic cards. Unit design is top notch and campaign posters (images seen when loading a campaign map) are simply fantastics.+ Interesting storyline - The world of Heroes has always been ridiculous and over-the-top with its magical theme, but I think this is the first time the main story actually embraced it and used it so effectively. The dialogues form a suprisingly coherent narrative for the main plot, which might not be written that greatly, but sure as hell is well voice-acted. I was very positively suprised how well contrived the world of Ashan is in the dialogues, so the story has its value whatsoever.+ Lots of playtime - The game, even without DLC, provides you with a very decent amount of content to go through. Core game has 22 campaign missions, clocking at about 5h each, so you can easily go over 100h just enjoying the single player mode. DLC add another 14 missions (2 in Pirates, 2 in Dance Macabre and 8 in Shades of Darkness, so the two adventure packs ain't worth the price), with similar amount of gameplay within. And of course the multiplayer, especially the couch one, can provide you with another Infinity hours of gameplay. If you buy the Gold or Complete edition on sale, the price to value ratio is pretty damn good.+ Very heroes-y music - Lots of the tunes are remakes of the H3 score and everything else really complements the graphic design. Soundtrack is what you would expect from a Heroes game, but thats a good thing!CON's- UPLAY - Ubisoft bloody DRM will turn the game off when the Internet is down (less often) or UPLAY servers are unresponsive (very often). It also forces itself into the game in the form of CONFLUX orbs - something similar to chatrooms, placed near boss battle locations. Their Mission/Reward system is stupid and the whole software is simply annoying as all hell. Still, its not Origin, so I guess it could have been worse.- No hexgrid (again) - Why did the developers of Heroes decided to go from classy hexgrid battle to obviously inferior square tiles? I know it was the same with H5, but why? Hexgrid is million times better!- Some balancing issues - Although units on their own are very well balanced when comparing factions, the Hero bonuses are not. Faction powers of Haven and Necropolis are far better then those of Sanctuary or Stronghold. Blood/Tear bonuses also vary from totally worthless to grossly overpowered.- Gets kinda repetitive - After few missions and some skill experimenting, the game gets pretty easy and repetitive. Reinforcement skill almost break the game, as it allows you to go through most minor battles without a single lost unit. You don't have to change your tactic that much to win with different enemies.Overall, I recommend this game very stronly. Unless you hate UPLAY more then I did or you want to play this game competitively againts your friends, you gonna love H6 if there is any affection for turn-based strategies in your heart. Is it better then H5? HELL YES! Is it better then H3? Arguably yes, but even those that treasure H3 as the best game ever will say that H6 holds the solid second place on the HoM&M podium.

												This was the biggest letdown of it's year. I expected a great new arc in the genre.But it's failed in so many ways, some up to personal opinion others less so. My opinion is based off of a comparison between this game and the games before it, Heroes III and V especially.The first and the defining failure in this game is the lackluster abilities and function of the heroes. In it's predecessors Heroes III and V, they could gain great power and spells that both were and felt awesome, as well as unique for their factions and style.Now, their abilities are all the same in the TWO different classes, and you'd be hard pressed to find any real difference between one hero and the next. They're called ""Heroes"" of Might and Magic, not Peasants of punches and fairy dust. Half the fun of the previous games was customizing a build with different schools of magic, but when all spells are ""balanced"" and every hero has the same there's no difference.The game was littered with bugs upon it's release, since then it may have received updates that have fixed them.There are only four resources. Once again, diversity and resource mechanics are taken out only to be replaced by a bland ""everyone uses the same"" resource called gold, wood stone and ""crystals"". Apparently, having different resources for different things is too hard.As for personal opinions which is a matter that must be taken with a grain of salt: The game seems very balanced to the point where similarities between the factions become too strong, and once again the diversity and innovation of the game is lost.The gameplay is decent, although occasionally slightly sluggish.Story's good, although very long. But that wouldn't be a complaint if one likes the game.Heroes VI is terrible because it has taken exactly what was fun about it's predecessors, the customization of Heroes and gaining immense powerful units, and made them all the same, fair, balanced and utterly boring.

												Having cut my teeth on hundreds and hundreds of hours of Heroes 3 and Heroes 5, I really wanted to like this one.  It looks great, no doubt, but I'm afraid the magic is gone.  Enemy AI cheats to a game-breaking extent, so the only way to really experience this properly is to only play with other people.  Unfortunately, that's not generally desirable or workable online, due to UPlay's instability and the general unreliability of anonymous players in general, and 1v1 hotseat (or the like) is itself pretty limited and unsatisfying.  I miss the days of playing cooperatively with one or two other human players against the AI.The mechanics have also become problematically distorted, leading to too many unwinnable games where the growth of map creeps outpace your own troop production, or how suffering even incidental losses in too many map skirmishes can permanently doom your long-term war effort.  The idea of local forts/castles serving as the control point for local resource generators in the area was kind of nifty, and I could be okay with that depending on how it was implemented, but it feels too much like everything that formerly made this series great (particularly in HoMM3) has been gradually stretched, squashed, and otherwise mashed into some cheap imitation of its former glory.  GIve this one a pass and go play Heroes 3 or 5, stat!			",216,26,2,29,13,0,36

												This is a fun, turn based Strategy RPG focusing on controlling an Empire and the Heroes that you recruit. (CATEGORY) ""Poor/Sub-Par/Average/Great/Superb"" 1-5/5 - Description(OVERALL)- My personal rating for this game is 85%. My average rating for this is 71% (3.5/5)(GAMEPLAY)  ""Superb"" 5/5 - Battles are turn based tactics using a grid system, similar to games like Final Fantasy Tactics, Poxnora, Disgaea, Ogre Tactics, etc. Each turn you aquire resources depending on what mines/ect you've captured, and can spend those resources to upgrade your town(s). Your Heroes gain levels, and new abilities which are both passive, affecting the Army of Monsters you recruit at your town, or directly doing damage or providing some various effects (slowing down enemies, speeding yours up, summoning monsters to fight for you, etc). You end up fighting Neutral monsters that are stationary on the map, usually blocking your path as your armies are too weak (at first). Armies are formed from Monsters/Units that you pay to recruit (with gold) at your town/village. Each unit bought will represent a ""Stack"" of units. You have around 10 slots to have different types of creatures in your army, and you can have as many ""Stacks"" as you can afford / create to build up your forces. There are a huge variety of ways to play this game, all of which are really fun. Many elements of this game are comparable to a 4X game. (STORY)  ""Sub-Par"" 2/5 -There is a storymode to this game, and infact it is one of the best ways to get strong gear for your Hero. Gear aquired during those missions (and some other ways) allow you to make your Hero stronger, earlier, in any form of gameplay. The story isn't insanely good, but I found it to be very well done as far as being creative. Depending on what DLC you buy changes how much story you can access. This is one of the greater faults for the game. The story itself is something I like, however limiting it by DLC is not something that I favor. (Note, without some of the DLC (IE you bought Shades of Darkness, not the original) you will get a lot less content, which is why this is a 2/5)(GRAPHICS)  ""Average"" 3/5 - The graphics are quite good, but not amazing. There is enough going on in the world that it can draw you in, as a fantasy world. There are all sorts of odd buildings, and interactable objects. Exploration is one fun factor in the game (as there is Fog of War) and the graphics help tie in the feeling of exploration. Seeing the units in 3D during battle is always nice, and fun to watch (though if you have a slow-walking unit, try speeding up how fast your units move)(SOUND)  ""Great"" 4/5 - At first I was going to rate this a 3/5, but I realized that several of the songs in this game had gotten stuck in my head. Remembering that, it was a lot easier to rate this a 4/5. The Gameplay was addictive, and so is the music. Although it isn't anything over-the-top, or mind-blowing, it is still a fitting sound track. (ONLINE)  ""Sub-Par"" 2/5 - The games worst issue, by far. MMH VI has to be connected to the internet at all times to play the game. DRM-Stuff. This is a huge deterrant for most people, and thus have rated this section quite low. However on the flip side it has a great single player mode (which you still need to be connected to the internet to play) which you can setup your own matches against the NPC's and either destroy them, or be destroyed! It is a lot of fun learning tactics for certain maps, and for certain factions. (RE-PLAYABILITY) ""Superb"" 5/5 - This game is truly addictive. While I only have 40 hours in the game right now, it is because I haven't been able to re-install it and to get it working (with an issue others have had, a black screen) I haven't tried re-downloading and installing since I tried last. The game has a great sense of addictiveness to it. You earn new equipment to use on your Hero. Your hero gains new levels, and you can re-do it every match. You can play all sorts of different tactics, take your time or not, and generally, do what you want. (COST) ""Average"" 4/5 - This game costs either 30$ USD or 20$ USD (Depending on if you get the base game or Shades of Darkness) My review is based on Shades of Darkness. At 20$ USD, this is a steal of a game, as long as you don't mind staying connected to the internet. (OVERALL)- My personal rating for this game would likely be a 4/5. My average rating for this was a 3.5/5 or a 70%.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I've mixed feelings about this game. Ever since spending countless hours playing Heroes of Might and Magic III and it's expansions/mods years ago,  I've been a fan. I love a good turn-based tactical combat based game. In fact, it may be my favorite genre. A strong strategy of collecting resources, helpful items and building powerful kingdoms backed by a solid story, good character dialogue, with outstanding art and soundtrack all mixed together, it's my opinion there is no topping this genre of game. Might and Magic: Heroes VI though falls short of legendary status for many reasons. Many avenues of this series have been simplified such as the resources, additions like the caravan options from HoMM IV and NPC monsters on the map being able to attack you during their turn if you are too close are missing. The story is nothing that held my interest and the dialogue happening in the pop-up screens was pretty horrible in many instances, and the in-game cutscene graphics are pretty generic. I did enjoy the map art and the soundtrack was okay. The gameplay is decent, though at many times not challenging. I had to crank up the difficulty to hard for any real strategy. On normal it can be difficult in the first few levels, but once you amass some powers/items/armies it's pretty much a steamroll. I played through 3 of the campaigns and towards the end of the 3rd I was getting bored and just selecting auto-battle and having minimal to no losses. I did like the inclusion of dynasty weapons, dynasty traits and having to open further slots and options by playing more and earning the achievement points. Again, there wasn't much of a challenge to the achievements other than just playing long enough to rack up enough kills/battles won without losses/ etc. Uplay is another barrier. Online activation to continue your game, if you do need/have to be offline you have to play a game started in offline mode.  I don't like to open my steam purchased game in two menus. Not a deal breaker for me, but annoying and unnecessary.I doubt I'll go back and play another full campaign. Perhaps, a random map here and there. Overall, it's just okay. Nothing spectatular that a turn-based strategy lover must have, but a worthy buy if you come across for cheap. ",83,14,7,27,8,1,11

												It could just be that this is a bad entry in a good series or maybe I’m just not a Might and Magic fan but despite the amount of time I put in I don’t feel like I enjoyed it. The things that come back to me after not playing it for a while was the annoyance of having to be connected to the internet to play the game. Internet went out while you were playing? Too bad, you’ll have to continue your single player game later…Additionally, the game had a player progression system, a ‘Dynasty’, where you can collect heroes, weapons, and such. While nice the leveling was painfully slow, I never maxed out any of my weapons and you can see how many hours I put into it, which made it feel rather unrewarding.Lastly, I’ll just say that I personally don’t like over world strategy part of the game. The movement was annoying, especially since it’s best to keep all your troops in a single army so you’re prepared for anything. However, since there is almost never a single route an enemy army can sneak around and you’re hightailing it back to your cities to protect them before you have time to do the reverse. If you split up your army to cover your flank you don’t have enough troops to assault the enemy city.The combat was cool but half the time it was so highly dependent on pure numbers that it felt like if you lost a battle it wasn’t because you made a tactical error but that you should have managed your cities better and recruited more troops.

												The single player is fun, very classic ""HoMM3"" if you will.  The campaign is ok, a little dry, but the gameplay is fun.  If you like playing single player HoMM3, you will really like this game.  Now, multiplayer is a cluster-f.  Trying to connect to other games, chat channels, ect...is an impossible mission, fraught with danger, failure, and really strange errors.  Good luck trying that option, odds are, you won't.Ubisoft abandoned the title, offering no more support, regardless of these bugs, and you are going to use uPlay AND Steam...look, that is just dumb.  uPlay is clunky and redundant with Steam.Mixed review, but because I like the SP that much, yes that much, I barely recommended this game.

												If you are a fan of turn-based tactical games, then this is a great entry in the genre, and even a better entry in the M&M series than the others to date.  M&M: Heroes 5 managed to hold my interest for somewhere around 15 to 20 hours, while I have enjoyed this one for almost 250 hours at the time of writing this review.The game does become fairly repetitive after a while, but its repetitiveness was not enough to put me off the game.  I typically get somewhere between 30 minutes to 5 hours out of a game, while games that I particularly enjoy might go as high as 60 or 70.  There is usually only one games each year that will get me to put in more than 40 hours, let alone the time I have invested into this game.I do find the UPlay dependence a bit obnoxious, as it sometimes takes up to a minute to get past the ""Checking for UPlay Updates"" screen (this on the latest system w/ SSD, 32gb RAM, 100mbit internet connection, etc.)  I was also disconnected partway through a major battle due to UPlay going offline.  I found this part to be inexcusable - it had a connection, let it reassert itself when it can but don't kick me out of the game!			",1286,418,24,223,103,7,191

												If you've played Heroes III, IV, or V, know that this game is better. Yes, even better than Heroes III. Balace is well done, each faction has abilities that make them distinct and fun to play, and the combat strategy becomes more customizable thanks to the skill trees that you can fill as your heroes level up. Campaigns are extensive - each takes about 20 hours to complete (I've only made it through two), and there are about five in the base game.The only probem with this game lies with Ubisoft's ""Conflux,"" an always-on social application that you must be connected to in order to play. It isn't intrusive, but it does mean that you need an internet connection to play, and if your internet cuts out, the game boots you out - even if you're in the middle of a 15 minute castle seige - and you have to reload the last save when you reconnect. It's a ♥♥♥♥♥, but it's ony a problem if you have unreliable internet.			",107,18,0,41,7,0,16

												In every aspect this is a disappointment, and quite simply it shows that it is a money maker. There have been strained absolutely no muscles in the making of this game, and it's quite obviously the worst expression of the Heroes-series. This is utterly disappointing, and I am opting out of the Heroes-saga. Sadly so.The graphics.. well, according to the progress of the graphics from Heroes V to VI nothing happened at all between the makings of the two. This is by all means underachieving. 2/10			",28,0,0,6,2,1,1

												Wow. They don't tell you you need to go though something called Uplay to play this game, I thought when you purchased something it was, erm, yours to own? How odd then that they take your money, then you've got to sign up to another website to play the game. I suppose if the game were good the hassle would be worth it, but seeing as I've never seen Uplay actually work and have never been able to actually play a game through Uplay I can't tell if this one is any good. Another Steam con. It's why I never buy a full priced game and will only buy games at a couple of quid at most. I don't do thieves you see, and that's all this♥♥♥♥♥♥is, thievery.

												Personally I find this to be the best HoMM game since the 3rd, don't really get the bad rep it got which seems to be aimed mostly towards uplay rather than the game itself, it's a shame.Unlike HoMM 5 the maps aren't nearly as linear (which was my biggest issue with the 5th entry)Neither have I run into too many bugs other than the camera-bug which makes me unable to look around with my mouse and having to nagivate with the arrow-keys instead (only a reboot seems to fix this from my experience) but fortunately it doesn't occure too often. Unlike the 3rd one you don't have the whole RNG randomness of skills whenever a hero lvls up, instead you get this RPG-esque option to put out talent points into either Magic or Might. The balance doesn't seem to be all there neither, might is a far superior choice over magic from what i've seen and the factions seems to be a bit unbalanced as well. There are less resources to think about, etc. You can also not steal mines in the same way you could previously since they are all connected to the owner of the nearby town so it's a bit less micro-heavy than previously as well. For some this might be a big issue.While the overarching story might not be anything amazing (neither was any of the previous installment's stories) I still enjoyed the campaign a great deal, playing from the different perspectives of Duke Slava's children, one for each faction.And honestly if you are into the story that much I'd recommend going for the Might & Magic series instead.All in all, It's a fun game if you can look past the whole double-DRM thing and some changed core features such as less resources and how the whole territory-war works.

												i've written a review for this game before you'll notice i dont have very many hours played on this game. here's the thing it requires uplay to play. i know it says that on the store page but i missed it. anyway that's why i dont have a lot of hours played on this marked on my steam account. now before you think i'm just a hater you should know i own every single heroes of might and magic game (yes including heroes of might and magic 1, where the black dragons were actually purple) as well as all of the expansions up to right before 6.i'm going to keep this short and then i'll have the long list after it all. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME. PERIOD. as a heroes of might and magic game it's ok, but this game is ABSOLUTELY UNDESERVING of your money. the bugs in this game are absolutely insane and numerous. i'll post a list from another forum at the end of this review but good god you have no idea how♥♥♥♥♥♥it is. if you think the bugs have been fixed since this game is a few years old NOPE they haven't. ubisoft announced that they were no longer patching homm 6, and as off that final patch nearly all of the bugs on this list still exist.i'm not going to get into why i hate the whole uplay always online ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t i listed off reasons why it's ♥♥♥♥ing♥♥♥♥♥♥in my other review of this game. but i've gotten past that i tried to give this game another shot while ignoring my hatred of that uplay ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t and i find that i have to maintaint he boycott i've held since i first bought homm 6. i'm never ever buying another ubisoft game ever again. their customer service is♥♥♥♥♥♥ i mean damn near comcast♥♥♥♥♥♥ my uplay account was fairly inactive for about a year i went back to try this game again and suddenly this game doesn't show up in my games library in uplay anymore. ok no problem i'll resubmit the cd-key that steam gave me. uplay tells me hey that cd key is being used by another account. so i contact their customer support it took 3 weeks of back and forth to figure out that at some point uplay had a big update and somehow the email for my account has a typo in it's address instead of (myemail)@whatever.com a copy of my account at (myemail)@whatever.com was made except the copy was .comm with 2 m's. so i couldn't retrieve the password for that account or even change the password for it since whenever you try to do anything it sends an email to get it done. except no email exists where the .com has 2 mm's. the useless customer support couldn't fix it for weeks until they decided to just change the email on the cloned account and i had to get a new email attached to that account. so now all of my previous achievements games, rewards that i earned in hmm6 for my old uplay account isn't transferred over to my new one. nice.anyway that's my not so short experience with ubisoft CS and homm 6. now for the list of bugs some of these are minor inconviences, they range from crashes, that happen if you take too long a map (except it's not really that long, you basically have to rush the map or the game will perma crash on an exact game date), all the way to your hero being permanently fubared by having his magic power of a specific school reduced to 1, permanently no fix at all.""- unequip any staff with a magic school affinity before you either save your game, or end your turn. otherwise, when you reload/start a new turn, it will PERMANENTLY SUBTRACT 5 points from your effective magic power for every day you leave it equipped. This is hidden; you won't see it in your stats sheet when you look at your magic power, but you WILL see it in how much damage your magic troops do, and how much damage your spells do (also affects summoning!). ruined two characters like that, and had to restart an entire campaign to fix it- In the 4th map of the stronghold campaign, in the first week, Airini's earth elemental spell produces fewer elementals when cast each successive day. So, on the first day it was 22, the second, 16, the third 12, 4th 9, 5th 6! Restarting the mission without using Batu's Totem does not result in the strange gradual reduction of earth skills. Conclusion: BATU'S TOTEM IS BUGGED- occasional bug: if you unequip and re-equip a set-artifact then the set-bonus stacks up- In the barbarian campain on map 2 it gets to month two and mid week the game crashes (solution: finish map quickly!)- It looks as though luck with Infernal is really bugged; almost like they take on the reverse of whatever luck they should have.When I am not playing Inferno, and I have a combat against inferno neutrals, they act with the value of luck MY troops have, not based on the luck value in their descriptions. When I play WITH inferno against other neutrals, my Inferno troops take on the luck value of the NEUTRALS, and are not anywhere close to the luck value stated in their description. When playing inferno, the description often shows me values of luck over 60% for my troops, yet if I am facing a group of neutrals with luck values of say, 7%, then that is what my troops will act with - I have measured this over 100 combats now. Interestingly, this does NOT apply when I am facing off against an enemy hero, in those battles, regardless of faction, luck values work normally.-Pathfinding skill is still broken (actually adds movement PENALTY, instead of bonus on hard terrain!). I assume it was fixed for the normal campaigns, but not the expansions?--improving scouting levels does not improve scouting range to any apparent extent.- Souldrinker's Lifeforce (or whatever it's called, gives +3% to health) works for both sides (not only for weapon holder, but also for his opponents).- ""Anathema"" (blood skill -haven might) instead of LOWERING enemy damage, actually RAISES it.- Set a game with ""Aggressive AI"", for example. Save the game and when you load it again, the difficulty is ""normal"" instead of ""custom"".- Sometimes, for no apparent reason, heroes simply stop earning reputation points.- bonuses from visiting weekly shrines are often lost on reloading a saved game- Buffs after wait command: general weird behavior - buffs expire differently in some cases, like buff->action won't have the same result as wait->buff->action. Especially annoying with guardian angel- Hourglass of Asha (special of Nec town) gave a -15 ini penalty to both teams, in field battle in AoC. Should be: neither. only in siege defense should it work!- On map wasting grounds decreases health and damage not for all enemy creatures, but also for yours too, if they're not undead. Do not know about city version - need to check it.- Inferno campaign, map 2: Increasing magic power levels does not increase damage for magic-damage based troops, nor does it increase damage for spells (possible solution: it seems unlikely, but this is also the only campaign I chose to start with the dynasty trait ""fanatic"")- - Cleave+morale+wait: if stack gets morale bonus, and with the second action gets a kill that activates cleave, then issuing the wait command will give the stack 2 more actions afterwards (total 4 actions in 1 turn: regular->half power->regular->regular. Not sure about if last one being regular, only happened few times. Maybe it's half power too). So in this case wait gives one extra move.- The Azkaal Inferno fight became impossible thanks to what I assume are bugs. First, Mark of Consumption doesn't actually increase ensuing fire damage. Second, the Ill Blood (frenzy) move doesn't work on enemies that are not adjacent to anyone (in the past, this would keep the enemy from moving for 2 turns). As a result, the fight went from insanely difficult to literally impossible.- Necromancy II does not work in Necro Campaign. This bug appears after every battle in the arena (for example, near the 2nd city on the 1st campaign map) by default necro hero (Anastasia).- To use the faction trait in a campaign, you have to have it selected from the start of the campaign. it doesn't work to add it after you have c			",50,11,0,12,5,0,11

												A fun, intuitive and challenging game, Heroes VI is my favourite in the series. The graphics are BEAUTIFUL and the real-time battle models look astounding. Battles are a mix of complicated turn-based, chess-like gameplay, with interesting, game-changing abilities. The maps are fun to explore and are filled with treasure and plenty of monsters to fight. One thing worth noting is the difficulty of the campaigns. The AI are smart and aggresive. So if you are are a fan of being  able to say, ""I've finished this game, good luck at doing it yourself"", then you will really enjoy this. Heroes VI is also great fun to play against friends. It features a hot-seat gametype which can be tedious if you don't like waiting for your slow friend, though the AI in Custom Game will be a worthy, oppenent in an actual player's stead. So, if you are a fan of expansive, challenging strategy games or enjoyed the other games in this series, this should be an memorable experience.			",59,10,3,13,13,1,9

												The game itself is great, BUT: It crashes very often (black screen / crash to desktop) when entering a city screen. This is a common issue that is well known by many players. However, Ubisoft shows no interest in this problem - there is still no patch that fixes it. Too bad, because without these frequent crashes, the game would be great. But as it is, it's quite unplayable and not worth buying.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

I bought the game when it first came out and gave up after the forced use of Origin caused all the issues originally. I hoped that buying the game through Steam would solve all those issues and that it would just generally integrate better but that is not the case.  The Conflux drops randomly and your saves get ♥♥♥♥ed up, and you can play offline but you miss out on a lot of the additional stuff.  Don't even bother with multiplayer, it's ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t.

Upon installing the upgrade, Steam/Ubosoft erased all of my dynasty weapons and perks that took me forever to build up.  I figured , no problem - I will play through the campaigns again.  I put the CD keys in for, and have access to the expansions, but the main campaign is greyed out.  I try to input my CD key to unlock, and Ubisof informs me that my key is already assigned to a different user.  That is some BS from Ubisoft			",42,14,0,17,4,1,12

You have to take heroes from shop to play them.And the biggest problem was that there are few factions to play (6 with expansion). I have heard that there are no plans to make new expansion so there is only small chance that new faction will be added to game.I prefer heroes V and III to VI.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												While this game has one of the best concepts for gameplay I have seen, it is all put to waste when you encounter a terrible graphical glitch which instantly sets the game's gamma so low that you can no longer see what you are doing on the map. Increasing this option in the menu does not fix this problem. Until this major glitch, along with other glitches that many people have seen, are fixed, it is best to avoid this game.

												Where to begin?  Wierdly, I feel let down by this game.  That's even taking into consideration I picked this game up in the sale for 7.99 because at this moment that feels like about 7.99 more than I should have paid.Firstly, you need to open the game UPlayer - which doesnt work and will come up saying ""uplay uplayer has stopped"" everytime unless you run as an admin from outside steam - which then opens the game through Steam requiring both Steam and UPlayer to be open simultaneously to run the game which is a complete FARSE.Secondly, having played previous HoMM titles I wasn't expecting the wheel to be reinvented - in fact I bought the game specifically to quench my thirst for turn based fantasy.  I then go into the game open up the custom game option and find that you can't even so much as change your faction without going through the games dynasty system ( a system basically set up to milk cash out of online play) and nor can you change the faction of AI players at all.  This is in ""custom"" games.  After realising this I went back to the menu and the more I looked at the game and it's features the more I felt that it didn't look like a game anymore, it looked like a F2P app with in game purchases.  Don't buy this game.  Not even if it's on sale. ",27,4,1,13,6,0,26

												Disclaimer: I have only played the single-player portion of the game.  Recaptures the feel and subtle complexity of the original Heroes game while adding larger tactical combat maps, additional inventory options, zones of control and swapable buildings in the cities.  The biggest weakness is the game's interface which can seem a bit awkward.  Overall, I'd recommend it, especially on sale.  Beware, however, as the game uses (and requires the installation of) Uplay, Ubisoft's DRM system.			",282,71,1,55,18,0,40

												Can't go through the 2nd mission on normal difficulty - OP opponent always has such a bigger army which don't give me any chances to beat him. Even if I won't visit any side neutral camps I will not beat him just cause of there is no way to increase your army, you can only buy 50 units per week. The game provides you idiotical experiance not to discover a map. I wasted 11 hours on this but I have no idea how to use magic how to buy extra troops etc. I don't know why there is so different plenty of resourses if you can't spend em on anything. Just a waste of time.Ive never player any other Heroes games but my friends who did it told me that in all games you can buy as many units as your resources allow you. Seems like Ive done a big mistake when bought this♥♥♥♥♥♥Btw if you want to play you must install Uplay and make an account in CONFLUX. That means 2 senseless registrations is indeed.

												I'm writting this after playing foor 10hrs straight. I played all of the Heroes games ever made (including the expansions) and I can safely state that this is now absolutely my new favourite one.Some people complain that the game is buggy, but I've yet to encounter anything like that. The game runs great.On the same note, the landscapes are breathtaking and the Art direction for the creatures and characters is truely original (as far as Heroes games go). Heroes skill sytem is complex and rewarding and the storyline is interesting enough to not be dismissed as ""generic"".I don't know what else to say, if you're a diehard Heroes fan like myself, don't listen to anyone else, give it a chance. I'm really happy I did! ",119,56,1,22,6,0,18

												Well, Heroes 6 are far from being a good game, but it's not like they're that bad. As a big fan of the series I would place it above H4 for sure. It's hard to make it worse than 4th part. There is no Elves, no Mages, even that puny Elementals (I mean the castles) for me, it's a big flaw. This whole Dynasty thing, ok, it can be, I don't really mind. Not so many maps, even if we take these made by players. Of course Uplay is an issue, same as that Conflux thing. Generally it is still fun to spend couple of hours with Heroes but it's not the same any more, that game have lost it's magic. But i still would recomend it, just wait for good discount.

												A good game in a great franchise ruined by a bad company.  You can see that I have a lot of hours logged into this game.  What you don't see is that a tremendous number of those hours are idle; I simply refused to log out because I thoroughly distrusted uPlay to the point of not believing I would ever be able to log back in if I logged out.  Previous experience justified that fear.  Subsequent experience validated it.  I finally had to reboot my machine.  Once again, I cannot get into the game because of uPlay.  The latest ""update"" to uPlay upgraded my experience by once again denying it to me entirely--as in, where I once could log on, I no longer can.When I was in the game, I was able to get through the first campaign and part of the second.  The game is a respectable member of the HOMM franchise but nothing truly revolutionary (the primary new element, dynasty weapons, is a good concept and I hope that it appears again, but it isn't exactly series-defining), and there are definite power balance issues among the factions.  Fortunately for beginners, you start playing the easiest (most powerful) faction (Necropolis), but the balance issues could be serious in multiplayer with random factions.The bottom line is simple: Not only do I not recommend this game for as long as uPlay exists, but I personally will not buy another Ubisoft title of any kind until they abandon or dramatically reform that system.  There are many excellent publishers out there that treat their customers with more respect, or failing that, if they force you to use proprietary portals, at least they function.			",30,3,0,9,4,0,8

												A horrid disappointment.  I loved the older Heroes of Might and Magic games.  They provided a good mix of RPG and strategy and were fairly well balanced.  This game does not meet the expectations is predecessors provide.  The balance is perhaps the worst offender, being completely tossed out the window.  With the slightest difference in how you play, the experience can be either an utter cake-walk or an impossible death march.  All aspects of the RPG and Strategy sides of the game are severely diminished compared to its predecessors too, resulting in a very shallow, un-fun experience.			",133,55,2,48,7,0,16

You have to take heroes from shop to play them.And the biggest problem was that there are few factions to play (6 with expansion). I have heard that there are no plans to make new expansion so there is only small chance that new faction will be added to game.I prefer heroes V and III to VI.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Where to begin?  Wierdly, I feel let down by this game.  That's even taking into consideration I picked this game up in the sale for 7.99 because at this moment that feels like about 7.99 more than I should have paid.Firstly, you need to open the game UPlayer - which doesnt work and will come up saying ""uplay uplayer has stopped"" everytime unless you run as an admin from outside steam - which then opens the game through Steam requiring both Steam and UPlayer to be open simultaneously to run the game which is a complete FARSE.Secondly, having played previous HoMM titles I wasn't expecting the wheel to be reinvented - in fact I bought the game specifically to quench my thirst for turn based fantasy.  I then go into the game open up the custom game option and find that you can't even so much as change your faction without going through the games dynasty system ( a system basically set up to milk cash out of online play) and nor can you change the faction of AI players at all.  This is in ""custom"" games.  After realising this I went back to the menu and the more I looked at the game and it's features the more I felt that it didn't look like a game anymore, it looked like a F2P app with in game purchases.  Don't buy this game.  Not even if it's on sale. ",27,4,1,13,6,0,26

The originality in the art style is certainly there, while it is a classic fantasy, it still feels like a fresh apporach to a long loved genre.As for the gameplay: While I honestly have no idea what I am doing, I am enjoying the combat system. Town managment has depth but is not overwealming. Map exploration feels very rewarding. I feel that the AI could be a little better and I really wish that I didn't have to deal with Uplay in order to play this game. But other than that I would reccomend this if you are a fan of RPG/Strategy games.			",108,22,0,27,11,0,27

												A good game in a great franchise ruined by a bad company.  You can see that I have a lot of hours logged into this game.  What you don't see is that a tremendous number of those hours are idle; I simply refused to log out because I thoroughly distrusted uPlay to the point of not believing I would ever be able to log back in if I logged out.  Previous experience justified that fear.  Subsequent experience validated it.  I finally had to reboot my machine.  Once again, I cannot get into the game because of uPlay.  The latest ""update"" to uPlay upgraded my experience by once again denying it to me entirely--as in, where I once could log on, I no longer can.When I was in the game, I was able to get through the first campaign and part of the second.  The game is a respectable member of the HOMM franchise but nothing truly revolutionary (the primary new element, dynasty weapons, is a good concept and I hope that it appears again, but it isn't exactly series-defining), and there are definite power balance issues among the factions.  Fortunately for beginners, you start playing the easiest (most powerful) faction (Necropolis), but the balance issues could be serious in multiplayer with random factions.The bottom line is simple: Not only do I not recommend this game for as long as uPlay exists, but I personally will not buy another Ubisoft title of any kind until they abandon or dramatically reform that system.  There are many excellent publishers out there that treat their customers with more respect, or failing that, if they force you to use proprietary portals, at least they function.			",30,3,0,9,4,0,8

												A horrid disappointment.  I loved the older Heroes of Might and Magic games.  They provided a good mix of RPG and strategy and were fairly well balanced.  This game does not meet the expectations is predecessors provide.  The balance is perhaps the worst offender, being completely tossed out the window.  With the slightest difference in how you play, the experience can be either an utter cake-walk or an impossible death march.  All aspects of the RPG and Strategy sides of the game are severely diminished compared to its predecessors too, resulting in a very shallow, un-fun experience.			",133,55,2,48,7,0,16

												A fun, intuitive and challenging game, Heroes VI is my favourite in the series. The graphics are BEAUTIFUL and the real-time battle models look astounding. Battles are a mix of complicated turn-based, chess-like gameplay, with interesting, game-changing abilities. The maps are fun to explore and are filled with treasure and plenty of monsters to fight. One thing worth noting is the difficulty of the campaigns. The AI are smart and aggresive. So if you are are a fan of being  able to say, ""I've finished this game, good luck at doing it yourself"", then you will really enjoy this. Heroes VI is also great fun to play against friends. It features a hot-seat gametype which can be tedious if you don't like waiting for your slow friend, though the AI in Custom Game will be a worthy, oppenent in an actual player's stead. So, if you are a fan of expansive, challenging strategy games or enjoyed the other games in this series, this should be an memorable experience.			",59,10,3,13,13,1,9

												For starters, if you are like me a genuine HOMM fan. Stay away from this nightmare.I've been playing the HOMM for as long as I can remember.And this game truly is a let down.The story is thin and is lacking any kind of depth that would make the player intrigued to advance further into the campaign.The selection of factions and interesting creatures are slim. Thou they've added a completely new faction. Which is on the upside, but it does not counter the negative aspects of the others.The heroes themself have somekind of RPGish levling, which is to me just confusing.Balance of the game is all roody poo, I can't put my finger on it. And neither can the devs, or so it seems.All creatures has way too many perks and active effects it's all just a big mess.It's like the devs have gone tryhard on this game, making it as complicated and frustrating as possible.Oh, and you need to be online at all time during your session and connected to Ubisoft's Conflux service. If you happen to go offline while playing, all your progress is lost. Neat, right?If you happen to be new to the HOMM series you might actually like this game, since it has some good points as well.I'm not the one to tell them, there's plenty of positive rewievs for that.But as an old HOMM player, I'd suggest you stick with either HOMM 3 or 5.

You have to take heroes from shop to play them.And the biggest problem was that there are few factions to play (6 with expansion). I have heard that there are no plans to make new expansion so there is only small chance that new faction will be added to game.I prefer heroes V and III to VI.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Where to begin?  Wierdly, I feel let down by this game.  That's even taking into consideration I picked this game up in the sale for 7.99 because at this moment that feels like about 7.99 more than I should have paid.Firstly, you need to open the game UPlayer - which doesnt work and will come up saying ""uplay uplayer has stopped"" everytime unless you run as an admin from outside steam - which then opens the game through Steam requiring both Steam and UPlayer to be open simultaneously to run the game which is a complete FARSE.Secondly, having played previous HoMM titles I wasn't expecting the wheel to be reinvented - in fact I bought the game specifically to quench my thirst for turn based fantasy.  I then go into the game open up the custom game option and find that you can't even so much as change your faction without going through the games dynasty system ( a system basically set up to milk cash out of online play) and nor can you change the faction of AI players at all.  This is in ""custom"" games.  After realising this I went back to the menu and the more I looked at the game and it's features the more I felt that it didn't look like a game anymore, it looked like a F2P app with in game purchases.  Don't buy this game.  Not even if it's on sale. ",27,4,1,13,6,0,26

I suppose if the game were good the hassle would be worth it, but seeing as I've never seen Uplay actually work and have never been able to actually play a game through Uplay I can't tell if this one is any good.

												Though I've not played anywhere NEAR as much as the time logged indicates, I will say - I have tried to like this game.  But, it's AI basically amounts to building armies at 3-4 times your rate.  Even on easy.  They aren't brilliant (I watched the last orc attacking my city, who was alrwady INSIDE the city, turn and attack the wall leading in).  They're just overtly numerous.  2-3 heroes with armies bigger than your main army can muster (again, even on easy for the Haven campaign) will be constantly on the attack, and in your zone.It's sad, because I've come back TRYING to like this game.  I'm not a Heroes III fanatic, in fact I didn't even play it.  But though I DID like Heroes V, I didn't judge this against it.  I'm merely saying an unfinished game at release was obviously glossed over as 'completed' by simply letting an ignorant AI outnumber you to your death.  I don't recommend.			",20,10,0,20,3,1,12

												Personally I find this to be the best HoMM game since the 3rd, don't really get the bad rep it got which seems to be aimed mostly towards uplay rather than the game itself, it's a shame.Unlike HoMM 5 the maps aren't nearly as linear (which was my biggest issue with the 5th entry)Neither have I run into too many bugs other than the camera-bug which makes me unable to look around with my mouse and having to nagivate with the arrow-keys instead (only a reboot seems to fix this from my experience) but fortunately it doesn't occure too often. Unlike the 3rd one you don't have the whole RNG randomness of skills whenever a hero lvls up, instead you get this RPG-esque option to put out talent points into either Magic or Might. The balance doesn't seem to be all there neither, might is a far superior choice over magic from what i've seen and the factions seems to be a bit unbalanced as well. There are less resources to think about, etc. You can also not steal mines in the same way you could previously since they are all connected to the owner of the nearby town so it's a bit less micro-heavy than previously as well. For some this might be a big issue.While the overarching story might not be anything amazing (neither was any of the previous installment's stories) I still enjoyed the campaign a great deal, playing from the different perspectives of Duke Slava's children, one for each faction.And honestly if you are into the story that much I'd recommend going for the Might & Magic series instead.All in all, It's a fun game if you can look past the whole double-DRM thing and some changed core features such as less resources and how the whole territory-war works.

												Wow. They don't tell you you need to go though something called Uplay to play this game, I thought when you purchased something it was, erm, yours to own? How odd then that they take your money, then you've got to sign up to another website to play the game. I suppose if the game were good the hassle would be worth it, but seeing as I've never seen Uplay actually work and have never been able to actually play a game through Uplay I can't tell if this one is any good. Another Steam con. It's why I never buy a full priced game and will only buy games at a couple of quid at most. I don't do thieves you see, and that's all this♥♥♥♥♥♥is, thievery.

												Personally I find this to be the best HoMM game since the 3rd, don't really get the bad rep it got which seems to be aimed mostly towards uplay rather than the game itself, it's a shame.Unlike HoMM 5 the maps aren't nearly as linear (which was my biggest issue with the 5th entry)Neither have I run into too many bugs other than the camera-bug which makes me unable to look around with my mouse and having to nagivate with the arrow-keys instead (only a reboot seems to fix this from my experience) but fortunately it doesn't occure too often. Unlike the 3rd one you don't have the whole RNG randomness of skills whenever a hero lvls up, instead you get this RPG-esque option to put out talent points into either Magic or Might. The balance doesn't seem to be all there neither, might is a far superior choice over magic from what i've seen and the factions seems to be a bit unbalanced as well. There are less resources to think about, etc. You can also not steal mines in the same way you could previously since they are all connected to the owner of the nearby town so it's a bit less micro-heavy than previously as well. For some this might be a big issue.While the overarching story might not be anything amazing (neither was any of the previous installment's stories) I still enjoyed the campaign a great deal, playing from the different perspectives of Duke Slava's children, one for each faction.And honestly if you are into the story that much I'd recommend going for the Might & Magic series instead.All in all, It's a fun game if you can look past the whole double-DRM thing and some changed core features such as less resources and how the whole territory-war works.

												Though I've not played anywhere NEAR as much as the time logged indicates, I will say - I have tried to like this game.  But, it's AI basically amounts to building armies at 3-4 times your rate.  Even on easy.  They aren't brilliant (I watched the last orc attacking my city, who was alrwady INSIDE the city, turn and attack the wall leading in).  They're just overtly numerous.  2-3 heroes with armies bigger than your main army can muster (again, even on easy for the Haven campaign) will be constantly on the attack, and in your zone.It's sad, because I've come back TRYING to like this game.  I'm not a Heroes III fanatic, in fact I didn't even play it.  But though I DID like Heroes V, I didn't judge this against it.  I'm merely saying an unfinished game at release was obviously glossed over as 'completed' by simply letting an ignorant AI outnumber you to your death.  I don't recommend.			",20,10,0,20,3,1,12

												My only complaint is that all the maps are pregenerated - you can't generate random maps.The gameplay is a balancing act of economy building which is pretty subtle.  I lost an easy map 3 times before figuring out a way that worked (and even then I might have just gotten lucky).The music is excellent - which means a lot coming from me.  I'm very picky about music.Also the artwork is very well done and nice to come back to.This is not a TBS like Civilization, because the maps are very linear and sort of contrived.  You can't build as many cities as you want - everything is fixed on the maps.  But it's still FUN and really artful and some of the artwork is so good I'll forget about the game for months and then an image pops up in my head and I want to play this again.The tactics are interesting because some units take up more than a single square - like 2x2.  In those cases you can set up shielding formations to protect your most important units, maybe other cases too.Yes buy it.Also... as far as Uplay goes... yes it's a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥ but so is Steam.  It's just another platform and this is just the way developers do marketting.  I don't care.  I can still get to the gameplay and I enjoy it once I get there.  That's all I care about.  Uplay IS a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥though - they want to suggest 2-step verification.  Guess what Uplay - this is a ♥♥♥♥ing game not a bank account I don't give a ♥♥♥♥ about your stupide 2-step verification ideas!			",40,9,2,27,29,1,32

												FROM A HoM&M AVID PLAYER: AVOID AT ALL COSTSEvery month there is a problem with connecting to the server: once it's an ubisoft update, another time the maintenance works which always take more time than scheduled, other times it just keeps disconnecting for unknown reasons, today it's a bad uplay update ( uplay has caused a lot of problems so far) etc... the end result is that you can't play this game decently!  I'm still of the ( maybe old fashioned??) idea that if you pay good money for a game you have the right to play when you want and as much as you want. The number of times I couldn't play with this game and the way Ubisoft keeps on failing by giving very little or no customer support only points to one conclusion: DON'T BUY this piece of junk.I've played and enjoyed all the Heroes of Might and Magic and I'm completely disappointed with Ubisoft because it has completely ruined the franchise both by pairing with Uplay and by making the content of the game only available when connected to the game server (conflux). As curious as I was about HoM&M VII I won't buy it. If you want to enjoy this franchise go back, play the V, IV, III and II, but don't buy this and the following one at these absurd conditions, where you can only  play every other week and with Ubisoft replying to your submitted ticket 1 month later, when the old issue is resolved and a new one has just arisen.

Probably the Best ""Heroes"" since HMM III.PreambleBeing a massive fan of HMMIII, and having played all the following games in the series (Except M&M: HVII) I would rather warmly recommend M&M:HVI.While the game was first plagued by game breaking issues courtesy of Ubisoft's dodgy DRM, numerous bugs, and a lack of Town screen which caused an uproar when the game first released, these problems were eventually addressed. I think a lot of the negative reviews date back to the olden days of 2011 In my infinite wisdom, I only bought the game a year or so after it released, and my experience was only slightly mired by the innate DRM and Conflux systems. I've not played all the DLC content available today for M&M:HVI, only Shades of Darkness (SoD), so this is the scope of this review.  The GoodThe campaigns are interesting overall, with some of them really shining as possibly the best campaigns  in the entire series. This is particularly true for the SoD extension which was thoroughly enjoyable in my opinion. I liked as well that the main heroes in campaigns are related to the other heroes by an overarching story frame, which - to boot - allows you to play the campaigns in pretty much any order. The game also includes the ""Dynasty system"" allowing you to unlock Heroes and additional bonuses that can then be used in multiplayer and other modes, as well as weapons and pets for your campaign Heroes.Last but not least, also included is a Karma system of sorts which, through your choices and actions, allows to you to gear your main Heroes towards super-good or mega-evil, thus gaining equally good or evil superpowers. This is a tiered system, which at first provides small but useful advantages, but by the time you reach the last scenario in a campaign will give your Hero some massive bonuses. This adds another level of customization to your heroes and provides some replay value for the campaigns. The profusion of ways in which your Heroes can be tweaked, upgraded and customized will give the min-maxers a great time. Graphics and audio are pretty good, though some of the voice acting can be a bit off-putting at times, but overall the presentation is pretty good. The gameplay, exploration, city management, kingdom building, hero development are all very enjoyable. The battle system while being very classic is also very enjoyable thanks to a clear interface, nice graphics and animations (which after a few hours you will certainly want to speed up !)The BadOn the downside, you have to bear with an ""AI"", which at times is so obviously scripted that it becomes a bit of an immersion breaker. (Hello Inferno campaign!). The Truly EvilAh! UBISOFT darling when will you understand that such heavy handed DRM only affects the people who actually purchase your games? We're not in 1990 anymore when everyone was burning ""backup"" copies of games and ""lending"" them to our friends! We have the internet and we have smarts! We can download in a few mere minutes DRM-free versions of your games and enjoy their content without your annoying, crippling, absurd and utterly pointless DRM!To the point, Uplay, the DRM, should really be called Udontplay, because frankly it can be pretty hard to get the game to start after installing it. Thankfully in most cases you will find the solution in this here forum or on the web.ConclusionLastly, once you are past the DRM Gates of Hell, Heroes VI, offers great gameplay and a huge amount of content to play through, even more so nowadays with all DLCs available. Overall, with 313 hours on my counter, I must say I have very much enjoyed Heroes VI + SoD, more so than any other since the days of HMMIII. (Excluding Heroes VII- which, in my still infinite wisdom, I will not buy before Ubi gets their game together so to speak.)			",42,14,0,21,10,0,17

												I don't understand all of the negative reviews of this game. It isn't on par with, say, MM3 but it is a very fun and addictive game as well with it's own unique charm. The graphics are great, the gameplay is tweaked but maintains the classic Heroes vibe. All the DLC is a bit of a turn off and the lack of custom map making is a step backwards but overall it is a good addition to the universe.A lot of people complain about Uplay but I have not experienced any of these problems. Perhaps the complaints are outdated? I can play online without issue, Uplay functions perfectly. I have had one instance of a game crash but that was after hours of play and enabling the daily save feature makes it so that the odd crash really isn't much of an issue.  ",162,56,0,46,45,0,71

												I just finished the HoMM V after playing it for the first time this weekend.And loved the game so much I bought the Hammers of Fate expansion as well as HoMM VI and also started playing HoMM Online as well.Way back in 2002 I had purchased what I believe was HoMM IV, my first HoMM game and I recall within minutes not liking it, deleting it and for the next 13 years avoiding all HoMM titles.GEEEEEEZZZZZ, what was I thinking!?!On a whim, I played Kings Bounty for the first time last Friday, ""KB: Legend""...I loved it !And also was happy to find out that HoMM and KB are related.This got me thinking to give HoMM a 2nd chance, so I bought HoMM V and OMG I love it!I could not stop playing it!Although, I finished it, I still have Hammer of Fate to play.But, that could not stop me from wanting to try HoMM VI with its upgraded graphics.My initial hesitation on Steam to return to HoMM games was due to mixed reviews regarding the versions of HoMM that require the infamous ""UPlay"".But, being a techie I was determined to not let UPlay ruin my fun.Despite, not being able to play HoMM VI due to a UPlay error, that caused me to RAGE, I was able to get it to run with the help of our Steam forum members.As a result, I LOVE HoMM VI as well!1) Updated graphics2) Beautiful Sound Track3) Plays just like HoMM V, but with some changes that others complained about, but I do not mind.My only complaints thus far is that the voice acting is not as good as HoMM V, the Orc sounds downright cheesey. And of course the cinstant connection, Conflux and UPlay all adding to disk usage and duplicating Steam.if you never played a HoMM game before, let me tell you that the game design is very uniquer and fun and is being imitated by other games.For me, the allure is the way the game switches from strategic view to tactical view where the battles are fought.Loving it			",60,5,0,23,7,0,27

												NOPEJust... no.What a flaming pile of dung. After spending way too many of my precious and limited ""free time"" trying to diagnose and correct an intrinsic connection issue with the game, it depends too heavily on the Ubisoft ""UPLAY"" (more like UCANNOTPLAY) software to function. Since this is a game I bought on Steam, it appears that the two launchers just are not compatible. I could spend several more hours and probably get it to work, but why bother? I have enough OTHER games to play that this isn't worth my time - nor is it worth anyone else's, either.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Do not buy this game.My PC is an i7, 3GHz, 24GB of ram and a GeForce 960 1GB video adapterPlaying on high graphics settings is not possible as I never get 30fps. Then I tried low graphics and I get 70fps, except every time I move my hero it goes down to 20fps.I am able to play games like Shadow of Mordor on full graphics without a glitch. How is that possible??The DRM is terrible, having to install UPlay and be always online is outrageous.Loading times are very long.Sometimes textures are missing from the game and I can see the checkered placeholder instead.I am a big fan of the Heroes franchise but what Ubisoft has done here is at best a wannabe that should be forgotten.The 20 hours I have on record are already too many for what this game deservesI would be ashamed of releasing anything like this as an indie/garage developer.On top of that it has been 5 years and every couple of years I come back to the game hoping for a patch that would make it playable. Instead they release and charge for 2 more expansions of the same crap.I guess I'm giving up. I'll uninstall it finally and will probably not buy the next one either, because to me this feels like a scam.			",426,104,28,82,87,5,110

Is this a direct result of Console Peasents buying more PCs, or is the Master Race not as L33t as they assumed?What can I say though? Better than V in every way, with Blackhole getting very close to mirroring the original feel and mechanics that made this series great. Is this III or IV worthy? Hardly... But it's a start in the right direction, and Hot Seat and MP is as memoriable as ever. Story is meh, but such is the way of HoMM. Hours of fun ... if you know where to spend those hours.

												Very good game.Pros: 1) Nice graphics and beautiful environment 2) Engaging gameplay after a few hours of adaptation 3) Ability to convert cities of other fractions 4) Well made animation of units and spells (exept might hero basic attack) 5) New skill distribution system, which allows you to build your hero the exact way you want him 6) Interesting blood/tears reputation abilities  7) Dynasty weapons and perks 8) Music 9) Overall creature growth and hire - very usefulCons: 1) Cities. Awful cities as before as after the patch 2) Sometimes inappropriate units' voices 3) Somewhat lazy made storyline in main campaingsI recommend this game to every heroes series' fan (exept those who like thirds and thirds only) and to everyone who likes strategies. If you've played thirds' fourths and fifths at least try to give this game a chance. I too was very angry at developers at first for their innovations, but after a few days i understood that this game is good, despite all negative sides (Cities). Looking back now, i regret that i didn't bought this game before, when Blackhole studios (original developers) still existed.			",24,6,0,16,0,0,6

I've experienced crashes when trying to play this game at other times, as well.

AI never fights you in open field unless they're sure to win. Basically entire game lasts hours, most of time just playing against creeps. The skills in this system are so lame and boring.

												The only gripe I people seem to have with this game is its use of Uplay. Frankly, I've never had problems with Uplay, and a second layer of DRM on top of Steam (which is DRM in itself, we must all remember) does not bother me. When it comes to the game itself, I greatly enjoy it; a breath of fresh air into the HoMM series, which since Heroes III, has been based on the same formula which quite frankly has been getting somewhat stale. The amalgamation of all the tedious resources into one, crystals is, in my opinion, a good idea. Whilst it simplifies the game, the introduction of the region system means it would be very tedious to capture all of the resource production buildings, even more so than in HoMM III & V. The graphics, even now, as I write this in 2015, are gorgeous. The creature design in this game is the best it has been in the series. The units are original and the art direction in general is great.Similarly the introduction of deeper RPG elements makes the game more interesting and helps the player invest themselves into the world. What can I say, I like this game.			",98,4,3,20,27,0,36

The various forums have lots of workarounds, but it seems to be potluck which if any of these work for a given system. Ubisoft shouldn't have released this game on Steam if it didn't work out of the box, and it looks like even in the best case scenario you need to download their own game launcher and sign up to an account with them.I'll be trying to avoid all ubisoft games from now on.

												I don't know what other people reviewing the game are on about, i've not had a single problem yet and  I enjoy it. Not had any bugs yet, the combat is easy enough to get the hang of. Admittedly the ai is a little bit annoying but other than that it's fun, i'll give it a 7/10 (which is good)			",165,15,6,6,15,1,32

												As a long fan of the Heroes of Might and Magic franchise, this game was a complete and utter dissapointment. Not only is Uplay a terrible program. The skill tree, and the lack of sylvan elves, with a terrible AI makes it one of the worst games I have ever played.			",21,7,0,29,14,0,20

												The only gripe I people seem to have with this game is its use of Uplay. Frankly, I've never had problems with Uplay, and a second layer of DRM on top of Steam (which is DRM in itself, we must all remember) does not bother me. When it comes to the game itself, I greatly enjoy it; a breath of fresh air into the HoMM series, which since Heroes III, has been based on the same formula which quite frankly has been getting somewhat stale. The amalgamation of all the tedious resources into one, crystals is, in my opinion, a good idea. Whilst it simplifies the game, the introduction of the region system means it would be very tedious to capture all of the resource production buildings, even more so than in HoMM III & V. The graphics, even now, as I write this in 2015, are gorgeous. The creature design in this game is the best it has been in the series. The units are original and the art direction in general is great.Similarly the introduction of deeper RPG elements makes the game more interesting and helps the player invest themselves into the world. What can I say, I like this game.			",98,4,3,20,27,0,36

												Well, I have over 600 hours in the game, so perhaps I should write a review.  For context, I'm a shameless HOMM fanboy; I started back in the day with HOMM II, and recently replayed III, IV, and V, just for the nostalgia (and in preparation for MMH7's release).This game did have some game-breaking bugs in its early days; today, only one remains that I can detect, and that is the ""NVidia card causes black town/combat screen"" bug.  I actually picked up a Radeon card just to get around that bug - that's how much I enjoy the game.  When the game first came out, it had one bug that I found highly amusing ... if you chose to speed up the combat animations, the sound would also be sped up, to the point where it sounded like a bunch of mice screaming and yelling.  Maybe I'm easily amused ... but the bug still exists in the Dungeon campaign (SoD), which I recently re-played ... and it was still worth a chuckle.Nearly all of my gameplay has been campaign - I enjoy those more than anything else, although I can't easily explain why.  This installment, when you include Shades of Darkness and Pirates, has numerous campaigns, which allow you to fully explore the various factions and reputation paths.  The whole dynasty thing was moderately interesting, but tended to offer too much temptation to lean on ""dynasty traits"", which could really upset the balance of the heroes.  The dynasty weapons, which attain new abilities as they level up, are the highlight of the dynasty system, in my opinion.I'm not going to nit-pick the pros and cons, as other reviews have already done that in great detail - I'll keep them simple:Pros:Very open skill tree (also see cons)Cutscenes are interesting and relevant (Pirates had some amusing content)A tremendous variety of combinations of factions, artifacts, etc., keep things interestingSpell cooldown during combat, while limiting, is realistic and forces you to use your brain a bitReduced resource granularity helps to keep the focus on playing the game, versus constantly juggling resourcesHaving all creatures in all towns available to hire from any town ... nice!Fixed perspective camera, versus the crazy controls in HOMM VTakes full advantage of 2560x1440 monitorGreat musical scoreCons:The skill tree doesn't let you go as far with certain skills; consider Grandmaster Pathfinding in HOMM IV (no terrain penalty, +50% movement).  In MMH6, every hero can have logistics, but it's limited.Some campaigns tend to be a bit suffocatingWhen morale gives a stack an additional move, it's not a full move; less movement, and less damageThat's really it.  Overall, 9/10 from me.			",3,3,0,7,2,0,4

												Terrible and practically unplayable. Very unbalanced. Dwellings increase in numbers too fast and opponents are overpowered. I didn't even play past the 2nd mission on the first campaign. If you liked HoMM 2 and 3 you won't like this. If you thought M&M X was an improvement over the prior M&M games you might like this.			",4,1,0,5,4,0,3

												This game is utter crap compared to its predecessors.   The AI cheats, doesn't play anything like you do.  It does not build up fairly or normally, has insta-armies and unlimited income.  So you cannot attrition them.Every mission, you end up ending turn like 50 times to get powerul enough to defeat the boss.Neutral monsters gain stacks like mad as well, I'm talking 20 thousand of a unit.  It is as if the game was not playtested at all.Total junk, would not recommend to anyone.The only good thing is the hero levelling system tree is well done.			",113,16,0,20,11,1,25

												This game is basically just inferior to HoMM5 in nearly every way. It appears to use the same engine/assets for many things, which by itself is not necessarily a bad thing. This is probably the nicest thing I have to say about it. The story seems to be set in the same world as the previous game, but is completely unrelated. Again, not necessarily a bad thing, if not for the fact that the delivery of said story was far worse than in HoMM5. The voice acting was mediocre, and the writing is on the same level. While I could not force myself to further the story to try the gameplay in later missions, there doesn't appear to be anything new. Not that I expect there to be, since it is still the same engine.The real warehouse of nails in this game's coffin is the fact that it forces you to use uPlay. Why Ubisoft feels the need for more DRM in top of Steam is beyond me, and why they decided to make this DRM as bad as it is is a rabbit hole down which I dare not go. In any case, expect to spend close to an hour trying to figure out why uPlay is crashing, failing to patch, and not linking to Steam (a feature it claims to have). Oh, and this is all assuming the servers are up. When you do get it to work, you will still probably have to work around uPlay ""features"", like it's overlay, which interfere's with Steam's overlay, and the strange GFWL-style secondary menu that looks like part of the game but isn't.Overall, I would recommend this game to literally no one. If you're new to the franchise, do not start with this game. See if you can find a friend with a copy of HoMM5, preferably on a disk so that you don't have to deal with Ubisoft's DRM. If you're a veteran, you probably own one of the other games already. I would suggest modding them, or just replaying the older ones, until the 7th installment of the series comes out. Not that I have high hopes.In summary, incredibly mediocre rehash of the last game with no improvements, difficult to set up because of uPlay being terrible.3/10At least, if you do get it working, the custom games aren't too much worse than before.

												Limited badly by Ubisofts own systems (need to be online, if set to offline different set of saves, so no playing online plays when net is down). Also the game itself has become very top heavy with lots of ablities, which isn't an issue but I constantly find myself not knowing WHY an action happened the way it did (most recent example, I went to attck an enemy and another unit rushed in and hit mine before it attacked, it was a unit type I have played before and have never been able to do anything like that with it. Also there were no listed ablities that matched the actions).All in all it would be a good addition to the franchise if they cut back on some of the ablities or made them more clear before taking an action. Ubisofts systems are also something to fight against, which does not help the stress levels.			",69,14,0,17,5,0,5

												DRM and Uplay are the two biggest problems with this game. ~If ubisofts servers go down, it will literally boot you to the main menu in the middle of your game, and not let you continue with what you were doing.  What the actual ♥♥♥♥.~You must download and install Uplay to play this, which is a garbage cloud. When you launch from steam, it will launch the Uplay cloud first and then launch heroes. If uplay is down, you cannot launch heroes. ~Nvida card users probably will experience black screen of death often. There are multiple sollutions and checklists its fixable you just got to do it yourself.Cons about the actual gameplay.~In campaign, easy mode is to easy, normal mode is too challenging. There is no middle ground.~Against AI in custom games, hard mode is too easy oddly enough even without dynasty bonus's.~Combat can become stale.Cons about the story.~Not the most memorable story.~Can feel a bit detached from the fantasy world, not news for a heroes game tho. Every character without a name is just generic and it feels like there are only a handful of characters in this universe. ________________________________________________________________________________Rather then give you a list of pros with this recommend, I will just give you what I feel are the cons. Heroes 6 does deliver and will provide many hours of gameplay if you can look past the cons.			",38,6,0,15,4,0,2

												I'll be straightforward.I don't have a problem with the ubi launcher. It's a fail, but it does the job done. When it works.I don't have a problem with the dumped down resources. Although i prefer the old system, i can live with it.I don't have a problem with difficulty in general. Sometimes it can get rediculous, but you can also change it to easy.Where i do have the problem though, is with the games core mechanic that increases enemies army size every week like the players. It may look nice on paper and you can dump it down a little through difficult settings, but if you take your time (like me) wandering around the beautiful crafted map, or sometimes just killing every army you encounter, you'll hit sooner or later an overpowered enemy wall that you cannot cross.This is by the far the worse thing in the game in my opinion. It forces you to play fast and precise, otherwise you may end up in a really tight situation. Why? Why in earth can't i define my own game pace? It makes no sense. And if they liked that mechanism so much, why don't they just put a slider or something so the players can adjust in a precise way the amount of reinforcements enemies can get? Bad design choice.Apart of this, the game is nice with all it's problems. And it has lots, just read the following reviews. But it's also fun, has gorgeous graphics and a beautiful designed enviroment. Oh and the animations, are one of the best i've seen, kudos to the animation team/studio.It's a good game, full of bad design choices. A  5/10  from a series veteran.A solid  7/10  for the newcomers or the ones who simply don't care.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I love the M&M series and have been playing it since HOMM 2 (I later went and purchased the bundle pack of HOMM 2 so I could experience HOMM 1). This game brings alot of changes to the series and I personally like the fresh take on the series. Major changes include, the new leveling system, spell system, blood and tears system, and dynasty system.The leveling system is different in this entry in that you actually get to choose the path and perks of your hero as they level. While this gets rid of a bit of the luck side of things when leveling it adds a strategy layer to picking your perks and leveling your hero. For those new to the series, in older games when your hero leveled you got to pick from a selection of randomly generated perks and skills. Sometimes you got the ones you wanted... sometimes you didnt. I can see how some loyal heroes fans would be upset about this major change but I personally enjoyed it. I felt like I had far more control over the outcome of my hero.The spell system in this entry has been overhauled as well. In previous games you would have schools of magic and spells that fell under those schools. You'd build mage guilds in your towns and get a random selection of spells from different schools of magic. Certain Factions were more likely to get specific magic types. In this game schools of magic are only available to certain factions. Spells and perks that you would get from a school of magic are part of the leveling system. When you level up you can pick a spell, a skill, or a perk. You no longer learn spells from mage guilds and shrines. I can understand how this draws away from classic heroes and can upset some devout fans but I believe the outcome is better. You can learn your spells on the fly (without having to go back to town everytime you buy a new level in the mage guild), Certain high level spells are restricted to level requirements (no level 5 guy smashing your team with death ripple), and you can pick between a weaker but wider range of spells or focus in a specific school and make those spells stronger. Again I believe it adds an extra layer of strategy and gets rid of some of the luck.the Blood and Tears System is an entirely new addition to the heroes franchise. The system rewards consistant gameplay style by giving you points towards your style. Blood being ruthless and tears being compasionate. You gain points for actions such as persuing and slaughtering lesser creatures (blood), or allowing them to flee (tears). When you get enough points your hero gains a special perk garnered to that gameplay style. It's an interesting feature and certainly brings something to the table. I found myself many a time slaughtering weak armies just for the blood points when i'd normally let them flee just to save combat time.The Dynasty system is a new addition as well. This particular addition came with some powerful perks at the cost of a miriad of major drawbacks. Perks include weapons with their own leveling system that can be passed from hero to hero and small perks that could give a starting advantage to new games. The DRM system forces you to be online in order to take advantage of the perks you can gain through dynasty. It can be relatively annoying if your playing games and you are disconnected. All in all I enjoyed the game and got my moneys worth out of it. While I understand that the vast majority of the negative reviews are for bugs or the DRM system the game itself is worth playing and is IMO the best HOMM available on steam. That being said HOMM 3 (and its expansions) is probably still my favorite entry in the series and is available on GOG.			",88,19,2,7,4,0,11

The game had a horrible launch with connection issues, bugs and so on... but it was years ago.Story and Lore ? I liked it, the graphics + music + voice acting + decent story, can be pretty immersive. Gameplay? Pretty standard, if you a heroes vet you might not like it. Because some simplifying of features has been done, but on the other hand they added some other things, like a progress system, for your account and for special weapons.Why to bother with a review this late? Because overall i enjoyed this game and it makes me sad seeing  49% review rate... its like a heavy scar that the game will always carry on for the mistakes of the past, if i would guess i think this game would have sit on 80% rate at least if it was released at its current state.Something to be aware of although : Dont buy this for the multiplayer, its pretty much dead.And it seems that some people are still experiencing problems, i had zero of those and i think that 99% of the problems can be fixed, just need to understand how, but its definitely something to consider before getting the game. If you never had issues with Ubisoft or fixed any you had then i dont think you will have any with this game either.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I have spend many hours in the campaign, which is quite good.  However, due to how the AI seems to be given units rather than produce them like you, it feels like like King's Quest.  It's an entertaining adventure, but it does force you to play the heal/ressurect game, otherwise you will not be able to survive many hard battles.  Treat the campaign as an RPG adventure, where your stacks and hero develop with you.  Because the rest of the game is very lackluster.  The skirmishes were extremely boring, especially because you can convert cities to your faction and then recruit from a single pool.  It makes the game very snowbally, where you just throw all your stuff into one spot, and if you win, you gain another city and more of the same units.  You have to use U-play which caused problems for some, though not me.To summerize - Campaign is good, rest is bland.			",37,2,0,15,3,0,15

												Limited badly by Ubisofts own systems (need to be online, if set to offline different set of saves, so no playing online plays when net is down). Also the game itself has become very top heavy with lots of ablities, which isn't an issue but I constantly find myself not knowing WHY an action happened the way it did (most recent example, I went to attck an enemy and another unit rushed in and hit mine before it attacked, it was a unit type I have played before and have never been able to do anything like that with it. Also there were no listed ablities that matched the actions).All in all it would be a good addition to the franchise if they cut back on some of the ablities or made them more clear before taking an action. Ubisofts systems are also something to fight against, which does not help the stress levels.			",69,14,0,17,5,0,5

												Turn Based Strategy / Fantasy*Important BugsOverall 3 out of 5Complexity 3Graphics 3Immersive 3Inovative 3Game Pace 2This is a hard call between recommending or not, but at the end I think it is worth the money if you find a good discount.To make it easier I split the review in pro and against.Pro:This is very much like the original games, the ones that got very popular, with the addition of a relevant achievement system.There is this extra layer to the game where you create your heroes and give them the habilities, and as you play you do not only level in game but you also level your profile and acquire in game coins. This profile leveling allows you to expand the set of options for your heroe and the coins to acquire more habilities and other stuff for your set.It's interesting and fun developing your profile as if it as an in game character, and it gives extra game hours.The game itself is pretty much like the series, you have castles, armies, heroes and resources and you are in a row for conquering it all. The AI is decent enough, the creatures have a nice variation of habilities and magic is interesting although narrow.If you like the series, this is a good call. I personally didn't like the Heroes V, but this one I did. There's plenty hours of game in.Against:Ubisoft have been showing a tendency to shady business in recent developments, and this seems pretty much it.The games have loads of bugs that will probably never be fixed, it crashes, hangs, etc. also the Uplay is mandatory for this game, but there are bugs syncronising content making the loading a pain. Almost every time I open the game I have to wait for a long attempt to syncronise content with their server, eventually it fails for time out, and only then I can play.Another hint that Ubisoft do not really care much for fair play is that this is not a full version. You'll not find the Dungeon available, the only way to get this is to buy another fully independent game by a price way above a game pack. I'm also not sure if this is the only thing missing as I originally bought two game packs along with this because of a sale.Bugs and shady business aside there's one more annoyance, if you are a fan of multiplayer or stand alone, to take the most of the game you'll have to at least play one campaing with your favourite race, aside the introductory campaing. This is the only way to unlock some special items that will be attached to your account.The introdutoring campain is boring like hell but is ""short"", the race campain I can only tell about the Undead which is not bad.All in all, there's no other game like this. Falling Enchantress gets close to beat Heroes, but it misses some fundamental stuff. Others are too simple to be interesting for long... so in my opinion this is worth for the simple reason that there's no competitors for this game style, specially if you want to play with friends.If you are looking at games at random and not after this game style in specific, then stay away.

												DRM and Uplay are the two biggest problems with this game. ~If ubisofts servers go down, it will literally boot you to the main menu in the middle of your game, and not let you continue with what you were doing.  What the actual ♥♥♥♥.~You must download and install Uplay to play this, which is a garbage cloud. When you launch from steam, it will launch the Uplay cloud first and then launch heroes. If uplay is down, you cannot launch heroes. ~Nvida card users probably will experience black screen of death often. There are multiple sollutions and checklists its fixable you just got to do it yourself.Cons about the actual gameplay.~In campaign, easy mode is to easy, normal mode is too challenging. There is no middle ground.~Against AI in custom games, hard mode is too easy oddly enough even without dynasty bonus's.~Combat can become stale.Cons about the story.~Not the most memorable story.~Can feel a bit detached from the fantasy world, not news for a heroes game tho. Every character without a name is just generic and it feels like there are only a handful of characters in this universe. ________________________________________________________________________________Rather then give you a list of pros with this recommend, I will just give you what I feel are the cons. Heroes 6 does deliver and will provide many hours of gameplay if you can look past the cons.			",38,6,0,15,4,0,2

												So far, it's been a little buggy. I had to delete a folder created by the game to even get the game to start. Then it hung up when going to a battle scene when I did get the game working again. Had to use the Task Manager to close the game. Haven't played quite enough to make a decision on game play, but it seems okay so far. Pretty much what you'd expect from a HoMM game. Graphics are decent but not amazing.			",31,1,0,10,1,0,3

												Might & Magic Heroes VI has the potential to be a superb game, but is held back by one minor and one monumental flaw.The graphics as expected are superior to previous titles in the series. The music and faction/unit versatility is on par at best, though being able to split your upgrades in the previous iteration makes unit upgrades in VI seem like a step backwards. Spells and gear are fairly versatile, though once more there is the issue of an optimal"" gear set and spells which effectively make 3/4 of your arsenal obsolete.One of the  two places where the game falls short for me is the story and character script, which whilst brilliant for most games, just isn't as captivating and moving as previous iterations of Heroes. The second issue, which happens to be the largest deterrent, is the sheer amount of bugs, glitches, freezing and crashes which makes playing the game incredibly frustrating. Seriously Ubisoft... get your♥♥♥♥♥♥together and fix this!			",384,136,15,76,44,5,119

												I love HOMM2, 3, 4, 5 was so so and 6 is awful.  UPlay is a terrible idea and it doesn't work well.  this game looks nice, but they removed the town pictures at first, then we cried and we got it in a patch.  the storyline was mediocre.  sadly, this game just isn't fun to play.  the computer can become severly overpowered ruining single player experience.  having Uplay go down while you are playing means you get boooted from the campaign and then can't continue your 'online' campaign.  happened too many time so I turned it off.  I honestly played this game for nearly 2 hours but was booted from Uplay so many times that I uninstalled it and said never again.    hopefully if there is a HOMM7, they will learn from the terrible mistakes of this game.   as a long time fan, of the series  I was pretty dissapointed.

												1) This game is by Ubisoft 2) It requires Uplay (third party gaming app) to play.     If you are still not convinced not to buy it...3) The launcher now crashes on startup (and is generally buggy), after I took a long time away from playing it.    Why did I stop playing it? Because...4) The game mechanic where you have to mindlessly click through turns just to get a big enough army to defeat the final castle in missions is still very much applicable. Click, click, click...5) Did I mention you can't access your saved games if you are offline, for whatever reason? You actually have to make offline saved games, which are separate from the normal saved games.I played through all campaigns of M&M 5, and all add-ons (a final battle in one of those was bugged, where you just kept fighting the battle over and over). So I've played a fair share. It's a pity about the problems with this one.6) Oh, and with reference to M&M 5. You remember those lovely cities with inspiring music, that were arguably the most enjoyable/well-done features in the game? Well, no longer. They've actually been downgraded.Despite all this, I would actually like to play the game some more. Sadly, point 3 rears it's ugly head.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I dont recommend this game. ive played heroes of might and magic 3 and 4, but this game doesnt compare.its mostly because of the bugs in the game. you cant properly play multiplayer because you constantly lose connection eventhough it doesnt have anything to do with your actual internet connection. btw this only happens when i try to play with 2 or more of my friends so it ususally works if you play with just 1 friend and hot seat does work. ive also tried this game on lan with more that 3 people and that also wasnt playable.another problem of the game is that you need a connection with conflux (ubisoft) to play online and conflux usually has problems. ive read a lot of forum messages that conflux doesnt work and it seems like ubisoft is just ignoring all the bugs that are in the game and or connected to conflux. if conflux does work it usually takes 15 seconds to connect for some it takes even longer.if you want to buy this game to play this with friends i would recommend another game. it was the main reason for me to buy this games as i dont enjoy this type of games in single player modes.

												I started playing this game over three years after its release, and it is still packed with bugs.  If you do buy this game, do not load any game with a magic affinity dynasty weapon equiped.

												Many people say this game is the worst of the Series BUT that is just because its diffrent. This game is great with friends and awesome heroes options , and creating your own one. The Factions are missing Elves and dwarves but are adding the Sanctuary faction. This game was terrible at launch but went through alot of changes and is now AWESOME !!!!

												Might & Magic Heroes VI has the potential to be a superb game, but is held back by one minor and one monumental flaw.The graphics as expected are superior to previous titles in the series. The music and faction/unit versatility is on par at best, though being able to split your upgrades in the previous iteration makes unit upgrades in VI seem like a step backwards. Spells and gear are fairly versatile, though once more there is the issue of an optimal"" gear set and spells which effectively make 3/4 of your arsenal obsolete.One of the  two places where the game falls short for me is the story and character script, which whilst brilliant for most games, just isn't as captivating and moving as previous iterations of Heroes. The second issue, which happens to be the largest deterrent, is the sheer amount of bugs, glitches, freezing and crashes which makes playing the game incredibly frustrating. Seriously Ubisoft... get your♥♥♥♥♥♥together and fix this!			",384,136,15,76,44,5,119

												I'am a big fan of the whole HoMaM series and especially like that in every new game there is something new in the mechanics to handle and many new things included to find and discover. The storyline is also one to remember ! I kind of dislike that in this one you will need a permanent internet connection to be able to use weapons with your hero since they need to be connected to the cloud. Thats because you can level them up and will have quite overpowered help once you got them high enough. All together the game is not too far away from the old game style which made it so popular while it still features new contents and improveable ideas. Defenetly worth the money in my opinion.

												I love HOMM2, 3, 4, 5 was so so and 6 is awful.  UPlay is a terrible idea and it doesn't work well.  this game looks nice, but they removed the town pictures at first, then we cried and we got it in a patch.  the storyline was mediocre.  sadly, this game just isn't fun to play.  the computer can become severly overpowered ruining single player experience.  having Uplay go down while you are playing means you get boooted from the campaign and then can't continue your 'online' campaign.  happened too many time so I turned it off.  I honestly played this game for nearly 2 hours but was booted from Uplay so many times that I uninstalled it and said never again.    hopefully if there is a HOMM7, they will learn from the terrible mistakes of this game.   as a long time fan, of the series  I was pretty dissapointed.

												This game is basically just inferior to HoMM5 in nearly every way. It appears to use the same engine/assets for many things, which by itself is not necessarily a bad thing. This is probably the nicest thing I have to say about it. The story seems to be set in the same world as the previous game, but is completely unrelated. Again, not necessarily a bad thing, if not for the fact that the delivery of said story was far worse than in HoMM5. The voice acting was mediocre, and the writing is on the same level. While I could not force myself to further the story to try the gameplay in later missions, there doesn't appear to be anything new. Not that I expect there to be, since it is still the same engine.The real warehouse of nails in this game's coffin is the fact that it forces you to use uPlay. Why Ubisoft feels the need for more DRM in top of Steam is beyond me, and why they decided to make this DRM as bad as it is is a rabbit hole down which I dare not go. In any case, expect to spend close to an hour trying to figure out why uPlay is crashing, failing to patch, and not linking to Steam (a feature it claims to have). Oh, and this is all assuming the servers are up. When you do get it to work, you will still probably have to work around uPlay ""features"", like it's overlay, which interfere's with Steam's overlay, and the strange GFWL-style secondary menu that looks like part of the game but isn't.Overall, I would recommend this game to literally no one. If you're new to the franchise, do not start with this game. See if you can find a friend with a copy of HoMM5, preferably on a disk so that you don't have to deal with Ubisoft's DRM. If you're a veteran, you probably own one of the other games already. I would suggest modding them, or just replaying the older ones, until the 7th installment of the series comes out. Not that I have high hopes.In summary, incredibly mediocre rehash of the last game with no improvements, difficult to set up because of uPlay being terrible.3/10At least, if you do get it working, the custom games aren't too much worse than before.

												I'm a little disappointed in Ubisoft for taking the Heroes series in kind of a weird direction. If you enjoyed the prior ""Heroes"" games for things like the cityscapes, faction details, and down-to-earth plots, you won't find all that much of those things in ""Heroes VI"". What you will find is over-the-top unit designs and a lot of the current trend to make the bad guys seem not so bad after all. The Inferno Faction has really suffered in that regard - it's not so much evil and demons as it is a bunch of misunderstood guys with horns.Gameplay, though - that's what's remained true to all the previous ""Heroes"" games, and the developers did a lot to expand on the options available to a Hero in terms of the skills and powers they can develop. The AI is a bit smarter, and the game can be very challenging if you don't stay on the ball in the early parts of missions. Some units are a lot more useful than others, and the factions have been homogenized a little bit, and there are only five...			",103,11,0,14,9,3,19

												First off I want to say this is the second Might &Magic Heroes game I have played. The other game is the third game.Compared to the third game this is garbage. So I would recommend any one thinking about buying this game to buy the third and play that instead.  Gamewise they feel a little different. Pros:* It has quite good graphics, the battles look cool.* The battles are still as epic.* It gets cheap when there is a sale.Cons:* I felt VI feels to narrow. * There are no open areas just small corridors. If you want to get from one point to another there are only a few corridors you can take.* Uplay.So to summaries I would not recommend you to buy this game for full price. IF it is one 75% sale then yes it is worth the money. But otherwise I would recommend the third game in the series.			",61,5,6,12,7,0,6

												1) This game is by Ubisoft 2) It requires Uplay (third party gaming app) to play.     If you are still not convinced not to buy it...3) The launcher now crashes on startup (and is generally buggy), after I took a long time away from playing it.    Why did I stop playing it? Because...4) The game mechanic where you have to mindlessly click through turns just to get a big enough army to defeat the final castle in missions is still very much applicable. Click, click, click...5) Did I mention you can't access your saved games if you are offline, for whatever reason? You actually have to make offline saved games, which are separate from the normal saved games.I played through all campaigns of M&M 5, and all add-ons (a final battle in one of those was bugged, where you just kept fighting the battle over and over). So I've played a fair share. It's a pity about the problems with this one.6) Oh, and with reference to M&M 5. You remember those lovely cities with inspiring music, that were arguably the most enjoyable/well-done features in the game? Well, no longer. They've actually been downgraded.Despite all this, I would actually like to play the game some more. Sadly, point 3 rears it's ugly head.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I dont recommend this game. ive played heroes of might and magic 3 and 4, but this game doesnt compare.its mostly because of the bugs in the game. you cant properly play multiplayer because you constantly lose connection eventhough it doesnt have anything to do with your actual internet connection. btw this only happens when i try to play with 2 or more of my friends so it ususally works if you play with just 1 friend and hot seat does work. ive also tried this game on lan with more that 3 people and that also wasnt playable.another problem of the game is that you need a connection with conflux (ubisoft) to play online and conflux usually has problems. ive read a lot of forum messages that conflux doesnt work and it seems like ubisoft is just ignoring all the bugs that are in the game and or connected to conflux. if conflux does work it usually takes 15 seconds to connect for some it takes even longer.if you want to buy this game to play this with friends i would recommend another game. it was the main reason for me to buy this games as i dont enjoy this type of games in single player modes.

												i am upset with the purchase of this game,  i really did not expect any risk with satisfaction as i have had such great success with steam games in over the past 4 years.  I would like a refund but i guess that is just the risk with buyinga game.  such a shame i waited so long to find out.			",6,0,0,5,3,0,13

												If you want to spend a lot of time being frustrated this game is for you. Ive played Heros in the past and it is a great game, but when you cant get past the garbage connector which you will waste excessive amounts of time trying to determine what else to try just to get the game to start it kinda takes all of your good feelings about the game away. Hopefully they will see the wisdom in dumping the connecting system one day and I will actually get to play the game, but for now it is a paperweight in my library that I paid way too much for.

												Really fun game plagued by issues which I believe are mainly related to having to use UPlay. I can't recommend it based on the issues preventing me from even playing. For example, it took me awhile to figure out how to successfully launch the game after installing UPlay. I need to launch the game from Steam without UPlay running or I'll just get a message saying the game is already running. Also, every time I click on a town, the screen darkens and seemingly soft locks. From reading other forum posts, these issues have been occurring for years now so I don't see them ever being addressed.Simply put, I'd avoid spending the money on it.

												General reviews are mixed, and I had my share of doubts about this game. I have tried it before, when it was just released, but it was buggy and not really enjoyable. I tried it for 10 minutes.Spring 2015 it was on sale, and I thought that I need to give it another go.I have played through 2 compaignes on easy, and I relly love the simple and beautifful stroll around new world and a simple fairytale of a story.Owned HOMM 1-3 since the release dates. 4 and 5 I never got to play properly. 6 brought me back.I am not a big fan of a new artifacts system, and a new magick system.Uplay is a mess overall - not possible to sync saves even on a fast connection.Get it on sale, and spend some time with it. You will lowe it. ",70,3,5,22,4,0,8

												I like it, well I like it after I manipulate the amounts of characters in my ""team"" with cheatengine, without it the game is just too tedious. The online thing, CONFLUX (more like confux) is the most annoying crap I have ever seen. WTF lol why do I need to over and over again to ""reconnect"" to a single player game that I have been playing for hours. Then there's the fact that when UPLAY / CONFUX takes a crap (a correct analogy) it stays craptastic by either not letting you reconnect, or by letting you reconnect then kicking you back out again ?? CONFUX is for the birdsAnyway, like others have said, only get it if its cheap, this game can be monumentally annoying possibly causing you to stab yourself with a rusty wooden spoon..

												While I appreciate the ideas of trying to change up the game play, all the changes fundimentally make the game worse.The castle mechanic is the biggest detriment. In previous games, having to scout the area to pinpoint a castle was a critical move. In 6, there are boarders which are a big screaming flag that says ""Hey! The Castle is right over here!"". So then you just run in and grab it.Resource management was also a drawback. In 3-5, Having to make the call to explore, fight for a particular mine, or spend way too much money at the market was run. In 6 you just get crystal and call it good.Ok I lied, the biggest detriment is Ubisoft. You have to log in through their bs system and create all these bs accounts. I just want to click play and run the game. Do not buy this game. If you want true Heroes, buy 3. If you want good Heroes with better graphcis, buy 5 (which was pretty solid).			",53,22,1,12,10,1,11

												Heroes of Might and Magic 6 is an awesome refinement of a tried and true formula. The factions are balanced, the combat is engaging and adds hero abilities into the mix which gives the player the opportunity to build their character in some interesting ways. The campaign is solid, and of course the sandbox mode is always great. HOMM6 is beautiful and is the complete package when it comes to turn based strategy games. The series has been through a ton of revisions and I think they have finally hit something amazing. I'm talking HOMM3 amazing here...			",818,217,10,103,64,10,113

												I'm angry, a part Uplay that displays issues constantly, (just after 2 days it stopped connecting to the cloud), the balance of the game is completely destroyed, it is too difficult on ""easy"", the number of the enemy troops grows fast compare to yours and you need to know the inside outs of the game perfectly to develope a strategy that could hold your opponent, all of this on easy! C'mon! So stressing! I'm bored of restarting from saves constantly without any chance of success, such a stupid game.			",240,50,2,18,10,1,6

												The best Heroes yet!  I think the designers have finally removed most if not all the issues with the Heroes of Might and Magic series.  (I have been playing since 1 back in the day).  I have enjoyed this one the most so far.  Let me list the issues with the last games and how they have been fixed in 6...1) Crossing your fingers whenever you hero goes up a level, hoping you get the skill you are looking for.  In 6 you may select any skill that you want.  Of course some of them require other lower level skills  and some have hero level limits.2) I have 3 town and they are so far apart, it is going to take me a week just to combine my armies.  In 6 the number of creatures you can buy per week is shared with all towns so as long as your town can build a certain unit you can recruit all of them.  (Works with special building that give you bonus units as well).3) Gosh the enemy took all my mines again and if I retake them I cannot get back to defend my town. (Not enough movement).  In 6, you can take a mine for the turn if you leave your hero on it, but as soon as you leave control returns to the player who has the closest town.  4) Issue I have with 5 - Gee that phoenix has taken 3 moved before my Earth Elemental ever got a 1.  How unfair.  I lose no questions. (Unless I am the phoenix, in this case I hope you enjoy cheese).  In 6 they do have the initiative bar but each unit only gets 1 move a turn.  Much better, so yeah all my units might take an action before yours but only 1 action.5) Wow that is the 3rd chain lightning in a row, magic is so much stronger than might...  In 6 each spell has a cool down time, so no more chain lightning each turn until my 3000 units are toast. Most spells are every 3 turns.6) Alright I am going to build a magic tower, cross fingers...  Oh crap I already have all those spells...  In 6 spells are hero abilities so you can pick whatever you want, no randomness.7) (Not a issues but a cool new thing in 6) - Units have a might and magic attack and defense.  Not just 1 value for attack and 1 for defense.  So you can have the magic user who gets destroyed by the sword but spells / magic attacks do very little to him.My only complaint so far has been the difficult, not that it is too hard but it is out of balance.  90% of the fights I can just hit auto combat and go have a cup of tea.  But the ""boss"" battle at the end of the map usually requires my hitting next turn for a  few weeks to get enough units to win. (This is after I exploed the whole map.  Perhaps it is my style of play.  I am an explorer not a rusher).			",24,0,0,7,2,0,19

												Plays just like it's forerunners but everything's been given a makeover. A graphical overhaul for one. The magic's been given a lot of attention and is all the better for it and it's got the usual depth for a Might and Magic Heroes game. I've played some of it's recent competitors like the King's Bounty games, Eaodor, the latest Disciples games, etc, but I have to say this played the best and was the best looking of the lot too.Downsides; extra DRM. Not content with just using Steam, you also have to create an account and password for Uplay which Ubisoft's now using with ALL their games now. So you've got one lot of DRM on top of another DRM! Talk about giving the legitimate buyers a hard time! The pirates won't have to put up with all this everytime they want to play the game.If you can overlook that, I would say Might and Magic: Heroes VI is the best of the genre at the moment.

They say that has since been fixed (if you beleve them) but it shouldn't have been broken in the first place.  I had the game crash over 10 times, during one of the missions.In addition to flat out crashing this game has other multiple problems 1.each map takes about 6 hours to compleate, not because of gameplay but because of teadiasness.2. each and every unit is required to move at a grouling pace you will litteraly spend hours watching them move.3. because natural units gain more unites over time you can actually have a situation in which it becomes impossible to beat normal unites because your blatently outnumbered. (its so unfair)4. zero depth, I really do mean 0 at least on the main map, moveing around is fun but the building componit so sooooo bad.5. IMPOSSIBLE DIFFUCUTY.

The combat system is incomprehensible, random number flash as attacks happen, some listed as damage but oppenents health arent decremented by any amount near to those numbers. Oppenents randomly gain health, the health bars of combatant seem to not be an indication of their health. Perhaps most baffling, you have a hero that watches the combat but does not partcipate.

												1. Open game through Steam.2. Open game through U-Play3. Maintain connection to in-game server.The main problem with this game is you CANNOT CONNECT to the ""Conflux"" server, in-game. Not only is it already convuluted by having to launch the game through two clients, but you have to connect to the internet to do nearly anything with this game.This is absolute garbage. All this money spent to sit at the menu screen, watching the knight look around.			",275,124,6,99,23,3,36

												I suppose this game has split the HOMM community in pieces. Some people hate it, some love it. Im with the latter. Really, i have NO complaints about it (as far as Heroes games go). It improves on nearly every aspect that made the previous games more frustrating F.E. not u can buy all units colectively from all cities, no need to circle through them all to get your units. Another would be that your opponents cant Ninja-cap your mines without taking over the rulling local fort. I could go on on and, but over all, it's a fantastic title for anyone enjoying a challange or strategy games in general. 9/10			",131,15,3,17,16,1,35

												I had only one problem after 97 hours on Win 7 prof (64bit) with a simple HD 4000 vga chip. I like the storyline and I this this game is better than the last one. I'v already played the complete Heroes series more times.The only problem is the mouse cursor vibration and it happened on only one of my computers.			",35,7,0,7,0,0,15

I really wish they had kept the 3D map feature like in M&M 5., but Great game anyways, love the series and cannot wait for M&M 7 this year! Highly recommend this game!! Although to be honest....

												This is probably the best Heroes of Might and Magic game. While Heroes II had better campaigns in it, the Heroes VI campaigns remain good. The AI is excellent - a serious challenge to beat in some battles. Heroes VI also removes one of the most tedious things about HOMM (and i say that as someone who loves these games), which is having to do a running tour of all your cities to keep your armies equalling or outnumbering the AI's.In Heroes VI you can recruit troops with a hero in any town, from any town, speeding things up massively.The option to build advanced town portals that let you teleport between towns you control speed things up again. And since the AI can build the same portals it doesn't make the game any easier.Heroes of different factions also get completely different skill trees from one another, which adds to the variety of the game a lot.The graphics are nice, so is the music. The one downside to Heroes VI compared to earlier games in the series is that to get the best starting bonuses you can get you have to play it online via uplay, which, when you're playing single player, is just a bit of a pain that slows starting a new game or loading a saved one down a bit.This is a minor annoyance though in what is basically a really great game.Some HOMM fans deride Heroes VI for having made some changes to previous games. The mess of Heroes VII resulting from trying to go backwards instead of forwards shows how mistaken those people are imo.The one thing that Heroes VI hasn't changed is that it's still in big part a matter of who can recruit more troops faster - but that's a flaw in the basic type of game it is, not this version of it.

												I bought this for a Win8 touch device. It is sort of playable with touchscreen. I played 1-2 hours, then saved. Later I tried to play again and the savegame was gone.And then there is this awful uplay linkage. You have do download, install and update uplay. Then you have to mak a uplay account. So the game works through steam with uplay! After closing the game you get uplay advertisement. This is a total no go.The game itself is not bad.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Just...don't play this...just don't.Everyone says heroes 3 is the best, and that one was great, my personal favourite though is heroes 5. There every team felt unique, had a cool faction ability and the game was just really well done.Here in 6 there's so much pointless bull$@^! they make you do. They've dumbed down the game as well, instead of having sulfur, mercury, gems, crystals and all that it's now only: wood, ore, special.The combat feels like crap compared to 5, there are fewer teams, no simultaneous turns (omg this is annoying), no dragons, no angel as the ult for haven either. Just everything about the game feels off, sure it's still heroes but if you want to play heroes pick up 5. Tribes of the east is on steam, and that one's better in pretty much every way...except for graphics (and even then the graphics in 6 aren't anything special)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Had some trouble getting it started through UbiSoft, but kept working on it and got it to go. expected a real dud reading through some of the comments and reviews, but I enjoy it. Had an issue last night where screen went to black, which my computer guru attributes to a not juicy enough graphics card. Reloaded from Steam, and I'll see how it goes.

												With a confusing timeline and a lack of elven factions, not to mention lack of spells and perks for the hero. This game ain't halfbad if you like the previous installments. Certainly better then the fifth in terms of mechanics, but not in story. Although it is indeed worth a shot if you enjoy the Heroes series. Only thing left to say is. When are they gonna pull their hats out of their backsides and give us combat-Heroes like in HoMaM 4. Siiiiiiigh			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

If they could simply patch out the bugs (which at this point seems unlikely) then this would be a quality game.			",89,7,0,28,25,2,41

												I'm a fan of Heroes of Might and Magic, and as much as I wanted to enjoy this game, I didn't. The base gameplay is nice enough, but lacks that spark of charm that the classic HoMM titles have, mostly becuase of the change from randomized skills to a linear run-of-the-mill upgrade tree.I could have lived with that, but unfortunately this game has lots of issues. Firstly the difficulty is insane even on easy, due to inbalanced A.I. It's the classic example of having bad A.I. programming, only to try to make it up by making it hugely owerpowered, meaning that you will be attacked by enemies with way too many troops for you to handle.The issues with Uplay are there as well, maning long load times if you're connected to the internet, and lost feautures if you're not. To make it worse saves made with Uplay turned off aren't compatable when playing online, and vice versa. Stick to the older HoMM titles, don't waste your time with this.			",90,20,1,17,11,0,8

 One of the best Turn base strategy games in a world. Game play. Heroes 6 keeps in Heroes 3 traditions gameplay, but stil with changes that makes game even better. Interface is now more comfortable than ever before.  Resources now have only gold, wood, ore and crystals as special resource for advanced buildings and creatures. You can make your costume  Hotkeys which is nice. I have to admit game suffers from balance issues which is a disappointment. Game performence and GraphicIf honest game cold look better. Of course its matter of taste, but still with this graphic game perform quite terribly. Game seams lack of optimization. With my hardware this game should fly. Even such games like Far Cry 3 or Tomb Raider runs stable on 60fps. Probably game should be in 2D graphic than it would look better and would not perform as it does right now. Do not get me wrong. Game still playable but suffers some serious frame drops. I thot that is driver problem, but no I have all drivers up to date.StoryI never was fan of Heroes games story line, but in this game story is really engaging and enjoying. And Heroes profile leveling gives a game adicional value. They call it a Dynasty.ConclusionGame is good, but there need some work to done in order get some genius turn based game which was Heroes 3 at the time. Strategy fans don't need fancy graphic. They need good interface and good idea for game it self. This game is worth your time. You should be patient to play this game. This game takes a lot of time. If you still happy about game after long sessions this means game is good.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I would recommend this game overall but this is not one of the best games out there. This game exhibits great RPG elements, and mastering an expertise in battle requires dynamic strategies. However, there are many issues that I have with the game as well. For example the AI is stupid; there are two settings: aggressive and defensive. If you play against defensive then the AI only stockpiles units, which means you will eventually win by sheer force from taking over the map. If you play against aggressive then enemy heroes will only engage in battles that they win in, but only return back to base if forced to. This means that (1) you won't enter in any battles unless your slated to lose (which sometimes means that no matter how resourceful and strategic you are, you will lose); and (2) if you reinforce your main hero then you will eventually overpower the enemy. However, this tends to just end up the AI playing chicken to take your city and you just sitting there until you abuse bad AI scripting to, for example, make them miscalculate. While this makes players think, this doe not make for interesting or fun gameplay. The campaign offers relief from this type of AI stupidity but only sometimes; however, the campaigns did contain some maps that were definitely a puzzle. To be honest, the only reason I recommend this game is because the combat system is engaging, and by abusing the computer's stupidity of amassing units; can reach battles of epic proportions. The hero powers become essential in achieving victory and is the best way this game hands control into the player's hands: all units are balanced among the different races, but it really is how you build your hero that defines a win from a loss. If I could make an ideal 4x game, Heroes of Might & Magic IV would be the type of combat that my game would emulate. That's how fun and different it is from say CIV or SC. However, there are many better strategy games that offer more meaningful experiences where the player has much more choice, not just in hero customization but in building a kingdom. I bought this game thinking it was a strategy game: let me be clear; if that's why you would buy it then do not. This game is an RPG game with strategy elements. Find loot, defend your bases and points of interest; and win by sheer force. If you want a game where you get to control massive and visually epic battles then I'd recommend this game for you.

Though many people not satisfied with the game after their hopes were not realized I found the game quite a good one, as it consumes less time then previous parts of the game (when not many time for entertainment it's a great advantage), quite deep strategical thinking required for battles, nice graphics and whole universe of magic. In addition a good card game which is in beta now (Duel of The Champions) in the same style attracts a lot.			",6,3,5,10,3,0,33

There is no way to whittle down the enemy force, the combat area is RIDICUlOUSLY small.If I could get a return on this game... believe me I would.			",62,6,1,13,6,0,13

												I mean... It's HoMM.  Features some interesting improvements over previous incarnations in the series, such as Dynasty Weapons and benefits of controlled territory around cities, and the skilling system is interesting.Suffers a bit from poor optimization, like many other Ubisoft titles, and has a tendency to run sluggishy or choppily, regardless of graphics settings.Is also victim to the recent cancerous gaming growth of ""required online connectivity to play,"" even when playing the single player campaign.  If at any time while playing, you lose connection to the internet (or more importantly, if Uplay goes down, which it frequently does,) your game will immediately exit without saving and you'll be punted back to the main menu.  It's a pretty heartbreaking way to lose a ton of progress.Still, if you're aching for a HoMM game, this is one.  So, that's probably enough for some folks.  Suppose it's recommended, though only by virtue of being a sequel in a series that was once near and dear to my heart.			",107,33,0,51,8,1,26

												Great game, much improved on the previous game. New features include dynasty bonuses which are pretty much points you get from achievements which you can then use to unlock artifacts and items to use in custom games. You can also create your own heroes, massively expanded ability tree and greater choice of town upgrades. Combat has also been streamlined to (wait for it!) Might or Magic! Basically, you have your hero use buffs and warcries to boost your units, or faceroll people with crazy spells (but of course you can also have defensive buff spells).Enjoy!			",70,9,2,15,11,0,32

												The game doesn't even start because Uplay crashes on launch. That alone awards it a negative review. As for the game itself. The single player is horrendously unfair. The towns, which used to be the biggest medium for the fantasy of each nation, are ugly, flat, and overall repulsing. I didn't mind the reduction of the number of resources, but the change which introduced the area capture turned the game into chasing enemy heroes in circles. I was also so very excited for the new Sanctuary faction, but it was not enough to salvage my opinion of this one. I hope the next one will be better, but I don't hold much hope.

I have an Nvidia GTX 760 so I doubt that my card is the issue here. One other small complaint that I have is that you have to manually create heroes before you can play custom games. I know it's picky but I wanted it to feel a lot more like HOMM III (which I have from GOG but cannot play fullscreen or in windowed).Until they fix the black screen avoid purchasing.

												What the HELL, ubisoft?! Why would you release a game that featured an unplayable multiplayer!? We couldn't get past the FIRST TURN because the game locked up! EVERY TIME!I must say I was quite stupid when I bought this game. I read the featured (all negative) reviews, and thought to myself- ""oh, these other guys' computers just must have some sort of problem, or they aren't doing it right""... well, I guess the only way to experience something firsthand is to spend your own money on it and be dissapointed yourself! Now, I got the complete edition for $10- I'd still say that 10 bucks is worth the single player game (which works fine), but still, the fact that they didn't seem to care about the quality of the game makes me really aggravated at ubisoft... again. Whatever.If you want to play this game for multiplayer, do not buy it. If you are only interested in single player, wait for it to go on 75% off sale, then get it if you are feeling adventurous and have the money to toss at it. It's up to you.			",228,57,0,47,14,3,31

												I don't recommend this game since it's still full of bugs that Ubisoft won't fix. I bought that game but it crashes after the first battle. The only known fix for this is to either use an older graphics card or possibly revert my drivers to an ancient version. I've even been in contact with their support and the only thing they could say was that my card was not supported. Which it technically is not, sure, but they could at least warn that the game have poor support for newer graphic cards.My roommate says that the game is good though!

												Let me set one thing straight before I go off. custom games with your friends is very fun and definitely an enjoyable experience. If this is your sole purpose for buy this game I recommend this game highly.If you are playing for the campaign I recommend that you pass. I've been playing HoMM since Heroes II and I've never experienced such broken gameplay in the campaign. I'll start off with a brief overview of basic gameplay. Each faction has their own special spell that must be built up to by performing specific feats on the battlefield as simple as kill units etc. Special spells include: the Necromancer's have raise the dead, Inferno has gating which allows you summon allies into battle, Sanctuary has a team buff, Haven has a single target shield that gives the unit invulnerability and makes them untragetable and Stronghold gives initiation boost to allies which allows them to move sooner if the boost is enough, although most of the time it isn't. The goal is to build up your town allowing you to recruit more powerful allies as well as provide unique bonues for each faction and eventually defeat your enemies in a ""chess-like"" battle. During these battles you may use spells that are unlocked Now I will explain why I believe the campaign to be broken. For most if not all of the campaigns you begin without a city, which is fine and completely normal for a Heroes game. Once you have your city you are limited to a certain amount of buildings and the other remain locked until you complete certain tasks or when the game deems it worthy. The AI that you fight in the campaigns is given access to all building at the beginning which means when all you have access to is Tier 1 unupgraded ghouls and skeletal spearmen the enemy is sending out hordes of Tier 2 upgraded Griffons. This is a pain but it is still manageable. Throughout heroes games when you take a city you get all of their upgrades and buildings available for your own use. In the campaign this time around it immediately removes all of their upraded buildings and sets you with your limited structures. So after you fight all these upgraded creatures you dont even have the access to it as the AI did.During battles with the AI is where things really get broken. Every spell you use has a mana cost as well as turn cooldown, such as ""you cannot cast this spell again for three turns."" The AI for some reason has no limit of mana and may cast the same spell turn after turn not suffering from the cooldown penalty. It takes roughly 2 turns to build up enough of your special spell in order for it to have any use on the battlefield allowing you to cast once every other two turns. The AI seem to build these up in rapid succession allowing them to cast once per turn, and in some rediculous situations i've seen the Haven enemies cast their invulnerability spell twice in one turn. Which means your guys arent hitting anyone but the enemy is, which eventually dwindles down your army. If you are lucky enough to win you will most likely lose 2/3 of your army just to have another enemy attack you in two turns not allowing for you to even begin rebuilding your armyIt seems the devs focused so much on dumbing the game that they forgot to give the enemies a decent AI, because really most of the time its stupid easy even when outnumbered as teh AI makes some really stupid decisions. Which is why they gave them unlimited mana and no cooldowns, that way the game can still remain challenging. Except this isn't the fun kind of challenging. Imagine fighting in PvP and the enemy has hacked the game allowing them to use these same broken mechanics, nothing about that would be fun. The fun challenging is when the AI is using intelligent tactics while you sit there trying to plan one step ahead.6/10+fun battles with friends+each faction is unique (although not as much as previous games)+very cool creatures with their own unique mechanics+enough skirmish maps to try and keep things fresh in custom games+Artifacts are extremely useful+Campaign has a decently interesting story-Bad Voice acting( not really a big deal to me but it is for some so i'll post it up here)-AI is broken in campaign (in custom games it functions properly)-Building the towns has been dumbed down from previous games (Less unique between factions then previous Heroes)-Spell system sucks (Gives us back the Magic Guild buildings please)-Only 3 necessary resources now and you cannot capture an enemies resource-Game almost seems like it was meant for mobile devices with how much everything has been streamlined			",23,2,0,12,0,0,2

												I f you're a fan of might and magic series this'll be a great pleasure for you. the downsides and upsides are mostly in comparison to the 5th since its the most recent of them that comes to mind. DOWNSIDES: infinite shots for archers, no war machines, can't turn your screen 360° , and the skill system for levelling and spells is horrible. UPSIDES: nice graphics,better readaptaion of the different kinds of creatures (Ex; if this is your first melee unit it won't be bad just because you have it first, archers are less physically strong than the melee units)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												One of our favorite games of all time.  Too bad stupid ubisoft servers are down every other month. UPlay is so annoying.  all progress and saved games lost, kicked out of game mid-play, and all because of there stupid UPlay server being way sub-par. I paid good hard earned money for every single itteration of this game and quite frankly am super tired of starting to play a board and getting kicked off mid way through because of some unknown Ubisoft server debacle. Screw you guys. Just let us play the game that we paid you for!			",5,2,0,7,0,0,3

												As someone who didn't play the original 1-4 of HOMM, and therefore do not have the whole 'old game nostalgia trip' going on, I enjoyed this game a lot. I played through all of the campaigns, and found each and every faction enjoyable.UPlay sucks though, but the game was good enough for me to put up with it.

												Might & Magic: Heros VI is a RPG-Strategy game.  It has beautiful graphics and music.  The concept of the game looked so interesting and that is why I was initially drawn to it.  The basis of the game is moving your Hero around to collect resources, building up your army and then traveling to fight the final boss.  However, after playing for some hours, trying to complete the campaign.. it lost its appeal.  I find the AI to be extremely overpowered and as I read the other reviews I see I am not the only one.  It requires you to rush through the game to get to the final boss before their armies can become strong.  It doesn't allow you to be able to take your time an explore the area because each turn the opposing army gets stronger.  The Multiplayer is very buggy with lots of dropped connections and sync problems.  This game also (unannounced by steam on the store page) requires Uplay to play.  Uplay is also incredibly buggy and it takes quite awhile just to even be able to play the game.  Overall this game is not good and I would not recommend it.			",168,35,2,41,25,1,32

												A surprisingly decent addition to the HoMM series, streamlining Heroes V's developments (only one special resource, no second upgrade option for creatures) while expanding it others (a more comprehensive skill system and the addition of blood and tear abilities) yet a little skimpy on variety in Factions and monster design.  However, it still keeps all the great tactical depth and fun that makes HoMM worthwhile.  I did, on the other hand, not enjoy the feeling that I needed to play the campaign to unlock the full experience, as HoMM's campaigns are not the reason we play them.  I am yet to fully try all the Factions and immerse myself in great non-campaign games, but I was pleased that the core essence of what makes these games great still beats at the heart of this latest episode.

												An extremely fun and well-crafted combination of RPG and turn-based strategy. Adventure and level up with your Heroes - earning skills, spells, and items along the way... but also engage in complex combat sequences of turn-based strategy - involving armies of various units (with various characteristics and abilities) on an isometric grid, similar to a large chess board.Imagine Warcraft (the original RTS games) but everything is turn-based and combat occurs on the ""chess-board"" screens. You have bases (cities and forts), you collect resources with mines, lumber mills, etc, and you buy new units as time goes on.Warning: the game is a bit buggy, including a few game-breaking bugs that are best avoided if possible (check forums if you are concerned. But Ubisoft is continuously patching these bugs... or so they say, anyway.Still, very fun game, I've already put 200+ hours into it in a couple weeks, and I've barely scratched the surface of the various single player campaigns and mutiplayer options. I recommend it to any RPG and/or strategy fans.			",45,10,1,7,7,0,6

												I love Heroes, was hooked on III especially. This game is pretty alright. People complain about changes to resources and all that, but it's not really a big deal.The problem with this game is that it gets repetitive, fast. Healing your troops up and skipping turns so that you don't lose units. But if you lose units, you get screwed fighting the AI. So your tactics are just stalling trying to save as many units as possible.2nd problem - Bugs. Holy♥♥♥♥♥♥ bugs. This game should've been delayed for another year+ to fix all the bugs, but they released it, got people's money, and called it a day. Played the beta, said it was buggy, but a decent game. Bought the game on release, bugs were still around. They promise to patch. They patched, there's still enough bugs for at least 3 big patches. And that's what ruined this game for me. You can never be sure your skills, items, heroes do what they say. Stat changes that were obviously suppose to benefit you reverse and screws you over. If this game had its bugs hammered out before release, then yea. Go for it. But at this point, nah. Especially since the expansion brings in more bugs that won't get fixed. Such a shame really.

												It's a really good turn-based game, when it works. And by that I mean when Uplay, the program you are forced to install to play M&M Heroes 6, isn't down and/or unstable. The single player has a nice story which will pull you through the game. Though once you want to play with a friend or two, it's almost not worth it. Where I mainly got this game for Co-op and multiplayer it's definetly not it's strong suit. Uplay will always fail to sync after ten turns and if you are really lucky, you might reach to turn 20 before it loses sync and you and your friend will have to restart Uplay and TRY and conncet again.I would give this a thumbs down but since this is a review for the game, I recommend it even for the single player Campaign.As for the Uplay software you have to install to play and is horrible for multiplayer experiences, I wouldn't recommend this in the slightest until Uplay can stablize it's software.

												Gameplay functions well and I typically enjoy the campaigns in HOMM games. Unfortunately, to succeed in the campaigns in this game, you basically have to play the game in a very precise, almost scripted sort of manner. It makes me feel like I have no freedom. The characters have to be built a certain way in order to succeed and I feel like I may as well just watch youtube videos of the game to get a similar, less time-consuming result.Meh			",52,13,0,21,4,0,11

												Definitely recommend!I had almost zero problems getting into the game and when there was an issue, I just started the game file as an adminstrator (look on the game forum for help).  Any time Ubisoft updated their software, I'd have to do it.  No big deal really.I bought this game on sale with all of the DLC.  GREAT VALUE!!  With that being said, I've played HOMM 2-6 and this series did not dissapoint at all.  I very much enjoyed the smooth game play and great storyline.  I'm on my entire 2nd playthrough, this one on hard (trying to get some of those dynasty weapons to lvl 5).  I also like the Dynasty system et al.  It added another layer that was previously not there.  I like it alot.  My ONLY issue  is the order in which you play the main campaign.  It's shown from left to right with the Tutorial missions first and then the Necro followed by Haven, Sacntuary, Inferno, and Stronghold.   I believe the best way to play the main campaign is chronologically versus each faction.    I suppose that's a matter of opinion though.  Either way, it was still a blast to play.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Very disappointed with this purchase.3 and 5 I enjoyed while with this version of Heroes I was continually hassled by UPlay while trying to download the game (took around 1 hour to finally get it to work - Steam was glad to remind me of this), playing the game could sometimes crash or lose saves, the game is simplified in some aspects that added charm to the previous versions, bad balancing when it comes to certain quests and annoying AI mechanics.Game consists of Cat and Mouse tactics when it comes to seeing an enemy and just free portaling back to a city. You do this, enemies do this, and the game goes on and on with players doing this.If you want a game of attrition via trench warfare then perhaps this game would satisfy your need. However even ""trench warfare"" sounds more exciting then what this game offers...UPlay? For me it's more like UDon'tPlay.			",50,12,0,9,2,0,6

												I usually don't write reviews. I usually don't feel very strongly about the games I play. They are games, I enjoy them to a certain degree, but that is about the extent of my emotional investment. Now that we have this personal tidbit out of the way, let me begin by saying that I honestly like the Heroes franchise, which includes even the current atrocity and the (for many fans, anyway) mediocre installment that went before it.That is, I would really like to enjoy this game, but for the life of me I can't. Not that it doesn't have some strong suits: The unit models are downright gorgeous, and watching them duke it out in a Heroes-style arena is quite enjoyable. I don't even mind the weak storyline, the presentation of which makes you want to pop some ecstacy (figuratively speaking, of course) just to stay awake. I don't even mind, and I honestly didn't expect much to begin with.What I do mind is the absolutely distasteful, punch-in-the-face, DRM-nightmare platform that Ubisoft ever so tactfully forces upon the player, who put down hard cash to begin with and is most likely eager to play. But wait (and, trust me, you will have to wait a lot if you play this game, but more on that later), first create an account with the fun-loving, family-good-time platform that is Uplay. Already, that dreadful feeling of regret is kreeping along my spine as I feast my eyes, for the very first time, on Uplay and what will from now on be my personal window into the game. I blink once, I blink twice, I try my hardest to ignore the plethora of pile upon pile of achievement, cosmetic-personalization, and fictional-monies/credit ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. I look only for two things: Activate offline mode and play.The game loads, finally, the main menu appears. Naturally, the game is played. Strangely, some options in the character window are greyed out. The cold sweats are creeping back in. Immediately, I shut down and look for articles that explain this so-called in-game dynasty (not that it requires rocket science).Within minutes, it becomes painfully obvious that, should you choose or want to play the game offline, you're basically looking at a crippled product. Only if you connect to your account are you allowed to choose boni, with which your alter ego begins their adventure, dynasty weapons, pets, and custom heroes (otherwise, the one provided has to do). And, while it is true that these are mere boni, which add to, but are not strictly required in order to finish the game, you're always reminded how you may miss out whenever you find a new dynasty weapon or similar. (It is here I believe Ubisoft's lack of publishing talent is wasted on the gaming industry. They might want to consider psychological warfare.) Best of all, however,  if you wish to reset your progress, you're♥♥♥♥♥♥out of luck: What you do online, stays, at least until Ubisoft goes out of business. Above, I mentioned that your patience will be tested by this game, and it is true. Virtually every minute, you will be greeted by a loading screen. You start the game -- loading screen, you load a save -- loading screen (so far, so normal). The loading screen will stare at you for what will soon become an eternity. You are prompted to press any key to continue. You are now in the game world, but, lo and behold, certain items are missing -- such as your character, or other characters, or flags, or anything animated, really, because these are loaded on the fly after the loading screen (sick of the word ""load"", yet?) You enter your town, haven, or whatever you want to call it, and the screen says ""Loading ..."" for a bit. You enter battle, and the screen goes black (loading the battle scene, I presume), and sometimes the scene doesn't load at all. This happens before about 5 % to 10 % of all battles, thusly crashing the game. I cannot quite remember if Uplay attempts to synchronize your saves (a ""feature"", which can be turned off, fortunately), but when it does, know that you will stare at your screen for 2 to 5 minutes during synchronization.All this being said, I almost pity the developer for having to work under the yoke of Ubisoft and did not (it seems to me) have the opportunity to realize the full potential of the game -- even after the many patches.At any rate, Heroes VI will definitely be the last game I bought that has the Ubisoft sticker on it.

												Ubisoft hasn't fixed multiplayer yet, so even though my friends and I have a save file together, we can never pick up a game where we left off, making the game really disappointing. The game is fun if you only want to play single player, but if you ever want to play with friends, and you don't have time to do an entire game in one session, then you're out of luck.So my friend and I found this solution. It is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. Ubisoft needs to fix the game, because this is dumb. But here is the link so that you know how dumb the fix is, and might decide to get the game anyways. http://forums.ubi.com/showthread.php/491995-Out-of-sync-constant-crashing-in-multiplayer/page3Oh, this only works if it's a two player game. Otherwise, with 3+ players, you must all remember to remove your dynasty weapons before saving, or just not play with dynasty weapons at all, because you will get the out of sync error if more than one player has a dynasty weapon equipped when you load the game.

 One of the best Turn base strategy games in a world. Game play. Heroes 6 keeps in Heroes 3 traditions gameplay, but stil with changes that makes game even better. Interface is now more comfortable than ever before.  Resources now have only gold, wood, ore and crystals as special resource for advanced buildings and creatures. You can make your costume  Hotkeys which is nice. I have to admit game suffers from balance issues which is a disappointment. Game performence and GraphicIf honest game cold look better. Of course its matter of taste, but still with this graphic game perform quite terribly. Game seams lack of optimization. With my hardware this game should fly. Even such games like Far Cry 3 or Tomb Raider runs stable on 60fps. Probably game should be in 2D graphic than it would look better and would not perform as it does right now. Do not get me wrong. Game still playable but suffers some serious frame drops. I thot that is driver problem, but no I have all drivers up to date.StoryI never was fan of Heroes games story line, but in this game story is really engaging and enjoying. And Heroes profile leveling gives a game adicional value. They call it a Dynasty.ConclusionGame is good, but there need some work to done in order get some genius turn based game which was Heroes 3 at the time. Strategy fans don't need fancy graphic. They need good interface and good idea for game it self. This game is worth your time. You should be patient to play this game. This game takes a lot of time. If you still happy about game after long sessions this means game is good.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I've been a huge fan of the series since I was a kid and got this game despite the warnings because I wanted to see what had become of it. Despite it's flaws I still have to give it a positive review.Pros-Interesting story line-Hours and hours of gameplay-Huge maps -Challenging on higher difficultiesCons-Having to install Uplay (This alone will make you want to punch your screen at times)-Random crashes in the middle of battles-Music seems to be just a copy and paste from older games (May have been intentional for fans)-Game feels unfinished-You need internet to play Alot of people (myself included) are having a hard time with Uplay and how horrible of a system it is to access the game at times and Ubisoft's indifference is infuriating considering how loyal alot of people have been to them through the years. The reason Im giving it a positive review though is all that aside the game itself is addicting and can be alot of fun once you get passed all the flaws around it.Hope this helps anyone looking to purchase it in the future			",14,0,0,7,3,0,13

												Hi,first of all, I'm playing HOMM since HOMM3 and together with HOMM6 it is the best part of the series still. I like to think that I'm an experienced player, so the campains aren't too hard yet allthough the necromancer campaign maybe is a little too much for newer players, because the first mission can be quite trying until you know the layout of the map and know what to do early and the second mission you literally aren't allowed to waste a single unit until you reach a nice army size. All in all it offers a nice gaming experience in single player as well as multiplayer mode, if you like round based strategy games.Now the cons; The dynasty weapons don't work in offline mode. I also can't play any singleplayer games that I started offline in online mode and vice versa. I don't know what UBISOFT was thinking when they decided to implement this ""idea"". As far as I remember they promised this game to be DRM free and technically it is, but instead they force you to be online the whole time and if you lose your connection you can't even continue the single player games you started in online mode.I got this game as a present, otherwise I would've never bought it due to these limitations (allthough I'm a long time HOMM fan). In my opinion Ubisoft is screwing its customers when they promise a non drm game, but make it even worse for paying customers. So my recommendation is a pass, maybe they'll learn to take players more seriously then.			",24,5,0,6,1,0,6

Regeneration and healing is totally unbalanced making it easy to abuse your way through the hardest setting. Doesn't play like any of the previous games and all the races weirdly reflect different real world cultures rather than the traditional HOMM ones. The game was very disapointing compared to every one of its predacesors which were all decent. Also the game forces you to instal UPLAY which is trash and installs add ons with out permisions.

												Eh. I bought this for the nostalgia factor for Heroes of Might & Magic. Truth is, the game has promise, but the problem is it just keeps crashing, and it requires you to be always online. Sure, cloud computing is wonderful, but pushing it on you as a default strips a bit of the experience on the user-end of things. And the bugs... ooooh the bugs. The mouse floats and skips about, and some gamers are complaining about it dropping the framerate or killing it entirely. If you try scrolling the screen too quickly after an event (battle, cutscene, dialogue, whatever), it'll break and you can only get the screen to scroll by restarting the game. And if you retreat from a battle with an enemy hero, the game freezes! The game takes forever to switch off due to the uPlay interface synching your game with the cloud, so restarting it becomes a pain. I swear, I get about twenty minutes of good game time before something goes wrong and I have to start over, and waiting between three and five minutes for the game to reboot, and a further couple of minutes to get back to where I was before it froze... it's just not worth it.

												Heroes VI is the first in the series that you can actually beat on Normal mode, without having to resort to cheese tactics to stay alive.  And while you're doing it, you'll have a lot of fun, too!  It's been simplified so some of the hassle is gone, but all of the tactical action and hero development aspects are just as engaging as always.  Pile on a hefty campaign with a great story (even if the voice acting is so-so) and I've really been enjoying this game.  Pick it up, and let me know if you do so we can trade tips!

												Might and magic Heroes VI is generally a pretty good game. Better animations and graphics than its predecessors,better than average quests and lore,pretty good gameplay and nice new features added such as the dynasty weapons. Totally worth buying if you don't have any problems with ubisoft and uplay.These problems MAY be fixed by installing the original uplay launcher from the ubisoft official website. I never had any problems with uplay but i had it originally installed before i installed  this game. It will consume a lot of time so be wary. There are a few bugs in some of the skills though but they are not game breaking and sometimes they are not even noticeable. THE MAJOR DRAWBACK IS THAT THE DEVELOPERS HAVE STOPPED WORKING ON IT BECAUSE THEY HAVE MOVED ON TO OTHER PROJECTS.MANY OF THE NEW FEATURES WONT WORK IF YOU ARE NOT CONNECTED TO THE CONFLUXGRAPHICS: 86%GAMEPLAY:88%NEW FEATURES:90%REPLAYABILITY: MORE THAN 90%TIME CONSUMING:100%CHALLENGING: EVEN IN NORMAL IT IS OFTEN CHALLENGINGOVERALL:86-85%			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I don't recommend this game since it's still full of bugs that Ubisoft won't fix. I bought that game but it crashes after the first battle. The only known fix for this is to either use an older graphics card or possibly revert my drivers to an ancient version. I've even been in contact with their support and the only thing they could say was that my card was not supported. Which it technically is not, sure, but they could at least warn that the game have poor support for newer graphic cards.My roommate says that the game is good though! Too bad I can't play it since I need to downgrade...			",181,42,2,29,16,2,41

												Some time ago I would have recommended this game, because it had some good points. But now it is entirely a different story. If you own Nvidia graphics card, then you will run in serious problems. Game will freeze and crash all the time. This bug has been known for a long time, but nothing has been done to fix it. Game itself is good in one area - Custom matches. That`s it. AI in campaign is so unfair that the only way to win a map is to rush, rush and rush.Simply put Heroes VI is not worth your money and time.			",607,194,19,107,59,5,132

UpdatedDid not play this game for 5 Minutes, so unfortunately this review has nothing to do with the game itself.So after after 13h play time a small update.Uplay is needed to play this game. This is software like Steam but from a different publisher. So if I start Steam, first Uplay starts and then the game tries to load. If I start Uplay, then Steam starts and afterwards it tries to start Heroes 6. But both time it will not work, I only got to see the game once. With 13h play time its obvious I got the game to work. But I am still not happy about having to start both services to play.If I had known this game needs Uplay I would not have bought it. Why is this not shown anywhere on the games steam side? I know why, because most people are♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥about this. I really would like to play this game, but with the current setup I just would like my money back. It is shown that you need Uplay (""Drittanbieter-DRM: Ubisoft Online Service Platform"") on the right side of the store page now. Perhaps I just overlooked it at buying?Know finally to the game: as far as I progressed into the game it was mainly boring. Story and game mechanics.			",114,26,1,10,7,0,25

												Heroes 6 is a beautifully laid out intriguing masterpiece. It would give hours of exceptional entertainment and at this point I would have given up anything for more. I mean anything like a desperate inmate on death row selling his cornhole for crack type anything.Or so i would believe, having never played the game because Ubisoft has no customer support and I can't even get onto Ubisofts UPlay server. Again support is junk and im pretty much F#*&%^.But they still got my money for essentially nothing so I'm hoping to at least use the charitable donation for a tax break.Trust the other reviews I didn't for my love of the previous generations Ubisoft has fallen a long long way.

												This game is absolutely great, especially if you've been a fan of HoMM in the past.  Leveling up is a bit more predictable, and you get to decide on just about everything instead of it being luck-based as it has in the past, which I prefer.  There are a few bugs with some of the campaign maps, but for the most part there's few issues.  Also, keeping 10 autosaves helps to save you if you screw up or if the game crashes.

												It had a decent start but it quickly became apparent early on that you couldn't take your time on levels on any difficulty setting as enemy armies grow exceedingly quickly. As a result the only real way to win is to rush through levels as quickly as you can, the exceptions appearing to be the tutorial levels. As someone who prefers to take their time and poke around the inability to do this on even the lowest difficulty is dissapointing.			",115,84,0,60,29,2,25

												Once you get past the Uplay garbage (turn off cloud saves on Uplay!) it's fun to play.  The story arc is engaging and will keep you coming back for more.  The basic gameplay seems more confined and linear than previous Heroe's of Might and Magic games.  You play one of five children with each it's own faction.  The factions are distinct and you need to play one faction to get to the next one in campaign mode.  It's worth the time and better than your average turn based strategy game.  Worth the price when it go's on sale.			",50,20,0,35,13,1,43

												After two years of game the game crashing on entering a town and problems regarding UPlay, I was finally able to play the game. Gameplay is mediocre at best, load times are too long, and, as a Heroes III fan, the graphics seem to be unnecessary. If they put the budget into good gameplay, they might have had a good game. For fans of the franchise that have to have every game, get it when it is on a Steam Sale. Also, only 1 ""special"" resource. This was a major misstep, and oversimplifies the resource acquisition. It looks like they are fixing this issue in HOMM VII, but I am still very cautious about that game, as of how bad this one is.			",207,60,3,36,21,2,25

												This title is a cash cow.  If you grew up playing Heroes 3 its been a disappointment there after.  My personal opinion is to stick with 3 and enjoy it for days on end.  5 was the first 3D version, cool but still meh.  6 had multiple driver issues, uPlay incompatibility issues, sound bugs, camera bugs and a boring story.  I've given up on the heroes title. If you've never played before it's a fun turn based action strategy game where the ultimate goal is to get one hero at max level and wreak havok.  Get zounds of units and kill the other guy.Ciao			",35,3,0,7,4,0,8

												Very disappointed with this purchase.3 and 5 I enjoyed while with this version of Heroes I was continually hassled by UPlay while trying to download the game (took around 1 hour to finally get it to work - Steam was glad to remind me of this), playing the game could sometimes crash or lose saves, the game is simplified in some aspects that added charm to the previous versions, bad balancing when it comes to certain quests and annoying AI mechanics.Game consists of Cat and Mouse tactics when it comes to seeing an enemy and just free portaling back to a city. You do this, enemies do this, and the game goes on and on with players doing this.If you want a game of attrition via trench warfare then perhaps this game would satisfy your need. However even ""trench warfare"" sounds more exciting then what this game offers...UPlay? For me it's more like UDon'tPlay.			",50,12,0,9,2,0,6

												This isn't a bad game. I've played and loved all of the Heroes games starting from the first one and I think this version has its merits. It looks really good and plays fairly well. They scrapped some of the things I loved from Heroes V including the cool skill progression/mixing and variable unit upgrades which is a bummer. Also they cut the amount of City's you could play as and sold one as DLC. Yes the DLC and Uplay and connectivity stuff are garbage, but that doesn't make the core game not fun. Overall, I would say that if you want to play a game in this series, then buy and play Heroes III Complete and Heroes V w/ expansions. They are cheaper and better than Heroes VI. If you've played those and are looking for a pretty modern take on the series I'd pick up this game. Hopefully they can learn from their mistakes in this one and make the next one a game I can recommend wholeheartedly.			",171,38,2,33,13,1,21

												The game itself is pretty good.It consists of economy management and tactical turn-based combat, using either of five factions who are fun to play but not always very well balanced against each other. You are in control of one or more heroes, who level up after winning enough combats with your army, learning new skills and what-not to use in the following combats. You construct buildings in your towns to recruit soldiers or give other benefits, and you'll soon find out that you're always in the lacks of blood crystals, inciting your continuous exploration. A collecting of sometimes murderously challenging campaigns (at least one for each faction) makes you fine-tune your strategy. This is all pretty damn fun.The factions:Haven - the boring faction consisting of boring humans and some light-aligned creatures. They focus on luck manipulation and light magic - a magic 3 of the other factions are mostly weak to.Necropolis - a faction consisting of undead who compensate for their lack of morale buffs with the ability to revive fallen creatures using necromancy. They can be quite difficult to play, since they require you to have no losses what-so-ever to excel, but once you get hold of their penultimate building you can revive ALL fallen creatures from your former battles...providing your economy is strong enough.Inferno - a bunch of demons zerg rushing across the field. They die a lot. That's pretty much it.Stronghold - a faction of orcs, focusing on rushing and trolling the enemy. For example, goblins can put invisible traps on the battlefield, maulers get stronger if they are attacked, harpies can attack then fly away, centaurs shoot reaction shots when your opponent move across the field, etc. Pretty damn fun.Sanctuary - my personal favourite faction, focused on fighting honorably, one-on-one, and also water magics. They have a mixture of tanky units, strong ranged units, an ability that provides extra tankiness to all units provided you fight honorably, a lot of units that debuff the enemy - debuffs your hero can specialize in enhancing and last, but not least, a freaking water spirit dragon as a penultimate creature that can, if played right, carry your entire army across the field in one turn.I have postponed the bad things about this game until here. The ""bad things"" have a name - Ubisoft. First of all, you require UPlay to play this game. I almost committed sepukku once I'd been forced to sign up, but I was able to pull through. Ubisoft are dead-set on becoming the new EA, hated by everyone for ruining games. Not only did Ubisoft pull away resources and personel from the development team, leaving them with less to work with on the same timeframe. Not only did Ubisoft sabotage the development of the campaign by handing in the script for the story way too late to the devs, but they're still ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ly enough to put ""PAY FOR MORE DLC"" in the ♥♥♥♥ing main menu! You know, the first thing you see after you've paid for the ♥♥♥♥ing thing! Furthermore, there's a stupid meta-system called ""dynasty"", which gives ALL of your heroes perks depending on global experience gathered because do you know what's fun in multiplayer strategy games? Starting with unequal circumstances because of arbitrary ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t, that's what everyone wants!In short: a good game that could have been great if not for Ubisoft.			",100,21,0,14,2,0,15

												Might & Magic: Heroes VI is a excellent installment in the series - it provides hours upon hours of turnbased fun. It features good graphics and sound effects, although you may run into troubles if you use the highest graphic settings while playing on a older PC.It features various, by now well-known factions and a story for each of them, combined with two independent DLCs which add actual content to the game.The only downside - aside of the ubisoft launcher, of course - that I could find was the leveling system. You earn experience for everything you do and so your account level up slowly. Very slowly. Although it requires you to use the Ubisoft-Launcher it is a good game; if you are a fan of turnbased games I can only recommend you this game.			",720,196,26,109,67,7,141

												I had A LOT of trouble to install it. Once I managed to, steam doesn't recognice when I'm playing. Ok, not a big deal, playing time doesn't show on record properly, not so bad. But that's not all, after all of this, the game disconects from ubisoft servers randomly, losing all progress in the map, because you have to be connected to play (even offline campaign). I couldn't even finnish the tutorial campaign. HOMM is my favourite saga, but this totally ruined Heroes VI. Won't play anymore, I'm back to Heroes III (GOG version, of course, I don't want ANYTHING coming from Ubisoft). Steam shouldn't allow to sell this game on his platform.			",46,6,0,6,5,1,5

												I am a sucker for turn based, cell based combat, and Might & Magic: Heroes VI has plenty of it. Possibly even too much, as I am feeling burnt out after playing this game for so long. But thankfully there is an option for quick combat where the computer almost instantly resolves the encounter for you, and does so very reasonably as well. Of course this is not available for boss battles, which is good since some of them are really quite well done (especially in the expansion packs).I played through all the story campaigns (including the ones in the expansion packs), and it took me 80 hours to get through them. I have no intention of touching the multiplayer or skrimish modes, I've had my fill of the 6th entry in the Might & Magic Heroes series and I am feeling very positive about buying the game.Despite it being somewhat barebones, I actually enjoyed the story. It has an interesting premise and it is presented from many different points of view. And as before, the continued story in the expansion packs is actually better. Most of the story is presented with voice acted walls of text and through cutscenes. But it is true that the characters do feel wooden and there is nothing special going on here graphically.Some of the missions do have a tendency to drag on, especially since the prevalent strategy seems to be to just build up your army until you have a bigger army than your opponent. This is sometimes avoided by placing time limits on the main quests. But you can't get away from the fact that most missions really are the same thing over and over again, start with one city, build up an army, conquer more cities, repeat until you win. While this is simplifying it greatly, and there is variation here (well made maps, many different types of units to fight against, some interesting side quests), that is the basic premise of most every mission.Sadly it would appear that this game was not especially well received among the fans of the Might & Magic Heroes series. But I have to say that it's probably my favourite one so far. It tries to change up the formula of the games and in my mind it succeeds well enough.I would really recommend it only to fans of this kind of gameplay, otherwise you're just going to get bored with the slow pace of the game. Thankfully I fit the description and I got plenty of enjoyment out of the game.7½ / 10			",809,305,38,121,97,9,172

												Just reinstalled the game. I remember having a little fun last time i played it and i can't remember why i stopped but i figured i would give it another go since i'm bored. And now i'm upset that the refund policy doesn't allow you to return broken games.Wait, that's not right. Let me explain. The problem with this game is Uplay. You need Uplay to play it and after installing the game i just let Uplay do its thing until it stopped working. Now, whenever i try to launch the game, Uplay boots up and crashes. So if Uplay doesn't work, this doesn't work. So if ubisoft isn't going to let me play my game I've just been robbed. Sucks for me i guess. The good news is that with the refund system in place PC gaming will no longer be something for Ubisoft to make cheap bucks off of by releasing incomplete or unplayable games. It's a bummer that i can't play the game and I'd love to make an actual review but i'm not willing to deal with Uplay's BS just to play a game that others say is incomplete and will never be complete and I dearly hope that Ubisoft grows a brain and stops worrying about pirates so much because as a result, they're actually harming the people that legitimately buy their games.Fingers crossed that Ubisoft either goes under or grows a brain.That's the correct phrase for a company disolving, as a result of not making money, right? ""Goes under""			",118,19,0,11,3,0,18

												Definitely recommend!I had almost zero problems getting into the game and when there was an issue, I just started the game file as an adminstrator (look on the game forum for help).  Any time Ubisoft updated their software, I'd have to do it.  No big deal really.I bought this game on sale with all of the DLC.  GREAT VALUE!!  With that being said, I've played HOMM 2-6 and this series did not dissapoint at all.  I very much enjoyed the smooth game play and great storyline.  I'm on my entire 2nd playthrough, this one on hard (trying to get some of those dynasty weapons to lvl 5).  I also like the Dynasty system et al.  It added another layer that was previously not there.  I like it alot.  My ONLY issue  is the order in which you play the main campaign.  It's shown from left to right with the Tutorial missions first and then the Necro followed by Haven, Sacntuary, Inferno, and Stronghold.   I believe the best way to play the main campaign is chronologically versus each faction.    I suppose that's a matter of opinion though.  Either way, it was still a blast to play.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I usually don't write reviews. I usually don't feel very strongly about the games I play. They are games, I enjoy them to a certain degree, but that is about the extent of my emotional investment. Now that we have this personal tidbit out of the way, let me begin by saying that I honestly like the Heroes franchise, which includes even the current atrocity and the (for many fans, anyway) mediocre installment that went before it.That is, I would really like to enjoy this game, but for the life of me I can't. Not that it doesn't have some strong suits: The unit models are downright gorgeous, and watching them duke it out in a Heroes-style arena is quite enjoyable. I don't even mind the weak storyline, the presentation of which makes you want to pop some ecstacy (figuratively speaking, of course) just to stay awake. I don't even mind, and I honestly didn't expect much to begin with.What I do mind is the absolutely distasteful, punch-in-the-face, DRM-nightmare platform that Ubisoft ever so tactfully forces upon the player, who put down hard cash to begin with and is most likely eager to play. But wait (and, trust me, you will have to wait a lot if you play this game, but more on that later), first create an account with the fun-loving, family-good-time platform that is Uplay. Already, that dreadful feeling of regret is kreeping along my spine as I feast my eyes, for the very first time, on Uplay and what will from now on be my personal window into the game. I blink once, I blink twice, I try my hardest to ignore the plethora of pile upon pile of achievement, cosmetic-personalization, and fictional-monies/credit ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. I look only for two things: Activate offline mode and play.The game loads, finally, the main menu appears. Naturally, the game is played. Strangely, some options in the character window are greyed out. The cold sweats are creeping back in. Immediately, I shut down and look for articles that explain this so-called in-game dynasty (not that it requires rocket science).Within minutes, it becomes painfully obvious that, should you choose or want to play the game offline, you're basically looking at a crippled product. Only if you connect to your account are you allowed to choose boni, with which your alter ego begins their adventure, dynasty weapons, pets, and custom heroes (otherwise, the one provided has to do). And, while it is true that these are mere boni, which add to, but are not strictly required in order to finish the game, you're always reminded how you may miss out whenever you find a new dynasty weapon or similar. (It is here I believe Ubisoft's lack of publishing talent is wasted on the gaming industry. They might want to consider psychological warfare.) Best of all, however,  if you wish to reset your progress, you're♥♥♥♥♥♥out of luck: What you do online, stays, at least until Ubisoft goes out of business. Above, I mentioned that your patience will be tested by this game, and it is true. Virtually every minute, you will be greeted by a loading screen. You start the game -- loading screen, you load a save -- loading screen (so far, so normal). The loading screen will stare at you for what will soon become an eternity. You are prompted to press any key to continue. You are now in the game world, but, lo and behold, certain items are missing -- such as your character, or other characters, or flags, or anything animated, really, because these are loaded on the fly after the loading screen (sick of the word ""load"", yet?) You enter your town, haven, or whatever you want to call it, and the screen says ""Loading ..."" for a bit. You enter battle, and the screen goes black (loading the battle scene, I presume), and sometimes the scene doesn't load at all. This happens before about 5 % to 10 % of all battles, thusly crashing the game. I cannot quite remember if Uplay attempts to synchronize your saves (a ""feature"", which can be turned off, fortunately), but when it does, know that you will stare at your screen for 2 to 5 minutes during synchronization.All this being said, I almost pity the developer for having to work under the yoke of Ubisoft and did not (it seems to me) have the opportunity to realize the full potential of the game -- even after the many patches.At any rate, Heroes VI will definitely be the last game I bought that has the Ubisoft sticker on it.

Let me just tell you how sad I was to find out how buggy it was. They never should have released it when they did. All that aside, this game once it was fixed is fantastic.

												Gameplay functions well and I typically enjoy the campaigns in HOMM games. Unfortunately, to succeed in the campaigns in this game, you basically have to play the game in a very precise, almost scripted sort of manner. It makes me feel like I have no freedom. The characters have to be built a certain way in order to succeed and I feel like I may as well just watch youtube videos of the game to get a similar, less time-consuming result.Meh			",52,13,0,21,4,0,11

												I had the game when it came out and managed to play a lot.My son destroyed several games while playing including this one.Last year i decided to buy it on steam,the complete edition,since is somewhat safer and was including  also all dlcs wich i didnt managed to buy or werent out yet,and was also on sale.i was excited to try try it again and was really happy about the dlcs.But i didnt took in consideration the Steam.instead of complete package i got just the original game and one dlc.That means no free items or whatever else weas included for having the complete edition.Also not being able to play the dlcs.I sended several emails to the steam support but got no answer or at most a we will work on it.after an year i am still not able to play the dlcs and still no answer from support.So my opinion is to buy the game if you really want to play it,but buy the complete edition at your own risk.I made some research and it seems there is a huge group of people who are in same situation like me,no dlc,no answer etc.I normally dont do reviews but this made me so angry,i couldnt keep it in anymore.Avoid the complete edition and buy all separate.Or pirate it.Or play MoM V,wich is better.Or buy MoM III,wich i find the best of them.

												Still very mixed on the game. It seems dumbed-down from V and the online system is almost pointless, You can play the game offline but you miss out on some level perks. To me this was really poorly executed and a disappointment overall. It feels like a step in the wrong direction. Not a step back, just stumbled a little of course. Could I recommend the game? No, Unless it's under $10 and you are a fan of the series. Then it might be worth it to see some of the new mobs and mechanics. It looks great and some the units specials are cool to use but their are sound glitches and it looks like they have abandoned this game so I wouldn't expect any customer support. Oh and the difficulty level is just dumb. Easy is Normal or sometimes too Easy and Normal ranges from normal to ""wtf, how many reloads is this now on this level?"". Plus there is some weird glitch that if you select for the AI to take control and fight the battle against the AI, the outcome is usually more favorable than if the player were to battle it.

												It's the worst game I've ever had. One a simply reason: It's impossible to play. The game needs a permanent connection to ""the Conflux"" network, and this network it's falling down every 5 minutes, so you are mandatorily ejected from the game each 5 minutes.It's incredible, but it's true. A game that you can't play it's not a game, its' a damn crap.			",27,3,0,11,0,0,3

												I am a sucker for turn based, cell based combat, and Might & Magic: Heroes VI has plenty of it. Possibly even too much, as I am feeling burnt out after playing this game for so long. But thankfully there is an option for quick combat where the computer almost instantly resolves the encounter for you, and does so very reasonably as well. Of course this is not available for boss battles, which is good since some of them are really quite well done (especially in the expansion packs).I played through all the story campaigns (including the ones in the expansion packs), and it took me 80 hours to get through them. I have no intention of touching the multiplayer or skrimish modes, I've had my fill of the 6th entry in the Might & Magic Heroes series and I am feeling very positive about buying the game.Despite it being somewhat barebones, I actually enjoyed the story. It has an interesting premise and it is presented from many different points of view. And as before, the continued story in the expansion packs is actually better. Most of the story is presented with voice acted walls of text and through cutscenes. But it is true that the characters do feel wooden and there is nothing special going on here graphically.Some of the missions do have a tendency to drag on, especially since the prevalent strategy seems to be to just build up your army until you have a bigger army than your opponent. This is sometimes avoided by placing time limits on the main quests. But you can't get away from the fact that most missions really are the same thing over and over again, start with one city, build up an army, conquer more cities, repeat until you win. While this is simplifying it greatly, and there is variation here (well made maps, many different types of units to fight against, some interesting side quests), that is the basic premise of most every mission.Sadly it would appear that this game was not especially well received among the fans of the Might & Magic Heroes series. But I have to say that it's probably my favourite one so far. It tries to change up the formula of the games and in my mind it succeeds well enough.I would really recommend it only to fans of this kind of gameplay, otherwise you're just going to get bored with the slow pace of the game. Thankfully I fit the description and I got plenty of enjoyment out of the game.7½ / 10			",809,305,38,121,97,9,172

There are only 3 resources which is awful. Overall, it's a dumbed down version of the other Heroes games. I'd wait till the next one comes out (which looks like it at least has more than 3 resources...) I only would get if you get it only because of the namesake and then you will still be disappointed.

												Just reinstalled the game. I remember having a little fun last time i played it and i can't remember why i stopped but i figured i would give it another go since i'm bored. And now i'm upset that the refund policy doesn't allow you to return broken games.Wait, that's not right. Let me explain. The problem with this game is Uplay. You need Uplay to play it and after installing the game i just let Uplay do its thing until it stopped working. Now, whenever i try to launch the game, Uplay boots up and crashes. So if Uplay doesn't work, this doesn't work. So if ubisoft isn't going to let me play my game I've just been robbed. Sucks for me i guess. The good news is that with the refund system in place PC gaming will no longer be something for Ubisoft to make cheap bucks off of by releasing incomplete or unplayable games. It's a bummer that i can't play the game and I'd love to make an actual review but i'm not willing to deal with Uplay's BS just to play a game that others say is incomplete and will never be complete and I dearly hope that Ubisoft grows a brain and stops worrying about pirates so much because as a result, they're actually harming the people that legitimately buy their games.Fingers crossed that Ubisoft either goes under or grows a brain.That's the correct phrase for a company disolving, as a result of not making money, right?

												First of all, lounching the game was a chalenge on its own: after paching for about an hour, it started up UPlay, which imediatly crashed... over and over again... After some tries, the thing actually loaded up... To begin even more patching...It would seem that in four years they should have fixed the bugs, however it seems quite astonishing how many bugs they have left out... In the tutorial alone my unit got stuck during a fight and when I eventually managed to defeat the enemy, the game crashed...Overall the game is quite lame, since you are required to be online to do pretty much anything and unlock stuff witch should be included in the first place...I would only recomend this game if you are a die - hard HoMM fan or there is a huge discount on it and you are looking for a turn-based game.

												Good game. I miss the large variety of factions from Heroes II and III, but V, and now VI, are still good games regardless. Some of the new systems may be confusing and a turn-off at first, but you'll get used to them, just as you got used to them on V.As always, the campaigns are long, so plenty of gameplay hours there. Online and hotseat are available, which is great. Good variety of maps as well.My only complaints are lack of a choice between two upgraded creature options, the lack of solid variety and balance for hero skills (there are many, but I end up building my Heroes almost the same), and never enough faction choices! More the merrier!Pick this up if it goes on sale, and if you like turn-based RTS games (with quality RPG elements).			",106,16,0,20,8,0,20

Please accept our apologies for your inconvenience."" If it's not Assassin's Creed or Far Cry don't bother with Ubisoft. /ENDEDITDon't buy this game. I bought it on a sale for $10 and it has constant freezing issues and crashes every 15 minutes. I ahve tried the NVidia workarounds and most of them do not help for longer than an hour. I have loved this series since I was a kid but I can't recommend this game to anyone right now. It also requires UPlay. So while you may be buying it through Steam you will then activate and play it through Ubisoft. The DRM is pretty terrible, too. If it fails a check the game won't launch and can sometimes be the cause of your crashes.Too bad...			",151,47,0,31,7,3,17

												Being an avid fan of this type of turn-based strategy and having followed the series since its Kings Bounty origins, I had high hopes for this game. There are a couple of fundamental flaws that absolutely ruin the experience for me.First, this game has to be played on Ubisoft's UPlay network. If you cannot connect to UPlay, you cannot play the game. Being that the game would constantly error out when trying to connect to UPlay for the first time, as you can imagine, I was none to happy. Having your first interaction with a game be digging through support forums to launch an element that I will never use started me off on the wrong foot.At some point, I was able to find a work-around and get the game up-and-running, and being that every other Heroes game I've played was enjoyable, I was fine overlooking my initial mishap. Game had loaded, cinematic intro had played, and I was off and running on the tutorial. Much to my surprise, in my first battle, the melee troops reached my archers by the middle of the second round of combat even with my other melee troops occupying the board in front of my archers. I quickly came to the realization that they did not include zone-of-control in the combat system which was the nail in the coffin for me. In previous versions of the game, you could position melee troops to prevent your ranged troops from being immediately overrun by the opposing army. This was done using zone-of-control which would require an opposing melee troop to stop their movement if moving into an adjacent space to your troops. This helped create a buffer against the opposing team since the AI is programmed to go directly for your ranged troops first. Without this feature, the opposing army moves past your defenses every time, and there is no reasonable way to avoid heavy losses, especially when the battles get tougher.I’d be happy to overturn my opinion on this game if they can fix the zone-of-control problem, but as is and especially for those familiar with the series, I highly recommend looking elsewhere and saving yourself hours of frustration.

												This game is disappointing in my opinion. It has excellent graphics, but many of the proposed single-player campaigns are exceedingly difficult (at least for a not very skilled player like myself). I think that the old HOMM3 is still overly much better. I mean, the graphics of HOMM3 is obsolete, but the game is much more enjoyable, and there is a much desired generator of random maps.  If you are a better player than me, however, you will have a better chance to enjoy HOMM6 and its colourful landscapes. To summarize, I cannot recommend this game to players who play just to have fun and do not like exceedingly frustrating experiences. It can be good for people considering games as a pure challenge. Maybe, by playing a lot one can find the correct sequence of operations to beat AI enemies in each of the campaigns and scenarios (I did in a few of them). But it seems to me that there are better ways to spend my time.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Well I made my first purchase on steam at eighty quid, and I'm really not happy. There is no guidance as to how the thing works. It says it needs to do patches that take yonks, then when you end the task there's no way of getting back into it for it to comtinue installing these 'patches' apparently. Then it suddenly decides I need to update uplay I do so then it consistantly refuses to work and fails to respond. I've heard from people that steam is great but TBH I say its very unreliable. I can't get into my games and eighty quid's gone out of my account. If someone can explain what's happening that would be great. But complaints will start flying to the company or whatever it is if it continues to fail.Buy the box guyes and install it from disks, far less stress and faf that's what I say!			",9,2,0,12,1,0,3

You lose a few things, but they're not consequential enough to be a big concern.I've been playing (and loving) this series since HOMM2. This is a solid entry in the series, though by no means the best in the series. If you like the series and can pick it up on sale, I think it's worthwhile. It introduced some interesting new features, some of which work quite well. If nothing else, it will keep you busy while you wait for bug fixes and a price drop on Heroes VII.			",48,22,0,20,34,0,24

												I have to say i love the game. Others don't. Respect everyone's opinion. But something seriously needs to be done with Uplay. Failing to synchronise saves is also (i say also cause it's always) a problem after doing a format your pc. Let me give you an example. Say that you were in the middle of a campaign as i was:1st: you have to start the mission from the beginning cause (guess what) your save is not there...wow some serious black magic done there2nd: by starting to play the mission from the beginning, i say the mission not the whole campaign, even if it is the 3rd or 4rth mission your main hero is LEVEL god damn 1. So this will lead you on the 3rd step3rd: you start the campaign from the beginning cause in the mission 3 or 4 you were your LEVEL 1 hero doesn't stand a chance to win against other heroes.GG thank you. Yet i love the game. Please, i say please, fix Uplay sync.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I saw this game got a mixed review, and honestly i do not understand why.Surely you have to be online to play + the uplay client. And? This seems to be the source of many negative reviews. I find this strange since it is not that hard to log in to another client. But lets talk about the game instead:+ Really nice graphics, especially in the Haven and Sanctuary campaing, in my opinion those waterfalls and flooded areas are trully beautiful. + As far as i remember there were some earlygame imbalances but they got fixed by patches so now the game is really balanced creaturewise. + Good ingame music.+ The campaign was really good. Finally not a linear story where you unlock the next campaign by finishing the previous one. The stories happen at the same time so i highly recommend to look up the order the chapters are played out since it gives an extra epic feeling that the whole of Ashan is involved. The campaigns intertwine so it is possible to not understand the story if you just complete one campaign and then start another.Honestly the only negative thing about this game is that sometimes you can feel that the computer ""cheats"". Gets out too many units from too few castles. Oh and maybe that the magic trait heroes are a bit superior to the might heroes.  :)All in all i had a lot of fun with this game, i recommend it!

												Hours played: 0Don't buy this game, it's just not worth dealing with Uplay. Got banned for trying to log in. GG Ubisoft.--Update 1--Finally got to play the game a little! All I can say is that I'm sad. The moment you lose internet connection, CONFLUX kicks you out to the main menu with no option to save. Now this wouldn't normally be a problem for me but this happens randomly when my internet is fine. Right now I can't even log back into the game because CONFLUX thinks I have no internet.The biggest pitty of all is that it actually seems like a pretty good game, the little I saw of it.Still the worst implementation of DRM I have ever seen. Don't buy this game.			",76,44,0,34,8,0,25

												Despite the countless bugs present in the game upon release (and no doubt still lots left to fix), the game lives up to a long-time fan's expectations. If you liked all previous Heroes games, III was your favourite, and loathed IV, this game certainly is something you are going to enjoy.			",169,97,1,41,24,2,60

												The game doesn't even start because Uplay crashes on launch. That alone awards it a negative review. As for the game itself. The single player is horrendously unfair. The towns, which used to be the biggest medium for the fantasy of each nation, are ugly, flat, and overall repulsing. I didn't mind the reduction of the number of resources, but the change which introduced the area capture turned the game into chasing enemy heroes in circles. I was also so very excited for the new Sanctuary faction, but it was not enough to salvage my opinion of this one. I hope the next one will be better, but I don't hold much hope.

												yeah, i'm late to the party as i just recently bought and played this game (i had other priorities). anyway, i played almost all HoMM games except the first one so i can safely say that im a vet. With HoMM 6, i feel there's this still ""magic"" that made me played the previous games. the story is not as much as good as HoMM 3 but it's still decent. my only gripe is the addition of UPlay but didnt stop me from buying (on sale!!) and playing this game.

												Might & Magic: Heroes VI - Shades of Darkness was a pretty huge dissapointment. The ""Stand Alone"" game actually just unlocks some basic DLC seemingly already existing in the game (I don't believe it even downloaded anything). There wasn't a lot of new content, either. Basically, this was just an expensive additional campaign (or two?) and completely not worth being marketed and sold as a seperate game, which it absolutely was not.Might and Magic VI generally was disappointing. The requirement that it run through Uplay was stupid, the ""dynasty weapons"" were stupid, honestly, there really were not any great improvements to the franchise. The story line wasn't terrible, but on the whole: V was better. IV was better. III was better.My only other beef is that the game tends to be a bit too easy - you can go entire maps without losing more than a few dozen from your army, with flawless victories being standard, yet still you have to fight most of the battles since most enemies won't run.

												Whether you play one of the campaigns, a one-off game, or a multiplayer match, you must choose from one of the five factions. Each faction has a different town in which it can construct unique buildings and recruit seven faction-specific creature types. The medieval Haven, hellish Inferno, and ghoulish Necropolis factions will be instantly familiar to veterans of the series, as might the snarling Stronghold faction introduced in Heroes of Might and Magic V: Tribes of the East. The Sanctuary faction, on the other hand, is entirely new and makes a great addition to the existing roster. The blue and green temples of a Sanctuary town feature the curved eaves of Japanese pagodas and sit atop flowing waterfalls. The creatures also draw on Eastern inspiration, including slithering, four-armed samurais (kenseis) and ethereal, kimono-clad water spirits (snow maidens).			",192,29,5,16,19,1,38

												A great addition to the M&M game family.  Sucessor to the long M&M turn-based strategy franchise this game includes all the features that have made the franchise shine and brings multitudes of new features to the table.  As a long time fan of this series I was worried, M&M V wasn't the game I was hoping it would be.  All of my concerns have been put to rest with this game.  With an expansive single player campaign and multiplayer experience this game blew all of my expectations out of the water.Easily one of the best in the M&M turn-based family.100/10			",116,22,2,20,15,0,16

												I bought this game for me and my friend with high exception for crashes , Uplay bugs, Conflux disconnections etc etc. I was very surprised to see that the game work perfectly fine for me and my friend. I hope to stay that way in future. What I need to say more about this game that no one ever say before me. It's good solid RPG/Tactic strategy. It's not masterpiece like Heroes Of Might & Magic III, but the game still worth playing with a friend or just enjoy the great atmospheric campaign. One of the most lovable things in Heroes VI for me is the music. It's add a lot to the game . I spent 5 Euro (on sale) for this game. And this is equal to one bottle of beer. I can't give this game thumb down. For all other users that have problems with Uplay & Conflux I really sorry and feel their pain.			",28,5,1,14,1,0,10

												Its possibly an amazing game, ive heard so much good about it, and ive always been a heroes of might and magic fan.BUUUUUT, and thats a real big but, i cant connect to the conflux. No chance. Ive reinstalled the game at every opportunity, ive browsed a sea of forums and ive done things to my router which could make a grown man cry, and yet that conflux is as confluxing as ever. so now after having to try (and fail) to dea with the conflux, i feel my feelings about heroes are a bit conflicted, on one hand, i love the games, on the other hand i utterly loathe ubisoft and all they stand for.So to you, potential buyer of this game i say this, if youre up to the russian roulette that is the conflux, all the more power to you, if you win, thats great! But i will sit here with my head full of bullet wounds and wait for heroes 7, and see if ubi maybe are able to reedeem their past sins. though my hope is faltering.			",143,21,1,28,19,0,27

												I had the game when it came out and managed to play a lot.My son destroyed several games while playing including this one.Last year i decided to buy it on steam,the complete edition,since is somewhat safer and was including  also all dlcs wich i didnt managed to buy or werent out yet,and was also on sale.i was excited to try try it again and was really happy about the dlcs.But i didnt took in consideration the Steam.instead of complete package i got just the original game and one dlc.That means no free items or whatever else weas included for having the complete edition.Also not being able to play the dlcs.I sended several emails to the steam support but got no answer or at most a we will work on it.after an year i am still not able to play the dlcs and still no answer from support.So my opinion is to buy the game if you really want to play it,but buy the complete edition at your own risk.I made some research and it seems there is a huge group of people who are in same situation like me,no dlc,no answer etc.I normally dont do reviews but this made me so angry,i couldnt keep it in anymore.Avoid the complete edition and buy all separate.Or pirate it.Or play MoM V,wich is better.Or buy MoM III,wich i find the best of them.

												Because Ubisoft. Probably the most customer unfriendly software company in the World (only rival is MicroSoft)I thought ... I thought ... I dunno what I thought ... I thought the game looked kinda ok and it was 75%, $25USD (bit more in my currency) for the entire series to date, maybe it was worth risking Ubisoft. I was wrong. Now Ubisoft noew has $25 of my money I strongly feel it does not deserve. Haven't played the game yet. Downloaded 10g last night, launched the ""game"" in Steam, which actually launched the Ubisoft game launcher instead. Writing review while I wait to install and update itself ... and the launcher has reached the login screen and crashed. Great game.Memo to Ubisoft: Your reputation has been trashed beyond redemption. If you wish to continue as a software company I recommend that you change your name, your logo, hide all links to your past that you can. Do not ship your products with DRM that punishes your customers or slow and unrealiable game launchers that give your frustrated customers time to post negative reviews about your productsedit: Still unable to even start the game because the Uplay launcher keeps crashing.

												To all those reviews about Yplay must always be online in order to play. It has an offline mode like steam does and it works fine. Yes you must redownload Uplay from Ubisoft, because the Uplay Version of the game doesn't work, but that is a minor thing. Heroes 6 is a great game. You can compare it to Homm3 or Homm5, but why would you do  that? You don't want to play the exact same game with new graphics. You want a new game with similar mechanics and same theme, but still we want some innovation. I like how your actions determine if your hero turns good or evil. Also the models and graphics are really good. The interface is very appealing and I like how you have a vast variety of skills to choose from for your hero. (a better system then Homm3 or Homm5)But what I like the most is, that you can now convert Dwellings into your own (as well can the enemy). That means exploring the world and finding any kind of Dwellings is very important and fun, Also guariding the Dwellings is now a considerable actions. (something I never did in the previous installment).Well I'm still at the beginning, but it looks like it is a worthy successor for Heroes of might and magic.			",126,28,1,31,10,1,29

												 After more than 3 years of the game's release it's still not yet finished. After setting up Uplay, dealing with its compatibility problems the game freezes at a certain point and nothing can be done with it. It's quite pathetic, even the Gothic games were fixed or using some trick you could avoid the bugs. But no, you can't advance in Heroes 6. While the 7th is upcoming this game is still not finished, and I assume it never will be. For this betaness a huge minus from me. Dont waste your money on this game, huge pity for it though. Could have been awesome, but the developers (or the Ubisoft) didn't even bother themselves finishing it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The game mechanics and look are pretty appealing and I was really happy to dive into it, up until I realized how badly balanced the difficulty is. The AI cheats a lot, to the point where games starts to be really annoying and even unbeatable. Of course I read some advice on different forums where people said that there's a specific way you should play to be able to get through campaigns, but where's fun in that?If you're into exploring and advancing your heroes to higher levels before running a war, you're not gonna have a lot of fun with this one. Such a shame.			",108,30,0,19,12,1,13

												The game itself is pretty good.It consists of economy management and tactical turn-based combat, using either of five factions who are fun to play but not always very well balanced against each other. You are in control of one or more heroes, who level up after winning enough combats with your army, learning new skills and what-not to use in the following combats. You construct buildings in your towns to recruit soldiers or give other benefits, and you'll soon find out that you're always in the lacks of blood crystals, inciting your continuous exploration. A collecting of sometimes murderously challenging campaigns (at least one for each faction) makes you fine-tune your strategy. This is all pretty damn fun.The factions:Haven - the boring faction consisting of boring humans and some light-aligned creatures. They focus on luck manipulation and light magic - a magic 3 of the other factions are mostly weak to.Necropolis - a faction consisting of undead who compensate for their lack of morale buffs with the ability to revive fallen creatures using necromancy. They can be quite difficult to play, since they require you to have no losses what-so-ever to excel, but once you get hold of their penultimate building you can revive ALL fallen creatures from your former battles...providing your economy is strong enough.Inferno - a bunch of demons zerg rushing across the field. They die a lot. That's pretty much it.Stronghold - a faction of orcs, focusing on rushing and trolling the enemy. For example, goblins can put invisible traps on the battlefield, maulers get stronger if they are attacked, harpies can attack then fly away, centaurs shoot reaction shots when your opponent move across the field, etc. Pretty damn fun.Sanctuary - my personal favourite faction, focused on fighting honorably, one-on-one, and also water magics. They have a mixture of tanky units, strong ranged units, an ability that provides extra tankiness to all units provided you fight honorably, a lot of units that debuff the enemy - debuffs your hero can specialize in enhancing and last, but not least, a freaking water spirit dragon as a penultimate creature that can, if played right, carry your entire army across the field in one turn.I have postponed the bad things about this game until here. The ""bad things"" have a name - Ubisoft. First of all, you require UPlay to play this game. I almost committed sepukku once I'd been forced to sign up, but I was able to pull through. Ubisoft are dead-set on becoming the new EA, hated by everyone for ruining games. Not only did Ubisoft pull away resources and personel from the development team, leaving them with less to work with on the same timeframe. Not only did Ubisoft sabotage the development of the campaign by handing in the script for the story way too late to the devs, but they're still ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ly enough to put ""PAY FOR MORE DLC"" in the ♥♥♥♥ing main menu! You know, the first thing you see after you've paid for the ♥♥♥♥ing thing! Furthermore, there's a stupid meta-system called ""dynasty"", which gives ALL of your heroes perks depending on global experience gathered because do you know what's fun in multiplayer strategy games? Starting with unequal circumstances because of arbitrary ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t, that's what everyone wants!In short: a good game that could have been great if not for Ubisoft.			",100,21,0,14,2,0,15

												You are forced to install and use Uplay to play the game, to play the full game, need to be all time connected to Uplay service but it disconects from time to time with no reason, each time the game stops, no matter what you are doing (in middle of a battle or what ever) and returns to main menu until you reconect back to Uplay.Games are saved on Uplay so you cant continue playing your current saved game until you reconect, (play with autosaves  every turn so you dont lose too much on each disconection).Sometimes Uplay just dont work at all and you need to stop playing until it turns on.

												For some, HoMM died around 3 or 4.This actually picks up a bit of the old feeling, mixed with some interesting new leveling aspects and ""new"" graphics. Not that the visual are stunning; think ""polished Warcraft 3"".Leveling system gives some level of freedom to customise how you play, with a somewhat broad group of skills to chose from.Creatures are oddly balanced...!All in all; great way to kill some time, and would recommend picking it up if/when it goes on sale - if you liked Heroes of Might and Magic 3/4.

												Honestly this game annoys me heavily on story and gameplay elements, least in the campaign.I played to just the second level so far, where the masoleum you captured is now your home base. Apparently your lead is such a♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥that he has lost....3-4 towns and not even realized it along with orcs dying, orcs you never actually get to see for more then just cut sceens and a very very very tiny group that joins you. Yet the orc ally won't shut the hell up, and is supposedly there and helping you yet never actually is, no reinforcments etc. From the get go your town is limited so much, that you can't even get the second level of troops for more then one type, meaning the rest troops are okay to just plainly just bad. To get the sisters to half way decent, you have to conquer a town that makes absolutely no sense why.For this town in question, you have a cut sceen where the ghost ancestor is fighting wolf troops, they win of course and you are right there, both teams in the open, out of cut sceen the ancestor is back snuggly within a town locked behind walls. After you beat him, instead of you being cool or anything your mom (reagent) comes by for ten seconds, sends the ancestor on his way, and guess what, she ditches your♥♥♥♥♥ no troops, no real reward. At this point in the game I have 40k+ gold because I literally can't spend it on anything and over 100 of each type of material. I can't hire troops either, since I have to wait for a week, just to be able to recruit, that means no mercenaries for hire (that might happen later in game)But my point is, this game is horribly paced, unbalanced, and just...bland the events in it are often criss crossing and have no rhym or reason. Oh and for the alignment system...it has more to do with your spells and such, then how you actually are. So once again limiting you down heavily.In short, this is more like a really bad jrpg then a heroes of might and magic game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												After two years of game the game crashing on entering a town and problems regarding UPlay, I was finally able to play the game. Gameplay is mediocre at best, load times are too long, and, as a Heroes III fan, the graphics seem to be unnecessary. If they put the budget into good gameplay, they might have had a good game. For fans of the franchise that have to have every game, get it when it is on a Steam Sale. Also, only 1 ""special"" resource. This was a major misstep, and oversimplifies the resource acquisition. It looks like they are fixing this issue in HOMM VII, but I am still very cautious about that game, as of how bad this one is.			",207,60,3,36,21,2,25

												Heroes VI is a difficult game to review. Does it stack up to previous HOMM games? Definitely not, this is a simplified version of what we have come to love. There are less resources and much less micro management in terms of obtaining the correct resources and even spells. If you still fire up HOMM 3 every now and then this wont even seem like the same game. And that is exactly how you have to treat it, as a different game and then you can see some of its merits. There is fun to be had in this game. The creatures are well thought out and the battles are satisfying. This is without a doubt the worst HOMM game but if it is on sale it is worth it if you are looking for a less intense HOMM session that generally will be a much shorter game.I also have to mention the performance of the game, it is very very poorly optimised and will struggle to produce decent framerates even on a high end computer. When it was launched, it was loaded with game breaking bugs, but for the most part these have been fixed. HOMM VI is a game I do recommend but with a very large asterisk next to it.

												I've been playing HoMM games for a long time. Juat something about them keeps me glued to the screen for hours that only feel like minutes.Whether it's the mild city managament, the building of and using large armies, or the half baked story, I do not know, but I always enjoying losing a night to these games.

												Personally, I am a fan of the game. I don't think the story is as bad as most people imply. The graphics are a huge improvement from the last one. Overall, it's a good game especially at the current price. Does it have more potential? Absolutely, however, at its current state with its current price (or even with the Steam winter sale coming up), it's worth you giving it some of your time.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Most have started with Uplay so I will skip, yes it sucks but bareable.My issue is the AI, no matter if you are on Easy or Hard it is no matter you will not win.  The AI balance is way off in a game that limits how many people you can recruit based on a weekly basis the AI is not afforded the same handicap, you will find many scenarios are unbeatable, by logical mathmatics you cannot succeed.  The last battle I played I beat the main character who had a huge army celebrating his retreat I find he comes right back out of his base with the exact same huge army, this was only one of many times I noticed things simply didn't add up.  Don't take my word for it heed the hundreds of other reviews that say the exact same thing.  This game is decent and playable on multiplayer against other humans.  Don't even bother with the campaign.Second issue, the story after leaving us with a huge cliff hanger on the last installment do they follow up and make it worth your purchase?  Nope, completely ignored the elephant in the room.  The new story is completely dry and uninviting which is par for the course of post 2000 Ubisoft.If the game costs $.01 go buy a pennie candy you will get more enjoyment.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												After 2 years of release, you would think they have fixed all the bugs. Not so. The game crashed right at the uplay launcher. It can only run with Admin mode... and in the game, it crashed randomly.  The game only allows you to save  to the cloud and it crashed when tried to sync to the cloud. The uplay online play is cumbersome and extremely annoying. Never learn that playing game can be this painful. Never buy another uBisoft game again.			",177,77,7,39,26,5,55

												A must for tactical games enthusiasts with hardcore RPG elements. Deep characters, extremely detailed world and packed with heaps of lore and fantasy elements. The colors are extremely vivid and just outright gorgeous, probably the prettiest colors I've seen in a PC game so far. The soundtrack was beautifully crafted, being very pleasant to the ear and fitting to the game's atmosphere at all times. Online play is quite satisfactory and will keep you interested along with the game's already massive natural appeal in it's own right. If you liked games like Warcraft 3 and enjoys turn-based strategy you can't go wrong with this game, it's one of the finest blends of such genres so far, you'll find it's gameplay quite unique.I suggest buying the complete version, as it is much, much cheaper than buying the standalone expansions afterwards. You won't regret it!			",6,4,0,12,1,0,3

												This game has had quite a mixed reception among throughout the HOMM community and i really am at quite a loss to explain why. One way of filtering out the unjust negativity though is to ignore the near endless ""not as good as HOMM3"" comments as there are simply too many people who will always say this no matter what features the next HOMM game brings. This title intoduces several new features over it's predecessors, most notably the dynasty weapons, traits and heroes, which are saved and can be used in any skirmish game once unlocked. Graphically it is the best version of HOMM by far and while there are many new features that debut in this title, the core gameplay allows anyone familiar with the HOMM series to get stuck in immediately. The game does suffer from the occasional graphics glitch and the campaign is extremely unforgiving at times, but these flaws do not sour the experience at all. This IS the best HOMM title to date.

												Ok..so this is the first time I actually decided to give my opinion on a purchase. Frankly i'm kinda amazed at all the negative comments. But to be fair I just have not encountered ANY of the issues others are complaining about. Keep in mind Ive only played it for about 3 hours. YES... the game does need UPlay to run. If this an issue for you do not buy it. To me it is no big deal. However they SHOULD put that in the Description so people that this is an issue for KNOW it before the purchase.THat being said...I haven't played the Might and Magic series since it was on 3.5 disks. I just remember that i really enjoyed playing the game so I decided to try this one. I only paid 7.50 for it so i figured no biggie if i didn't like it. But so far i LOVE IT. The installation went flawlessly...and since i already had a U-Play account that part of it was also seamless and i had ZERO issues launching the game after installation. When it asks for the CD Key you need to put in the KEY for the Main game ONLY. The DLC codes are updated automatically I assume since I never had to put them in but they are available from the beginning. As far as bad acting goes...(voicovers) umm really ??? that matters to people ??? Oh well I guess i am just to interested in Gameplay ...not so much on dialog...especially in a game like this. Now if it was a survival horror or fantasy first person rpg where story is super important for atmosphere or moving the story along then yeah Dialog and acting is important but for this particular game ehh!!!Graphics are great and gameplay is simple even if you have NEVER played a Might and Magic game before. I am running an old duo core amd 3.2 CPU with 8 GB ram and a Radeaon 4650  with 1gb ram and have zero issues so far with crashes or lock ups. THe game runs smooth and looks amazing compared to the older M&M games that I remember. As far as the other issues that some of the more experienced M&M players have talked about I just have not had any yet. Over all I think this a great game for those of us that like Turn Based as opposed to Real Time strategy games and i would recommend it (WHILE IT IS ON SALE) to anyone that is into Turn Based Fantasy Stategy games. That is my humble opinion and EVERYONE is entitled to MY opinion!!!  :) Peace			",39,18,2,16,16,1,6

												Still very mixed on the game. It seems dumbed-down from V and the online system is almost pointless, You can play the game offline but you miss out on some level perks. To me this was really poorly executed and a disappointment overall. It feels like a step in the wrong direction. Not a step back, just stumbled a little of course. Could I recommend the game? No, Unless it's under $10 and you are a fan of the series. Then it might be worth it to see some of the new mobs and mechanics. It looks great and some the units specials are cool to use but their are sound glitches and it looks like they have abandoned this game so I wouldn't expect any customer support. Oh and the difficulty level is just dumb. Easy is Normal or sometimes too Easy and Normal ranges from normal to ""wtf, how many reloads is this now on this level?"". Plus there is some weird glitch that if you select for the AI to take control and fight the battle against the AI, the outcome is usually more favorable than if the player were to battle it.

												Whether you play one of the campaigns, a one-off game, or a multiplayer match, you must choose from one of the five factions. Each faction has a different town in which it can construct unique buildings and recruit seven faction-specific creature types. The medieval Haven, hellish Inferno, and ghoulish Necropolis factions will be instantly familiar to veterans of the series, as might the snarling Stronghold faction introduced in Heroes of Might and Magic V: Tribes of the East. The Sanctuary faction, on the other hand, is entirely new and makes a great addition to the existing roster. The blue and green temples of a Sanctuary town feature the curved eaves of Japanese pagodas and sit atop flowing waterfalls. The creatures also draw on Eastern inspiration, including slithering, four-armed samurais (kenseis) and ethereal, kimono-clad water spirits (snow maidens).			",192,29,5,16,19,1,38

												Might & Magic: Heroes VI is a excellent installment in the series - it provides hours upon hours of turnbased fun. It features good graphics and sound effects, although you may run into troubles if you use the highest graphic settings while playing on a older PC.It features various, by now well-known factions and a story for each of them, combined with two independent DLCs which add actual content to the game.The only downside - aside of the ubisoft launcher, of course - that I could find was the leveling system. You earn experience for everything you do and so your account level up slowly. Very slowly. Although it requires you to use the Ubisoft-Launcher it is a good game; if you are a fan of turnbased games I can only recommend you this game.			",720,196,26,109,67,7,141

												Heroes 6 can be described as massive. It could also be described as tedious and arbitary. The size of this game is colossal. There is so much to do and to customise, it is hard to know where to start. The turnside of this is that it is hard to come to grips with, and slow. The game offers you deep strategic gameplay and character building, but progress is slow and enemies grow too powerful too fast. Which leads to tedious grinding and almost boring gameplay which was exicting a turn earlier. But none of this troubles you when you are immersed in this grand and excellent experience of top notch rpg tactic. And that is the problem, you cannot get immersed because of Ubisofts ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ DRM. You'll spend more time trying to get the save files synched than actually playing. Actually getting the game to work merits an achievement cause you need to verify so many codes and agreements it's almost unheard of. Honestly, the game itself is terrific, but the included shackles are very stifling.			",192,21,8,22,19,2,33

												Too much attempts to look like WoW with stories and worlds, And the gameplay is also dissapointing compared to the third game. Until I played the game for real, It cannot measure with Heroes 3 but this game is really awesome.After a few hours you get into the campaign story, And the enchanced multiplayer is also very good. I look forward to future games in quality. This game has good graphics, But they should have been even better with the cutscenes. And the talking. Gameplay itself, Strategy combats are as usual very funny. But for the next game like this, It would be nice to see a Heroes 3 but as a new game, With new stories and graphics but still designed the same way. I give this game 9/10 in score... Of course I love the Might & Magic Series. It is a fun game and I recommend it to strategy lovers, It is worth it in the end.

												An extremely fun and well-crafted combination of RPG and turn-based strategy. Adventure and level up with your Heroes - earning skills, spells, and items along the way... but also engage in complex combat sequences of turn-based strategy - involving armies of various units (with various characteristics and abilities) on an isometric grid, similar to a large chess board.Imagine Warcraft (the original RTS games) but everything is turn-based and combat occurs on the ""chess-board"" screens. You have bases (cities and forts), you collect resources with mines, lumber mills, etc, and you buy new units as time goes on.Warning: the game is a bit buggy, including a few game-breaking bugs that are best avoided if possible (check forums if you are concerned. But Ubisoft is continuously patching these bugs... or so they say, anyway.Still, very fun game, I've already put 200+ hours into it in a couple weeks, and I've barely scratched the surface of the various single player campaigns and mutiplayer options. I recommend it to any RPG and/or strategy fans.			",45,10,1,7,7,0,6

												Latest iteration of Might & Magic: Heroes, nothing revolutionary here.Graphics, Audio, Interface, Gameplay and Story are all good.Warning: uses Ubisoft DRM. Avoid the overpriced expansion/DLC. Buy if on sale and you love Fantasy 4X, avoid if you don't know what that means.			",265,192,6,41,35,0,60

												A good game, although Ubi's always online thing is kinda annoying. Good unit variety (and reasonable balance), a decently challenging AI, and a long play time (each map will take a good couple hours) make for a real time leech.			",352,49,7,56,38,7,84

												This game simply does not work!  It forces you to use the Ubisoft Uplay service to even open the game.After installing, updating & registering for this service it constantly states that it is offline.I followed several articles on the steam forums and elsewhere & have successfully managed to start the game, but once open I cannot play the campaign, because, guess what, you need to be connected to the Ubisoft Uplay service (at least once) to even start a single player campaign.If you are looking to purchase this game as of 08/12/2014 I would strongly recommend that you do not purchase it as it appears they no longer run the required servers / services to use it or it is simply broken & not worth their time to fix it.

												Better then 5, Leaps and bounds better than 4, but not better then 3. Lets face it, 3 was the apex of this series. It could have been as good as 3, it had the same feel to it. The only thing that it lacked, the only thing that held it back was a simple AUTO BATTLE button. You have to fight every single battle there is. You could have an army that would shake the world in this game, but up against some creature gaurding something that doestn run or surrender, even though there is ony like 10 of them, you have to fight. Making small, non significant battles, where you know you are going to win 100% because you have 300 dragons vs 50 Gosh Darn Sprites, You have to play it. taking 3-4 min of your time to beat something that you should be able to say to the game ""Auto solve this for me will ya!"" If it wasnt for that, it would have lived up to its older brother 3. That pitfall makes the game feel tidious and lackluster. 6/10			",97,28,0,15,0,2,9

												First of all, the game is good. HOWEVER, try to play a few hours in single player and then suddenly, server discconection. Even when you press save file, all your files will be deleted, making it almost unplayable because you will need to start from scratch. I WAS PLAYING SINGLE PLAYER... why do i need to connect to the internet to play single player? Very very terrible, I saw reviews about this issue, but that was few months ago last year. So I thought 'well, im sure they would've fixed something like that' apparantly not. DONT BUY IT, SAVE URSELF THE TROUBLE.			",37,12,0,9,1,0,7

												Heroes of Might and Magic III is an all-time great. It remains the perfect game, the pinnacle of the series and one of the best turn-based strategy games. Devotees have been awaiting the series return to this mark but sadly, each subsequent game has fallen short. The latest entry, Might & Magic: Heroes VI, further distanced the series from its former accolades and remains the worst of the version yet.Revising the word direction from Heroes of Might and Magic to Might & Magic: Heroes is a minor, albeit odd change and representative of Ubisoft’s apparent disdain of the series’ history, which was formerly known as HOMM.The graphics have improved, but this style of game was never about the graphics.One of the biggest changes is the opening up all heroes for hire from the start. There is no longer the choice of two random heroes at the tavern. You can scroll through the entire cast and pick whomever you want. The hero change does not end there in that you can pick any skill upon level up. These two changes considerably change the game for the worse. It was a fun trademark of Homm to check your two each week to see what heroes were available. This eliminates a sense of randomness and uniqueness that each game held in the past. It also leads a player to pick their favorite hero each game rather than being faced with the decision to choose between two random heroes. Additionally, classic level ups required careful decision, with a bit of luck, to pick the best skills for your play style. The changes in Heroes VI eliminate those gameplay mechanics and ultimately decrease the fun of the game.The resources have also been scaled back to just gold, wood, ore and crystals. This is another change that eliminates critical components of the core game. Managing resources, picking up piles and fighting for mines were a fun part of the original games. The mines are also tied to castles now and you cannot control them over until you take the town. This is ridiculous and eliminates the ability to cutoff an opponent’s supply lines if said opponent decides to stay and defend in town. This was another component of the old game that has been removed. You could choose to go straight for a town and affect a brute force finish or choose to slowly buildup, control the map and hamper your opponent’s production. This is another choice eliminated from the game.What remains is no longer the core Heroes games. Choice is eliminated and it has become incredibly linear. This is not the Heroes I remember or wish to play.One strength of HOMM3 was the random map generator, which excelled at creating balanced maps and gave the game an unprecedented level of replayability. This feature has not returned and the offering of maps in Heroes VI is laughably slim. This game is severely lacking in actual content. One of the only quantifiable additions is Ubisoft's inclusion of its atrocious UPLAY software, which you are forced to install and suffer with.Ubisoft just does not get it. They are hard at work on part seven and it looks much the same as part six. They are holding votes to pick which factions you would like to see in the end game. This false sense of choice is insulting. A better service would be to over deliver and provide all of the towns they have conceived. Part seven, like six is shaping up to have less content, less options, less variety and much less replayability than a game that was released in the 90s. This series would be better served by being retired rather than being revised for another bi-annual cash grab.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I have not beaten this one yet, but I did play a heck of a lot of Heros III, and this is a major improvement on that title. The animations or each creature are really detailed and I'm a huge sucker for voice-acting, but they even have voice-scripted narrative too.  And so far I really like the narrative.  My only beef with this game is really just Uplay. You have to create a Uplay account before you can play the game, and it's not entirely intuitive what key they want.  You'll figure it out eventually though. This is a big improvement on the Heros of M&M series and I officially reccomend it for those people who like turn-based combat/strategy games.
