												If you dug Morrowind's oppressive atmosphere (and ultimately totally op magic) but want a far more narrowly-focused experience with sexy snake women, a surprisingly immersive gesture-based magic casting system. Simple trolls wearing sumo diapers - then you have very specific tastes, and while this game does provide those things, you should probably lower your standards in general for your own wellbeing. You lovable nut.			",78,13,0,12,5,0,7

												Challenging and highly atmospheric, if also heavily flawed, dungeon crawler/immersive sim that is in many ways highly reminiscent of Looking Glass Studios classics. You'll journey trough decaying underground world filled with dark ritual, bloodthirsty enemies and eldritch horrors. Patience, experimentation and careful exploration are often rewarded, and also quite often -required- in a way that is rarely seen in modern games: Arx offers little to no hand holding to players during their journey through its sprawling, interconnected dungeons - thorough exploration and paying attention to clues and readables are keys to making any sort of progress!Game isn't without flaws tho: magic system, while original and also quite impressive in a sheer number of offered spells and their possible effects, is also somewhat clunky, and spellcasting is often unresponsive. Controls & interface in general will take some time to get used to.While game offers to player a freedom to develop his character in many possible directions, some skills are definitely far more useful than others, and some playstyles are far less developed than others. Stealth system for example is quite unrefined, and while it is sometimes useful and at some points borderline required to sneak (say early encounters with dreaded Ylside warriors), stealth tends to be rather useless and unsatisfying.There is quite a bit of different types of fun-to-use melee weapons, each with their own pros and cons. Ranged combat on the other hand, while quite useful at times, is made unnecessarily monotonous by the fact that the player is offered all of -two- bows, second one being pretty much unreachable on first playthrough without any outside help.Still, I'd say this game's assorted shortcomings are -very much- worth dealing with, and are far, FAR outweighed by its many qualities.Pretty much recommended to anyone with some patience and willingness to deal with game's flaws and idiosyncrasies.Also, i highly recommend using Arx Libertatis: it offers additional bug fixes and eliminates issues with modern hardware.

												This is definitely a title I'd say is ""underrated"". It's a relatively obscure RPG title that gives a fairly interesting setting and good mechanics. The game is good overall, but it's definitely rough around the edges. PROS:The game is pretty immersive, with full first person and complete view of limbs and equipment. There are plenty of things to loot, plenty of things to kill. The game is also very atmospheric: lots of dank caves with dark ambience playing. The RPG elements are mostly good, but there's not much character interaction, no real dialogue trees. I have a lot of fun exploring dungeons in the game, they can go pretty deep and pretty wide. There are lots of immersive touches, like having to drag things manually into the inventory, to manually drawing runes to cast spells, to even staking zombies to make sure they stay dead. It helps make the game feel alive. _____CONS: The game barely conveys any information to the player; I've had to rely on walkthroughs extensively. The journal is worthless, it tells nothing about current tasks or reminders of where to go. If important details from dialogue are missed, they can't be found again. Navigation is nightmarish as there are no clear paths to get to locations, everything is located on separate underground levels. The game also is unbalanced in terms of combat and specialization. Playing as a thief or as just a warrior is suicidal, as a certain kind of enemy late-game cannot be easily killed with brute force. I had to restart my game to play as a sort of battlemage build, and now everything is easier. _____It's a pretty mixed bag overall. If one likes RPGs with somewhat original settings, compelling mechanics, plenty of immersion, and plenty of loot, then this game is good if one can look past the glaring flaws.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is absolutely amazing. For the game from the year 2002 it has really interesting mechanics, the whole casting by drawing spells is an interesting idea. The cooking mechanics are also something I didn't see in any other RPG yet.  Recently I installed it again because I discovered the Arx Liberatis mod that fixes the game for the modern computers (adds FullHD resolution, fixes spell casting - be sure to have v-sync on)			",1763,685,87,200,243,29,293

Score: 4/5; I recommend Arx FatalisPC; Win XP 32-bit; Arx Fatalis v1.21completed; playing time: 74 hrsPros:+ An interesting storyline, NPCs, and quests+ A wide choice of spells and weapons+ The locations are varied enough, each with a distinctive atmosphere and decor+ Immersive sounds and voices in the background, especially in dungeons and catacombs+ You can use a shovel to dig stuff out of the ground or a pickaxe to get stuff out of rocks and graves, and knock down walls*+ You can use some weapons to carve wooden stakes to finish off some undead monsters+ You can steal, break into houses**+ Over time, you get hungry and need food+ You can cook your own food, catch fish, pick mushrooms, and prepare potions on your own (of course, you can also buy them)* not everywhere, only in some locations** the success depends on how you develop your skills when you level; if you don't develop the right skills, you won't be able to do it successfullyCons:- The spell casting mechanism is extremely annoying. Each spell consists of several rune letters. In order to cast a spell, you need to literally draw the runes on the screen with your mouse. In theory, it seems innovative and sounds like a lot of fun. However, it's not practical. You really need to be very accurate in drawing the runes; otherwise, you'll fail to cast your spells. It's extremely hard to do it in combat, as being under pressure (and battered by monsters), you often feel unable to focus on drawing, and usually fail to draw the runes accurately enough to be able to cast successfully. Luckily, you can pre-cast a few spells, but even pre-casting can sometimes be quite laborious. I would sometimes spend literally minutes trying to cast some spells consisting of the more difficult runes. For me, this was the most irritating part of the game.- Some aspects of the game seem to be a little unbalanced, e.g. Ylsides are extremely fast and strong, and they kill you within seconds - you can meet them early in the game, but you won't really be able to deal with them successfully until very late in the game; also, towards the end of the game, you may run out of life potions - you won't be able to buy them or find any plants to make them on your own- There are a few bugs and glitches here and there...- NPCs and monsters have a tendency to get caught in between various objects, like parts of walls, doors, etc. They simply get stuck and can't move. Well, that's how I killed a few Ylsides...- When saving, once I gave a name to a save file, I couldn't change it later- It's a 2002 game, so don't expect visuals like in Skyrim...All things considered, I experienced a lot more fun than irritation with this game. Therefore, in my opinion, the game is worth playing.			",740,351,7,132,62,2,175

												Highly recommended for those that have played and liked games like Ultima Underworld or Dungeon Master (Legend of Grimrock).The developers wanted to created Ultima Underworld 3 but were unable to get the license from you know who, which is a shame. With stronger resources this game could have been very special indeed. For an old game (2002), the graphics are pretty good and sound in some instances quite amazing, the game engine has aged well. I played the game of Steam and in Windows 7 and it was more or less playable apart from some memory crashes - I learned to save often using all the save slots - you need to do this too, especially when you move between levels. It is best to play the game without any background noise such as the TV/ music or radio - believe that. Not only will you get immersed in the game world, beautifully crafted by the designers, you won't miss key information said aloud by your character and then never repeated!It's a first person RPG/adventure set in a world where the sun has died so all races of the world live in a huge underground complex - the city is called Arx.Arx Fatalis = fatal fortress (Latin)The game does involve combat, magic and sneaking options. But most of the game requires exploring, adventuring, some puzzles (simple and fiendish) to solve, a lot of traversing to and fro.You begin the game in a prison cell and yep, you guessed right, no memory of who you are! Wow, not seen that in a video game before. There follows an escape from prison and a gradual understanding of where you are and of your destiny. You escape the prison and then move onwards to different levels of the underground world, such as mining caves, spooky crypts, ice cavern (dragon) and a strange snake level!  It takes a while to learn the mechanics of the game but you give it a chance as the rewards will be many! Above all read and print off the manual so you have it with you. Yes ladies and gentlemen, this game was produced in the days where manuals actually were required reading and gave hints on how to traverse the game. Believe me it will answer about 75% of your questions.Your character has the normal ST,INT,DEX etc stats as well as skills to develop such as magic, technical skill, intuition. Every time you level up these can be increased. Combat is similar to that found in Morrowind where I often found myself moving in and out of combat and swinging whatever weapon I was using at the time. Not great but ok. The magic system is something else, it is rune based and you need to draw patterns on screen with your mouse. This is pretty amazing and at the beginning you learn a new PC gaming skill - let's face it - that is pretty unique. Runes can be found or purchased and your journal will update to show the new spells you can cast. Oh - you reckon it would be pretty damn impossible to cast a fireball as a giant evil looking spider is looking to bite your head off? READ IMPORTANT - you can pre-save three magic spells! Read the manual properly for goodness sake - just do it.Your journal shows your character stats, armour, inventory, magic book of spells and runes, map and some key information about the game interface and quests you need to complete. I stress ""some"". As an assistant in following the game story - the journal is next to useless. Exploration is encouraged and the game engine allows you to do some innovative stuff. The map is pretty useless too. Use a fishing rod to catch raw fish and then cook them next to a flame. Combine water with flour to create dough and then bake to create bread. I think you can combine it with apple to make apple pie. Oh - you need to eat and your character will moan when he is hungry. Apparently hunger was pretty common in earlier versions of this game but I think the latter patches made this less acute. Saying that, I did go through a stage where I was baking and cooking stuff a lot! Later in the game I stopped hoarding food and just munched down anything I found.Your inventory is grid based and cannot be sorted, despite what some have said. You can stack some items and expand the size later in the game. This could be better as you spend too much time on inventory management. On the first play through you end up hoarding. As you learn all the tricks and want to do another play through, it will be less problematic.The storyline is quite interesting, you have no say on what needs to be done and there are no dialogue options. At certain points in the story a cut scene will update you. There a lot of hidden items and locations in the game and exploration is encouraged. The world is beautifully put together and there are some real unique places and characters to interact with. It is quite complex and therefore some things are not explained properly and you will need to do some internet research to help you progress. Some tips:Buy the key ring and combine all found keys with it.Learn how to pre cast spells - especially fireball.Read the manual and print it off.Learn how to make potions - especially heal. Learn it. The castle in the human city has an alchemist which allows you to distil potions.Don't worry about cash - I ended up with about £35k.Some magic rings will disappear from your inventory after a while, these have a 12/20 or something. Ring of Regeneration.Read the 'Races of Arx' book before going to find the dragon.Find the activate portal spell in game or online and write it down in the manual - for some reason this spell does not show in your spell book.Your character needs decent magic to progress end game due to very difficult melee warriors that will polish you off in two whacks.Don't worry about hoarding food - just eat stuff as and when you find it.Save often.Shops are not always open, progress the story line and come back.Check the keyboard control options to ensure you don't waste all your healing potions when trying to crawl or sneak!There are some negatives. If you don't READ THE MANUAL, expect some frustrations with the game engine. The great magic system is limited as not all the spells are equally useful and I tended to play the whole game with fireball. However, you need to have decent magic to complete the game, do not go all out as a fighter or thief. Not everything is spoon fed to you, ultimately you can get where you need to go just by adventuring but sometimes a specific ""go there"" would be appreciated. There are only about 10 levels which you seem to traverse back and forward a lot, learn how to use the portals or this can be frustrating. The game world is complex and many things can be interacted with - this is also a downfall as often you need to make assumptions about how things work together.Summary - really is a great and unique game if you like RPG or first person dungeon adventure. World is quite amazing. Some difficulty with the game engine which most can be sorted by READING THE MANUAL. 40 hours+ on first play through and a few side quests not completed. Repetitive towards the end as it suffers from lack of additional quests and locations which would allow greater use of spells and your character.Highly recommended to those looking for Ultima Underworld 3			",187,95,11,86,8,1,47

												Arx Fatalis is the 2002 brainchild of Arkane Studios, a studio that went on to make Dark Messiah of Might and Magic, and Dishonoured. Notably, the game was intended to be Ultima: Underworld III, but the studio was unable to obtain the license. Even without it, this has been hailed as the spiritual successor to Ultima: Underworld, and rightfully so.It's ""inspirations"" are as evident as they are positive. The right-click menu overlay, popular in its early 2000s peers, once again makes it return and proving that it never gets old. Arx Fatalis handles it a tad differently to others, keeping the overlay mostly bereft except for inventory and controlling the bulk through separate windows brought up via the journal. While manipulating the environment never gets old, the overlay itself does get clunky compared System Shock 2 or Morrowind. From inventories that give you separate windows when upgraded, instead of just making the existing window bigger, to useless, nigh unreadable maps, to the journal system that is Morrowind's, without all those pesky ""search"" functions.Arx Fatalis boasts an ""intelligent story"", which is laughable. You start as the amnesiac named Am Shaegar, find out your purpose is to save the world, and then save the world. Along the way you bear witness to some incredibly hammy voice-acting, which falls directly into ""so bad it's good"" tier.The worldbuilding itself is less hilariously trite. While the generic fantasy races stay generic fantasy races, the premise of being forced to live inside one big cavern system lends itself to some interesting towns and details - the giant pumps that flood the levels with air, for example. But Arx Fatalis hails to an era where the story wasn't the focal point of RPGs, pre-Infinity Engine. King Lunshire's one-dimensional antics and cults that just evil cults only provide the background for the real draw: dungeon delving.The game boasts being able to take care of enemies in a variety of ways. This is a lie. The game is based around a single playstyle - spellsword.  DEX skills are useless and will get you killed Stealth attacks cap out at 1.5 times the damage of a regular hit The gesture system only recognizes perfectly drawn signs Particles of your runes fly off while running Your mana regen is incredibly slow There's barely any bloody potionsYou may be able to fireball or stealth a goblin to death, but try pulling that on a Ylside warrior and watch your dangly bits get plastered to the ceiling. Your magic will always play second fiddle to your sword, and DEX doesn't get a fiddle at all.It's therefore a shame that the swordplay is so limited. Arx Fatalis falls into the traditional aRPG trap of having the majority of the combat be incredibly simple and boring. You take out your weapon. You charge up your weapon. You hit things with your weapon. There's several different animations but they change nothing. Footsies that amount to kiting. No real movesets, no real variety, and even the speed of combat is deplorably slow.It fails basic decisions/time game design, a common problem with these games. Buffs aside, you will largely be doing the same exact 3-step sequence from beginning to end.Thankfully the incredibly hard-hitting enemies combined with limited resources in the midst of battle, especially when up against a Ylside or a Lich, keeps these battles engaging to the end. They never become a chore. The payoff of lobbed limbs and exploding enemies is a bonus.The dungeons themselves are fantastic. Far from open-world, these areas are distinctly level based and are flooded with hidden secrets - which unlike the barren and uninteresting landscapes of open world games, have withstood the test of time.The rest of the game's elements are particularly notable. There's some sidequests, but the triggers are arbitrary and you'll most likely just luck into them. The puzzles you encounter within the dungeons themselves can quickly get tedious, and rely on searching the area for items or buttons which are hidden in annoying locations. Occasionally with physics, and Fatalis' physics system isn't as great as its item manipulation system.But it wouldn't be a true dungeon delver without puzzles, would it?Arx Fatalis is a relic, and its a relic in the best possible way. Hailing back to the best of Looking Glass' work and Ultima Underworld itself, for every clunky mechanic there's another aspect that counters it to make it work. If you're looking for an oppressive dungeon-delving game with brilliantly designed levels and inventory mechanics which don't treat you liked a fool, then I couldn't recommend Arx Fatalis more.

												Arx Fatalis is an amazing role playing game from the former half of the last decade. It features a very original world premise, it eternally snows so everyone lives underground in massive tunnel systems. it has a traditional rpg plot, but it feels immersive. Characters are seen as listless and antisocial, dreading their exile from the snowy abyss above.The game has a very intriguing magic system that allows you to draw glyphs to cast spells. It feels very intuiative and as such if you play a mage character you get used to certain glyph formations.Very recently Arkane released the source code for Arx and a source port named ""Arx Libertatis"" has been created, which finally allows players to play the game at a consistant framerate the way it was meant to be played when it first released.

												Please don't look at my ingame-time. Steam didn't count it correctly and I've played the game back when it was released ... for at least 100 hours. Seriously, I'm almost speechless when thinking about this game. The only thing I feel is love. Very strong love. Arx Fatalis was actually one of my very first games and back then I loved everything about the game: The design, the sounds, the characters, the gameplay, the dark world, the spells - and I still do. Even though this game is ""old"" now, it still is a masterpiece. Everything fits perfectly together. Of course, there are some bugs and glitches in the game and the gameplay has some bad things about it but still: It works and it's absolutely fun.Everyone: Please just give this game a chance. It's worth it. Especially for ~5€.By the way: I was very happy when I found out that Arx Fatalis was made by the same guys who made Dishonored as I really love this game too.

												Arx Fatalis is a good solid RPG. If you dont mind the slightly dated graphics I highly recommend you try it out.If you go find Arx Libertatis, its a 'mod' for the game, it'll use the game files that you download through Steam, but optimize the game for use on newer machines. Unfortunately it didnt count me as playing on Steam so my game time counter didnt go up.Initally I was a lil skeptical of the onscreen gestural magic stuff, I've never been good at drawing symbols with a mouse but the game lets you precast three spells to hotkeys so you can instant cast later which is awesome. Melee is basic but effective: hold mouse button, gem glows, more it glows the more damage you do, release mouse to strike.Anyways sound is decent, graphics are dated but not ugly, theres a combine/crafting system so you can make things like a fishing pole from a piece of wood and rope, and theres potion brewing. You might need a paper and pen to keep track of everything, the journal isn't very helpful.In closing definitely worth getting, especially at $5.			",128,80,0,43,22,0,36

												If I were to ask what PC dungeon crawler First Person RPG you played way back in the mid 2000s you'd probably say to me Morrowind. And with good reason, it's one of the best.But at the same time, another game came out by Arcane Studios that was shadowed by the success of Morrowind, a cult gem if you will of classic 3D PC gaming now all but virtuall forgotten save for a few souls who sought this title. What is Arx Fatalis? Is it good? Pros and Cons? Here's the run down.Arx Fatalis is a first person semi-linear dungeon crawler where you play the role of Am Shaegar, a fantasy John Doe who wakes to find himself naked in a goblin prison in a world where the sun has died and the surviving peoples habitate in underground fortress cities and mines. The story follows Am Shaegar as he seeks to reclaim his memory, but along the way gets tossed into a series of events that could mean the end of the peoples of Arx and even the world.While the story is strong in the beginning, by the middle act the it becomes predictable and there aren't any big plot twists or holy hell I didn't see that coming moments, but many of the characters and races of creatures of encounter and/or fight make that journey from start to finish interesting.Because this game is well over 10 years old, it hasn't aged well in terms of graphics. Even Morrowind, however, suffers the same issue, so don't take this as a con persay. However, I've found that the Steam version is a tad glitchy with its sounds or even graphics, whether that is an error on my end or not I can't be sure. Combat in this game is fun but takes a bit of time to get used to since depth in this world is a bit strange feeling when compared to modern first person games. There are dozens of weapons to find, enchant and utilize to bring death to the menagerie of baddies laid before you.Puzzles in this game are much like classic D&D puzzles or even old PC adventure games, which means they range from no♥♥♥♥♥♥easy to what the ♥♥♥♥ hard on the first playthrough. The magic system is also unique and I wished that Arcane had taken the time to re-explore that in later titles because the concept of drawing magic spells to cast them on the screen is quite fun, though a nightmare in the heat of combat.Difficulty can be...well, all over the board. Some enemies are unfairly overpowered even when you are higher level and certain spells and items that make fighting them easier aren't made clear in the game itself and are discovered through trial and error or game FAQs.Pros: There are some horror elements and classic RPG elements that make this game feel like a classic. It's not difficult to pick up and get into, the characters and world is quite interesting, and the sound design is haunting (I seriously made a recording years ago of just background sounds in this game to use for Table Top role playing). The magic system takes getting used to along with combat, but once is mastered can make it hard to go back to other games of that time.Cons: The game is sadly glitchy, the graphics did not age well and can lead to some headaches and eye strain during the first few minutes of play. Combat ranges from easy to unbeatable, puzzles aren't really spelled out, the map system needs work, and the story gets weak by the middle of the game. All in all I rank this a 3 out of 5, its a game from my youth that I loved that nostalgia draws me back to for fond memories and aggrivating flashbacks of unkillable bosses. Its well worth the price here on steam and there are patches and mods all over the internet that fix some of these complaints. I'd like to see an HD revamp or even remake of this game, so fingers crossed.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												0,0 hours - because playing with Arx Libertatis mod. Let's just say a few years ago I played Urban Chaos: Riot Response on PS2 and I got 100% in-game achievements, which I normally don't care about, so it's a testament how much the game sucked me in, then I noticed it had been developed by Rocksteady... It's the same case with Arx Fatalis developed by Arkane. You will fell the same spark of genius  present years later in Dishonored. As for the game, it's very atmospheric and contains some very original ideas. It doesn't guide by the hand in any way, just leaves you in the gloomy underworld where everything is hidden - hidden quests, HIDDEN SPELLS. Remember to play with the Libertatis mod, and do a little research before playing so as not to make a characer build which makes it VERY hard to progress later in game (suffice to say, you shouldn't make a pure fighter build). One of very few design flaws. And congrats to anyone who completes the game and uncovers all its secrets without resorting to Wiki for help!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I have played this game when i was younger, which was about 10 years ago, and it was awesome back then. Then i saw it on the store, and I immediately bought it, and it is still awesome now.A dungeoncrawler/RPG that in my opinion is still looking for a game to beat it. Published in 2002 it has some of the best and never brought back till now mechanics ive ever seen. Cast magic with painting Runes on the screen, store them if needed later, diversity, awesome voiceacting (consider: for that time and animation possibilites) and gameplay.Nothing for people who are graphic+driven, this is clearly a 14 Y.o. game and ofc the graphics are from that time.For people who like a Very Good game in the rpg and dungeoncrawler style, this is a must play.Only con is the inventory management and that you cannot sell stacks (max stack is 10 so its not that annoying), but other than that, just recommendable.

												Arx Fatalis is a pretty difficult and hardcore experience.  The game relies heavily on puzzle and problem solving, which I found refreshing over its action oriented counterparts.  Not only that, some encounters are downright difficult, but the feeling of conquering these challenges is reward enough.  Additionally there is a fun rune drawing system to spell casting that puts an interesting spin on spell combat.Arx hearkens back to the old days of first person dungeon crawlers which I found to be a blast of nostalgia.  Back in the ol' days (Read early 90's PC play), a lot of first person RPGs took place entirely either in a dungeon or underground complex, or indoors in some way (probably due to the fact you didn't have to render much). Arx also has it's share of secret doors and buttons hidden in the underground walls not dissimilar to what you'd expect during that era.If you're going to play it on a modern PC system, you should probably download Arx Liberatis, a fan made mod that adapts the game to modern systems.  I had found that the game was almost unplayable for me until I installed the mod.You can find more of my ramblings about video games at www.chatswithrad.com ",297,60,2,47,19,1,37

												Are you familiar with Ultima Underworld? Because this is the closest we're ever going to get to an Ultima Underworld 3. It was originally designed to be a sequel, but the dev's couldn't get hold of the official license from EA, so they just filed off all the serial numbers and called it Arx Fatalis. Make no mistake, though - this is Ultima Underworld in all but name.The story of Arx Fatalis sets you in a dungeon world where no one lives on the surface since the Sun was snuffed out some years ago. From there you begin as the classic prisoner arc type with no memory, set to escape from your goblin captors, for game-play It has physics similar to Morrowind but superior combat and graphics and an interesting spellcasting system.Overall, this game is worth buying if you like games like Morrowind and Gothic. However. If you played Morrowind and want more of that, play Arx Fatalis. After that, you may want to look at Deus Ex. IMO Arx Fatalis is up there with Deus Ex and System Shock 2 as one of the best FPS-RPG hybrids ever made.			",1666,682,61,226,179,19,307

												Playing Arx Fatalis after searching for a good game in the seemingly endless pool of high budget, nowadays products is shocking! There is more content, better gameplay and much more intense atmosphere in 600 MBs than in a few GBs and Millions of Dollars invested in modern games. Everything is refreshing and interesting: Starting from the real-time casting system, over the immersive and often funny dialouges to the intelligent and well thought quests. For the rediculous price that it's currently sold on steam I don't even need to loose myself into details. There is a dedicated community that created a patch called ""Arx Libertatis"" which fixes a few bugs and adjust the resolution to modern PCs. (The patch btw is the reason why I have less than 2 hours on record). This game is by far the best thing I have come across in the past 10 years that I have been looking for a good RPG.

												An amazing rpg and if I made a top 10 list of my favorite rpgs from 2000 to 2016, this would be on that list. Wonderful atmosphere, interesting characters, addicting dialogue, great immersion and just a blast to play. At the time this game came out, it kept me up till the late hours playing and exploring this wonderfully crafted game. This is not for people who want to have there hand held all the time, this rpg can be tough for alot of people but if you are patient and use that thing inside ya head, there is a good chance you will like it. The only negative I had at the time of release was that it was not that well optimized, although for the time it came out it did look pretty good from what I recall.Also for fans of old school style rpgs! Not sure why this says I only have 0.2 hours, it was the first game I bought on this second steam account of mine as the box/disc I bought when this game came out got wrecked. Steam didn't seem to record you're time in game as much back in the day. Anyways, wonderful rpg that is a true joy to play, I beat it twice when it first came out and then years later I bought it on steam again. If you like old rpgs or even if you want to just play another wonderful game from the makers of Dishonered, give this a go! I was very happy to see these devs get the credit they deserve finally, even though Arx Fatalis was WAY underrated, its nice to see them get some success with Dishonered.Bottomline is that this rpg is a really great game and also some of the best immersion and atmosphere I have witnessed in an rpg, go buy it now if you want a challenging, old school style rpg!

												Decently entertaining dungeon crawler in the vain of Ultima Underworld, probably best known for its rune drawing spell system. About 20-25h of gameplay, featuring a protagonist  suffering from the well-known Amnesia™- and The Chosen One™ syndrome out to fight The Ultimate Evil™ with the trusted Fireball Spell™.Great fun!

												Pretty cool for its age. I remember I played this one after Morrowind but I liked Arx Fatalis better, even though it's not an open world and exploring is limited. The crafting and cooking were pretty awesome too. I actually haven't seen a cooking system in today's games like the one in Arx Fatalis. The casting system was hard to master but was also different from the ones in other games. If only this game was more mod friendly, though.Apart from that, it's one of my favorites games and I still play it from time to time.			",46,6,0,9,8,0,8

												This game freaked me the ♥♥♥♥ out when I was fourteen. The ritual sacrifice of the little girl to summon a demon (that I finally put a stop to on my current playthrough YAY FOR LIFE GOALS BEING ATTAINED!) and the trolls going after you if you whoops into their mine without the BFF necklace and that freaking rat creature chittering behind you at random moments that will totally make you go AH WTF WAS THAT until you finally catch sight of his lame assassin♥♥♥♥♥The magic system is one of the best ones I've played because you have to literally draw the component sigils with your mouse to cast spells (slots are available for 3 precast spells, but it's just so much less dramatic than making your character wave their arm about). The open world is claustrophobic and creepy and full of spiders, which is awesome okay. And yes, yes, there is a sexy naga in the library, she is so done with your♥♥♥♥♥♥but will be all sssssssibilant at you anyway because you won't leave her alone, please leave her alone, go kill a rat or something.The only downside to this game is that you MUST patch it with Arx Libertatis otherwise it won't run at all. I played it a bit offline and couldn't get to the patch so I had to copy a random Steam.dll into the folder to make it at least run when launched outside the client. I understand why the devs won't include the patch in the initial download-- it's a third party patch so issues with endorsing stuff they should fix themselves abound-- but it's really irritating when you expect plug-and-play and instead get LOL NOPE DDRAW ZERO EXCEPTION HAPPY FUN TIMEZ.This game is a classic. Get it, patch it, play it. Kill rats and eat their meat. Hopefully after cooking said meat so you don't make yourself sick. Did I mention you can make apple pies if you want to? RAT MEAT AND APPLE PIES FOR EVERYONE.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Please ignore the 6min game time. I Have completed the game. The time is due to using the arx libertatis patch without which the game is unplayable. But steam does not count time when using it ... I have spent about 20 hours on it.I cannot recommend it to others despite its many good points such as,- Excellent atmosphere- Interesting setting- Good basic game playThe problem is, that even with the well made fan patch Arts Libertatis it suffers from an amazing amount of annoyances and half-broken/half-working mechanics, examples,- The magic system is drawing of runes on the screen. The problem is that the game has miserable recognition of what you draw and even after your 20th spell cast, you'll often have to retry 2, 3, 4 or 10 times.- You can lose or sell quest objects and they have no tags, yep, sell or drop items, discover 2 mins before that you needed them for final door to last boss (not a joke, keep your akbaa stones).- You have to suffer through an amazing amount of half messed up content, including Poor maps,  Bad quest log (going to need a walkthrough), Endless corridors for no reason, Bad as in really bad stealth--- Aaaand in quick order, stuck mobs, stuck bosses (including the end boss), puzzles that decide to ignore you (ooh mithril goes into that 1cm area and everywhere else it results in a throw, funny...) or simply bug out (invulnerable, one-hit kills you, mandatory quest mob please met mr. stomper, uuuuh, mr. stomper? .... stomper? ... damn ... where is my closest save)Add to this, that builds are badly unbalanced too and are to a large degree defined at start, leaving limited options to adapt them later on,- Melee build? Can work. But Melee is near suicide at end of game, where out of nowhere the  gameplay become utterly anti-melee. There is a decent chance you cant complete last 20% of the game unless very comitted melee build.- Ranged build? One weapon for ranged, yep, one, and you dont start with it nor necessarily pick it up. Does not make sense as a build.- Mage build? Amazing overpowered magic (hello fireball on anything) except when it is totally underpowered (want to cast a non-prepared, max 3 prepared spells possible) spells in combat? ooh we are sorry, please redraw your runes while getting wailed at.- Balanced build? Dont be stubborn and try it, odds are you cant complete the game.It's not that the various build puts you at a disadvantage, but that they simply dont work and you likely cant do anything to fix it once you find out. So starting with a guide in hand is more or less mandatory and so is a mage build for big majority of players.All in all, unbalanced and a general mess.Essentially it is, for all nostalgi people have for it, a game that sort of never made it out of a late beta and frankly it shows. If you are fanatical, slogging through it might be worth it. But though I am a pretty hard core RPG fan, it came up short when I had completed it and thought if it had been worth it. Grab something else on your wanted list instead of this.			",52,26,0,31,11,0,22

												If you can get your hands on this RPG you have just got one of the best underestimated RPG's. It is one of the first games I bought on Steam, but still one of the best RPG's i've played. The Graphics are not as good as you get it in today’s RPG's, but the storyplay really works with the adventure you are entering when you start this game. This game is enjoyable for hundreds of hours of playing. PS: take your time to learn to use the spell-system (runes) – it makes your gameplay even more fun. So enjoy :-)			",78,11,0,24,3,2,35

												A diamond in the rough for sure, but Arx Fatalis is a classic that snuck right under a lot of peoples' noses. Years after release, the developers have continued to support this game, patching it to run on modern systems/resolutions, and even releaseing the source code. It is still up in the air if the now heavily Kick Started Ultima Underworld successor ""Underworld Ascendent"" will live up to its bluster, but in the meantime Arx Fatalis is definately worth some of your time.

												One of the greatest dungeon crawls ever created. Arx Fatalis has been in my top ten favourite games since release.Some of the highlights:---------------------------- Logical, somewhat realistic inventory crafting & recipes. Experimentation is a must!- An unsurpassed magic system; Logical combinations of words have different effects.- More atmosphere than you can shake a stick at! A truly claustrophobic underground world.- A 'hardcore' mentality in an easy to pick up and play game; no hand-holding, thought required!- Some of the puzzles are FANTASTIC.- Lots of varied locations, items and secrets to discover.Some of the low points:--------------------------- It's an OLD game. Without the Arx Libertatis mod (link below) it's actually unplayable, in a very literal sense.- Wasn't the best looking game when it released, hasn't changed. Not UGLY, but by no means pretty.- The melee combat is CLUNKY. It's a chore to fight tough enemies at times if you're a sword & board player.- The story is typical of games of the period, and riddled with cliché.While from an outside glance it would seem practically dead and unsupported, there is a hard-working team at http://wiki.arx-libertatis.org that have been patching the game since 2011, with the most recent Dev version being released on their site in Dec 2015! I really look forward to seeing if they manage to upgrade the physics engine and adapt it for modding support (some of their end goals), as Arx would have new life breathed into it!

												Awesome little RPG. Feels a lot like a smaller-scale TES:Morrowind. There are only a few problems with it, one being the fact that overall, the game is pretty small (at least as far as I can tell, having not yet beat it; they elude to the possibility that there are more large areas you can go to, but I don't yet know if you can or not), and another being that the game feels somewhat linear, though you're free to go wherever you want, so long as you've come far enough along in the main quest. It has some cool features with it, most notably that you cast spells by writing the gestures onto the screen with the mouse. It's pretty nifty, I really like it. The setting is also pretty unique. Basically, you've got a standard fantasy world. However, the sun dies and the surface is plunged into eternal winter. The sentient races unite and spend the five years leading up to the loss of the sun moving their civilizations underground. It turns the whole thing into a subterranean dungeon crawl RPG, which I really respect in a game. I'd recommend anyone play it who like first person RPGs. However, do note that some newer systems will have problems playing it. I personally have found the game playable only through the Arx Libertatis fan mod. If it doesn't work for you or there are general issues with it, try the aforementioned mod, it might get the game working for you.			",552,97,3,91,36,4,89

												One of the greatest RPG ever made. And one of the rare RPG to be both in first person and real-time.It's very immersive and aged quite well graphically.The music is weird and very good. In fact that would describe the whole game setting.It's an original world that's fun to discover and a lot of NPCs and quests are kinda funny.The world is semi-open and you can build your character as you like (no predefined classes).While disorienting at first, the controls are actually clever and the spell system is very unique (you have to draw magic symbols with your mouse in the correct order, yes, you have to actually *learn* spells).It's my second favourite game, next to Morrowind :)			",385,76,6,63,25,4,37

												I played the absolute balls out of this game when i was younger, Side by side playthroughs with my older brother, trying to solve the riddles and puzzles of the crypt, sneaking through the mushroom level, and♥♥♥♥♥♥bolting from that black beast in the dwarven level. Despite a few technical issues this game  has with modern OS, a few unofficial patches and whatnot can fix that, and it still stands today as one of the best games I've ever played. I'd be well over 200 hours if I started counting way back in 2002. And holy hell, that spell casting mechanic is still amazing, and I wish more games would use it. Like a linear Morrowind (which i also adored), this game is brilliant.			",102,20,0,11,22,0,11

The Ambient, locations, lore (even if there is not really huge amount of it) are dark and mysterious, and it's the only game that understands the spirit of Ultima Underworld (I hope new Underworld ascendant will also).Just for the atmosphere, it's in my top 10 cRPGs, even higher than Baldur's Gate.

												This game, although I've only played 5 hours up to this review, has the best magic system I have ever seen in my life. Although the effects are not great, obviously due to its age, the way you cast spells is quite fun. You literally draw runes in the air to cast spells. It's very innovative and I'm surprised that nobody else picked up on it. If it were to be put into another game with more spells with modern graphics and effects, the game would definitely win many awards. The dungeons can be confusing, for there are many tunnels within a dungeon and you have no sense of direction where you're supposed to go. You have to keep up with the story to know what you're doing. If you aren't going to use a walkthrough for this game, you may find it quite difficult. For example, for one of the quests you need to get back a Troll idol. To do that, you have to go to the Goblin fortress. You then, without an actual direct hint, after a long time of just wandering around in there, may decide to move a pillow to find a key to continue the quest. Where does the key go? Just try it on everything that's locked there. It's very confusing. Although, the dungeons do have quite a dark ambience. The only thing that may give you fright is when you don't have sound on and are not expecting a monster to creep out of the dark or attack you from behind, then making you panic as you're trying to gesture the correct runes to cast a spell and kill them. Another example is when you didn't know you had to stake zombies to actually kill them and they end up creeping up on you from behind. I mean, it's not scary, but the fog, darkness, and old style graphics and sound just give you anxiety (not that it's a big deal).The combat is pretty good. It's not too easy or too hard. The runes, in my opinion, are not hard to do and I only have 5 hours into the game. I don't see why people are complaining about it in their reviews. It most definitely does not take long to get good at casting. It may take some practice for some people, I guess. Melee weapons are nice and take some skill to use. One must avoid being hit whilst trying to go on the offensive, and the only real way is by hit-and-running or attacking from long range, such as with spells are archery. I have yet to use a bow, so I can't really go into that. Along with magic, you can precast spells. You can precast up to 3 spells so you have them ready when you're actually going to fight so you don't have to gesture a spell while you're trying to stay alive against some monsters. The story is pretty good. There is plenty of humor in the game, such as goblin kings with digestive issues and horrible goblin mom jokes. The lore behind the entire story is quite interesting. Humanity and monsters live underground, due to the sun disappearing and the freezing of Earth, making the ambience darker yet, knowing that your character has probably never even seen the sun. Although, with that, there is a loophole. You can find and buy plants that somehow feed themselves without the sun and the fact that humans need the sun to survive. If the lore means that there is no sun, at all, then their ""solar"" system would just be flying wherever they want in space or attracted to another planet's gravity. I guess it makes level design easier, simply needing walls, a roof, and a ceiling, not a background of trees and hills and a sky with clouds. Thinking outside of technicality, it's pretty good.There is one thing one must know before buying this game. You need to get the Arx Liberatis patch, else you WILL get errors upon start up. This is due to the game simply being out of date. The Arx Liberatis patch goes to your steamapps->common->Arx Fatalis-> (drop contents of zip here). One other tip- do not cast Raise Dead in a public place before you acquire stakes. It's not a good idea. Neither is casting Summon.The graphics are obviously not the best. This game is old. I have no need to talk about it.This game makes a good RPG, a good puzzle game, an extremely innovative magic caster, and a nice, dank spend of 5 dollars. ",31,1,0,8,3,0,1

												Arx Fatalis was the first game to be released by Arcane Studios (now mostly known for Dishonored), and very few developers hit it out of the park with their first game as much as they did. The game takes place in a world that might have once been a traditional fantasy setting, but the death of the planet's sun led the various races of the world to move into various underground cave systems, with Arx being the one that the game takes place in. The open world is somewhat like a dungeon crawler, and while it may seem like a small world at first you may be surprised as you unravel it and unlock its various depths and passages. It makes up for its size by being very compact, without the filler that most modern RPGs have. There are also various civilizations to deal with, with the humans living on the top level and various other races living deeper in the caves. Arx is full of secrets and side quests, and for the most part you're free to look for them at any time. The story is fairly simple, but it never chains you to it, instead opting to just leave you to go through things at your own pace.Gameplay-wise, things are pretty similar to Arcane's later games. You can specialize in stealth, combat, or magic, along with other skills like the ability to identify enchated weapons and armor. The magic system is one that you'll either love or hate; you learn spells by learning runes found on stones throughout the world and combining them into spells by drawing the runes on your screen with the mouse, and when it works it's a really cool system, but the rune detection sometimes refuses to cooperate, so you'll probably want to keep your three pre-casted spell slots full in case of combat. There are lots of item crafting mechanics you can use, and they're all presented in a more interactive way than most games' menus, like how cooking food requires you to light a fire with a spell and drop your food items into the fire until it finishes cooking, which is pretty fun in a way that's hard to describe. It's hard to describe exactly what it is about Arx Fatalis that makes it so great, because it's a game that's made great by the various moments and sidequests that make up the game instead of by the actual core mechanics and if I listed all of my favorite parts of the game here it would just be spoiling things. But everything about it comes together so well that the only reason I wouldn't recommend it is if you aren't very good with older control schemes. Even though it's old, there's a fan patch called Arx Libertatis that fixes things up to run on modern machines, and with the game's current $5 price I think it's a steal. It's an immersive and unique game that has a kind of magic to it that even Arcane's own later games haven't quite managed to capture.			",574,245,9,46,42,6,55

												This could be the sequel to Ultima Underworld series easily! Good old dungeon crawling, eight levels down. However this version has a lot of bugs, the most important being the fps. You have to really disable any form of AA both from the game and the gfx control panel to be able to play decently and then again when special effects and combat occur, fps do drop. I don't remember such bugs when I first played it back in the day but then again I had a pretty mediocre PC back then. Another annoying thing is the crashes. The game crashes randomly throwing a memory fault error at times and tends to get on my nerves. I will recommend it, with a heavy heart due to all those bugs, for those hardcore dungeon crawlers out there who loved Ultima Underworld series.			",302,135,6,54,34,0,33

												Great game. But sadly if you want to play this game you should download Arx Libertatis that fixes a lot of bugs and crashes those lead thru the original Arx Fatalis.I have tried playing Arx Fatalis normally without the Arx Libertatis even Arx Fatalis was repeately crashing... After 5 hours of playing and unstopable crashes I decided to move to Arx Libertatis. After I moved to that Arx Libertatis I have never seen any bug or crash (Well it just crashed on really curiours cases after 12 hours of playing haha XD).Anyway I really recommend you this game, its awesome game, has briliant story and gaming system plus a lot of spells these come always handy. But dont forget to download Arx Libertatis after buying Arx Fatalis, because it saves a lot of your nerves.Enjoy with joy <3 :)10/10			",109,17,2,13,7,0,10

												[TECHNICAL TIP ON TOP - REVIEW LOWER BELOW]If you are getting the following error:""A DDraw object has a non-zero reference count (meaning it was not properly cleaned up). This Program will now exit""Some suggest to download ""Arx Libertatis"" to make the game work again which is a bit frustrating considering some of us already had the disc version and were counting on the Steam version to be future proof so instead of downloading a third party patch (which might still be beneficial) you can actually setup the “arx.exe” file to run in Windows XP (Service Pack 3) compatibility mode which will result in the following error:“The program can't start because Steam.dll is missing from your computer. Try reinstalling the program to fix this problem”So all you have to do is recover the Steam.dll from the Steam program files to the installation folder of Arx Fatalis and it should run along with the compatibility mode!Actual Review:Everything in this game felt interesting be it for its special mechanics or the atmosphere and story.Generally speaking all the sections of the game had something to bring to the table and the semi open world feeling was great as each section gave a sense of accomplishment as you discovered and unlocked more sections of the game.So while linear for the most part levels wise, a good portion of the content could be dealt differently with alternative results and hidden elements (including undocumented spells) that were fun to enjoy on a second and third walkthrough of the game and allowed players to enjoy multiple gameplay styles be it a pure mage, warrior or thief as the three main character types were all technically accomplishable to the end and satisfying![Semi-spoiler - I once finished the game realizing I did not went to the Crypt at all which felt amazing]Overall by looking at this game years after completing it the first time I can notice some lack of polish in the gameplay mechanics and some rough edges on the visual level compared to other games of the time but was still a solid game nonetheless.[Spoiler: One element that kept bugging thought the years I re-played this gamer were the requirements of some of the best weapons in the game that penalized “jack of all trade” type of character as a player with medium strength and medium dexterity could not use at least one of the best swords and one best daggers that the game offered which was kind of a bummer in retrospective. Also the difficulty of the final boss with a rogue character was a bit annoying as you had to be prepared to fiddle around to be able to beat the game in that context].This is a must have game for Ultima Underworld fans!

												There’s no school like the old school, and Arx Fatalitis is the headmaster!NOTICE: when I first booted the game up o steam, ithad the worst frame rate I’ve ever seen.  Luckily, I got a free and simple mod called Arx Liberatis, and now it runs fun.  However, my steam account still only says I’ve played 20 minutes, while in reality I’ve lost many a fond hour crawling around in here.Arx Fatalitis is a very old school dungeon crawler.  Despite being over a decade old, it looks ‘not bad’, and boasts a very immersive and claustrophobic atmosphere that harkens back to the early 90s era of PC roleplaying games.  It feels very, how should I say, ‘beardy’, in that it is not action-packed (combat is very clunky too) but instead you have use logic and reason to solve problems.  It is a slow paced game, but that slow pace is just brilliant.  You actually feel drawn into the subterranean world of Arx and invested in its existence as you mince down musty mines and goblin fortresses.  There’s a fair amount of camp too, especially in the dialogue, but again that camp suits the game brilliantly.  My favourite is a goblin chef with a sleazy French accent.However, let it also be said that Arx is not a game which holds your hand.  You always have a clear objective, but it is not always easy to find out how to accomplish it.  Also, the game is packed with secrets and optional content, but it will take a careful and thoughtful eye to notice most of it. As for criticisms, well, the only one that really stood out was that the combat (after playing Skyrim especially) is chunkier than clunky clunk-dom.  This makes it challenging, sure, but I miss the fluidity and responsiveness of Skyrim.  Second, the maps down really tell you were the exits lead to; if I didn’t play the game for a few days I’d be hopelessly lost and couldn’t remember how to get back to some places I’d been to before.     All in all, for the paltry £2 I paid for this, Arx Fatalitis is brilliant game, the kind we don’t really see anymore.  If you like old school PC rpgs and don’t mind the clunky combat, give it a go.

												i rented this game like 6yrs ago and i only played it for 3hrs but i liked it alot and because i was still in school i couldnt finish it so i had to return it, and ive been looking for this game since then and then i found it on steam and i couldnt resist.   this game is great if you care about ""real voice acting"" and snappy graphics then move along but this game is really good for nostalgic rpg dungeon crawler fans this game reminds me alot of D&D 2.0 version and i love it the combat and menu's are little wonky yes but after an hour i got used  to it and couldnt put it down even tho it doesnt have alot of choices for skills or character customization you still get good flexibility for combat between weapons and skills the ambiance is perfect being stuck underground with other races, humans, dwarves, trolls, and goblins but you get the sense of something bigger around the corner like your always being watched and i love it just play  this game and you will know what i mean!

Product received for free
												Arx Fatalis is a true gem in the rough. The last time I experienced this specific kind of immersive, oldschool, slow burn atmospheric vibes was when I played Gothic 1 a couple of years ago. * The mechanics and initial slow pacing take some getting used to and you need to invest some time in it to let it grow on you, but when the world unfolds and your character gets stronger it feels great and you feel right at home within the games setting. * The story and lore are not the most elaborate ever and voice acting is not that great nor distractingly bad. But the world design in itself is actually pretty original. Level design is very solid and exploring real carefully not only feels very rewarding, it is essential.* Graphically it looks dated, but surprisingly acceptable nevertheless because it renders so well on large resolutions. To me this is still a pretty game. Also the music and sound design are really good and add a lot to the overall atmosphere. * Do note that unfortunately this game will NOT run without Arx liberatis, do look it up to get it to work. It's not much of a hassle, but really Steam should make sure the games they offer are actually playable right away.This game is absolutely recommendable, as long as you're patient and take notion of that last point mentioned			",416,219,12,72,43,3,73

												Back then it was first released i played this game like 20 days straight if we don't count sleeping and going to toilet. This is the only game made my parents worry about me. Don't mind my steam game time i probably played this game more than 1000+ hours overall and yet there are still things to discover. Game has a lot content and various way to make your own special *snowflake* character(not psychically). But i don't recommend for casual gamers, play this only if you have time because you will not now what you are doing/dealing in first 3 hours, later you will want to make another character.ProsEverythingConsIt consumes too much timeNot enough mouse space to draw that spellShouldn't have opened that door.

												An amazing experience of a game. DEFINITELY BUY THIS!I have played the cd version ALOT before playing the steam version. I have to say, despite the rare visual bugs, this game is perfect.You enter Arx, an underground city filled with humans, goblins, trolls, spiders, snake-women and all sorts of creatures. This RPG takes a whole new level of greatness with the perfect emulation of an underground environment, with stealth, magic and combat mechanisms ahead of its time. Each skill is important so this makes a well thought of character creation absolutely necessary!  Replayability is very good I have been playing this game for many years and I still don't get bored at the grey goblin mom joke. Voice acting is great, except maybe for Am Shaegar (the main protagonist you play with lol) goblins and trolls sound exactly like they look. The storyline is intriguing and interesting, but you can easily get distracted trying to find the hidden items and locations, and interacting with the world. In short, great visuals, great story, great characters, great replayability.10/10. Definitely buy this game, its way too cheap for its quality.Hope I convinced you to have a great time.

												When I first played it took me a while to get the hang of the controls as it is quite different from your standard control layout. The unique casting technique is not very sensitive and this causes some difficulty in-game. Other than the controls the game is actually one of my favourite RPG's. Starting off with the cliché 'escape the dungeon' doesn't matter with this game, the storyline makes up for it. As for the storyline... well mystery, war and everything else a good RPG needs.

												Even though its over 10 years old, this is one of the neatest RPGS Ive ever played. Even today its innovative and a breath of fresh air from how stale the modern RPG genre has gotten. It has average graphics for the time, but whats really neat about it is the magic and crafting system. In order to cast a spell, you have to learn runes, and then draw the rune in the air using the mouse. There is an option to precast 3 spells that can later be cast at the press of a key for combat or cast on the fly so you don't have to stop and draw in the middle of battle to draw.You can also mix items together to make new things, drop food on a campfire to cook it, ect. Its definately from an era before the ""bug budget cookie cutter dumbed down RPGS"" that exist now days. For only 5$, you cant go wrong. I woulda happily twice that or more. A word of warning, get the unofficial patch from the Steam forums, otherwise theres an odd bug that causes your char to move so fast he's uncontrollable			",211,106,1,118,39,0,27

												Arx Fatalis is a stellar dark fantasy game by Arkane Studios, the same group that would later be responsible for Dark Messiah of Might and Magic and Dishonored. This game is a spiritual successor to the legendary Ultima Underworld and was originally meant to be titled Ultima Underworld 3 but licensing issues got in the way. Arkane continued development despite these licensing woes and the end product was a dungeon exploration role playing game now considered to be a classic of the early 2000s. Unfortunately, Arx Fatalis launched at one of the worst possible times and went up against Neverwinter Nights and Morrowind, both of which drew attention away from this great game.The most notable aspect of this game is the magic system which requires the player to find runes, through either exploration, reward, or shopping, and then draw rune symbols on their screen using the mouse. Certain spells require certain combinations of runes, and the player has the option to store up to 3 pre-drawn spells which can be accessed at any time. This system of casting means that the player themselves must become skilled and proficient at recalling rules and casting them, adding a very real sense of tension to combat where you are directly responsible for how well your character does, instead of relying on character or skill level like in other games.Arx Fatalis also expertly does two things:It provides the illusion of being a linear gameIt provides the experience of being open worldThe game world is so large and sprawling that it would be daunting to otherwise throw you in to it without any guidance, so the approach in Arx Fatalis is to provide the illusion that you are on embarking on a linear quest: guards block your path, doors require a key, or you may not possess the combat aptitute or magic needed to advance to a new area. The reality is that nearly all of the impasses you may encounter can be circumvented without advancing the plot if you are clever enough and do not take a barrier at face value. This is not breaking the game or getting out of bounds like it may sound, and going where you think you should not can end up changing quests in ways you would not expect.ProsMassive, richly detailed superdungeon to exploreMagic system that relies on drawing runic symbols to cast a variety of spellsExploration is rewarded through magical runes and powerful itemsSecrets await the dedicated and clever, holding even greater rewardsHidden rune combinations can lead to magic of incredible strengthNo dialogue system - quests are advanced through your actions which determines what people think of you and how they respondFood can be cooked by placing it on a grill or fire and waiting. Enterprising players can bake by mixing things such as flour, water, and fruit together to make pies.ConsMelee combat is clunky and uninterestingPlayers that choose not to specialize in magic will struggle to access optional areas and miss much of the content and experience of the gameThe game can feature an abundance of backtracking depending on how you play, and how aggressively you exploreThe game's age may require the use of Arx Libertatis to be fully compatible on the most recent of systems ",406,108,14,82,43,2,87

												I believe there is a word that describes the chemical reaction in your brain when you inhale the smell of an old book. Though, a similar chemical reaction ensues when listening to a classical tune, both offering different euphoric feelings and ideas. I could say the same about Arx Fatalis..no, no coulds..IT IS a breath of fresh air from days gone by. In my younger years when I was installing Gothic 2, I noticed a demo game on the finalization of the install, it was distracting sight, filled with doubts and hesitation for the naive me. While there are many ideas of marketing a game, I have to thank JoWooD for their straightforward offer of giving me a demo game that not only it would annoy me, but it would also bolster some of my idyllic love for the gaming experience. In my Gothic review, I explain how deep my bond became with the series, and ironically, the game that was a demo in the former's install, would bolster even further my sense of creation of worlds and sights undescribable. Supposedly, a medieval world(prolly high fantasy, before it's fall) and especially, a kingdom, were ""blessed"" by the glorious fall of the sun from the majestic. Such, the eternal winter came over all souls, forcing them into retrat in the underground mines, dug deeply under the earth. A world trapped beneath the very rock of the earth, a world torn asunder by rivaling kingdoms of Men, goblins and trolls alike. A world that cuddled itself in cheap booze, fishing,sculpting,  small talk in a grim tavern A world haunted by the eerie moan of the cold winds of the abyssal dark sky on the surface from which it travelled through all the ducts of Arx. And in this underground kingdom rose a bloody cult, shrouded by secrecy, divine sacrifices and bloodied sharp tools with a little tint of ceremonial caves. This cult drew the attention of the celestial guardians that oversaw the balance of all worlds. Concerned with the safety of Arx and all neighbouring kingdoms, they sent YOU to investigate this rising blight. Be warned though, a grim world awaits you, of tired torches, gorging dark halls and secrets long forgotten. Be steafdast and do not linger, the gears of war and despair are turning for this world and you may not be able to stop if it's too late..			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Unique spell system (like everyone, including me, likes to point out), fun world, interesting design (love the goblins) and geninely funny moments, makes this a very good (aölbeit somewhat old and wonky) RPG. I can definitely see why it's often called ""Ultima Underworld 3"".			",107,45,1,20,8,0,12

												This game... Where do I start? First, download the patch Arx Libertatis in order to make this game compatable and fix virtually all the bugs in the game. Don't be fooled by the amount of hours Steam says I played because I easily put over 60 hrs into the Arx Libertatis mod. That said, this game is amazing! You are thrust into this immersive and highly detailed world and have to survive while uncovering a sinister plot. This game's story, characters, and atmosphere are superb. The clunky controls do little to hinder the fun I had with this game. It is a game where you actually have to figure things out and discover hidden secrets and riddles. The magic system is so unique and very thematic. In order to cast a spell, you draw on the screen the symbols of runes you have aquired. So many different possibilites can arise out of a combat scenario and the interaction between yourself, objects, and the world is like no other game. If you want to cook food (and you have to so you dont starve), then simply put some raw food next to fire and wait until its cooked. The voice acting is superb and the interesting and creative world is definatly worth exploring. I highly recommend this game. The combat and controls take a little getting used to but once you jump that hurdle you unlock a charming game that you won't want to put down.			",120,14,2,19,14,0,27

												An amatuer first attempt by people with great taste.Its fairly rough and linear RPG, A few bad puzzles, Bad voice acting and writing, A somewhat broken spell casting system, Not so great combat, And its quite buggy without the Arx Libertatis mod.So why do I love it?Its an RPG that isnt a border line shooter, Its not a sprawling 1000x1000 km world with 10,000 boring filler fetch quests or hours and hours of mind numbing combat.Its a smaller world with a quest thats straight to the point, Its a great setting, very atmospheric and fun to explore. It has the aesthetics of games like Thief and Ultima Underworld. An awesome game depsite its roughness.			",462,66,8,46,45,1,58

												Full of secrets and adventure, you build your character depending on your preferences of strngths and skills. Loads of options and items yet still easy to manage.I bet you'll replay the game once you've finished it to see what if I did this or that !Awesome game and recommended for players who needs a game that keeps their minds captured and entertained. I believe this is a very underrated game and I've discovered it really late but no regrets.			",27,5,0,6,1,0,3

												ARX LIBERTATIS WAS USED - Thus game time was not counted by steam. My playthrough was ~22hrs. Arx Libertatis gets the game running on nearly all systems, I suggest it if you can't run the game normally.Arx Fatalis was created by ArKane Studios who would eventually bring the world titles such as Dark Messiah of Might & Magic (one of my favorite games) and more recently Dishonored 1 and 2 through Bethesda publishing.The setting for the game is one of the most interesting I've seen in an RPG that is nearly untouched by the actual game. The premise is that the sun for the world has been extinguished and the surface is now uninhabitable. Anyone who goes to the surface would freeze instantly type of deal. The humans (with the help of naga-creatures) along with other races fled to the underground and through tunnels the population of the world continues to survive (Metro 2033 anyone?). Arx Fatalis takes place in Arx, one of what's considered to be 'safer' areas. This was disappointing since it was more tame setting than I wanted compared to the Travelers guild and how they're in a daily life or death struggle continuing through tunnels that are riddled with monsters. The crux of the matter on this game is that it's hard for me to pick a side on recommending it. I'm half-heartedly going with a No Recommendation despite thinking the game isn't that bad. There just wasn't enough to push me over to wanting to replay the game or encourage someone else to go through it.To explain, the combat (the main portion of what this game will consist of) is pretty garbage (TES style). You're forced into either building as a hybrid or into a mage only and while you can pull off the warrior build it's highly inefficient along with the worse builds of rogue or archer. The spellcasting in the game is an amazing concept that not even the game was able to do properly. You must create the runes in the air manually in a correct combination to cast the spell. Anyone who hasn't played would think it hard to do in combat BUT the player can have up to THREE precast spells. This means mages can play with the runes until they get the three spells they want and easily murder any opponent with probably only two of the spells used. Fighting with melee weapons is a chore in comparison, as swinging wildly does next to no damage. The player must 'hold' the weapon until the gauge is full and then release to deal impactful damage (~5s per swing). While this won't seem apparent initially, when the player reaches the Ylsids that run slightly faster and can swing 3 times as fast, it'll spell your doom. As a new player this was especially annoying since the runes recieved early on were practically useless, and a useful spell isn't learned until later in the game which encouraged me to stay mostly melee instead of a focus on spellcraft which ends up the far better of the two.Now to me what is the real dilemma I have with the game. MECHANICS.This game is a perfect example of the once and done feature. They place mechanics that exist in the game for the sole purpose of one point and then abandon the feature forever. This is excrutiating as a new player and people who played this perviously looking back with fond memories need to understand what I'm talking about. Mostly this is due a lack of both not showing and not telling what the player should do.Here are some examples, spoilers abound. There's a section in the game where a monster chases you upon entering the dwarf area, as you run away slamming on doors you'll cross a lava section and then find a dwarf with a key, power stone and meat. You'll probably grab the key and powerstone then run back in a panic to open the door with the monster on your heels down a corridor. If you run to the right you'll instantly game over. If you're too slow in any of the above sections, also instant game over. You then run into an empty-ish room with a ladder and hop up with glee. But now you're stuck. Here's the solution: You were supposed to grab that meat (which looked identical to Rat Meat i.e. nonimportant unless you mindlessly loot), run into the room and use the power stone on the blank looking box that powers the stomper above you and lure the monster underneath to get squished.Literally WHAT. Like okay if the game had shown the power crystals earlier, it would be fair. If it had shown the stomper rising up from the ground, also fair game. But the fact of the matter was the whole section was like playing that stupid Train Minigame in Mario Party of RIGHT OR LEFT. Oh wrong way! Off the cliff you go!This is the whole game in bringing up new concepts to the player. ===The wine into the dough was the only one DONE RIGHT. It showed the goblin cook time and time again bringing pies to the king, if you found his diary it said he was allergic to wine, and then also finding all the wine next to the dough in the kitchen.===The magic lever that appeared when the monster was chasing you again? BAD. ===Temple of Illusions? MIXED (mostly the stupid reveal on the switches; the crystal ball with the switches where you had to compare shadows in each room which would have been fine had the switches made a 'failure' sound if you messed up.)===Levitating into the Ice Caves? Dumb as all hellThe funniest thing is that in the ice caves the player character actually kind of gives advice on knocking down a stalactite to proceed forward while in all the other situations has no info to offer.===Crypt (pickaxing the graves out of nowhere, rune slabs, stupid sun puzzle. The hint was terrible and the way the puzzle was positioned throws everyone off, rune slabs couldve been removed since it was used in the same puzzle in the same format but only existed to torture anyone who somehow missed a single slab.)Also kind of randomly; gold was relatively worthless. Best armor and weapon obtained free of charge.But it's not as though the game was entirely misdirectedCooking food was neat, spellcasting (despite precast ruining everything) was a good concept, and the whole staking the vampire ghouls in the crypt was a nice inclusion you wouldn't see in most games. (Plus the setting)For the time when the game came out I could see why most people would love this game.Personally I don't think the game aged well, and new players would certainly have more than one problem with it. If this game released modernly not even the most hardcore would try defending it. It would be riddled with 'this makes no sense' posts but communities exist which give older games a free pass.

												A gem of a game from a period when developers built games from their hearts and their games didn't hold the players hand all the way through the game. Experience true freedom, rebel sends you to fetch her something in return for a ring you want? STEAL THE RING, then GIVE IT BACK for a reward! go pretty much anywhere as soon as the game starts (though some places might require certain spells). Magic system is the best magic system I've ever used - creative and intuitive as long as you realize that each rune is a word and sentences are the spells. No quest marks. No tagged quest items. Minimal quest tracking. Use you head, you'll figure this♥♥♥♥♥♥out.How did this game not get a sequel?brotip: Get arx libertatis (modern rewrite mod) - will work better on modern systems.

												Arx Fatalis is a fairly decent dungeon crawler RPG. Not the best, but still very solid. It can be compared to Morrowind in the fact that it is first person fantasy roll playing game, however, it differs from the Elder Scrolls classic in its gameplay machanics and its setting. It is set mostly in confined dungeon areas. I like this approach especially since most games like this are set in an open world anymore. Unfortunately this approach tends to cause most of the game's areas look the same and not stand out. This game also has a unique set of controlls, but you will probalby want to reset most of them, especially if you are used to playing games like Morrowind. Overall, this game is a solid RPG that you are sure to have fun playing, assuming you don't mind the outdated graphics. I give it a 7/10.			",91,8,0,26,1,0,0

												Arkane Studios' (Dishonored) first game and it's amazing. The magic system was really unique at the time (the magic runes are drawn in the air with mouse grestures, and new combinations unlock new spells). The crafting system, although kind of limited, makes sense because you're typically creating each ingredient seperate from one another as opposed to finding them all in the environment (take some flour and water to make dough, then take dough, a rolling pin, and some fruit to make a pie, for example). Like Dishonored your choices are determined by the actions you take throughout the game as well.It has some annoying quirks on modern systems despite the most recent patch, so I highly recommend downloading Arx Libertatis to play it, though.

												One of the first games i ever played, back with Divine Divinity, and Might and Magic, games like this made me a gamer, and set the bar for the future ... very few games have surpased that bar, the magic system is outstanding, and the combat is smooth and inuative, youll find yourself leaning in for your sword swings, and feeling the heat of your fireballs, quite linear but with a world you can go back and explore, a very relaxed pace with a few side quests, lots to find, lots to see, a truely unique game ... which in itself is a shame, would have loved an Arx 2.

												A very solid RPG played from a 1st person perspective. An innovative spell casting system is what sets this game apart from other RPGs. Casting spells requires you to draw runes in mid-air with your mouse. Although you can queue up to 3 spells that can be casted instantly via hotkey, drawing runes in the thick of combat requires a steady hand but adds a whole lot of depth and challenge to the combat.

												Here's a Gem most of us overlooked when it came out.One part Ultima Underworld, one part thief, Arkane studio's first foray into First-Person/RPG Hybrids was a successful one, especially considering it was also their first game. Yes there were bugs, yes the casting system wasnt't perfect, but Arx Fatalis still stands up today as a shinning example of (post MS-DOS era) First-Person Dungeon Crawls.I recommend it for all CRPG fans and also fans of the thief/Deus EX/System Shock genre.

												This game was remarkably fun for what it offered, its just a shame it is so buggy that is practically unbeatable if not unplayable past a certain point.  Even with the bugs this is a game I have played several times.  So if you can handle the glitches and this type of game your favorite, go ahead an play.  Just be aware that it will come to an abrupt end at some point, like a TV show canceled mid-season.			",288,68,1,32,11,1,57

												Arx Fatalis is a pretty shameless ripoff of Ultima Underworld, one of my all-time favorites. Games of that type are few and far between enough that it's forgivable, though. Just recently, the studio that made it released Dishonored, a well-recieved stealth-action first-person game, and to celebrate, they updated this, one of their earlier titles, to run properly on modern systems, and released the source code. It's so classy I could cry. Buy it, try it, maybe love it. Honestly, I couldn't get into it, but I know it's worth a try at least. 4/5			",759,224,23,90,104,9,146

												Quite possibly the last real dungeon cralwer ever made before Etrian Odyssey inspired a revival in the genre.An obscure part of the lineage that led to Deus Ex, The Elder Scrolls, and BioShock, Arx Fatalis is kind of like an older uncle to BioShock, except set in a subterranean fantasy kingdom. An excellent exercise in survival and exploration.If you want to run it on modern computers, you'll need a source port called Arx Liberalis.			",242,44,2,24,4,1,18

												Alright guys, all I can say is - if you love RPG´s that are immersive, dark and sometimes outright creepy, buy this game. What you waiting for? It´s 5 ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ bucks for one of the best RPG´s of the early 2000´s. While the story certainly isn´t groundbreaking, it does do a good job of keeping you going and you rarely have moments where you literally don´t know what you´re doing - but they are there and when they hit you, you will be stuck or looking at a walkthrough to see what you missed or what to do next. And that for me, is one of the key elements I like this game. Very little handholding, you gotta use your brain a little bit to get through.No seriously though, do yourself a favor, tell your girlfriend/boyfriend you´re sick for a week and play this. You won´t regret it. 9/10 for me guys.			",256,19,0,28,6,1,13

												Before skyrim, before oblivion... around the time of morrowind, there was a great little rpg game that came out called Arx Fatalis. Unfortunately, Morrowind cast such a huge shadow that this game was only seen and played by a few.At the time however, it was just as immersive, in depth, and advanced as any elder scrolls game. This game doesnt hold your hand. It requires you to think, and be intuitive. The spell casting was some of the most unique of its kind during those days (you draw the spell symbols in the air with the mouse).Anyway, this is a great, old school, first person, elder scrolls like rpg. Its slow paced and very detailed. If you have little to no patience, dont get this game. One last thing. You REALLY need the free open source mod called Arx Libertatis to play this. Yes, it will run on steam, but expect REALLY long load times, framerate issues, and many other buggy things due to trying to run such an old game on modern machines. The ARx Libertatis mod basically fixes these thing, allowing it to run smooth and fast, as well as fixing tons of bug and improving the visuals. Dont play far without this mod, because it doesnt seem to work with non-mod game saves (at least from what I can tell). Best to just get it and play with it from the start. It doesnt change content, its just a fan made patch and improvement to the game that is A+ quality.			",554,122,3,120,41,2,77

												One of the best RPGs ever. -Magnificent story full of interesting quests & side quests, set in underground world full of secrets and places to discover. -Amazing atmosphere of dark dungeons, caves and underground cities. The world full of mysterious but also funny characters and fractions who share this cold and dark ""underworld"". -The more you uncover parts of this eerie world, the more you want to continue in this thrilling story. Those are few of many attributes of this fantastic but unfortunately terribly ""underrated"" RPG which is for me still one of   the best titles that Arkane Studios ever made. As for the cons big problem of this game is compatible with newer OS. -I have several problems with running the game as it was crashing and freezing on the Win 10. But this of course is rather problem of Windows than the game itself.-The other thing is that the controls are kind of gimmicky at first but you can quickly get over it. My final statement is that this game is must for everyone who wants original, interesting and entertaining RPG and at the same time can get over ravages of time, also because of fairly low price nowadays this game is totally worth of trying.

												I can't play my copy of this on Steam anymore because of a DDraw error, or some such nonsensical cack. This appears to be a common problem. It's weird, because the game ran fine for me back when I first got it and wanted to give it a couple test runs to get a feel for it. It's only when I wanted to play it seriously that this DDraw thing started happening, after no changes to my computer. Unfortunately there's no way to fix it to make it playable on Steam. Instead, you need to get Arx Libertatis, a fan-made mod that fixes this and other problems with the original game, allowing it to be playable once again. You just can't play it on Steam. No more problems, though. Plus, you can have HD and widescreen resolution. How nice. Enough of this, let's talk about this great game.This is a great game. A fantastic RPG inspired by Ultima Underworld, with a fully realized world and lore and smooth gameplay, especially considering its age. It's kind of an open world as well, but taking place entirely underground in labyrinthine dungeons and tombs and mines and caves and ruins and all the kinds of locales that are vital to a game of this nature. A good story, fine plot and action, and no grinding or tedious quests. Everything is tightly related to the story or worldbuilding, and quests are often complex, with interesting puzzles unlike I've seen in any other RPG. The rune magic system is unique, MYSTICAL & ENIGMATIC, the combat is a little clunky and slow, but considering the game came out around the same time as Morrowind, it's a step ahead of the competition in that regard. Exploration is rewarding and enjoyable, enemies are challenging, progression is steady, and there's really nothing bad or mediocre to say about the game.			",80,6,0,13,2,0,2

												Good old open world RPG dungeon crawling that feels like Ultima Underworld. The locales and story reflect this sort of atmosphere. There's a lot of stuff to do, some cool abilities to fool around with, and quests that will make the player explore almost every nook and cranny in the game. The sidequests are fun, and don't feel overly compulsory. There are a lot of interesting little puzzles peppered throughout as well, which excellently showcase the model and texture creativity allowed with the game's engine.Three complaints:1 - It's very buggy. The game crashes when I wander into the path of an NPC, which happens at least every 10 minutes. Transparent textures render as pitch-black voids. Quests can be broken. Objects and characters can get pushed through objects. Enemies can get stuck on thin air, and this was usually how I ended up beating bosses.2 - Artificial difficulty. This is not a term I typically use, but I'll make an exception here, because this game undeniably has it. The magic system is an example. I understand the need to have some kind of complex output for magic, given just how useful it is, but drawing out signs with the mouse is like doing so in Microsoft Paint. Even when I know how to do it, it takes, like, 5 tries before I create perfect shapes with the exact angles and straight lines. Meanwhile, the enemies can pinch 'em out in a matter of one or two seconds, but the enemies themselves are a different story. This is one of those games where ""difficult enemy"" means, that guy hits hard and has a lot of health. There's nothing wrong with strong bad guys, but making this the basis of difficulty for every boss and upper-level enemy in the game is just lazy. There is no strategy, just run in a circle until I manage to draw a perfect spell, turn around, fire it, rinse and repeat. Or, I suppose another option is to quickload until my opponent spawns in stuck and I can take my sweet time.3 - A lack of explanation. This partially works to the game's benefit, making for quests that actually feel rewarding and puzzles that feel challenging, unlike certain games (coughSkyrimcough), but this stops being fun when the game takes too many liberties with this approach. I can deal with a spell in my quest log instead of my spellbook. What I can't deal with is having certain dialogues and cutscenes postponed simply, say,  because I haven't talked to a specific NPC, despite the fact that I already had the information I needed from reading a book, but no, I have to talk this person and hear what I already know, because it will trigger the next dialogue sequence with another character I had already gone to visit in an unfruitful attempt to advance the quest! This sort of situation is where the discrepancy happens, where the player is caught between the limited information provided by the quest log, and what action needs to be taken to progress. It results in a lot of pointless running around and wasted time.Overall, I have somewhat positive feelings for the game. It's by no means perfect, but may have both the gameplay and atmosphere to appeal to more seasoned RPG players, specifically those who don't mind a few hiccups.			",120,19,3,24,14,0,4

												Definitely recommend. Fantastic game with a really cool spell system. You collect Runes throughout the game and combine them to create your spells. You draw them with the mouse (it can be very touchy and difficult at times) to cast them. Each rune has a ""meaning"", and once you learn what that rune means, you can pretty easily combine it with other runes to create your own spells.			",50,8,0,19,1,0,4

												One of my all-time XBox favorite games (the original XBox) Arx Fatalis is an unofficial sequel to ""Ultima Underworld"". The Steam version is for the most part glitch free, but the graphics have not aged well. They are from a time when for some reason, brown/green was the it thing, and poor skinning over polygon frames. The UI is still ok, and the game itself has numerous glitches that may be game stoppers for some... well many... anyone who who has played a game since 2008; I still find this to be a fantastic retro game. The gameplay is  much like exactly like Morrowind, but with a far more linear storyline, and fewer sidequests. I would go into long detail about the game itself, but it would be pointless; if you like Morrowind, and want to play a game where you can be a Mage, Warrior, or Ranger, then get Arx Fatalis. Personally, I think its worth the 5 bucks, but overall the game was not groundbreaking when it came out, and its not in retrospec a staple RPG.That said, the good things about the game are this: Its sword and sorcery, its fairly fast paced, its not too short or too long, and its gererally a fun time killer... until you hit a glitch or bug.

Posted: November 16, 2016
												I have never been quite as satisfied with a small steam purchase as I was with Arx Fatalis. This is a gem of a game and a spectacular RPG. The roughly 15 hours I spent playing this game were sublime and were enough to cement it into my memory and my list of favorite video games of all time.  Make no mistake; the game has flaws. However, if you can overlook some pretty bad voice acting and a relatively cookie-cutter story, and if you like RPGs with a classic feel, I believe that you will love this game. As others have said, it is important to note that this game will likely not work perfectly on modern systems without tracking down and installing the Arx Libertatis community patch/mod. For example, when I booted up the base game for the first time, I found that my character would move at virtually the speed of light, smacking instantaneously into walls on the other side of the room with barely a touch of the keyboard while all other graphics on the screen were slowed to a crawl. With that out of the way, let me talk about all of the things I loved about Arx Fatalis.Arx Fatalis reminds me a lot of the time I once spent playing King's Quest: Mask of Eternity. It is a game that is somewhat sparce on spectacle but ridiculously dense in detail and atmosphere. As is revealed in the first moments of exposition, the world of Arx is one in which the sun has gone dark and all of the world's inhabitants have been forced underground to avoid freezing instantly to death. Almost literally all of this game takes place underground, and the world the player explores is a complex, deceptivlely large and multi-layered dungeon, with end-game content hidden organically in plain sight right from the very beginning. Tight spaces, fairly excellent lighting and sound design, terrifying enemies, extreme amounts of environmental interactivity, and quests that require the player to research lore, remember important details and hoard potentially useful and plot-important items all combine to make Arx Fatalis one of the most immersive [emotionally, if not visually] games I've ever played. All of the game's underground environments feel oppresive. They are full of characters, monsters, secrets, riddles, puzzles and supernatural phenomena that all want to hold you back, and this makes the player's steady success rewarding and cathartic and their areas of safety a treasure. I, for one, found a long trek through the game's crypt to be a prolonged anxiety attack with just a sprinkle of paranoia and would lock doors behind me just to keep what's left of my sanity intact. You will be forced to think creatively, to sometimes take a few steps backward before forward progress is possible. Furthermore, you will sometimes be forced to interact swiftly with the environment under the looming threat of monster interception. All of this is great, except for when it isn't. If you're like most players, you will probably want to keep a walkthrough handy. My recommendation is to do your best to figure things out yourself and introduce just a little bit of frustration into your experience, but don't be discouraged if you need to utilize community resources, especially during the last 1/3 of the main story. It might also be worthwhile to keep a set of your own handwritten notes around just in case you plan to take a couple days off from playing. If you have checked out more mainstream video game reviewing sources, you will have undoubtedly heard of Arx Fatalis's unique appraoch to magic. To reiterate on what they've said, I have certainly never played a game with a similar magic and casting system. Casting a spell requires you to draw out symbols contained on small little blue runes found throughout the game world in real time and in specific combinations. Yes, this can be finnicky at times, but it never really bothered me all that much; in fact, It was one of my favorite aspects of the game. The developers knew that using magic in combat would be pretty much impossible, so they included the ability for your character to store any combination of three spells for immediate future use. If you choose to invest the time into raising your casting skills and stats and hunting down all of the runes for your spellbook, you will have about 40 different spells at your disposal by the end of the game, and those are just the ones that are explicitly recorded in your spellbook. I assure you - there's more. You see, the runes that are used to cast the spells are actually like a whole language in and of themselves, and the spells adhere to the logic of that language. Much like how learning the roots, prefixes and suffixes of Latin can help an anatomy student figure out the structure and location of a body part, learning the underlying meaning of the magic runes allows the player to experiment and come up with new spells. Some rune meanings are obvious, but not all of them. I'll give but one non-secret example so as not to spoil the fun. The very first spell the player learns is one that lights up flammable light sources in the area, and the runes used in this spell are Aam [create] and Yok [fire]. Finding and tacking one more rune, Taar [missile], onto the end of that sequence turns a spell only useful for lighting torches and campfires into an offensive fireball. Pretty neat. It's also worth mentioning that the leveling system facilitates using the magic system to its fullest potential along with one or two other straightfoward combat specializations in the form of close quarters combat and defense or stealth and projectile weaponry and maybe even a skill like lockpicking if you are so inclined. In essence, a player can be a competent spellcaster [with access to every spell] and an axe-wielding armored tank maniac all in the same playthrough.Overall, I can't recommend this game highly enough. It seems like there was a lot of love put into it by the developers, and there are quite a lot of things that I neglected to discuss in this review. Arx Fatalis is the textbook definition of a hidden gem, a diamond in the rough and imperfect perfection. You won't be disappointed.			",191,25,0,37,11,0,8

												Now, don't mind the hours played, I played the game long before steam was cool.Also I'll make it hsort. Do you like RPGs? Do you like an interesting world, ediocre combat system and an awesome magic system? Do you like dungeons?If any of the above or all were answered with ""YES"" then I recommend you give this game a try.There's also a mod avaiable called ""Arx Libertatis"" which is a cimmunity patch of sorts that makes the game even better and lets you play on a modern system.Seriously, give it a try.

												I recommend this game against my better judgement because the bugs make it unfinishable (and to many people probably unplayable) I actually cannot finish the game because if I try to cast 'enchant object' the game crashes with a fatal error! And you have to be able to do that to finish the game. Bumping in to people 30% of the time doees the same, or going up stairs... despite the crash worthyness of it I got a number of hours enjoyment from it and it is a very many layered game experience. Most of the puzzles are fun and interesting... a few are just pointless where it's overly laborious lever puzzles or click every pixel on an area until you get the thing you can't see and wouldn't know was there without a walkthrough. Mostly I didn't need to resort to them but when I did it was pretty much always a... you what?!!! how would you find that??!! There are a lot of different endings/options and side quests and the play is varied. The magic was an interesting idea but badly executed, you draw the magic symbols, however the character recognition is APPALLING combat casting even if you are really practiced is a joke. Additionally many of the damage spells are just a bit rubbish, however the range of options are good and you can use them in a lot of ways. Another way the game suffers is it's rules on stealth, I played a high stealth 80+ and magic. Despite having invisibility cast on myself and high stealth AND being hid in the shadows (and stationary) I still get a 'look it's him!' followed by being chopped to gobbets... Not very well done, which is a shame because the game has a lot of scope for it. I spent many happy hours creeping around casting extinguish spells on torches so I could terrorise monsters from the shadows but it only tended to work well on one hit kill monsters because despite hitting someone at range from a dark shadow in the back they automatically know exactly where you are and home in! Ducking behind a wall while your arrow was in flight would 'sometimes' allow you to avoid detection... Anyway, in a nutshell lots of interesting things to do and things to kill, quite a few frustrating gameplay things and buggy as anything but still very playable to the point where I'd be tempted to try again with a straightforward choppy character and see if the 'enchant' bug was just for this character which suggests it's a fun enough game to overlook the flaws. However as an aside I'd look up how to do some of the basics as the game provides sod all help on how to do even basic things i.e. how to pick a lock, how to combine items, how to move a stack of objects etc. etc. it's lack of instruction was apparently a 'gameplay' thing including rules on hunger... or rather no rules or indication you just have to eat food every so often or it's 'bad' but no food meter or indicator if you're keeping up with it or not... aaaaanyway yeah, but still fun. So hence 'against my better judgement recommends this game'			",38,12,0,11,4,0,20

												Good, old-as-♥♥♥♥, RPG. Controls take a little to get used to only cuz the UI is based around the F-keys and some weird clicking, but definitely workable. The only issue I take with this game is that there is no sprinting, so you're kinda stuck walking around the world at a sometimes annoyingly slow pace. I did play through the whole game, disregard my time recorded on steam. To make this work on newer machines, you have to DL a fuill conversion mod and play thru that. It's easy to set up and install, so no real complaints there. 7/10Woulda been an 8 or possibly 9 out of 10 for me, but loses a few points only because the test of time is hard to overcome for some games.

												The Demo was working perfectly, but the game refuses to start after I bought the full version. There are fixes for:""A DDraw object has a non-zero referencecount (meaning it was not properly cleaned up).""but unfortunately, none of them worked for me.I have no doubt that this is a pretty good game (since the demo convinced me of buying the full game, obviously), but right now, I can't recommend it, simply because it isn't working anymore.Edit: I know that people don't like it, when reviews are negative, because the game didn't run for the reviewer, but that's just how it is. And if a game isn't running, even after you applied the fixes for it, nobody can recommend a game. Simple as that.			",284,62,5,48,20,3,32

												So, I've had this game for a while, but never got very much in to it until recently. But holy crap, it's freaking amazing.Right off the bat, ignore the low playtime. I'm playing with the Arx Liberatis patch which uses its own .exe.I've always been a fan of RPGs, and the design that goes into making great games fascinates me. Arx Fatalis has just the right amount of complexity, mixed with a ""less is more"" philosophy, that really exemplifies the value of emergent gameplay. The story's mostly linear, but I never felt restricted; there's a strong emphasis on player discovery, and I haven't been this captivated by a game's world since I first played Morrowind. There's a reason this is sometimes called the spiritual successor to Ultima Underworld, and while the lore might be a bit corny at times the atmosphere is dense and the game feels truly modern in a lot of ways. For a game as old as Morrowind, I was amazed how new Arx Fatalis felt, and I'm sorta amazed it doesn't get more recognition. Free-form exploration, adventure game-style puzzle solving and interaction, and some genuinely terrifying moments The dark beast. Holy♥♥♥♥♥♥ made this game instantly memorable once I dove in to it. There's a major emphasis on item interactions; there's no dialogue options and a lot of activities involve directly manipulating objects both in your inventory and in the game world itself. This is clunky at times, with difficulties managing equipment quickly coming to mind, but overall it's practical, unique and fascinating. Movement feels odd at times, too, with a sort of full-body-awareness thing going on, which makes a few platforming scenes more annoying than it has to be, but this design, again, overall works towards the experience.The combat's mostly what you should expect from an RPG of this type and age. Think dice rolls and an emphasis on character skill over player finesse. Casting uses a rune system similar to Underworld, but has you manually casting spells by drawing the appropriate shapes. I've always had a bit of an issue with this sort of system, because it really does limit the viability of relying on magic in combat, but it's not too hard to let slide. Just make sure you have an FPS limiter/vsync or you're gonna have a nightmare with casting.I went with an overall stealthy character, which isn't something I tend to do in games like this for my first playthrough, but the skill system is lenient enough that, as long as you have a bit of sense, you can make do with any sort of build you want. There doesn't seem to be an XP system, either; either XP is only gained from quests, or you level up at prescribed ""checkpoints."" I don't know, but it does work in the game's favor, because I never felt forced to play a certain way or slaughter every enemy just to be able to level up. There's no difficulty selection, either, but that never bothered me. Tough guys are tough and rats don't level up with you, it works. And a huge part of the game isn't even combat.If you know what to expect from an RPG of this age, Arx Fatalis won't disappoint. Even if you're not used to older mechanics, if you get past the clumsiness and occasional corniness I bet it'll genuinely captivate you.But this is really just a 20-minute Steam review. There's a lot more than can be said about this game, but this is all I've got right now. Play it if anything I've said sounds interesting, because there's tons of crap I didn't even touch upon. The story's not great but the atmosphere really is and the gameplay holds up amazingly. It should be a classic.			",52,10,1,9,8,1,9

												Despite the clunkiness of the old-school controls, the premise of Arx Fatalis had me fairly interested: the sun has died and the various races have somewhat put aside old grudges in a mutual effort to convert the old dwarven mines into a habitable  environment. As such the entire game (as far as I know at least) takes place in winding tunnels between subterranian fortresses.The first few hours were also interesting in that outside of fighting your way out of the goblin prison you start in, the game was remarkably murder-free for a fantasy RPG, with most of your efforts being aimed at trading favors for favors in the hopes of unconvering your lost memories, the only combat being defending yourself from rats and oversized spiders in the tunnels between settlements.However, shortly after you find out who you are and by extention the main plot of the game, this changes and for me ruined my interest in continuing to play. Not because of the murder, mind - I'm used to the notion that walking down the street in a videogame without ending a dozen thinking feeling lives is nigh impossible, and I would hope AF still keeps a nice middle ground - but because the game's combat controls are just that terrible.Arx Fatalis, as mentioned earlier, takes place almost entirely in claustrophobic cave tunnels, and your melee controls are essentially limited to light attack or holding the button down for a heavy attack. No blocking, and no dodging to speak of besides walking briskly backwards in the hopes you don't back into a wall (and you will, because the entire game is tight winding tunnels).And the magic controls are even worse, going for the admittedly fairly unique method of casting spells by tracing runes in the air, the sort of idea that would be tailor made for motion controls if they existed when this game was published, but since they don't you're forced to try drawing them with only a rough visual guide using your mouse. Good luck trying to scribble out a three- or four-rune spell while holding down the Ctrl key while being attacked by two or three goons. In all likelihood you'll be punched to death while desperately trying to get ""Yok"" to register.Arkane Studios, the team behind Dishonored, were also responsible for this game and it kind of shows with the intriguing worldbuilding, but it also shows how much they've grown with practice since this. If you somehow can handle the awful controls I'm sure the story is interesting, but personally I can't recommend such a nearly-unplayable mess.			",101,21,0,17,4,0,1

												Was entertaining until I found out that every time I interacted with the opening goblin level, that stupid opening cut scene would play and drop me off in the damn opening cell. Until that issue is fixed, I'm going to have to give it a thumbs down. I will admit that up until that point the game seemed kinda fun...			",27,22,0,34,1,0,3

												Wow I'm so sad this game doesnt work on my computer. I don't know whos fault it is steam, devs, or me, but this game will not launch after I bought it and installed it. This should have been a positive review I have played it before with my cd copy but I wanted a steam copy cause of scratched up games and this is what I get.....			",43,1,0,2,3,0,5

												Someone recommended this game a being ""Dark Souls"" like.  I have no idea what they think Dark Souls is like, but it's nothing like this game.  I think if I played this game 15 years ago I would have liked it a lot.  The controls are very very clunky and dated.  It was a bit more like a chore to play than a game.			",518,144,10,57,38,3,49

												I played this on a Linux machine with the mods that fixed most of the bugs so ignore my play time.This game will only appeal to fans who played it at release and are playing for nostalgia value. Even with the modifications to the graphics and mechanics the game is still not fun. I understand it's an older game but other games released around the same time such as Morrowind (despite its flaws) had a much more polished look and controls.The controls where outdated even for its time. You switch between standard first person mode and a mouse mode where you can move around objects. When trying to place or interact with objects it will take several atttempts. The on screen spell casting fails frequently no matter perfectly you move your mouse.The environment is that of a poorly constructed network of mazes and it looks like it was left unfinished. It feels less like a world to explore and more like you got lost on a construction site with half finished buildings.Beyond the interesting story there isn't much of a reason to play this game. I could go on about the bugs but it's not worth my time. Save yourself the few dollars and go a tub or icecream or something.			",7,2,0,7,0,0,0

												Somewhat enjoyed a decent 2 hours of the game until I loaded onto the next level and my character died from hunger. Have been quicksaving the entire time but that didn't matter. Each quicksave i load, all 3 of them, character instantly dies from hunger. No sort of icon or notice that this will happen until too late apparently. Not going to replay that crap.
