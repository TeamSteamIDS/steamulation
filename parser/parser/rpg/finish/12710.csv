 Overlord: Raising Hell	Overlord Raising Hell is an amazing game with lovable little minions. In the game you are the second overlord (after the first has left) and you must help your army of minions destroy the pitiful disgusting forces of good BLEH! Gameplay	In overlord you start off with  learning how to control a small group of minions. There are 4 different kind of minions you will find though the game. to summon a minions you need orbs of their specific colour which can be gained by killing enemies.As you continue you will gain the ability to purchase items to improve your amazing dark tower and to improve yourself.Throughout the game your goal is to become evils favourite son by commiting tasks such as killing villages, killing off elves etc. (good times i know) You will also have choices within the story which will help you reach your evil goal. Minions	The minions here deserve their own perfect panel. Within the game as previously mentioned there are 4 different types of minions, each with ups and downs. Brown	- Can wear picked up items and is your basic unit +easy to get orbs +capable of wearing armour and picking up weapons  Green	- Stealthy backstabbers who deal high damage+ can turn invisible when guarding a location+ back stabbing :D Red	- Ranged fireball chucking units+ only ranged unit+ chucks fire - low health Blue	- Blue is the only type of minions that can revive other minions (if he gets to them in time) and is the only minion capable of traveling through water+ can swin+ can revive- weak in combat Raising Hell	As you can guess raising hell is in fact not the base game but rather a dlc that allows you to launch it (hence why i have 0 hours on overlord). In raising hell after you defeat an areas ""hero"" a gate will spawn which will send you to what seems like hell. You will see your former enemies being tortured and punished while you must go and get stones to control these amazing hell resorts. And after you shall face the true keeper of this hell-like realm whom i shall not name (because i have forgotten him) and you shall receive the true ending of overlord. Rating	 Pros	+ fun gameplay+ fun little minions+ minions pick up garbage for you+ succubus+ each area has a different feel and the storyline is fun+ amazing ending Cons	- may become a bit repetitive ( i got nothing else bad to say) Final Throughts	For me Overlord Raising Hell has been an amazing game which I was able to truly embrace. I enjoyed every moment of gameplay along with the storyline. This game is one of my top picks and is truly a game you must try. Final Rating 10/10	 ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is a review for the expansion: Raising Hell. For a review of the original Overlord, please reference my steam review at http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197980576540/recommended/11450Raising Hell's storyline takes place after the events in the original Overlord. Abyss Gates are spotted in each of the lands that you have previously explored and present a twisted, more hellish version of each area. The seven sins of hell come to mind when playing through these areas. Your goal is to go to each Abyss and take control of it. You will also find moulds in these zones to create new and interesting equipment.The unique armor and weapons added in Raising Hell present new abilities that otherwise would not be available to you; however, the new equipment is woefully underpowered. If you already have a full set of upgraded Arcanium gear, you're better off ignoring these new items.Although the expansion adds much appreciated content to an already outstanding game, it does little to nothing to fix the flaws of the original. Trying to control your minions to solve some of the new puzzles can be frustrating. In particular, there is one puzzle that you must sweep your minions left and right to mow a lawn. Don't complete it fast enough and you have to start over. Nothing tells you that you failed due to time so you could end up like me looking it up online to figure out what I am supposed to do. This happened about two or three times for me. Guidance isn't exactly clear on some of the puzzles.If you enjoyed the original, this game will be well worth your money. If you are unsure of buying both Raising Hell and the original Overlord in one go, do not fret. Your saved game on Steam of the original will transfer over into the Steam expansion so you can enjoy the content at your leisure.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

NOTE:Also see:Overlord (1) Review TL:DR? See ConclusionINTRODUCTION:Overlord: Raising Hell is the official expansion to the 2007 game 'Overlord'. This expansion was released on the PC, Xbox 360 and Playstation 3 all on 2008. The game promises new content for the single player experience by adding additional plot, more levels and new enemy types, new items, and new creative mini-games.PLOT (No Spoilers):The game takes place several months after the events of Overlord 1 and serves as the prologue to the events that would lead up to Overlord 2. Having finally restored his dominion over the land and exacting revenge on the adventurers, the Overlord now faces a new threat to his rule when portals to another dimension starts opening around his territories. Upon investigating the nearest portal, the Overlord discovers that his 'loyal subjects' are attempting to flee into the portals with no intention of coming back. The Overlord now ventures into one of these dark portals in an attempt to conquer whatever is in the other side and 'persuade' his followers to come back. Little did he know however, that the portals were just the beginning of a much sinister plot by a being far much more powerful than him.PROS:+ The core gameplay of the original title is still intact+ Good new story that adds several hours to the game time+ New enemy types are fun to fight+ Each portal has a story of their own+ Fun new mini-games and simple but satisfying puzzles+ New minion equipmentCONS:- New items for the overlord sucks (mainly because they have prebuilt stats)- None of the the original CONS from the main game was ever addressed- Some of the mini-games gives no clue on how to solve them (gardening puzzle)- Far more expensive than the Original game, but still requires you to own said original game- No additional events to increase Corruption / EvilCONCLUSION:GOOD EXPANSION although it could have used a bit more polishing specially since most of the CONS from the main game was never fixed, this expansion still gives fun additional content in story and in gameplay experience.All in all, I still liked this expansion thus I give it my RECOMMENDATION. WORTH IT?If you're interested in this game, try and purchase the OVERLORD CLASSIC PACK which contains Overlord 1, Overlord: Raising Hell (expansion), and Overlord 2 either on Sale or Full price. The game is worth the money for fans of the action adventure genre.--------------------------------------------------------- Like my Reviews?

												The Good:1) Good graphics and atmosphere2) Gameplay revolves around you controlling your ""minions"" to defeat enemies and solve puzzles. 3)Controls really well however the game was designed around controller support. Never tried the K/M 4) Lengthy adventure 5) Well designed levels keep things fresh and interesting 6) Cute and charming story7) Bonus DLC is more creative than the actual game The Bad:1) The game at times can feel repetitive. 2) The game can be frustrating at times especially if you loose a lot of minions at once forcing you to harvest more. 3) Seems a bit too long given the nature of the game, I just wanted it to end around 13 hours in. 4) Minions sometimes don't really follow your commands causing needless death. Conclusion:The game is worth checking out and if you enjoyed pikmin from Nintendo you should somewhat enjoy this game. Both have similiar gameplay elements yet vastly different design.

												Imagine Pikmin, but instead of charming creatures you pull out of the ground, you have poorly animated monstrosities and instead of trying to get home, you try to subjugate and reign over the many areas you visit. Not sold yet?If you asked me, out of all the games I've played, which one feels ""the most game"", Overlord would almost definitley be mentioned. And that's a really good thing. It's got one primary mechanic that dominates the game, natural progession with you the player growing stronger and stronger, quests, lots of failure near the end, and a decent final boss.There are some games that, although really good, fall closer to the realm of ""art"" than ""entertainment"". Overlord falls into the latter with utmost confidence, and it's honestly pretty refreshing.Give Overlord a shot, I'm sure you'll be hard pressed to not enjoy it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Making a demon army, enslaving humanity, and taking over the world…. Ya who wants that? ME. Make more of these games please. Being a demon lord sith master dark force (copyright) yadadada  is pretty awesome!Control and MinonsOverlord focuses on you staying in control of well .. the overlord while you can also control minions. I really like these types of games that are define you as a single character who you are always in control of while manipulating units makes you feel more like a general in the front lines and not a king who is a potato in a castle you never see. That being said the gameplay is basic and most of it relies on you controlling your minions and solving the puzzles throughout the game. Its more of a puzzle game with combat moments of just sending your minions to rush in and slaughter everything in your way.UpgradesThough when you upgrade your character enough you can pretty much slaughter everyone yourself without the need for minions (sounds about right for a evil overlord).Did I mention my overlord castle had gold practically pouring out of the gates? Thats until i smithed a ton of statues of me in gold… awww the good days. Spoiler that didn’t happen :’(  Though you do get to have a treasure room like Fable 3. Moral SystemThough I find it hilarious it even has a moral system that is measured in corruption you think the whole OVERLORD with the flames in the background and evil monsters in the front of the game box would be a clear indication that you are a dedicated to being straight up evil. But hey having choice is always nicer than not having choice.			",608,187,12,74,51,9,81

												This DLC adds portals to all the realms you had completed in the base game Overlord.These portals lead to the hell version of the realm you were in. which end with a boss fight.An end boss is in the final hell realm if you can find it.There are some hidden weapons and armor in the realms and a higher difficulty for gameplay. You need to use your minions more to complete objectives. -The good parts:  Feels just like the base game Overlord, so you can jump right in.Graphics seems to be a bit improved and effects seem to be used a bit more.Environments look and feel a little better this time.Hidden secrets are back.Levels are not to small and big.Decent game lenght.Challenging, but not to difficult.Level design is better than the base game Overlord.The Minion Master is still annoying as how he gives orders to you ;p. -Bad parts: Price is to high if you just want to buy the DLC. This DLC is shorter to the base game, but costs more money for some reason.I bought it when it was on sale and that was for the whole Overlord package, just before the time of this writing.Minions sweeping still does not respond well for most of the time. My camera jumps random when I began to sweep and     locks itself untill you reset the sweep.Feels a little more linear than the base game. Rating  : 7,5-First impressions (not relevant for this actual review, just for my first minutes into the DLC):Not good as all they added are portals to new levels, no weapons/armor, no new minions, to linear.

												I have to admit that I was enjoying the main game better, but I don't regret any second I was playing Raising Hell as well. Everything what I've said about Overlord is true for its DLC as well. Meet the heroes again and conquer the Abysses.  12-13 hours game content, just like the main game quite linear, and lacks real story. You will encounter a story plot only at the end of the game, with a twist at the end not unseen elsewhere. Despte all this, I say don't miss it if you enjoyed Overlord.			",122,28,3,18,8,1,19

												Want to be EVIL? Great! The Souron Simulator 3000 is just what you need! Summon and command a horde of figgity, spastic, bloodthirsty gremlins! Manage your evil empire from a luxury tower of sorcery. Take a mistress, or maybe her sister! Destroy everything with no mercy, or Dominate the locals with an iron hand and a kit glove. For those who need more mayhem, get the expansion: Witch King Controller 2.0.This would probably be easier with a controller. Maybe. Unlike traditional RTS, where you can freely move a mouse cursor, you basically have to eyeball everything.			",47,0,0,8,4,0,2

												I dare say that this expansion is better than the main game.Not only is the humor top notch, the gameplay also steps up the levelas more (but also more fun) challenging enemies are introduced alongside some very inventive enviroments.Positives The writing is the meat on the bone. In this case there's a lot of meat and it's witty and funny New hell zones are inventive and fun to play in. They upped the difficulty of the puzzles which makes it necessary to plan your actions instead of the all-out    approach that was common in the main game. Nice tie-up of your story and the eternal suffering in hell for the heroes is satisfying.NegativeAll the negatives of the original game are back in full glory! The controls can be crappy at times and sometimes seem to get stuck while controlling the minions. Minion AI is still derby (Suicide aplenty) The game feels badly optimized at times due to framedrops and laggy controls. ConclusionForget about Overlord II or the sad excuse for an overlord game which shall notbe named that was released recently, THIS is the superior Overlord experience andis what should be played when you are in need of some ill-mannered havoc.

												A great game, with uniqe gameplay mecanics. The pc controls take a while to get used to, but once you do, it's awesome! The story was surprisingly good and the charachters are very likeable. Similar to fable you can choose to be good or evil... Actually its more like, evil and very evil. Anyhow, it ads to the game and gives it a decent amount of replayability. My only complaint is that I never managed to figure out how to change my spells, with the mouse and keybord controlers. I actualy had to swap between gamepad and keyboard a few times. In conclusion. A great game that is worth cheeking out.			",129,24,0,37,7,2,18

												Overlord Raising hell Review.Is overlord raising hell a worthy expansion to overlord? Pros adds a new gate in each world ( mellow hills, evernight etc) and in each gate is a challenging world full of new mini games puzzles and add more to the game and adds fresh new things to the game items, tower objects and new monsters to kill. It also adds a amazing new boss fight that is canon to the overlord story.  It adds many hours of content and it is fun and challenging.Cons its more content, if you did not like overlord I bet you wont like the expansion, but it still has the humorous charm the gameplay and lovable minions that the first game had. It can alter the balance of the game if you grind in mellow hills game before you beat the game you can get some higher quality gear for you and your minions. Do I recommend you buy this game? To put it bluntly, Yes for 10.99 the expansion adds much to the game although its does cost much more than overlord the base game does but I still think it is well worth it. You might just want overlord and not the DLC.Please see my overlord review of the base game http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198103591851/recommended/11450 ",222,47,4,23,7,3,17

												The Overlord game is one terrific piece of work. Raising hell adds 5 new areas with puzzles and a boss fight, each dungeon rewards you with a unique equipment to craft. Still, this game has everything. Humour, a well done script, morality choices made fun, mayhem, minions (not the yellow ones from tv), puzzles and so on. Each area of the game makes fun of the stereotypes of fantasy literature, movies or games in a sweet way all the time being narrated by the minion lord Gnarl. Also, the sqeaky voices of the minions are as warming as the purring of a kitten and you get to decorate your evil tower. ",63,7,0,18,4,0,10

												Let's start with the first thing.  This is NOT it's own game.  It's DLC for Overlord.  Why it's listed as it's own game?  Probably because it was put up on steam before DLC was really a big thing.  I don't know. So why the negative review?  Well let's start that I played this while playing the base game of Overlord.  I played it at the same time and the game really feels like that's the intended use case.  There's a number of additional ""Abyss"" levels that the player can go through.  5 of them.  Each have their own story and each has a play on the bosses faced in the real game, with an all new final boss. There's at least one or two good levels in here.  I particularly liked the level that dealt with everything being a play.   It's an interesting twist, and I really liked a number of things done in that level.  The down side, well the other four levels really didn't fill me with the same enjoyment.   A few of them were annoying, and overall, I felt this is underwhelming.   The last level is insultingly short, simplistic, and tedious all at the same time.  An impressive feat.Now the bigger issue that I think everyone should take with this.  This is DOUBLE the price of the base game currently, and definitely not worth that and the same price as the sequel.  I enjoyed Overlord.  I actually liked it a lot, but when I was doing things for Raising hell, I felt let down.  It wasn't a horrible experience, it just was more of the same, and while I really liked Overlord, the changes in Raising Hell, felt like they were there to differentiate itself from the base game, and failed at that.   It didn't help that a lot of the levels felt overly padded and uninteresting.  When the game had an interesting idea, it kind of built on it.  There also was a decent amount of interaction with the world.  In the DLC, it felt stale and desolate.  And annoying.  There's at least two puzzles I can think of (the lawn mowing and the sheeps) that was just annoying rather long after the interesting part of the puzzle was gone. Will you hate this DLC?  No.  But it's just not worth your money.  There's a sequel to the original game that is likely worth you money more than this.  It's not that it's bad, it's just unneeded and lackluster.   For me, that means I can't recommend it.			",427,129,17,51,43,6,82

												""Overlord: Raising Hell"" is a expansion for the original ""Overlord"". This expansion contains 5 extra levels, 5 unique forge items, the explanition for the begining of ""Overlord 2"" and new a whole of scenes and comentaries of Gnarl, the minion Master, who's the most sor of morbid humor you can find ;) .From the game it self, doesn't change so much of first Overlord, the main history is the same, characters are the same, basically all is the same except for the things i said above.So, if you like the first game you should consider buy this expansion, if you don´t ... well nobody doesn't like Overlord its very difficult because ""Evil always find a way"" .

I was so mad for loosing them and I had to play the game from the last check point.-lack of checkpoints-People don't know this game much. I mean the Devs should have done some advertisments. when U play Skyrim, U can tell a friend about something impressive happened for U in the game and they get what U mean. but U can't talk about this game with everybody cause ...-the graphics. but to be fair it's accepatble ( this game is for 2007 and I reviewed this in 2016)goodluck and don't forget to finish this game. this game got such a nice ending			",67,17,3,7,6,0,14

												Whats to say?, you have badass armour, minions to control, have an awesome tower. Pillaging and beating foes to pulp. A very good soundtrack with awesome theme music and graphics that stand up very well considering the age of the game. This is one of my all time recommended games simply due to it being good simple fun, none difficult mechanics to master, an immersive atmosphere with witty and humourous banter. A good purchase on any day, An amazing purcahse when on sale as it often is during the big sales for a mere fraction of the general price.  I have loved this game for the last decade. I would have left a review on the base game but it oddly would not allow me too. The expansion is decent enough but can be a little difficult as although the areas unlock as you get through the game they are rather challenging at times and can require higher level armour and weapons + minions. It isnt required to enjoy the main game at all but does have an extra bit of ending that leads into the sequel. Enjoyable for younger and older gamers alike.			",233,108,6,49,37,4,38

												This is a game that I've been wanting to play for years, but for various reasons just never managed to get around to buying a copy.  Well, now I have, and this game is every bit as good as I had hoped.  I'm not far into the story as of yet, however, what I have accomplished so far has been great.  The graphics hold up quite well as it looks a bit stylized instead of the out-dated-realistic look some older games have.  I find the minions to be hilarious - it's like I'm commanding color-coded gremlins.  If you haven't had the opportunity to play this game, please try out the demo or go ahead and take the dive while it's on sale.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												In an interesting fusion of games like Pikmin and Fable, Overlord proves to be an enjoyable, albeit sinister experience from your initial awakening, all the way to your fated seat upon the throne of evil. Each step of the game brings you through lush, detailed landscapes, offers rich musical scores and introduces clever, original writing not present in a lot of games of its kind. With a well integrated moral choice system, you're not forced to be a ""bad good guy"" as with most games. In fact, most choices are between evil and incredibly sadistic. Different abilities, storyline changes and even appearance alteration will supply some replayability. With its unique fusion of tactical, RPG and adventure elements, Overlord is sure to offer something for everyone. The expansion ""Raising Hell"" adds even more to that experience with new bosses, areas to explore and items to obtain that ultimately help you unleash mayhem across the land as you truly live up to your title of ""Overlord"".

												If you're gonna take a trip down nostalgia lane with Overlord you NEED to get the Raising Hell DLC.I didn't know Overlord had a DLC and I was surprised to find this! It doesn't change the game much besides some graphical improvements.It also adds the funny and challenging Abyss levels where you can acquire molds of special items for the forge, such as the Harvesting Helm which gives you 2 minions for every 1 minion orb you pick up, grinding is no longer a chore in Overlord!This also patches in what happens between Overlord 1 & 2 showing your choosen mistress pregnant with your child.What happens to you however and why you're not in Overlord 2 is a spoiler but it's pretty cool and I was happy with the out come!

												I am not sure why this is present in my game library as a separate game as it becomes part of Overlord upon purchase. I believe it was one of the first DLCs out there but at the time they still called these as expansion packs. So, Raising Hell adds some new missions and weapons / armor to be forged. So, it's a standard expansion pack with all the goodies one can have.You can head over to the vanilla game's store page to read my review. Overlord should be purchased with this expansion pack and its sequel as a bundle. Having some evil fun is guaranteed!			",369,81,5,31,23,3,33

												Haters of baby seals and fluffy animals rejoice, Overlord's contagiously fun and silly setting offers plenty of chances to murder cute critters and mytical beast alike. Overlord offers unique blend of beat-em-up and strategy elements that, on their own, don't seem to have any meaningful depth, but in conjunction with level design offers fun and interesting ways of using magic, melee and minions to get across various combat and puzzle sections. Graphics hold up reasonably well for a game released in 2008 with special mention to destructable environments whose level of detail can't be seen in alot of games from same era. Sound design is rather mediocore with the exception of minions who, although repetative, always help cheer up the mood of sometimes gloomy and uninteresting areas. Story although played for laughs through most of the game, takes itself uncharacteristically serious towards later parts of the game, something that the expansion Raising Hell remedied in its own ending. All in all Overlord offers unique and fun expirience for anyone with questionable moral compass or good sense of humor. Overall grade: 7.5/10			",101,14,1,10,8,1,12

												Glee is the word that comes to mind when I think of this game. Two words would be ""gleefully mischievous."" Imps and goblins usually annoy me - like the sidekick in The Darkness II - but these little fellows manage to be endearing.Anyway, this game has its tongue firmly pressed to its cheek, in a good way.It parodies LOTR - except you are playing as pseudo-Sauron, sweeping your minions across halfling villages and elven forests with an evil grin on your face.You (the Overlord) are slow and lumbering, but your minions - whom you can guide with an invisible hand or more precisely assign tasks to - are fast and fluid.It's sort of open world - open enough to let you revisit previous (respawning) locations to replenish your gold and Souls.Negatives: Lots of backtracking. No way to sprint or speed up your Overlord character. And no mini-map of any kind. These three problems are a big no-no in an open world game.Still, I'm early in the game and I am really enjoying it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Every quest essentialy comes from him, everything you do benefits him, and he is never in harms way.  Id kick him, but the game wont let you, which I submit as further proof of his superior status.  He doesnt get the girls though, so thats a win for me, I suppose.I first played Overlord years ago on my Playstation 3 (side note, I wish Folklore would be ported to PC.  And that it would get a sequel. tangent op, dont know why I thought of that.) and loved it.  There is just something appealing about being able to summon and throw hordes of minions against targets without needing to care about their lives.  I mean, I could use strategy and planning and tactics, and sometimes I do.  But I also enjoy simply watching minions die for me and my cause.  Which is evil, because Gnarl says so.This is what it must be like to be Sauron, minus that ♥♥♥♥♥♥ ring.			",6,0,0,11,6,0,2

												Ever wanted to be rich? Ever wanted power? Ever wanted to pillage and kill as you please? Ever wanted to be an evil overlord?Well this game does all that and more!!!It's a game that truly makes you feel like an evil overlord that can control minions to ravage the land and take over the world (and with the Rasing Hell Expansion pack even the abyss!). Alongside it's brilliantly cruel humour it also has nice graphics (don't really feel that they are too dated). The gameplay mechanics are simple but fun (although the minions can sometimes get themselves killed because they're not following orders correctly). All in all it's a really great game and i defineatly think it's a must have in your steam archive. :D			",245,32,3,37,13,0,27

												Overlord has you take the role of the almighty Overlord, an evil presence who is set to rule over the land.You begin the game, a newly awakened dark force – tasked with rebuilding your dark tower. You raise an army of minions, terrorize the local population and craft your own armour and weapons. You can even customize your dark tower, which is a nice touch. The narrative and environment are very reminiscent of Middle-Earth, in the sense of a twisted parody where you play as Sauron. The setting is very light-hearted and comical, despite playing the villain in a Tolkien-esque world. The graphics aren’t exactly stellar and there are issues with pop-in, but it does a nice job of portraying the theme of the overall experience. It’s similar to World of Warcraft’s style of softly lit and stylized environments and characters.Although you are a dark and powerful Overlord, you start off fairly weak, which is where your minions come in. Like Pikmin, you need to gather a force of followers who can aid you in your quest. You need a certain amount of minions to perform specific tasks for you - such as moving obstacles, pulling levers and of course, combat. They can also access smaller areas otherwise inaccessible, revealing secrets and other goodies. There are also various colours which specialize further. Brown minions, for example, are your standard fighting force, whilst red minions are your ranged attackers; greens are your stealth attackers and blues are your healers.Overlord plays like a very old game; now, I do not mean this in a negative sense – not dated or “retro” – I’m referring more to the game design and ideology. Although there is a main thread to follow, you’re not held by the hand from point A to point B, you are encouraged to explore and find things for yourself. The world is rather large and full of secrets and puzzles, which need actual work and thoughtfulness to find. It makes a very refreshing experience compared to more modern games full of set pieces and elaborately staged corridors.The controls are very well done, both with keyboard & mouse and a controller; although camera control is limited with a controller. You control your Overlord as you would expect, attacking and using magic but you can also control your minions directly as a horde, allowing finer control, such as sweeping them through inaccessible areas. You are also able to set guard points, sending your minions to station there until you recall them; this allows you to set your fire throwing reds at the back, set up an ambush with the greens etc. It’s nice how much control you have.The game lasted me roughly 25 hours, which felt very well paced. Some games feel too long, others too short. This game fits neither of these categories.I highly recommend this game, as I thoroughly enjoyed my experience with it.			",253,48,3,40,14,1,24

												So here’s what you getEvernight Abyss+BossHeaven's Peak Abyss+BossGolden Abyss+BossInfernal Abyss+Boss1 AXE OF CONFUSION1 MACE OF DOOM1 HARVESTING HELMET1 SWORD OF LIFE-STEALING1 ARMOR OF FIRE5 New Dungeon Challenges3 New Multilayer Maps-not 100% sure on that but I know you get at least 37/10-Its not that it not fun, I relished all the levels and the story had the same great feel to it. But for 10$, when the game costs 5$. It was really disappointed and I wanted stuff to be hidden all over the game so you could go explore again. To be able to buy more stuff for your castle and get a new room. To upgrade all of your minions and not just the two you picked during the first part. The most fun I got out of this game was when a friend gave me a link for this - http://forum.cheatengine.org/viewtopic.php?p=5430025you can spawn about 120 minions safely, the more you make the more of a chance of them just vanishing. give them infinite health and mana, give yourself infinite health and mana. Best of all you can speed hack both yourself and the minions to move at insane game breaking speeds, I have yet to try this in multilayer. But it gives the game a 2nd 3rd or 4th playthrough and a reason to buy it if you already own it on a gaming system.

												Overlord is officially the best game I have EVER played. It's even more fun than Portal, TF2, The Hobbit, and Defense Grid: The Awakening. Adventure games are one of the best type of games, and this, being evil and having minions (with different abilities for each element), combines many great styles into one, beautiful, high quality, game. Not to mention the Raising Hell expansion pack, plus Overlord II. The artists and mappers who made the worlds did an outstanding job, making the best enviroments I have even seen, and really know how to put detail into the job, and staying on the theme of the zone. The game also shows very funny dark, impish humor. Much like Portal. I would recommend this game to anybody and everybody. Get the full pack on Steam. It's the best deal, and the best game.

												7.5/10What if Pikmin had evil goblins instead of cute plant aliens? Overlord is the answer. This is a game where you're the villain - something you don't see too often in gaming - and your goal is to be the overlord (duh). To do that, you must go through series of missions where you gather resources, amass armies of minions and slay the heroes who have since fallen to the seven deadly sins. You can either choose to make the inhabitants of the land your subjects or simply slaughter everyone.Overall this game is a simpler Pikmin. There is not much to it that Pikmin does not also do, other than obviously the completely different setting and a smaller army of creatures in your command. The Overlord character's animations are... lacking at best and goofy at worse, but then again, why attack yourself when you have an army of obedient minions? It's nothing too spectacular, but it's a fun experience nonetheless.Remember to murder every sheep you see.			",63,15,0,9,5,2,7

												Well, it's nicely made, fine animated, has a humours touch, and a semi-original idea (slightly dungeon keeper feeling).The only thing I felt missing is a map of some kind.Played it for about an hour and a half but in spite of all the goodie mentioned above, I didn't seem to have fun playing it.Got me thinking and I believe the issue is it feels like just another dull quest run marathon. I might not have given it the chance it deserves and perhaps it gets better over time but i'll spend my time elsewhere.Kinda wish there was a neutral opinion one could write but since its either thumbs up or thumbs down, i land on the latter.

												I played through this on console and thought it would be fun to pick it up on a steam sale and play through again with the expansion and play it on a harder difficulty. I had great memories of this game but the Legendary difficulty is a joke, everything has ridiculous hp and damage, except for you and your minions. After spending about an hour trying to beat the first boss Melvin, I gave up. So I started on Normal difficulty and it is way to easy. If you have never played before it is still a great game, just sad they never actually play tested the Legendary difficulty.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

A Paladin’s Steam Review: Overlord & Overlord: Raising Hell. Frustrating Gameplay & Conflicted Themes Doesn't Make One Evil.Genre: 3rd Person Tactical RPG. Developed & Published by: Triumph Studios and CodemastersPlatform: Windows only. Business Model: Base Game + Expansion. Copy Purchased by Myself PreambleOriginally posted by Overlord: Raising Hell Steam Description:How evil can you get? Discover how corruptible you are in Overlord, the twisted fantasy action adventure where you can be evil (or really evil). In the game's seriously warped fantasy world, players will become the Overlord and get first-hand experience of how absolute power corrupts absolutely.To me, this paragraph is describing another game entirely. It's one case of marketing that I could argue negatively affected my impression, and eventual review, of a game. I did create a review several years back but I've returned after several years to make it informational and useful to you, the reader. So, let's begin. Overall Story ThoughtsOverlord is a quirky cartoonish game sure, but a dark twisted fantasy adventure where you get to be really evil? I disagree. It’s true that people who do evil deeds don’t feel evil or in the wrong when they’re doing them. But...well...let's talk about the story. In the game, you're setup as some sort of evil Overlord, tasked with bringing darkness and ruin to the world along with the help of your minions. So, you go out into the world and destroy people who are more evil than you and bring peace….and prosperity….to the land. Ok, that's one way it ends. The other way the story ends is that you create a land ruled by fear and your power's corruption and devastation of the lands. But all it does is affect the ending cutscene, not the game itself. Well, it doesn't affect it that much. I really don't like games that set me up to think that my in-game actions will affect the world when all it really does is affect the end cutscene. This game doesn't really let you be an evil overlord during the course of play. Part of which is to be blamed on the more comedic, cutesy tones present throughout the story. You can’t just randomly kill people if you wish, only in special circumstances. While you can set fire to wheat fields, slaughter sheep and destroy all the kegs of beer you can see, they just regrow back as soon as you leave. I get that it needs to be that way for gameplay reasons but it’s hard to feel evil when you know what you’re doing isn’t really harming anyone. If anything, I just feel more like a destroyer of boxes than a ruler of all that is dark and evil. I can’t even make children cry at the sight of me! I mean, c'mon. What is this...All that said, it does make for a decent time as more of a comedic/light fantasy story than a dark tale of power & corruption. Characters are two dimensional and stereotypical but the interactions can be somewhat amusing at times. Especially between the Overlord and the town citizens. All typical fantasy creatures can be found here. Drunken Dwarves, Ethereal Elves, Portly Halflings, Dumb Trolls and more are in this world, serving the part they play in most any other fantasy genre. You get to see a decent variety of locations too. But there wasn't much that surprised me. Gameplay ThoughtsYou control up to 100 minions and an unnamed overlord at the same time. The overlord gets a melee attack chain and the use of spells but he should generally stay out of the fight. Otherwise, you'll wind up running out of health and mana extremely fast. So, you'll be playing most of the game through your four types of minions: Brown melee minions that will generally make up the cannon fodder of your army. Red fireball throwing minions that are immune to fire. Green poison immune minions that will backstab enemies.Blue minion reviving ones that are immune to water and have weaker attacks. It’s a decent variety of minions but the game lacks in tactical decision making. Just send swarms of minions at your enemies and recall if you notice a big telegraphed attack coming. That’s really about the sum of the combat. Most of the time you’ll be losing minions because the controls didn't respond or you didn't see a hazard in time. That or they become stuck on doing whatever activity you ""assigned"" them or in the terrain. The sweeping function doesn't help matters either as it has the same issues. It’s more tiresome than enjoyable to deal with these controls when multiple types of hazards/enemies are present in a level. One last thing: I was fighting the camera more than I felt necessary for a 3rd person game which doesn't help the already frustrating gameplay. You have very limited control over it. PC Settings & MultiplayerI never did get a chance to experience multiplayer because the servers were shutdown after Overlord II was released. You can play online through Hamachi but the community has no doubt suffered. There is a split-screen mode though, that’s rather unusual for a PC-centric title. Graphics settings are solid. Resolution options, AA slider, V-Sync, Texture/Debris/View distance sliders are here as well. FOV is missing but you probably won’t need it. Audio sliders are present as well and it supports up to 8.1 speaker systems which is nice. Mouse and Keyboard function well enough but I think controller is the preferred control scheme. Even with a controller, the game feels like it’s fighting me the entire time. The game is getting on to be 8 years old now and it is rather disappointing that the framerate doesn't stay consistent. I noticed even on my current machine that it would fluctuate between 50-60 fps during the first level. I don't think it's enough to be a deal breaker but I wonder how bad it would be to play some of the later levels again. Overlord: Raising Hell Expansion ThoughtsIt’s not worth it. Half of it is challenge levels with a minor amount of story attached and the other half of it is maps for the now non-functioning multiplayer. Unless you really enjoy the mechanics of controlling your minions and want to challenge yourself to a new level of frustration, this expansion is a pass. Oh and keep in mind that the original game won’t launch if the expansion is installed. Not a big deal but something I should mention here. Final ThoughtsI don’t recommend Overlord or Overlord: Raising Hell. While there are glimpses of really fun gameplay, it eventually gets worse over time. Frustration set in long before the game ended and there’s a constant sense of repetition and I want this to end already that plagues the latter half. It just becomes a long grind. Between that and the quirky controls/minion behavior, it leaves a lot to be desired. Additionally, there is a ton of backtracking. The story itself is...ok. Its not awful but its not very memorable either. It seems at odds with itself on whether you're a good guy or bad guy. Outside of smacking minions around, destroying some buildings and killing a few people, you don’t really feel like a true Overlord to me. You just feel like an anti-hero who's a jerk when all I'm doing is defeating corrupted heroes, saving the townspeople from starvation and being a generally good guy. It's a decent enough 3rd person ""RTS"" game but I think it could have been much better given more attention to its gameplay.

												Liked and recommend Overlord in general: nice rpg-action-adventure-rts mix. Disliked the small expansion (Raising Hell): annoying weird quests (contain lots of bad puzzles imho). If Raising Hell comes free/very cheap, then it might be worth purchasing, otherwise just avoid and play the normal Overlord. PS. Game contains lots of good humour (imo).			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is a very light ARPG-ish game, but instead of fighting for yourself you command little critters of 4 types to do things for you in a sort of comical fantasy land.  The game runs fine on moderns systems, doesn't look too great but it doesn't try to and that's okay.  Due to playing offline I can't tell how many hours are in the game, but probably no more than 15 or so.The problem is that while it is passable, the game is fairly generic.  Enemies don't really have a middle-ground threat level, they either fall easily to a swarm of minions or kill your minions in 1 hit.  There's no noticable attrition, just TPKs.  There are some puzzle elements but its hard to do much with the minions to make it all that fun.  The story tries to be slapstick, but kinda just falls flat on the humor.  Controls are mostly fine as long as you remember them.  The 'Raising Hell' expansion adds extra side-zones, which are generally well crafted.  I did 3 of 5 of them.Not bad but nothing really great, all in all.			",278,109,4,59,8,3,22

												Verdict: Skip this one. Play the sequel if you want to try this franchise out. You're not missing anything story or gameplay wise. This is like the beta for that game. And everything you didn't like about the core game is worse in the DLC.This needed more work and more commitment. Its like the game was afraid to really let you be an evil Overlord. It feels like a rushed production. They threw together the broad sketch of what an Overlord is but didn't really flesh things out. You'll end up running around doing lots of errands either for the people or your adviser. You can't even sit on your throne. That said, the minions are a fairly well realized bit of gameplay. Point and click and they'll run out attacking your enemies, destroying stuff, pillaging towns. The four types of minions give you some variety for tactical play but honestly you don't need it.Big minuses.1) No minimap or other navigation. You have no way of figuring out how to get anywhere except through raw memorization. You'll even occasionally get directions like ""go east"" when there's absolutely no way of knowing which way east is (you can't see the sun and nothing indicates a cardinal direction)2) Can't sit on throne. 3) The ""evil/eviler"" karma meter system sounds good on paper but in practice it works a lot like a standard karma meter. Thanks to their non committal premise, the villagers are actually happy when you conquer them because the people in charge before were worse. If you want your villagers to fear you, you actually have to go back through their town on a separate ""YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO HATE ME!"" rampage. 4) Cheesy tepid humor. It kind of reminds me of the style of humor you get in Fable 3 but weaker.5) Game undermines the experience of being an Overlord. When you're at the castle you're constantly being nagged by your adviser and mistress to go back into the field to do some overlording. Aside from using the portal to jump to different maps there's almost no point in visiting your stronghold.EDIT: So this review got voted down 4 times. I wonder why? Who is defending this incredibly mediocre game? What have I said about the game that is untrue? I really mean it when I say ""Try the sequel instead"". The sequel really is much better than this. It fixes a lot of my gripes about this game and generally fleshes everything out, making it more robust. In the sequel, instead of this game's karma system where you choose between acting like a good guy who is a little naughty and acting like a bad guy, you get to choose between being a tyrant and a marauder. The second game mostly gets things right. Try that one. Don't waste your time with this one. The plot is very thin in these games and playing the first one will do almost nothing to help you appreciate the second. The one or two plot points from the first game that are relevant in the second one are sufficiently explained in the sequel.			",114,34,0,39,6,1,3

Posted: February 25, 2015
												I got this game and the 2nd one on sale and to be honest after only 3.7 hours i think i don't want to play it anymore. I guess nothing resonnated with me. not the goofy characters, not the aged graphics, not the dull gameplay which mostly consists of pathfinding, not the crummy controls or ""strategy"" (since there isn't any). All of it was really boring and i kind of wish i saved my 5 bucks for something better... like a 5 dollar footlong.Arbitrary score: Boring pickmin clone attempt/pickmin, which is actually goodEdit: Alright, let's get more in-detail then.TLDR: Just go watch Zero Punctuation's review on Youtube, he more or less explains my feelings on this borefest of a game.In this game you control minions which do your♥♥♥♥♥kicking for you as you take on tasks which generally involve making your way through enemies or pathing your minions through a certain route to either kill enemies or collect objects.The strategy is practically nonexistent. There was one section in the halfling homes where you can let out boxes of rats to do some fighting for you, but beyond that it's all just swarming your minions to an enemy or group of enemies while you charge in smashing the space bar (attacking with the overlord) or casting some spells. My patience with the game ended fairly early on. basically what i experienced was the halfling homes and the raided castle as well as some of the hellish place and a good chunck of the forest. I stopped just before i got the green hive because i realized how freaking bored i was at that point. Nothing stood out as fun or interesting and i was already 3 hours in. If a game fails to make much of an impression at that point then it stands to reason that the game doesn't deserve any more of my patience.I call it an attempted pickman clone because it IS. Basically you have colored minions that help you fight enemies and collect objects around the world. that's pickman in a nutshell, only pickman is at least fun in the sense that it controls better and you're fairly quick to get your multicolored friends and start adventuring. In this game i felt like i was getting my minions at a crawl and i didn't feel like i was really adventuring. each level had so much linearity to it that there were only occasionally branches in level design which led to chests for your minions to break open and that's about it. The only real difference is that you have an overlord and the overlord felt boring to play.The overlord can cast spells, attack, and move minions around. He isn't even all too exceptionally strong unless you upgrade his stuff and even then you're doing the same things but with better gear. There was never a point in my 3 hour playtime that i felt like a badass overlord going around being an evil badass. On the contrary i felt like a d-bag running around and checking off a chore list.So there you go. I won't talk about aesthetic since it's to each their own and that's about it. It's a boring game that didn't do anything impressive with 3.7 hours.			",118,19,0,11,3,0,18

It destroyed my whole overlord experience.It is clear that they did not even test it. Just sad. I have been trying to mow (yes, you now have to mow gardens, very overlord activity) for 1 hour straight. The controls are just so bad and the time frame to do it so short that it is just hell.

												This is the expansion add-on for Overlord. Overlord was the 2007 masterpiece, which let the player control minion's of 4 different variety to solve puzzles, battle enemies, and collect items for those hard to reach places.I was expecting this add-on to be a bit boring, not have that much content, and be roughly the same as Overlord but with more missions. How wrong was I? This add-on not only gives the player 20 more hours of gameplay, the game adds onto the story and gives you more fun loving, crazy memorable adventures.This has to be the best add-on I have played on a video game. The levels are fun to play, the detail of the environment is insane, and the missions are the most entertaining I've ever experienced.Had I not have purchased the Overlord package set, I would have missed out of some very good gaming. This is definately a must buy for anyone who loves to explore and adventure in a game with the most beautiful of scenaries.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												a nice addition to the original overlord. the torments that you deal to the former hero's is in many ways very gratifying.

												Short and sweet: bought this game for $5, played 20min of it, Loved it, worth. nuff said. haha but really, if you love minion horde games/questing games, this is one for you. Pros: cool story line, funny cut-scenes, simple config, smooth gameplay, cheap price,                         sequal, easy mechanics , interesting lanscapes/enemysCons: choppy graphics,walk only (no mount/sprint), slow start , Repetitive walking, no indepht character customization.I honestly think that if u are able to get the bundle offer on sale for $5, it is worth it. fun game for my collection, cant wait to check out overlord 2.

												I'm writing this as a review of both Overlord and the expansion, Raising Hell. Honestly, I don't feel Overlord is complete without Raising Hell, since it adds new unique magic items, one of which is almost a must have: the Sword of Life-Stealing.I wouldn't say Overlord: RH is a great game. It barely merits ""good"". But, some of the wit made me chuckle, the combat felt somwhat satisfying, and the crafting tied it together. The minion controls were in a word, awkward. They don't control well, and it basicaly devolves into mobbing enemies or sticking your minions on guard duty.The tactic I found that works the best is once you have the Sword of Life-Stealing and Arcanium armor with +75% or better health regeneration you're basically unkillable. While this does detract from the difficulty, it also makes the game less exhasperating to play.But do you truly get to be an ""evil overlord""? No. if they'd made the main character a knight, gave you binery moral choices that allowed you be to a ""chivalrous knight"" or a ""black knight"", and made all your minions squires instead, the game wouldn't be very different. Is the idea sort of amusing as the backdrop for the gameplay? Sure.Recommended if you want to take a break from all the other third person action games.			",132,6,1,24,11,0,21

												The game has some minor issues that can slow down progression a bit or make combat harder (minions getting stuck, some areas seem unreachable until you find a ""well hidden"" path only your minions can take to get further, etc.)Other than that, it is a fun (&comedic) adventure RPG I can only recommend for everyone to play. It really keeps you playing and surprises you with unique obstacles you need to overcome (for me, especially the rolling enemies + tactics were new). The story and voice acting is great and you feel like you make progress with each upgrade you find. The tower customization feature is cool as well.Play it!9.5/10			",640,166,16,115,52,7,80

												This is a combined review for the main game AND the Raising hell expansion pack.  Overlord is a great game where you basically play a parody version of Lord of the Rings, where you are an Overlord that looks a lot like Sauron and you have to use your minions, ie orcs/goblins or whatever to go and kill humans, halfflings, dwarves and elves.It's a very clever take on the genre, the humour and story added a great deal to the experience for me.  I wont spoil the story but having played the game through a second time I got all the little bits and pieces of hidden things going on, so it's more in depth than just running around and killing things.The expansion pack blends seemlessly with the game, if you have both DO INSTALL Raising Hell straight away, as you can do the missions from it in amongst the missions from the original game, I highly recommend that.The game mechanic of using your minions to attack your opponents, and pick up power ups etc works well, but sometimes their pathfinding is a bit average.  Overall, very funny and fun, only negatives are your minions not always obeying commands and some of the expansion levels use new mechanics that don't work well at all..(when you have to 'mow the grass' go online to get some hints, it will save you from smashing your computer).Don't let the negatives turn you away though.Original game 9/10Raising Hell 8/10			",68,13,0,6,4,0,11

												The original Overlord supplies hours of stupid, mindless fun using hordes of minions to do your bidding. The Raising Hell expansion is pretty much a full on stand-alone game which supplies even more hours of stupid, mindless fun. My biggest gripe with the game is the lack of direction. There is no mini-map or waypoints. Even a directional arrow would have been a welcome addition. Instead, most of the time, I just ended up wandering aimlessly until I found a new objective. The controller support is great for everything except camera positioning--which makes playing with one much more frustrating than it should be.The gameplay feels original and unique over more traditional action/adventure types. The concept never gets stale, but getting lost really took a toll on my patience meter making the game much longer than it needed to be. I never thought I'd put so many hours into it, but it's just so damn fun. It's hard not to recommend.			",666,205,27,65,46,5,114

												This addon to Overlord is a great ride into a new series of realms....a new gate of holy appearance comes to being outside your villiage and your villagers and escaping into it. We can't have that can we? Gather your minions and enter this new portal, wreak havok within and send a message to those who would edge in on your dominance. A great expansion that adds new areas, fun puzzles, and some hilarious throwbacks to the main story. This is a definite buy if you think you've allready taken over the kingdom.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

You have to play the game in the right orther to succeed and continue playing. But, this isn't the problem. The problem is that you need to be very carefull and go to the right places, cause the game sometimes will not guide you to the right place and you will loose your way. But, it is just a small thing.Enjoy being the Overlord and rule everyone!			",38,3,0,8,2,0,3

												For tha master!This is more than fun. Controlling minions to solve puzzles, action battles, kill sheepies, slaughter the villagers(if you want) and more,  getting all sorts of returns, including less minions sometimes. Try the game being either good or evil. I've wasted a LOT of time here, and loved it all.			",95,16,5,14,10,1,33

												Overlord is awesome. In the beginning you only get to kick and push brown people around, but as you progress you get to kick around more colored people. So...if you like abusing colored people, buy this game. Also, you get a waifu and she doesn't leave your home [castle], which is like mandatory waifu behavior. Oh, plus you get to become some dark overlord or some♥♥♥♥♥♥I don't know. I stopped progressing in the story when I got my waifu. Too much fap.			",157,34,10,31,9,1,17

												I installed the Raising Hell expansion after I completed Overlord. It allowed me to continue on by revisiting the four main areas of Overlord and devling deeper into the Infernal Abyss. New enemies, new challenges, and plenty of evil to go around. I was hoping there would be more expansions for Overlord, but if you want more than this you'll have to play Overlord 2.

												Have you always wanted to be the bad guy? Have minnions at your disposal to  spread chaos and evil? Then this is the game for you.When I played this game on my stream (http://www.twitch.tv/pauljongejans) I pretty much had a smile from ear to ear all the way through it.Gnarl's commentary, kicking the Jester, letting my minions kill peasants... if you have even a slightly sinister sense of humor, you are going to love it.There are some minor downsides to the game, for instance, that it's not so linear, that if you're not paying attentinon, you end up going to places where you can't progress without the required steps taken.Also, at times you are presented with options, and whatever choice you make, is permanent.However, this is a good thing, because it creates a good opportunity for replayability. Given you take 1 path in 1 playthrough, you can take the other path in another. Although it's not really that obvious which actions force which path if you don't stand around and wait.All in all, this type of game is super rare and for that I recommend it and give it an 8/10			",20,3,1,3,13,0,11

I could play this game for the rest of my life, yes its that good. So if your reading this, STOP and go get this game now! Overlord Raising Hell is so good and Overlord 2 is pritty good to.

Pros: cool story line, funny cut-scenes, simple config, smooth gameplay, cheap price,                         sequal, easy mechanics , interesting lanscapes/enemysCons: choppy graphics,walk only (no mount/sprint), slow start , Repetitive walking, no indepht character customization.I honestly think that if u are able to get the bundle offer on sale for $5, it is worth it. fun game for my collection, cant wait to check out overlord 2.

												Overlord is a game that has received a lot of love and yet is kinda underappreciated for what it does.The graphics may not be the absolute prettiest anymore, there are moments where you just wanna hunt down the designers for how clunky the minion controls can be, some of the world exploration seems a little boring and the constant repetition of certain lines by NPCs can be annoying.But despite all that, I powered through this game in a few days, beat all the content (not for the first time in my life but for the first time on Steam) and have already played through half the second game.For 20 Euros (for the Complete Pack), you get damn good value for money and some great games. For 5 Euros on sale, you would be stupid not to at least give it a try. A MUST BUY!			",129,34,0,24,16,0,33

												Ok, so I know I am not showing lot of hours on these games. However, I am a HUGE fan. I found these on Steam and thought it would be a good idea to have the online version as a safety for my hard copies. The Overlord franchise has to be a top 10 in my casual games category. I often find myself running a few levels when I am looking for a quick fix for violence with a comical flare. Considering the age of the game, I think it still holds up well even in 2015, though I would certainly appreciate a reboot with some modern graphics power! Fun, Fast and Rollicking, I give this game a solid 9!Look for more reviews as I work my way through a catelog of classic games...			",128,24,0,49,68,0,90

												I loves Overlord. I played it years ago, and fell in love with it.Oh the joy of spreading mayhem with your minions whom love to wear and wield all manner of items.Years later and after loosing my original disc's my hubby saw the weekend sale and immediatly bought the collection for me.... oh how i squealed like a halfling on fire.This game works absolutly perfect on Windows 8 with no crahes what so ever. Oh yes there are glitchs, like minions getting stuck in walls, or under fallen debris, and occasionaly the cut-scenes like to spaz out and do it twice, but the entire game felt like it was made for Win 8, and i highly recommend this and OL2 to anyone and everyone whom enjoys a little evil on the side... heck Gnarl said it.. Evil always finds a way... and watching sheep, and people burn brings that little sence of self satisfaction.So, FOR DA MASTA, and dont forget to wear a bra upon your head and wield a bunch of flowers while you bash on peasants!

												Decent little expansion for Overlord. It adds a bit to the story with a few new areas and it adds a couple unique weapons, a unique helmet, and a unique set of armor which you can forge after finding the moulds hidden throughout the Abyss areas.My only gripe is that in a couple of the Abyss levels there are some ""puzzles"" that you have to complete flawlessly to progress. Now the ""puzzles"" aren't hard in a thinking sense, but since the game was primarily designed for Xbox, I assume, the control when sweeping your minions is sloppy and uncooperative at times when using a mouse. This can cause a lot of frustration.			",451,128,19,25,41,5,43

												I realy wanted to like these games. After hearing so much about them being 'like Pikmin but with goblins' I bought the who series. Sadly, there's more after that 'but' in the sentence. Otherwise, when compared to itself and its very small genre, it's a good game. Pikmin just destroys it, however.			",159,25,3,22,1,0,3

												You'll like this game if: You wanted to see the classic hero story from the opposite side of the spectrum. Traveling with minions singing your praise and fulfilling your every wish is one of the best ego-trips I've had in gaming. Ruling with an iron fist can be fun!

Green minions are stealthy little ♥♥♥♥ers that jump on your back and stab you to death with little claws and devil horns then laugh as you try to throw them off but then decide to get healed by blue when they get hurt but then jump back on you and stab stab stab stab. did i mention they stab?

												Overlord, be the bad guy, control minions, have fun.Its hard to describe what this is, because there are very very few games that do what this game does. For example nintendos Pikmin, which most of you wont even know.So let me explain:You basicly dont fight all that much, instead you control a horde of ever growing amount of goblins that fight in your place. You walk around pointing in directions, or taking direct control of minions to fight enemies. Later in the game you have different minions that you have to micro manage a bit (some are fire immune, some dont die in water).The game has a good pace, some nice humor and its Fable-like graphicstyle is supporting this as well.I can recommend it together with Raising Hell, its cheap now anyway. And while graphicly inferior to Overlord II I had more fun playing the first game.Very good game, get it.'nuff said.			",313,65,5,41,28,1,48

												Expansions are always fun but they don't add all that much, I found it worth it but carefully look at the features before making this purchase.			",152,21,0,30,23,0,52

												Really fun! Actual, honest fun. Although the missions can be a bit long and there is no saving in the missions so you need a good few hours to play!			",358,125,18,72,85,3,129

												One word Minions. Need i say more... well ok. A great game where you are evil, no longer the good champion fighting evil. You are evil fighting to gain control of your domain. In control of four types of minions there are many challenges and things to find. A game where your choices actually affect the world around you and how the ingame characters react to you. Beautiful graphics and well worth playing. If that didn't persuade you then..... MINIONS!!!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Overlord and its expansion, Raising Hell, are rough gems in a world of highly polished turds.Take control of an evil overlord and rebuild your former 'greatness' by any means necessary, or plot related.Pros: - enthralling and cute design, mixing the evil with the fluffy, great job. - humor, humor everywhere. it's a silly game, and it works - minions, god, they're fun - free roaming - good voice acting, some times borderline silly, but still fitting - it will run on your computer, I assure you :DCons: - a bit easy - a bit childish (half a con, I'd say, cause I totally want that) - succumbs to repetetiveness a few hours inVerdict:It's the best surrogate for Dungeon Keeper, while not being anything like Dungeon Keeper.if you enjoy darkly humored hack'n slash, become the Overlord today.

												I purchased Overlord and Overlord: Raising Hell together at a discount, so my review is for both the base game and the expansion. The varied environments and controlling the minions are easily the best parts of Overlord. The graphics are decent and environments look pretty, though character models and animations seem dated. I liked that combat in Overlord isn't solely through the minions, but that your character has upgradeable weapons and spells that allow you to get up close to the action. The music is good while the humor is hit and miss for the most part. The expansion adds in a hell version of the main quest environments called abysses. After 1 or 2 abyss levels, I felt like this formula grew a little repetitive and tiresome, but some elements of them were humorous and enjoyable. The game gradually gets more challenging near the end, but sometimes I felt that excessive grinding/health bars in bosses made conflicts drawn out artificially, testing patience rather than ingenuity. Overall, I was pleased with Overlord and its expansion which I found enjoyable. The game is very long for this genre and this compounds the problem of repetitive gameplay, but if you give yourself Overlord in small doses, you'll find a worthwhile experience.Bottom Line: 7.5/10			",44,19,0,42,1,0,20

												It's like a much more hands-on Dungeon Keeper, with fewer minions and more Rhianna Pratchett. Which is awesome.			",143,27,1,31,31,1,18
