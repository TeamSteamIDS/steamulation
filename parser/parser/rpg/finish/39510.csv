												Gothic II is a gigantic game in a small world. The trick that the devs pulled to make the game seem so enormous was to make use of absolutely every nook and cranny on the map. Most of these places aren't even relevant to the main story; you can plow through the game several times over and still stumble across something new hidden in an easily missed gap between rocks or behind a waterfall at the bottom of a deep valley. Since the game doesn't throw powerful items or experience at you like lots of the loot-fest RPGs out there, the (usually) small rewards secreted away across the island are always satisfying to discover. This and the fact that the game is largely loading screen- and objective marker-free makes the whole world feel alive and supremely explorable. Just be careful; the game will hold your hand for a grand total of five seconds before booting you into a world where all of the local fauna have it out for you and will absolutely WRECK you if you aren't familiar with the somewhat clunky combat system. It gets easier later on but the challenge is always there. Don't be scared though; the danger just makes exploring that much more rewarding.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I have to say, this is one of the most beautiful RPG games I've ever experienced, it definetly earns it's place at the top with TES and other great games of the genre, it's just a shame it never had such a big communtiy and not many people know about it.If you're an hardcore RPG fan, then this is a game for you. It offers countless hours of gameplay, lot's of sidequests and plenty of things to do besides that, from picking berries in the woods to hunting orcs and other critters in the vast open world filled with forests and grasslands. Appart from the great story, the game has one of the most enjoyable combat systems and exploration features.Another thing to mention is the music which also perfectly fits in with the theme and creates an even deeper atmosphere to delve in, however this game isn't  for everyone, the combat can be sometimes found tricky and making money hard, but most players get used to it quickly.This is a must-have if you're an old-school RPG fan, 10/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is in my opinion, the best Gothic game in the series.  There is no lack of quests.  the Ability to roam all around the maps and choose what & how you want to do too proceed is entirely up to you as the gamer.    I also like the fact theres so many different choices you have  for what class and position you take in this game.  If you patch the game corectly it is pretty stable. and in my opinion the only real draw back for buying it on steam is minimizing the game.  other wise it seems more stable then the stand alone. As i have all the games and expansions in regular and Gothic 2 In Gold edition as well.   so if your using windowes 7 or windows 8 may I suggest the Gothic 2 Gold edition on the steam platform.

												Don't look at my play time. I bought the game just so I can write a review.What? Yep.. I did.For the last 12 years I played Gothic franchise. Every winter, when the weather goes bad outside, I have to follow my tradition of playing one of the Gothic games. For 12 years...If you read this far and you never played this game but you call yourself a RPG fan, then do yourself a favor and buy it!Buy it and play it for at least 1 hour. This is how long it will take you to get used to the controls and to  the open-world-no-hand-holding ideology. If I could wrap up the review in some simple words, they would be: Gothic = immersion.This is a common scene that you will find in Gothic 2:Heavy grey sky, raining. It's night and you see the soldiers gathering around a camp fire and chat. One of them even starts roasting the carcass of a hunted animal over the fire, preparing the dinner. The merchants sit down in front of big water pipes and relax, smoking different types of weeds. An owl can be heard in the forest close to the camp while through the trees, you can see some Scavangers going to sleep for the night. You decide to also sit on a log and enjoy some socialization time after all the fighting and hunting done over the day.Pros:- solid story with deep lore, a mix between religion, mysticism and politics.- unprecedented AI behavior! Seriously, this franchise is 16 years old but even today the Ai scripting, behavior and combat is unmatched in any other RPG. Sure some other games excel in certain segments of AI implementation, but overall, you wont see a more vivid and realistic AI.- a true open world. If you see something in the distance, you will most likely be able to reach and explore it. There are many level designers that can provide good content with a large world, but only geniuses can make every inch of a small world filled with content.- your actions matter. Stealing from someones house or chest? Bad idea. Beating up some important NPC that has many friends and connections? Really bad idea. Betraying a whole faction and be responsible for their deaths? Awesome!- a very natural and diverse quest system. Make friends, make enemies, steal, hijack, frame some or prove the innocence of others in order to unlock more quests.- choose your path. This is not Skyrim or Mass Effect. Once you chosen a faction, there is no turning back! Playing each faction it's basically a separate playthrough. This is how much the game changes depending on the path taken!- absolutely beautiful soundtrack, realistic nature sounds and good voice over.Cons:- somewhat awkward control scheme, but it's consistent! Once you learn to handle it, the controls feel smooth.- outdated graphics. D'oh! 16 years old engine.- almost no hand holding. No flashing quest marks over NPC heads, no minimap, no pointers all over the screen (probably this is also a reason why the game is so immersive... nothing to distract you from the actual game)- high difficulty in combat, but not unfair!- access violation error for some systems, that can be easily solved by running the game in Windows XP SP2 compatibility mode + Administrator rights.By today standards the game is 7 / 10. But, by taking a look at the game industry today... this game is a 10/10 from head to toes. This is a rough gem that deserves a chance to be discovered.Piranha Bytes, thank you for creating Gothic series. With all my heart, thank you!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Gothic II. What a great, rewarding and exciting game.After a series of events, you break out of the colony with friends you made there. Freedom, right? No.You weren't the only one to break out. Most bandits got out too and started to rob and murder innocent citizens of Khorinis. People see you as a nobody yet again, but slowly you gain respect and eventually become a respected man across the island, saving Khorinis from an evil force that's about to struck it.Gameplay is improved in many ways over the first game. Controls don't feel stiff. Combat is fun and never gets old: you hold LMB and use WASD to swing your weapons in different directions, no button mashing involved.You can join different factions: Paladins, Mercenaries and Mages. All of them are very different and have a lot of faction-related quests, so it's worth it to beat the game multiple times.You visit a lot of places in the game: the main island of Khorinis, the colony from the first game (which is now abandoned, grey and full of orcs at every step that'll murder you in mere seconds), swampy Jarkendar from the expansion and some other minor ones. All locations are unique and different, NPCs have their own chores and the game feels alive. I'll be honest, I got immersed. I spent hundreds of hours wandering around and finding cool quests and secrets.Gothic II is my favourite RPG and I beat it many times. It's the experience I will never forget.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Maybe i'm blinded by nostalgia, but I don't care. This game is exceptionally good for all those who seek a hard core RPG experience with a quirky plot and badass dragons.The game runs great on my windows 8.1 gaming laptop, with no errors. I have read some negative reviews which claim to have problems getting the game to launch. If the steam version has some error that I am not aware of, then there is always the option to purchase Gothic II: Gold Edition from GOG.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game was an absolute doozy and I loved every minute of it.Pros:- LONG STORY (took me 70 hours to complete it my first time through)- A deeper combat system than the last game.- A lot of dynamic characters- Good writing- Deep leveling system- Unique weapons. armor and enemies- A vast open world- Great ambient sounds- Magnificent soundtrack- Nostalgia for Gothic 1 players- DIFFICULT AS ♥♥♥♥- Lots of replay value- Animations for everything (even drinking and eating)- Strong endingCons:- A few glitches on the last island in Ch. 6 (can be fixed with fan made patch you can get from worldofgothic)- Sometimes unfairly difficult- Voice acting is still subpar- Disappointing final boss- Too many fetch quests- The difficulty at the start can deter newer playersOverall this game blew me away and I can see why people claim it to be the best Gothic game out there. It deserves a 9/10.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Posted: November 25, 2013
												So let`s start: Gothic 2 is second part of RPG saga Gothic and balh blah blah (Wikipedia.org says that ). But I want to start from my point of weave and tell what I think about it: Gothic 2 was one of the first (first was Gothic 1) RPG`s I got my hands on my in my childhood, back in 2002 it was something unbelivible and awesome in terms of lore, combat, magic... and at the same time it wasnt ovrloaded like modern RPG`s with stuff you dont need.Good side: Gothic 2 was briliant game and ""Piranhas"" managed to fix those problems they had in gothic 1 (exept those that were not possible to fix thx to engine limitations as I know) game is friendly to those who are new to the world of Gothic and kingdom of Myrthana and those who know it from privious game. Every NPC that was in first part almost ask you do you styll remember him or not so you can learn something about him. Gameplay: game play is devided in chapters that make game slightly harder to beat if you just fast run from point A to point B, after release of Night of Raven (and latter the Gold edition that we have here) game became biger and harder to finish at fast run. another good side is Open world that has its own life: from fealds with insects , to forests with wolves and ancient secrets in them and to swamps filled with flys and other animals that could kill you just because you went there. Oh... and almost forgot: Gothic 2 have dragons and they are more brutal then in Sky***.Bad side of gold: First bad side is some texture glitches aspecialy in darkness, second patch used in Gold forces you to search for patch that downgrades game version so you could instal some mods on it. And ofc age of graphys could scare new people who want to try this game. and maybe some problems with searching quest locations. and there were problems with Win 7 as I remember but I belive drivers were fixed on video cards so that problem was solvedall in all: Gothic 2 Gold is an RPG that every fan of genrie should try no matter of problems that may accure as they should brake your PC in half as it gives you plenty of time to waist and you will want to try other paths of game play to see what could have be done differently. I hope I helped and make you reader interested in this game and you will spend your time with joy.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Gothic 2 is a fascinating survival game based on exploration, discovery and choices. You have to live off what you can find, you cant afford to buy anything for a good while, coin is scarce and prices are high.You can achieve your goals in many different ways, nothing is forced upon you.You can also screw up in many different ways, nothing is handed to you (typical for all Pyranha Bytes games).Graphics are dated by today's standards but they are so well done that after a while they start looking quite good, they grow on you.The combat system can be very awkward, confusing and annoying at first, i know it was for me, but once you begin to figure it out, it gets quite rewarding.The survival feeling is there, anything can kill you in a hit or two, you start with the shirt on your back a knife and a branch as your weapons.You can find strange and interesting characters that offer you choices, or you can miss them if you rush, doesnt matter because whatever path you chose the journey will be worthwhile in different ways.

												If you love RPG's, and like to explore every corner of the open world, reach places that seem unreachable, collect everything you can find, save and load to find the most experince and amusement rewarding options - this is the game for you. On the collector's side - it has unlimited inventory, so you don't have to bother to double back to your chests every now and then. The plot is straitforward, but, nonetheless, interesting. There are three portions of the island, you can explore(on of which should be familiar to those who played the original Gothic), with dozens of NPCs and quests, hundreds of monsters, and thousands of stuff lying around or hidden to be found by curious players. Have fun, Chosen of the Gods, Khorinis is waiting...P.S. I recommend IronKeep Comunity patch 2.41 with ""alternative balancing"" (which is realy a few minor fixes), but wihout the textures. For texture pack - Gothic 2 Graphics Overhaul - and it looks much better and modern.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												If you like RPG's - this is a must have. Get the Gothic Collection (1, 2Gold and 3) all together. 30 hours in Gothic1, over 70 in Gothic2 and maybe 40 in Gothic3 (have yet to finish it) left a some great memories in my mind.This is easily one of the best RPG's i ever played, there is no question about that.The story is great and very interesting. Gothic series is one of the games i never skip a dialogue in just because it has so much useful and interesting information. Almost every NPC there is can and will give you useful stuff that will help you reach your goals.The graphics are obviously not super, because this game is pretty old, but nonetheless they are still really good. You might not like them at first just like i did, but an hour or 2 after you will love them.  Its impossible to explain how cool the atmoshepere of the game is. The music, the graphics... Just wow..And the most important part... The combat system. This is by far one of the hardest games i've played combat wise. This combat system is simple, yet very complicated. It is very hard to understand at first, and even later in the game. But while being hard and very nerveracking sometimes, this game rewards you VERY well if you manage to kill what you need to kill.Anyway, all of this is just words. You NEED to try this for yourself. Have a nice one			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I can't decide whether Gothic I or Gothic II is the better game. Anyway, it's one of the best RPG's and worths playing multiple times. The graphics are fine considering this game is from 2002. It has a stunning open world, a well written story and again is just as amazing as Gothic I.Gothic III lost quite a bit of the series' charm and we don't talk about Gothic IV here. Even worse. Also both Risen games are no match for this master piece.			",100,25,1,12,4,0,25

												Back in 2001, a wonderful RPG named Gothic 1 hit the markets. It’s truly an open world adventure that has absolutely no hand holding. Brutal yet fair, it’s not for everyone. Personally, I enjoyed the game despite its weird user-interface. Yet in hindsight, it actually served well enough as, in parts, can be quite immersive. Two years later, and to my surprise, Gothic 2 hit the markets. This game took all the strengths of Gothic 1 and enhanced it a hundred times – so much it makes Gothic 1 looks like a tech demo. Yet there are some slight weaknesses like the user interface however it’s minor comparing to what the game can offer overall.Depending what you want from this game determines the length of time to complete. For me, I tried to complete everything possible from picking up every plant to completing all of the quests possible. Even I used to walk option to explore any new areas so it took me around 100 plus hours to complete all six chapters. And the beauty of this is that, the game had a really decent pace to it – other words, it didn’t feel like a chore at all. That said, Gothic 2 is a game that RPG players will be proud of. It has all the elements of a proper RPG ranging from interacting to combat to exploration. The UI still needs tailoring however, after a little practice, it’s passible and won’t cause too much grief. An absolute must for any lovers of RPGs yet newcomers will find this a little too daunting.Full review here: http://www.gamespot.com/gothic-ii/user-reviews/2200-12659434/9 / 10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Gothic 2 is a masterpiece that aged incredibly well. The very first city you arrive at still feels vibrant and real, the characters (at least the male ones) are superbly done with believable motivations and actions.It's a child of its age - there's nearly no strong female characters, the men go out and fight beasts while the womanfolk stay at home to raise the kids and cook, and the monsters (with the exception of dragons) are there to be slain, and not talked with.Despite its age, and despite these misgivings, it took until the Witcher 3's release this year to provide a game that matches the immersion and believability of Gothic 2.Play it. You'll quickly get used to the graphics and the controls, and you will not regret it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A fantastic RPG with an unparalleled sense of progression, well developed combat system, and a world that feels truly lived in. The controls take some getting used to but with a bit of effort soon become second nature. It may be dated graphically with blocky models and stiff animations but surprisingly the texture work is very good and in some places even outshines some modern games (which is depressing - get your♥♥♥♥♥♥together developers). I recommend playing Gothic 1 before 2 because the second game builds heavily upon the characters, story and setting from the first game and certain parts from 2 will feel more rewarding after having finished Gothic. Having played both games for the first time in the year of our lord 2013 I can say without the slightest trace of nostalgia that Gothic 1 & 2 ranks high amongst the finest of western RPGs.

Posted: March 29, 2015
												This is by far the best game you will ever play. I have personally never played a better RPG. I will now go into detail about why this is the best way to spend your money on a game.First of all the story: If you have played Gothic 1 you will get to meet many of your old friends again. I personally played Gothic 1 after Gothic 2, and it didn't matter alot. Most of the dialogues give you the option to navigate around having met them before (in Gothic 1), but I surely do encourage you to play Gothic 1 before since it will greatly improve your enjoyment when meeting your old brothers again. The story continues perfectly with twists and new problem and adventures to explore. Honestly, the story is probably the best thing about this game, it just makes you love the characters, form realtionships, go on quests together and knock on baddies heads.Now to the Wolrd and its design: Epic. That's the only word you need to describe Gothic 2s' worlds. Piranha Bytes has the best team when it comes to creating maps. Every inch is used to its maximum potential, there are a big variety of different locations, each one unique and special in some way. In every corner there is a secret to discover or a unknown Boss-Mob to defeat. In Gothic 2s' worlds every step feels special, there is always something you didn't notice on your first walk along a path.Furthermore to the gameplay: Gothic isn't a game that babysits you through your playtime. You get thrown into the cold water (literally in Gothic 1 :) ), noone is there to show you where to go for a quest, no markers on your UI, no markers on the maps, nothing. It just feels like you are really in that world, wandering around not knowing where to go or who you will meet behind the next turn. It surely is a hardcore RPG experience, the controls might feel weird at first, but you will get the hang of it quiet fast. The combat might seem a little hard at the start, you will feel like your hero is good for nothing, you will get beat up alot. You are weak at the start, but once you get your first proper sword and armor, you can wreck **** up! Gothic has a basic, but good level and skill system. Though I must say it's strongly unbalanced without the proper mods installed (I will get to that later). You can do anything that is possible in a medieval world: Fight with one-handed and two-handed swords, use bows and crossbows, shoot magic bolts, summon undead creatures or let fire rain upon your enemies.A few personal notes about the game: I almsot can't describe the game in words, it's just the most epic, legendary, bestest, amazingest game you will ever play. If you don't give a damn about graphics like me and just play for the gameplay and the story, then this is perfect for you. Just ignore the graphics ( they were good for the time the game was first released ), once you are in a playsession nothing will matter to you but the game and the story. You will have at least 50 hours of pure joy during the story, if you only play through the story, if you suck out the maximum potential of the game you can spend atleast 300 hours trying out different guilds, different character skilling, exploring side-quest ( there is a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ ), or just wandering in the wildness slaying mobs and gazing at the epicness of this game.I think the addon could've been implemented better into the game. I am saying this as someone who has played the game withouth the addon first. I just didn't feel it in the addon, it seemed a little empty, but it surely offers A TON OF AWESOME LOOT and more old friends from Gothic 1 to meet. It just didn't, didn't do it, if you know what I mean, it felt kinda sloppy. The world could've been used more in the addon, more like the main map.Now to the comability issues everyone is talking about:If you think it just buy game, download, play, you are mistaken, soooooo deeply msitaken.It is incredibly hard to get this game running if you have no idea how ""modding"" works, or if you are installing the game for the first time. You need 3 different communitypatches at least and a ton of configuring the game files. Thanks to the community over at WorldOfGothic though its not that hard, they helped me install it a couple of times too. It is definitly worth the trouble though, this game is so incredibly epic it just has to be played.Continueing on that is the bad balancing the addon brings in, I STRONGLY advise to install a rebalancing mod (I use minimod balance), because the level/skill system is stupid in the normal state ( you will notice yourself though).Finishing this long post:Gothic 2 is the best game ever created and anyone not playing it is missing out on alot.Thanks for reading my rather long review, it is my first and I just couldn't express how I feel about the game..P.S.: sorry for any spelling-errors, am too tired to proof read this ;P			",43,4,0,9,10,0,18

												One of my most favoured games ever. I grew up with this game, like back then I now still love the game. It is not only nostalgia which makes me praise this game but the lively world. The memorable characters with their voices, actions and characteristics are something what not every game can offer. The atmosphere of the whole world is unique and never gets boring, as you wander through dark dungeons or peasants fields. Every place offers new persons to speak with, quests to aquire, monsters to slay and equipment to find. Most quests are designed thoughtfully and always have a story behind. Rarely you will find a quest which requires to bring X to Y. If it is the case then you will still enjoy it, as you enjoy the atmospheric environs. The game contains many kinds of weapons, from swords to crossbows, and many consumable items. Every character in the game has some kind of disposition and ethos, they react if you steal them, hit them or betray them to the milita. So you have to be careful what you do. In addition, the soundtrack of this game is marvellous and never gets boring, no matter how often I listen to it.I have spent many hours with this game and appreciate its atmosphere and complex world everytime. Furthermore I want to mention the level of difficulty of the game. I can understand that this game is difficult to master for players new to RPGs. Additionally the partly clumsy controls do not make it easier to survive, but I bid everyone to give the game a try. It just takes a bit time to understand the mechanics and to get used to the controls.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												No one will read this review, because the game's old, but I've been really into this old gem, and wanted to give it some love.This is the best openworld RPG I've ever played, and I've played damn near all of them. (New Vegas might come close, but is crippled by Bethesda's idiotic VATs combat.)The game's heart is driven by a well balanced progression that feels really damn good. The satisfaction of growing from an unknown, unliked hero who runs away from wolves to a master swordsman who slays mighty beasts has never been captured so well. Sure, every game does it, but here, you feel that change viscerally, and it's damn satisfying. Starting the game not as the Savior of Mankind but a hopeless wimp might rub some people the wrong way but I can't get enough of that sort of thing.I also very much enjoyed the main city. Very convincing as a living place. Damn near every person you meet has something going on. You could easily spend five hours getting things done in the first city alone.The map is huge, and rewards exploration, and while games like Oblivion might also offer that, here your exploration is lended a sizable amount of tension, as you never know what might be lurking around the corner ready to tear your head off, or what treasures you might find.Another thing I found well considered  is that each piece of gear carries a significant amount of weight. Though you may only wear a few sets of armor throughout the game, getting that first upgraded fills you with a sort of glee as you start to imagine all those difficult places you may now be able to explore. It also adds a certain element of realism to the entire experience, which aids in the immersion, which is nice in a game like this.Choice and consequence isn't a huge part of the game, but in choosing who you ally with, there is plenty enough of that, if that's something you worry about. And many quests do give you at least one or two minor options in how you complete it.The plot and writing aren't anything special, but the intaraction between all the guilds and your hero is well done, and it's perfect for a game like this, where your only wish is to be left alone as you run all over the map. The voice acting is stellar. Bad, but in a way that knows it's bad. So it's good!The game obviously isn't terribly pretty, and it can be hard getting it to run on new operating systems (check the guides), but if this is your jam, then you better make some toast, because Gothic 2 is a big delicious helping of open world goodness!6/10 IGN GOTY!!!No, but seriously, guys. It's pretty good.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is one of the best action roleplaying experiences despite its age and graphics. The world has to be one of the best designed game worlds. In the forests you are scared and quickly try to reach the nearest civilization, you find peaceful farms and behind the next corner lingers death. The world is vertical, meaning you explore hidden mountain paths and caves, wildlife, plants and enemies. Everything has a very dense atmosphere.The inhabitants of this world have their daily routine, everybody has his own agenda. You and others have to sleep, eat and fight for survival. This feels more real than in games like Skyrim, for example. You choose your faction and this is exclusive.There is alchemy and there are various forms of magic. All that and some unique quests make this game one of my favourite RPGs. May Piranha Bytes develop another such immersive game. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												One of the best RPG I ever played. It manages to let you have a great adventure very well by offering you an intresting and fully interactive world. One of the best features in my mind that Gothic Series especially Gothic 2 have are the NPC. They don't feel like they are just there for a quest, but rather are a part of the living world. Things happen to them too, while you experience your adventure. Some of them even guide you in this adventure by trading with you, fighting by your side, even training you and just sharing usefull information. This is strongly supported by the great level design, while it is open to you it has many interesting places and characters for you to find, but also traps and obstacles to avoid. All this is laid with an challenging, but fair difficulty.I have played this game four times now and I had a blast every time!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												What can I say?This game is a masterpiece. From the first moments you are drawn into the game world and attachment only grows with time. Gothic takes different approach to open world design. Instead of wast continents, you are given relatively small island, but unlike almost all other open world games, here every inch of it was meant to be explored. It is masterfully designed, every area hand crafted, every plant, animal and rock placed with care and purpose. The game is very challenging, but the challenge is fair, it is consistent with game world and serves a narrative purpose. It is set in a harsh, dangerous world where you have to earn the right to call yourself a hero. And each achievement is all the more satisfying for it. You are learning the world, it's challenges, you test yourself against every adversity and seek ways to overcome it, you begin to appreate it's unyielding difficulty. Quests and encounters are very engaging and interesting. They stem from the reality of the games fiction and never feel out of place. They are cleverly designed, surprising you in pleasant ways and challenging you in an interesting manner. 3 game factions and 3 different combat builds, create very good replayability. Though controls and combat may seem clanky at first, even they are designed in a way that does not detract from the game experience. And perhaps the greatest acomplishment of the game designers, is how every aspect of the game ideally works together and creates one very cohesive whole. If you like challenging gameplay, harsh and dangerous game worlds, great exploration and zero undeserved ego masturbation/empowerment, this game is for you. Grab German beer, place a battle axe across your lap, put on your most manly man face and enjoy your new favourite game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Alright, so... Gothic 2, eh? First and foremost, don't be fooled by my gameplay hours, because I've modded the hell out of this game and I'm using a custom launcher that doesn't trigger the play count. I've spent my entire childhood playing this game (and it's founding father) and I can say that I've mastered it at such a degree, that I can simply find nothing else to discover. I know everything, every quest, npc, attack pattern of monsters, hole, cave, easter egg, etc..The game itself is a must buy for any RPG fan out there. The controls may feel clunky in the beggining, but you'll get used to them. Step 2: it's difficulty is so unfair, you'll think satan crated this game. But that actually offers a much more rewarding gameplay experience.Step 3: There are 3 factions you can join:-> Paladins: Holy warriors that deliver judjement with their sword and magic. A hybrid class.-> Dragon Hunters: Bandits and stole some nice weapons and armor and went bird hunting.-> Magician of Fire: A pure mage is one of the hardest class to play, until you get the right amount of mana, mana potions and spells. The class is downright OP in the end game. Step 4: The music is simply blending with the surroundings in such a perfect way, I almost came just thinking about it.Step 5: You gonna have to patch the game a little, since it came out over 15 years ago. You'll simply need 3 patches to avoid any critical error you might encounter. WorldOfGothic . com is your friend. Regarding the outdated graphics, there's a DX 11 patch that removes the frame rate cap and makes the game look incredible. Search it on ytube.Oh, you might ask yourself, where's Step 1?Step 1 is BUY THE FRIGING GAME!!! It's amazing. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Rating: 10/10 (Its my personal opinion and i know many people would argue about that)Gothic was released in November 29, 2002, old school game worth paying attention to. This is the game of my childhood. I have replayed it over 20 times and it never got old for me.=========================================================================| Steam breaks the game so before i write down a review i'd like to post a fix that worked perfectly to me |(Go to the directory , find the exe. in [System] folder. Set the exe. to admin use and change the name of [Vdfs32e.exe] to something diffrent. After that the game should work fine. You can change one more thing but thats optional at the point , if you need diffrent resolution in-game , go to [gothic2.ini] and find a line called [extendedMenu=0] change the line to [extendedMenu=1] and now you can use better resolution in-game. Hope this helped)=========================================================================|Pros|+Amazing folow up to the first game , expanding the story. (You should probably play the first game , if you need a review of it , it is on my profile)+Improved combat from the last game+Great story with multiple factions to choose from+Many ways to finish a quest+Verity of weapons , armor and skills+Chalanging gameplay+Up to 50 hours of gameplay or more if you explore the whole map + The expansion that gives even more play time+Replayability+Interesting dialoge / characters+Exploration / Secrets scatared all over the map-------------------------------------------------|Cons|-Lots of retracking and running around (Although i don't find it that bad. After all it forces you to explore. Until act I ends)-Steam version makes the game break , and for many people it is the game killerWell i can't find many cons to be honest , I love the game for what it is and i do recomend buying it even for standard price on steam.

												Gothic 2 + Night of the Raven addon is definitely the best game I have ever played. The 2nd best game is probably the first Gothic. Playing both parts sequentially, the story and gameplay is just so epic. When you get to meet your old buddies from Gothic 1, in Gothic 2 world, you're just so full of joy. And when you're finally going back to the 'Valley of Mines'(where all the action of 1st Gothic happens at), and see how everything's changed, you just feel so epic. I can't even describe the feeling I got, when I first entered Valley of Mines in Gothic 2.Yes, the game is old, graphics aren't the best, and combat is often mistaken as 'broken' or glitchy or in any other way bad. But I think that the combat is one of the parts where the first two Gothic games shine the most! It takes a bit getting used to, but it's atleast not mindless LMB clicking or just 1 button. You actually have to use some kind of tactics for different monsters. If you're not careful even a pack of Scavengers could kill you - the High Mage of Fire, Dragon hunter or Paladin(depending who you join).And talking about graphics again, yes they don't have the sharpest textures, or the 'super cool' bloom effects or any other postfx's. But the game still looks brilliantly, especially for such an old game. I much prefer these kinds of visuals, than the overly realistic ones in games nowadays. Anyways, I could talk about it all day, just go ahead and buy the damn game! It's really awesome!10/10 from me.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I have nothing but good things to say about this game. If you have at least Windows 7 you should be able to run it no problem. Do yourself a favor, get this game.Not clouded by nostalgia mind you. This game would deserve all the praise in the world for what it did. Ahead of it's time by at least a decade.Dragons? Had it. Pirates? Had it. NPC AI to the point they have a daily routine? Had it. Immersive, harsh world? Had it.This game did what many failed to do from the get go. It's a sequel, to an already masterful game, yet it took it's base and expanded on it, with a good storyline, memorable characters, enemies and a soundtrack that you'd hear in your ears for aslong as you can remember. It takes place on an island, named Khorinis to be more precise, you are the nameless hero, rescued from certain death by an ally who is about to send you on an even more perilous journey.I have never played a game that felt so alive, so organic, the island isn't even that big but, it feels massive, absolutly packed with content that after 4+ playthroughs there will still be something new to find.You will be able to take 3 paths. Each parallel to the next to reach one end, but as they say, it's not about the destination it's about the journey. Wildlife, bandits, thieves, orcs, giant lizards, re-animated Mayan style golems, undead and dragons all ready and waiting to end your life in a myriad of ways. The Landskape of the Island itself is lush and quite vibrant for a game it's age.Honestly. The only true flaw I can name would be that most Operating Systems will no longer run this game. I managed to have it on Windows 7. Have an old laptop for the single purpose of playing Old Games like this one. It's quite possible to still play it on modern ones mind you, the Gothic Comunity was still very much aware of such issues, so patches were made and guides along with them.TL:DR: Groundbreaking game for those who played it in it's time. If you have the patience to get it up and running, it will more than be worth your money. If nothing else, get it on sale. If all else fails, the refund button will still work.PS:It should also be noted that I played this game for over 10 years, I merely got it on Steam to kill some nostalgia.PSS:If you become a fan of the Franchine, jump from 3 to Risen. Arcania was, to put it mildly, an accident. Have a good day.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Well worth a look for an older game, and if you played it back when released it's even more worth a replay! The new graphic and resolution upgrades combined with the newest 'Gold' version make this game a joy to play, the characters, the locations, the combat, and the massive content welcome you back with open arms. I'm currently playing it at 2560x1080 (I've beaten this game 3x with different factions: magic, militia and mercs previously in the past) and it looks better than ever, however, you must download the patches that unlock the new graphic goodies... then if you really want the best experience edit the .INI file for even more sweet detail and functionality... all of this takes no more than a few minutes.Bottom line... if you are starving for a great single player RPG with over 100 hours of game play, deep dialog and an unforgiving open world, look no futher.Edit: Skyrim & Obilivion fans, get ready to get your butt kicked, this game has No leveled loot, No leveled mobs... wander in to the wrong place and get crushed like a bug, you've been warned!

												For Windows 8 users what needs to be done is to open task manager and end processes 'Logitech SetPoint Event Manager' and 'Windows Host Process (rundll32)'. In the game folder the gothic2.exe must be run in compatibility for Win XP (sp2), and in steam the 'steam overlay' must be disabbled for this game. Also running it in window (setted up in Gothic.ini) shows 100% of the game (in full screen line at the top is hidden).For Win 7 I assume it will be simmilar, but the Windows host process might be called differently (perhaps just rundll32).But apart from that it is an amazing game, even today :-)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												My favorite game of all time. Play it still to this day every now and then. I would make a more detailed review, but everyone has already said the same thing multiple times and I do not think I need to repeat it. But to make things short, what makes this game so great are these things imho: Strong atmosphere, great soundtrack, attention to details, difficulty, no ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t tutorials, mini maps, point marks etc. Memorable characthers, hand crafted world and way more.

												Gothic 2 is a great game that I played in my childhood days. Now 10 years later it's still a great game!Yes, it's old and the controls and graphics definitly aren't the best and it may take you a while to get used to it, but once you're used to it it's so much fun! :DThe Story is great with a lot of quest and decisions that you can make and...♥♥♥♥ IT!

												One of the greatest RPGs ever created.It's not as colourful as, say, Amalur or Oblivion, it's not as gloomy as Dark Souls or Dragon's Dogma...the (original) Gothic games managed to create their very own niche. While not being as 'grimdark' as The Witcher or Dragon Age (which are so ridiculously ♥♥♥♥ed-up and gritty in terms of atmosphere it borders on satire), it's a very organic and believable world with lots of violence, swearing and crime, but also loyalty, good friends (DIEGO!) and great characters and stories. There are hundreds of individual characters (sadly with reused voice actors, although they at least managed to mix up their way of speaking a bit) and most of them will send you on errands, trade with you or beat your♥♥♥♥♥if you disrespect them. As in the other Gothic (or Risen) games there are three main factions, one of which you'll have to join to advance in the main questline. For simplicity's sake those factions could be described as fighters, mages and something in between (Paladins)- each of them plays differently, just like you could expect from the according RPG archetypes. Each of the factions and locations comes with heaps of sidequests, all in all there are hundreds of them. The controls are a bit outdated as it is very keyboard heavy and the combat system takes some (or lots of) getting used to as it relies almost completely on your chance to do critical hits, which of course is very low in the beginning of the game, possibly making the first few hours very difficult.As the game is 10 years old, the visuals won't win any prizes. But the game still manages to deliver a very dense atmosphere and consistent visual feeling. The audio on the other hand is still great. You'll get a great soundtrack (although some tracks are looped heavily), nice voice acting (I've played the German version as its the one I played when the game first was released but I read that in the English version there are renowned voice actors like Keith Szarabajka of Skyrim and Fallout:NV fame) and fitting ambiance sounds.A few words warning though: with the expansion Night of the Raven pre-installed, the game is very hard for beginners. You'll get your hindside kicked. Again and again. But in Gothic 2 there's always a way to complete your task.You have to kill a strong monster early in the game? Look around in town if there's someone willing to accompany you on your hunt. Or go to the local scroll merchant and buy a spell to transform yourself into a strong monster. Or you could even just try to get the monster's attention and lure it to the city guards. Even as a Gothic veteran there are still possibilities and ways to complete a quest I never thought of.Get this game. It can be punishing as hell, but if you love RPGs like I do, it is an experience you'll not wanna miss.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is probably the best game I have ever played (sure is my most favorite one). I started playing it 10 years ago (I was in 8 grade). Since then I have played and finished it around 12 times with all the paths and endings (including the original version and the Night of the Raven one). Now I feel nostalgic when I remember how I waited to get back from school to ""kill the dragons"". Definetely going to play it again some day.

 Old but gold... First off - don't let my playtime fool you - I played the Gothic 2: Gold Edition for what felt like an eternity on a non-steambound copy back in 2005 - I played it before Gothic 1 and had almost no problems to follow the plot - yet I would advise you to watch (at least) a short summary of Gothic 1 to be able to recognize plenty familiar faces from Gothic 1. As you can see by the pictures on the store page, Gothic is a pretty old game with old graphics so if you can't stand playing without more up-to-date graphics but still want to have a simular experience you should check out Risen - the spiritual successor to the Gothic series. Combat in Gothic is kind of clunky and you'll have to invest in teachers (with gold AND xp) to make it more viable - making every skill decision even more important since the spent gold wont come back to you unless you kill your teacher - which is a pretty stupid idea since there aren't many people around who can teach you and most of 'em require you to do 1 or 2 quests to gain their trust!Despite having outdated graphics the soundtrack and voice acting of Gothic 2 is very good (at least the german voice acting - sadly I haven't heard the english one yet). The map is large and littered with monsters, trinkets and many rememberable locations - such as the old camp in the mine colony.Another downer about Gothic 2 are the bugs - but most of them can be fixed using the debugging console - so if you're willing to (maybe) go to the trouble of bugfixing once or twice you'll still have a great time – given the game runs on your computer (It has various issues with Windows 10 and 8)Now that those points are clearified: Let's talk about the RPG-masterpiece that is Gothic 2! Gothic 2 is the second installment of Piranha Bytes ""Gothic"" series. It's story begins shortly after the end of Gothic 1 - The nameless hero from the first game returns to fend off a new unknown thread. The games plot isn't the deepest or the most complex but the games awareness of character placement, economy, social structure and surroundings/atmosphere makes up to this flaw with ease - and overall even though the story is kind of generic it's fun enough to follow 'cause of many unique quest and sidequests which you can approach on different ways.Gothic 2 will treat you like sh!t in the beginning - most of the combat will be extremely tough and you wont just stumble upon a viable weapon after 2 minutes of playtime. You'll long for new sets of equipment and will be happy for any piece of loot you can aquire! The game will not hold your hand and you'll have to figure out how you can reach your goals - making it even more rewarding if you solved a complicated quest or tricked a strong enemy into being killed by NPCs.Speaking of NPCs - the game is set on an island with a main city full of NPCs and 2 (partly restricted) districts, plenty of farms and abandoned sites or caves and the ENTIRE map of the previous game - all up for you to slay, quest and sneak your way trough 'em! After playing a while you'll be able to join one of three fraction - the mercenaries, the paladins or the fire mages. Each fraction has a unique realtion to the people of Gothic 2 and you'll be treated in a different ways by NPCs depending on which fraction you chose. The questlines of these paths differ a lot - even in the late game, giving you a solid reason for replaying.The DLC ""Night of the Raven"" could be considered the icing on the cake, adding 25+ hours of playtime to the main game which is already a pretty long-winding experience! In it you'll encounter even more characters from the prior game and play in a landscape/setting which completly differs from the one which the main game is using. It's kind of hard to reach this DLC but it's amazing if you manage to figure out how to reach it and if you enjoyed the main game till there you'll certainly enjoy it as well!Overall Gothic 2 is (in my opinion) an extremely detailed game with plenty of hours of fun and immersive playtime to keep you busy - and if you don't mind the old graphics and genuinly enjoy RPGs you should grab it on sale and give it a try!

Then you'll be able to play normally. (Tested this myself) ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												""An amazing, well written, challenging and fun RPG to play, must play for everyone who enjoys RPGs""Pros: Story begins at end of Gothic 1 but because Piranha Bytes didn't expect to make sequel, Gothic 2 start and pretty much Gothic 1 ending was changed so that reasons why you start from nothing would make sense and they do make sense. Story is very, very interesting from start to end, story is very interesting, well written and very fun. Combat is pretty much same as in Gothic 1 except learning, now instead of learning only several times you have like progression bar and the more you spend and higher your % the better you are with that weapon type. It is okay change, i wouldn't say it made game better or worse it's okay and that's good. Combat at later level when you have been trained in one art or another becomes very timing based which was in RPG like this, enjoyable. World is very interesting to explore, same as with Gothic 1 areas in which you shouldn't yet go are protected by stronger opponents, as far as i understood there is no level scaling which makes exploration very rewarding and fun once you get stronger and stronger, you have to remember places were you couldn't go before and can now as you have become stronger then you were back then. As in Gothic 1 there are several factions to join, each faction have quests which you couldn't access if you joined other factions which gives game certain level of replayability. Cons: Game will probably not start if you do not tweak and install few patches for it. Your game may experience framerate issues, they can be fixed by yourself too. Game may freeze or to be correct it can become a slideshow, all you see is a picture after picture, if that happens it may go off by itself or you can save and load that save and it will disappear, happened to me twice.Gothic 2 has been changed in several ways but neither one of them made game worse, for 15 year old game it has aged well IF you can fix all issues you will have when you 1st time run it.Having amazing story, fun combat and interesting world to explore but suffering from few technical issues which can be fixed, this game is must play even after all those years, 10 out of 10, classic.

												Dieses Spiel begleitet den Helden und den Spieler auf eine unglaubliche Reise mit vielen Persönlichkeiten, Charakteren, Questen, Gegnern und einen tollen Humor in eine riesige, mind.15 Stunden lange spielbare Welt. In diesem Spiel ist ein Addon zusätzlich enhalten, wenn du dir die Gold Edition holst. In der Gold Edition sind dann noch zusätzlich viele neue Gegner, Waffen, zusätzliche Quests und ein einzigartiger spielbarer Schwierigkeitsgrad dabei, der das Spiel einfach zu einer Herausforderung macht. Das Kampfsystem ist simpel gehalten, was aber an sich nicht so schlimm ist, weil der Schwierigkeitsgrad dadurch angepasst wird und man auf verschiedene Möglichkeiten mit dem Held vorranschreiten kann, wie z.B. als Bogenschütze oder als Magier. Das wirklich gute an dem Spiel ist, dass es dir 3 verschieden Auswahlmöglichkeiten bietet, welchen Weg du beschreitest und es neben der Hauptstory noch über tausende von Nebenquesten gibt. Insgesammt ist dieses Spiel einfach ein pornöses Spielerlebnis, welches in meinen Augen einfach super ist und absolut kreativ gemacht wurde. Wer keine Probleme mit einem simplen Kampfsystem hat und nicht all zu scheu vor älterer Graffik ist, sollte sich dieses Spiel zulegen.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												It is always worth playing the Gothic series and if you find the Gothic Universe bundle at a sale it is more than worth buying it. The story is a well developed one with graphics according to the years in which the games were released. But don't be fooled...after you enter in it, rarely you'll leave it unimpressed as you are emerged in a complex ,very interesting lore, since the first missions.In my opinion it is 9/10.P.S. Don't forget to save as much as possible, no autosave feature exists so you don't want to die and start all over again.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Gothic II, just like its predecessor is an RPG that has one of the most satisfying progression system ever implemented.  You will start as a wimp that gets a beating from pretty much everything, but if you don't get discouraged, stick around and work hard for it, your character will be steadily getting stronger. You will be an adventurer, exploring the well crafted world, trying to find every creature that you can handle (and avoiding the ones you can't), every piece of loot which you can add to your bottomless inventory, and every person in need of your help, just so you could get some experience and become a bit tougher. And doing so will feel incredibly good.Sure, the voice acting isn't the greatest, the combat and animations are clunky, and the graphics may seem bad (even though they're not), but you won't be paying attention to any of this after you sink into the world of Gothic. This game (and the first one) is a cult classic for a reason and if you're a fan of RPGs, you simply have to play it because it's one of the best.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Gothic 2 is an Action-RPG, it's the sequel to the first Gothic game and it continues the story from where the first game ended. After defeating the final boss in the first game (I don't want to spoil who it is) all hell breaks loose, there's a war, and it's up to you to get♥♥♥♥♥♥done once again. After nearly dying at the end of the first game, Xardas saves you and tells you about your quest to get the Eye of Innos, a powerful artifact that will help you end the war that's going on right now. And thus after the conversation with Xardas you set off into an adventure that you'll surely not forget.There isn't much to be said about this game that wasn't said about the first one. It's basically everything the first game was but bigger and much better. It looks a bit nicer than the first game, thanks to the new setting and locations there's much more color now, with lush green forests and a big city to explore. You also get to go back to the Valley of Mines from the first game to see what happened to it after the events of the previous game. I also have to mention the soundtrack, it's incredible, it really adds a lot to the atmosphere and I love it.Gameplay is basically the same, there's a noticeable difference in the combat though, now you can no longer block, you instead have a parry which doesn't work on monsters and animals, so you'll have to think a bit better about fighting those now. Like the first game, the character progression for the nameless hero you play as is phenomenal, you start off completely worthless and throughout the game you see yourself becoming a complete juggernaut of death and by the end of it, it's ridiculously satisfying.The ""Gold Edition"" of the game comes with the expansion pack, ""Night of the Raven"". It increases the difficulty of the game due to popular demand (you people are masochists) so the game is even more brutally difficult, it adds pirates and a whole new area with more story and quests for you to do. I liked everything in the expansion pack except for two things: The end boss fight, which felt like it was more based on luck whether you kill him or not and it just comes down to constantly reloading your save after every death until you finally kill him, which isn't the case in the entirety of the expansion or Gothic 2 as a whole, it's always fair; and the other thing I didn't like was the way they shoehorned the expansion into the main game. At a certain point in the main quest, the game halts your progression and tells you to do one thing without really any direction or hints as to how to do it. I had to do some research online to see what the hell this is all about and I ended up finding out that this is the game's way of saying ""Okay, you can't go any further until you complete the expansion pack so get to it"". I was happy to find out that there's more content to this game but I feel like the way they implemented the transition between the main game and the expansion pack is terrible. Still, the expansion pack itself is great.Basically, if you liked the first game there's no reason you wouldn't like the second one. It's a fairly hard game to get in to so if you're looking to get into the series I'd highly suggest you play the first game before playing this one, it'll ease you into it. It isn't a game that I can recommend to anyone because we live in an age full of whiny little kids who are used to objective markers and hand-holding, Gothic 2 doesn't like any of that, it's harsh, and if you're looking for a hard game that respects your intelligence and knows you can handle things on your own, this is one of the best.

												This is one of those games that I come back to over and over again, and it's still great. While the graphics haven't exactly aged gracefully, the atmosphere and story make more than up for it. People and monsters have their own rhythms instead of just standing around until you interact with them. There are some really fun characters in it, the main character is hilariously snarky, and your choice of faction actually makes a great difference when it comes to playstyle and story. Looting and finding secrets are really rewarding and there is no carry-limit. This is a game from a different era though: No mini-map, no questmarkers, no adjustable difficulty and it can be quite challenging, especially if you're playing ot for the first time and don't know where all the good stuff is and how to make the most of the skill tree.The combat is pretty basic, there is not exactly much player skill involved. If you can't kill it, level up and return later. This is not a game where you can experiment with different skill-sets, pick one at the beginning and STICK TO IT! Monsters only respawn at the beginning of chapters, so there is no real way to grind, and there is no way to reassign skill points through potions or magic, so don't waste them.If none of these are an issue for you, you are in for one of the greatest fantasy RPGs of all time.

												One of the great classic RPG's of all time.  This game has a steep learning curve and many choices you make will have lasting effects.  You affect the world.   Many places to explore, treasures to find, mysteries to solve.  There is something hidden in every nook and cranny.  Many ways to accomplish your goals and quests.  Many ways to die.  It doesnt have the best graphics, but the content more than makes up for that.  You will find yourself saving and reloading alot.  Often because of quick and surprising death, or because there are other choices you could make and you want to find out what happens...Totally recommend this game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Gothic 2 is arguably my favourite RPG, and has been for many years. It features exiting fights, lots of different skills, three different 'paths' to choose from, and loads of things to discover.First, the positive:Gothic 2 is much smoother than Gothic 1. It's easier to use, less clunky, and merchants are easier to deal with now that gold is introduced as opposed to trading items all the time. Timing is important during fights, but so is picking your opponent. Gothic 2 doesn't hold your hand at any stage of the game: if you make the mistake of wandering into the woodland armed with a wooden stick at level one, well, it's your funeral. The NPC's give advice, though, but you'll have to find them and ask them. You'll also have to build your character from the ground up: you start with a little health, and a huge problem the game needs you to solve.Levelling always feels important and vital to the game, be it your stats or your gear. The game makes every improvement you make feel valuable. This is because if you don't level up and face something stronger than you, chances are you're going to die. All this makes playing the game incredibly rewarding. I felt genuinely satisfied every time I accomplished something, because I worked for it. Gothic won't punish you by being overly difficult: it'll just make you work.But just in case you get too stressed grinding through the game, don't worry. After you get strong enough, you'll find some enemies easy to throw around if you skip around some of the earlier stages of the game you missed before. Destroying things that once scared the pants off you makes everything feel better. This feeling will dissapear if you accidentally stray next to a higher level enemy quite quickly though, keeping an incredibly fun cycle of victim and bully going strong until the end of the game: it never gets dull. Either you're happy and feel like a boss, or you're running for your life, and it's not something a game does for me often.Exploration is also rewarding: loads of secrets are hidden all around the world. Some of the best items and deadliest enemies lurk where you wouldn't expect. Sometimes quest items or NPC's can be hidden in the middle of the countryside, but unlike Skyrim, you can't follow a little arrow on your compass until you come across it. Find it on your own.As for the world itself, it's an open world, but that doesn't mean you can go anywhere you want. Higher level monsters lurk in some areas and mountains and cliffs box you in a lot of the time. This means that over a small area, there can be a lot of stuff that's hidden: under an ordinary country road could be a huge cave full of glorious, glorious loot, but at the same time, on top of the cliff to your left might be an epic monster, and you'd never even know unless you looked.Now, the bad:I had problems getting Gothic 2 to work on my computer. Whilst I eventually got it to work, it's a messy problem that took a patch to fix. There may be betters ways to get the game than on Steam.Night of the Raven messed with the levelling system a lot. Before, I found the game to be difficult, but fair. Not so much now: items need much higher strength to use. This means you have to gain more levels just to use a sword you could previously use at a lower level. You also end up needing to go up even more levels to gain more stats, which was frustrating considering that I was having a hard enough time facing orcs before Night of the Raven. I didn't really appreciate the content it brought to the game either: in a world of dragons, knights, and medieval monsters, I didn't really think that pirates or aztec temples really fit. There was great nostalgia value from meeting some of the characters from Gothic 1 in the expansion, though, but I didn't feel they balanced the stuff I didn't like enough. If Gothic came without Night of the Raven, I would have much preferred that... either that or I became a bad player over these past few years (which I doubt).Finally, the gameplay might not please some people. I spent a long time praising Gothic 2 for being difficult and rewarding, but for a more casual player, it may be a bit too brutal to get used to. The fighting system isn't the same as anything I've ever seen, and it isn't the most fluid to use. Sure, with practice, you get it, but you may not necessarily want to. And now, my closing statement:Gothic 2 is a classical fantasy RPG that combines some of my favourite tropes from the genre: wizards, knights, and epic, evil, hard to kill, not-at-all-watered down DRAGONS, but without making it feel too generic. The wizards (oh, I'm sorry... fire magicians) feel halfway between priests, scientists, and diplomats, and the dynamic between the paladins and the mercenaries is really well done. Choices you make have some of the most unexpected consequences making choosing a path truly unique and giving the game some great replayability.Gothic 2 with Night of the Raven: 8/10Gothic 2 in all it's glorious alone-ness: 10/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Gothic 2 is the only true sequel to the original Gothic. It keeps the same classic feel, but expands upon the scope. If you liked the last one, you will enjoy this one. If you haven't played the last one, do that first. This game picks up right where the Gothic 1 left off. The world is very open, full of hidden secrets and relateable characters. If you enjoy medieval RPGs like Skyrim, do yourself a favor and give Gothic 1 & 2 a shot.Just a note, it has some compatibility errors with modern OS and graphics cards, but it is fairly well patched by the community. Just be prepared to do a little Googling for fixes.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is a game of my childhood. I remember getting the physical copy of this when it first came out and having to play it on low settings because my windows xp couldn't handle it. The graphics may look dated now but using your graphics card settings, you can add a sharpness to the game. The thing that really matters though is the immersion, the story, and the difficulty balancing. I never had a chance to finish the game as my disc was damaged by my careless brother. So now, despite exams and essays going on, I intend to finish what I started years ago.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												IMO, the perfect mix of open world and story driven RPG. Tons of sidequests, rewarding exploration, mobs only respawn when a new chapter starts, and combat can be challenging. Each of the three factions (four if you join the optional theives guild in addition to one of the three) has some of their own sidequests. Graphics are dated (highly recommend Vurt's texture pack), and the combat mechanics are dated but it's tons of fun.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												-Old game classic, hours of solid RPG-fun-If you liked Gothic 1 you can get this immediately. For the others: G2 is a open world RPG in a dark and somewhat rough medieval fantasy setting. Mature themes and swearing are included. Expect to die a lot because it takes a long time for the character to become powerful - many times enemies will just one-shot you. The game is really hard on the casual player - there are no easy rewards, death will occur within the first gaming hour. Similar to the witcher series your choices matter and people will have their revenge on you. There are three factions and you habe to stick with one: Mercenaries, Paladins or Mages.G2 is from 2002, outdated and there might be issues on high-end systems. Still it's fun to explore the countryside, loot a cave, hunt monsters and survive a tough fight. The add-on doubles the fun by adding a second world to plunder. The game is considered by many to be the last ""good"" Gothic game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												While the graphics are dated they are still totally functional. And the interface takes a tad getting used to and if you wander off the beaten path, your character can die an early death.Other than those quibbles, G2 is still one of the best RPGs ever made. You play in a living world where people work, play and sleep. The world itself is totally scalable, you can climb roofs, fences and mountains. Traveling at night in a deep forest is scary. Throw away monsters in most games (wolves, skeletons) will kill you in this game if you are not ready. Some monsters that can not be beat until middle game are there at the very beginning. And while you have to join one of three factions that exist in this world and it will not change the game plot, it will totally change the way you play (paladin, merc and mage).So far I have played this game 4 times since it has come out and each play through has been over 100 hours. It's a fun challangeing game that for me is one of my desert isle games.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I like this game mostly because I'm a nostalgic guy that played Gothic I when he was young. If you are a 16 years old, probably this game wont enjoy, but in the past was an epic game, like AOE II. The story is not really extend, I could summarize that in 3 lanes, but you are free to choose some stuffs (archer, mage and swordman). The ""bow"" fight system is ""meh"", you just have to hope that your accuracy (based on your stats) is high enough to have a nice % to hit the target and the orcs, that are bigger than a cow, can be missed on 3 meters of distance. If you are attacked by 4 monsters, a sword swing hit only 1 enemy.If you want a retro game experience, this is a great game. But the price makes this game enjoyable also if you are not looking for old games (ike playing GTA San Andreas, it's just a classic).			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A must read review..!! 2017 and I am still playing this gameGothic 2 I always find myself going back to this game and it's 2017 and I still play this game. the devs knew what to do back in their days. played it when it first came out and until this days I absolutely love this game...! I love the choices that you can make for example to who join and I like the games environment I never get bored playing the game. Gothic 2 is a must play for RPG lovers and don't let the 2002 graphics disappoint you cause the gameplay and story is the most important thing.Piranha Bytes if you by any chance read this please make Gothic 2 HD Remake.!!

												Probably one of the greatest generic fantasy RPG's.If only bethesda did exploration and progression like these guys.The game design so contrasts with what you'd find in, say, skyrim or oblivion.For starters, there's no level scaling on enemies, and there is a HUGE power difference between them. For example in the starting area, you're mostly fighting wolves, but there's also an Orc, which are NOT to be ♥♥♥♥ed with at this point. They are twice your size, and hit like a steaming train. But like a train can be sidestepped quite easily.With perseverence and cunning, you can defeat foes that you normally shouldn't be able to, instead of just standing in place hacking away at an enemy that's designed to die by you just standing and hacking at it. If you know what I mean.Anyways, exploration is also greatly rewarded, for example you can find a huge bag of gold coins behind some random tree (and gold is a pretty big deal in this game, its not just for buying generic longsword +2♥♥♥♥♥♥ or get a finely crafted sword from an expert fighter's grave that was hidden in a makeshift mausoleum inside a cave that was swarming with giant cave-dwelling carapiece-plated bugs.Yeah it's a pretty cool game, wish more games went this route with game design, the effort in -> pay out make it so much more damn satisfying than generic bland grey difficulty all the way through.

Big world (although more compact comparing to Gothic III) gives you a feeling of freedom. Controlling system is a bit weird but hey I replayed this game 4 times.

												This is the hightlight of the Gothic series. its easily the best game in the series despite some inbalance issues but its very flawed and badly needs a rework.Pros+Story and Characters are great.+Combat is acceptable+Exploration is one of the best things the Gothic series and G2 is the highlight+Graphics are OK and you can mod it to make it prettier.+Plus 30 hours and gameplay and great replabilityCons-I hate the balance changes in Night of the Raven (Expansion pack you are forced to play and you can't skip it)-Playing as a mage is ♥♥♥♥ing horrible. See NOTR made learning cost double and you gonna be a gimped mage for like 3/4 of the game-Interface is horrible and going through the inventory the tenth time to find and drink a health took waaaaaay too long and I spend hours of life going through the horrible interface-Peformance is horrible without mods and community patches-Plenty of gliches and bugs-Unable to play Vanille Gothic 2 on steam.

												In my opinion one of the best ARPG that have been made till this day and one that shaped what came to be my personal standards in relation to RPGs in general.Pros:1.Has arguably one of the best leveling experiences in video games. Skill matters but stats make life easier making for a very balanced and thought out growth for your player character.2.The world feels authentic and more real than other RPGs which give more of a epic but cliche taste. Most NPCs have mundane problems and opinions yet a lot of them are interconnected and often reference bits and pieces of the bigger picture.3.Many of the earlier quests have several paths for possible solutions and advancing through the story will make you choose 1 of 3 factions each giving a slightly different spin on your playthrough.4.Because resources and enemies are finite ( some enemies are spawned at the start of a chapter ) the process of exploring and finding new things are made that much more rewarding. Grinding here would mean going out of your way to find hidden away goodies or enemies making for a much more engaging experience.Cons:1.There still are a few bugs and while I don't think any are game breaking it's still jarring to experience one.2.The combat itself is quite clunky and will need getting used to.3.The plot never really goes above ''decent'' level and could have been made more interesting.

												Gothic doesn't belongs to easy games, but you just have to buy It and chceck it out!For first you just shouldn't get nervous becauce of clunky controls, If you want to play you have to deal with it.But don't worry! Game will reward you for that in the form of beautiful music, nice dubbing and great atmosphere!I went through this game like 12 times at non-Steam version, so I guess you at least will be able to do it even 1 time.My judge is 9/10 only beacause Steam kinda ♥♥♥♥ed up and didn't make it able to play at Win7/8/8.1 (Of course you'll be albe to do it if you're smart, There's some other ways to repair it, you know) ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												One of the best RPGs of all time and packaged with the Night of the Raven expansion, Gothic 2 is not for the 'Push A for Awesome' crowd.  Open world exploration, no level scaling, meaningful choice and consequence, mutually exclusive character builds, challenging enemies, and an immersive world that comes alive -- these are the hallmarks of a true old school RPG.  Melee combat requires timing rather than button mashing and even the most trivial of enemies can kick your butt at the early levels.  Of course the game has its rough points such as mediocre voice acting (English version), the occasional bug, and a somewhat poorly thought out magic system.  However any negatives are dwarfed by the game's strongpoints that deliver a solid eightyish hour experience with tons of replayability.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is one of the best RPGs I have ever played. It's not nearly as complex as The Elder Scrolls or other huge RPGs but the fact that it's simple at heart is what made it a masterpiece.Even though the game is old, you can make it look like a beast using the DX11 mod created by Degenerated and a texture pack of your choice (yep, there's many).Gothic II has aged and there probably won't be many new players coming over and trying it out. But if there are, I'll just let you know that the community is still very much alive for this game with tons of custom story mods, huge graphical enhancements and cool other things.tl;dr - I recommend this game for new players looking for a solid game. Now, if you want a more detailed opinion, read more.Alright. So leaving the graphics aside, which can be extremely upgraded with the help of some mods, the game itself is fluid and fun. Gameplay is rather fluid like I said. There are bugs here and there but nothing that will make you rage quit and uninstall the game. The difficulty of the game however, especially with the Night of the Raven AddOn, is quite hard if you're a new player because you'll really have to be careful when, where and who you fight. The RPG mechanics are rather well done since there are a lot of character builds that you can choose from. You can become a mage, a bow user only, a crossbow user only, two-handed, one-handed, and so on. You can even combine them, you have the freedom to do so.Combat can be a real pain in the♥♥♥♥♥to learn at first but once you get used to the mechanics and the timing, you'll have lots of fun. Most of the monsters have their own timing so you have to learn when to attack, when to back off and when to block (when you can). It can get annoying at times but it can also lead to great satisfaction when it works out.Story starts 3 weeks after the events of Gothic I. If you haven't played the first game there's no biggie since you'll kind of learn the story of the first game from the main quest NPCs that you'll talk to. The story itself in the game is alright and while it's not anything groundbreaking, it's something that works. Don't expect huge plot twists or betrayals.ConclusionI grew up with this game. It's only natural for me to feel nostalgic and recommend it but like I said, it had and it still has it's flaws. It can get annoying at times but it's fun.. tons of fun.Also, adding this at the bottom so it won't look like shameless advertising. I also started doing a Let's Play on YouTube on this game so if you want to check out some gameplay of it with the DX11 mod, here's my playlist:https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLRTptUU9moJDl_sFe7OebLYZnMKwcghnk ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game will change what you think about RPGs. The immense world provides hours of gameplay and there are enough different paths to take that the game could be won in any way you want.The storyline, while cliché, has some interesting twists, and the progression of the narrative through the chapters, and increased sense of doom that occurs midway through the game as you face a orc horde backed by dragons leads to some interesting moments.Anyone who appreciates action-oriented RPGs in which the focus is on creating your own story rather than following one that has been predetermined, this game is required playing. Not only is it open-ended, but also it is massive.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Of course this game is a masterpiece, just like the first part of it, but this is the last good part of Gothic, tho. Great big world, especially with addons, wich makes it even bigger, great story. None of boring typical rpg quests, every storyline make sence. Atmospheric roads with goblins and other♥♥♥♥♥♥that wants to kill you, pirates, fire mages, DRAGONS, even ♥♥♥♥♥!

I perused the discussion board and tried all the tips I could find. Alas, I could only get the computer to believe it's running but I never saw any windows or anything indicating that it was running that I could actually interact with. I deleted the .dll but, honestly, at this point I'm not sure if I want to bother more if getting it to function means deleting a .dll every single time I want to play.This game may be very good and I bought it on sale so I'm not♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off or anything.

												Gothic, c'est tout un univers. C'est vraiment la série tout entière que je recommande, du premier au troisième (le 4 n'entre pas en compte, les devs ayant changé et ont créé Risen de leur côté).Toutefois, mon préféré reste le deuxième volet.Gothic, ou comment un jeu aux graphismes assez laids, à l'optimisation douteuse, aux combats à s'arracher les cheveux (du moins les premiers temps) peut tout de même devenir culte.Un univers sombre, mature (prostitution, alcool, drogues), répliques savoureuses.Un jeu ou l'on ne peut entrer chez les gens pour piller tranquillement sous leurs yeux. Un jeu où nos choix sont à peser.Gothic, du vrai jeu de rôle qui demande de la persévérance.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Gothic. An entire universe. I recommend the whole serie, from first to third (I do not count the fourth as devs changed and created Risen, good game too).Gothic, games with quite ugly graphics, dubious optimization, combat that makes you curse out loud but that still can be considered as cult.A dark and mature universe (prostitution, alcohol, drugs), hilarious dialogue lines.Don't expect to enter in every house to pick up items, people won't allow it. You'll have to carefully plan your actions and sayings.Gothic, a real RPG that requires patience and dedication.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

I downloaded a patch...    gothic 1: http://worldofgothic.de/dl/download_folder4.htm#4     (1.08k)    gothic 2: http://www.worldofgothic.de/dl/download_278.htm2. ... patched the game3. ... set the game's .exe file to ""compatibility mode"" (Windows XP)4. ... and (and this was very important in my case) didn't start the game directly in steam, but by directly double-clicking on the .exe file in the local content folder.Due to the fact that I almost couldn't play one of the most awesome role playing game ever made that is gothic 2, I thought long about giving a ""not recommended"". However, since it seems to work now, my heart will not allow it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Gothic 2: Gold is a game that you either love it or leave it. If you're willing to put in the time and effort, and there will be quite the effort, you'll find a truly wonderful RPG. Gothic 2 managed to iron out a few of the rougher edges of the first Gothic. The controls have improved, the glitches are fewer and less troublesome and the technical aspects of the game are much improved. I love this game. I loved the first one, I loved Gothic 2 when it first came out in North America in 2003 and I loved Gothic 2 Night of the Raven. Gothic 2 Gold is the proper mix of quests, exploration and combat. But make no mistake, you will die. This isn't Dark Souls, but it can be brutal. The first ten or so hours see your character, no matter which class you choose, as pretty under powered. Enemies are tough and it's not always just wolves or orcs that will kill you. The controls are a bit stiff and until you get used to them, can get you killed. There are factions to join which can somewhat dictate which abilities you can learn, but no matter which faction you choose to side with you can choose how you want to progress. If you want to be a pure fighter, with a two handed sword, fine. A mage that casts massive fire spells, sure. A thief that likes to hang back, and use his bow, not a problem. Gothic 2 lets you decide and mix and match.Although the game play is wonderful, I found the story in the first Gothic to be superior. Gothic 2's story is still engaging and fun, but it's not exactly the most original story telling in modern gaming, but still enough to keep you going. The music is effective if not a bit repetitive. The voice acting is where Gothic 2 really shines. In no other game will you hear such a varied and bizarre mix of voice actors. Some of them are terrible, which just makes me love them more. And finally the graphics are somewhat average. Even for 2002 they were a bit dated, but the draw distance is pretty impressive, especially for a game from 12 years ago. Gothic 2: Gold holds a special place in my heart. It may not have a million mods like Skyrim, a massive budget like Dragon Age or a sound track like GTA 5, it's still great. There aren't too many RPG's out there like the Gothic series and Gothic 2 is still my favourite in both the Gothic and Risen series. It's fun, frustrating, exhilarating, challenging, engaging and satisfying. You could easily put 60 hours into your first play through and even more on a second if you're will to explore every bit that the game has to offer. For the price it's hard to pass up.

												The best geme ever. Tight controls smooth gameplay and good dialog. And the story is quite nice as well. Btw i would love to see a redux of this game in the future, cuz Gothic 4 Arcania was really bad (Preformance and gameplay) It was just horrible game in general but u really schould buy this game or buy Gothic Universe (Gothic, Gothic 2 Gold, Gothic 3) 3 was not the best but still an ok game for the times it was released.

												Gothic, c'est tout un univers. C'est vraiment la série tout entière que je recommande, du premier au troisième (le 4 n'entre pas en compte, les devs ayant changé et ont créé Risen de leur côté).Toutefois, mon préféré reste le deuxième volet.Gothic, ou comment un jeu aux graphismes assez laids, à l'optimisation douteuse, aux combats à s'arracher les cheveux (du moins les premiers temps) peut tout de même devenir culte.Un univers sombre, mature (prostitution, alcool, drogues), répliques savoureuses.Un jeu ou l'on ne peut entrer chez les gens pour piller tranquillement sous leurs yeux. Un jeu où nos choix sont à peser.Gothic, du vrai jeu de rôle qui demande de la persévérance.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Gothic. An entire universe. I recommend the whole serie, from first to third (I do not count the fourth as devs changed and created Risen, good game too).Gothic, games with quite ugly graphics, dubious optimization, combat that makes you curse out loud but that still can be considered as cult.A dark and mature universe (prostitution, alcohol, drugs), hilarious dialogue lines.Don't expect to enter in every house to pick up items, people won't allow it. You'll have to carefully plan your actions and sayings.Gothic, a real RPG that requires patience and dedication.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Gothic 2: Gold is a game that you either love it or leave it. If you're willing to put in the time and effort, and there will be quite the effort, you'll find a truly wonderful RPG. Gothic 2 managed to iron out a few of the rougher edges of the first Gothic. The controls have improved, the glitches are fewer and less troublesome and the technical aspects of the game are much improved. I love this game. I loved the first one, I loved Gothic 2 when it first came out in North America in 2003 and I loved Gothic 2 Night of the Raven. Gothic 2 Gold is the proper mix of quests, exploration and combat. But make no mistake, you will die. This isn't Dark Souls, but it can be brutal. The first ten or so hours see your character, no matter which class you choose, as pretty under powered. Enemies are tough and it's not always just wolves or orcs that will kill you. The controls are a bit stiff and until you get used to them, can get you killed. There are factions to join which can somewhat dictate which abilities you can learn, but no matter which faction you choose to side with you can choose how you want to progress. If you want to be a pure fighter, with a two handed sword, fine. A mage that casts massive fire spells, sure. A thief that likes to hang back, and use his bow, not a problem. Gothic 2 lets you decide and mix and match.Although the game play is wonderful, I found the story in the first Gothic to be superior. Gothic 2's story is still engaging and fun, but it's not exactly the most original story telling in modern gaming, but still enough to keep you going. The music is effective if not a bit repetitive. The voice acting is where Gothic 2 really shines. In no other game will you hear such a varied and bizarre mix of voice actors. Some of them are terrible, which just makes me love them more. And finally the graphics are somewhat average. Even for 2002 they were a bit dated, but the draw distance is pretty impressive, especially for a game from 12 years ago. Gothic 2: Gold holds a special place in my heart. It may not have a million mods like Skyrim, a massive budget like Dragon Age or a sound track like GTA 5, it's still great. There aren't too many RPG's out there like the Gothic series and Gothic 2 is still my favourite in both the Gothic and Risen series. It's fun, frustrating, exhilarating, challenging, engaging and satisfying. You could easily put 60 hours into your first play through and even more on a second if you're will to explore every bit that the game has to offer. For the price it's hard to pass up.

												Gothic 2 is basically a completely polished and smoothed out Gothic 1 with added features.But that means that it's just brilliant, this game is flawless in my opinion.The story carries on and it just get more and more insteresting.Same as Gothic 1 you put in effort to become a part of a faction and NPCs react to who you are and what you do, you feel like you accomplish much, everyone who played Gothic 1 should without a doubt get this immediatly.

												My FAVORITE single player RPG of all time, hands down. If you enjoyed Skyrim, then you will enjoy this game, they're very similar, though I favor Gothic II. Adventure, immersing and open world, quests, loot, advancement, never ending new things to explore, great characters to encounter of both friend and foe, monsters.... oh the MONSTERS!!! Best fights I've had in my gaming experience. I love the melee combat system to death: you actually have to learn how to fight and block more effectively as the player, a human being, with your timing and rhythm of the keystrokes, as well as train your hero. The game feels so believable; the sounds, the weather, the people, the danger. It's a challenging game, you always manage to find dire and skill testing situations; be sure to save often. No two parts of the game are the same, EVERY encounter is unique and fun. As a player, you feel like you're learning how to survive and conquer in this word just as much as your character would be in real life.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Gothic 2 is a game about choice and survival, and no game like it does it better. The whole game just has a sort of life to it that most other rpgs don't have. It is probably one of the hardest rpgs you will ever play, but it's very fair once you learn the quirks of the battle system. You are able to kill any enemy in the game without being hit once regardless of your equipment or level. This game makes you want to explore but makes you wary to do so. You will find yourself making saves each time you go into an unknown cave or area. But it really has that sense of exploration.If you call yourself a fan of WRPGs, you should definitely give Gothic 2 a chance.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Classic. If you're a fan of old school RPGs, you'll definitely love this game. Even though the base game's main storyline is kinda weak imo (the sidequests are some of the best I've ever seen, though), the Night of The Raven addon fixes this by adding an awesome, brand new storyline. The expansion also drastically changes the game's difficulity level, not only by making the enemies tougher; leveling takes more time now, items have their requirements bumped up (albeit they also deal more damage), and overall the game just feels more difficult, thus it's also more rewarding and satisifying.The graphics have aged pretty well if you ask me; of course, you shouldn't expect anything fancy out of an almost 15 year old game, but it still looks decent as the environments are highly varied and interestingly designed. Morrowind (which came out the same year and which I also adore) should be the closest game for graphical comparison; and I think that Gothic 2 would still win over it. The biggest con I have with this title are the controls (including combat). They might be a bit tricky and annoying to get used to but you'll quickly learn them, as there's a lot of time to settle in with the movement and combat in the very beginning of the game.  IMHO easily the best installment in the ""Gothic"" series, definitely buy this anytime you feel like delving into an old school fantasy world.  ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Nominated for The ""Test of The Time"" Award 2016Gothic 2 with the add-on The Night Of The Raven is truly a masterpiece of an rpg. The story, the voiceacting, the melee fighting mechanics, the vast and diverse world is one of a kind. Gothic 1 should be played before this game, so you wont have trouble understanding the story ( and gothic 1 is fantastic game as well ).Pros- This game is a true open-world rpg. You can visit the vast majority of places in the world without story developing into those regions- The melee fighting mechanic is very well constructed. The combos are really fun execute. The AI meelefighters are also masterfully done. You will understand in a very short time, that you are facing a true blademaster. The parries, dodges and combos the enemies can do makes the fighting experience something beyond many rpg games i have played.- The magic in the game is diverse. Healing, summoning, teleportation, elemental, status effect you have everything in this game. The AI mages usually use low level spells, but sometimes you encounter your usual enemy mage casting one the strongest fire spells if you allow him to execute the spell in time. - The story is fantastic. Very well written, very well coordinated through npcs, augmented with side-quests helping you get through the main story.- The side quest are what makes this game on the best in its time.- The voice acting is fantastic ( especially the german)- The integration of the gothic 1 characters is smoothly done. They fit right in where you will find them here in gothic 2- The world is wonderfully constructed, each new region has a center plaza to rotate easily between places of importance. Different terrain in nearly all the new places you encounter. Vast number of monsters. Huge number of npcs. The npcs with no names ( eg. a novice) has speech option, where he or she will give a different responses to the different events happening in the world of khorinis at that time- Replayable through different faction selections.- Fantastic world and boss musicCons- Minor logic mistake with npc equipments- Playing as a mage in add-on is very hard. This is very sad, because some of the add-on introduced spells are very fun to use ( the normal G2 mage is still fine)- Some of the boss battles are not working properly, the patterns leave open a lot of abuses for archers and mages to exploit.- There are still some bugs for unlimited gold if you have the time to do it multiple times. ( nothing gamebreaking )Overall i give this game a 10/10 One of the best rpg ever made, the best open-world rpg in my opinion and it should on every top x rpg list for the next 50+ years . And yes i love this game ..Dont let my 30 hours played mislead you i have played this game at least 20 times			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												If you can look past the rapidly aging graphics and practise patience enough to really sink your teeth into this game, then you'll find a wonderfully crafted world ripe with adventure.  The combat can be a little tricky at times when you first start out, and the game is often very light on direction.  And sadly, the publishers pushed the devs for a release before it was fully ready so it has it's fair share of bugs.  Despite these things it remains one of my top five games.  Just don't go looking for a Gothic III or Gothic IV.  THEY NEVER MADE THEM, RIGHT EVERYONE?			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

I just love it. If you like true RPG games this is for you. You can choose your path and train your caracter (with learning points 10 every level). It has also many skills like pickpocket, pick locks, draw potions, craft weapons fighting with 1 handed, 2 handed weapons, crossbow and simple bow and MANY OTHERS. Each skills has its own trainer. I'm just be in love with that game!!			",23,1,0,4,2,0,2

												""Let there be light!"" said Innos to himself. Well, not really, more like ~I'm a lonely deity, thus I shall create another deity which I shall call my brother.~♥♥♥♥♥♥turned out horribly wrong for Innos as his sibiling, Beliar, proved to be his fatalistic counterpart for eternity. Though, he created Adanos, the water god of balance to govern over the newly created land of Man and Beast, where none of the warring brothers were allowed to enter. That would be just a small excerpt of the sermon held by Vatras in the temple square of Khorinis. YES, KHORINIS! You have been saved from the deadly(and caved in) clutches of the Sleeper's Temple and are now in Xardas' Tower.Ladies and gentlegeeks, I present thee Gothic II (Night of the Raven)! ! We have destroyed the magical wall which imprisoned us, and many other, in the penal Colony of Khorinis. With the last strike against the arch-demon, the Sleeper(known to the orcs as Krushak), you have destroyed that which held the barrier in place. Though, as the arch-demon fought his banishment from this world, he made sure that his last roar would be heard by all servants of Beliar.""His last order was 'COME!' and they came, all of them, even the dragons."" I remember the time when I was talking to a neighbour about his trek to the Valley of Mines. I was boiling with envy, since I didn't have the game at that time. But when I got my hands on it...oh sweet Rhobar...I've dreamed of you for so long<3 <3 <3 THIS was the feeling that enveloped me all those years that I played Gothic 1 and stared at what was beyond the barrier. Now, not only that I will have the chance to join the MIlitia of Khorinis and be promoted to the rank of Knight (Paladin) but I will also get the chance to fight by Lee's side once more or take my vows and live as a Fire Magician(priest of Innos).I will also get the chance to talk to Raven, the former Ore Baron from the first game, about his newfound hobby of desecrating ancient temples of Adanos.I'm going to end this little conffesion of mine with a small advice: play it! NOW!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I love Gothic 1 and 2. They certainly lack polish, look very dated today (they were pretty good upon release, but who cares...)They take quite a lot of getting used to them and are not by any standard easy games to pick up. The world is rather harsh, people aren't necessarily nice to each other, but that's always been part of Gothic's rough charm.I have no idea if the English or other foreign versions are any good, but the German versions are definitely worth it.

												I've probably invested around 200 hours into this game back in the day. I still think it's one of the defining pillars of the RPG genre, but it does not hold up as well as I had hoped. The outdated graphics are not even bothering me that much... It's the♥♥♥♥♥♥poor combat system that Gothic-fans have to endure since the beginning (it has been slightly improved in Gothic 3 and RIsen 1, just to get worse again in Risen 2). It's a price to pay for the beautiful experience.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Despite the incredibly large learning curve, awkward controls, sluggish and clumsy movement/combat, and awful voice acting, Gothic 2 gets it where it counts: depth. This is one of the deepest modern-styled RPG's you'll find. With an excellent character leveling system, a massive world to explore, a decent storyline, and tons of challenge (almost too much so, actually), Gothic 2's definitely worth checking out for any RPG fan, but especially the ones who like deep, difficult games.

After pressing 'New Game', it crashes to the desktop with a notice. After that, my computer freezes, and I have to reboot. Works fine on XP and, with a community patch, Windows 7. from what I have read, it works with 8, but has problems with fullscreen support, and has lag issues. Classic game. Completely recommended if you have Windows XP or 7. 8 is hit or  miss, and 8.1 is a no-go. Fantastic experience, but use with caution.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Following the first Gothic and it's surprising success wasn't an Add-on as originally was planned but a proper Sequel that picked up where the story of the unnamed hero left of. You waked up some weeks after end of the first game in Xardas new tower (honestly how can he build tower after tower in the most fitting places?) telling you that you have to save the world.A big problem is that what people today get is the combination of Gothic 2 and it's add-on Die Nacht des Raben (Night of the Raven in english) which raises the difficulty considerably. Back then Gothic 2 wasn't an easy game since the developers thought it would be bought by people who played through Gothic 1. Since there was no character transfer (dumb decision) the developers simply raised the diffculty and when they released the add-on a year later, they raised the difficulty again thinking that the people who played through Gothic 2 had enough practice to survive. So people who never played it before beware: The difficulty is far beyond of what modern games are, no hand-holding, no overpowered items, even the first wolf  can kill you. If you make it past the beinning you will encounter a for it's time big world full of life. You will meet all the people you got to know in the first game, since they all fled after the barrier got destroyed and you're thrown right in between them, some are just there to make money, other fight for the king, some fight for the rebel who hold fort in a giant farm, all the while you go around warning everybody of dragons who are coming back (Yes, Bethesda stole most of the plot for Skyrim later) but again it's a classic old school RPG so you can choose which side you support. Wanna help the Kind? Wanna help the Rebells? Even in between you can choose to work for a thief guild, become a pirate, a dragon hunter or stay out of it all (again, Skyrim really stole a lot from this game!)Gothic 2 features a ton of quests, a ton of sidequests, a lot of freedom to do whatever you want to do and if you play your cards right you can trick all parties against each other  while making a lot gold. While Gothic 1 had really bad controls the sequel has them a bit optimized, they're still not great but not that different from the bad controls GTA Vice City from the same year had. Get used to them, at least the inventory is...not exactly better but different. Instead of having to scroll through columns everything is one giant grid that says ""have fun finding an item"".The Graphics are improved and i think look ok considering 14 years have psased, certainly it's amazing how a game from 1986 looked archaic in 2000 while a game from 2002 looks ok in 2016. We've come a long way and computers today can even move you through the city without lag, something even highend computers in 2002 were unable. The music is from Kai Rosenkranz, highly atmospheric, fitting and a joy to listen to. The german voice acting is great, the english one is a step below at least as is the translation overall, some atmosphere is lost.Still this is a great game with a good atmosphere and some fun quests and characters that you will remember for sure (honesly Diego is on the same level as Minsc from Baldurs Gate when it comes to ""oooh i remember that guy, he was awesome!"")

[!] Beware! As sold here, the game doesn't work at all and crashes before reaching the main screen. It's been like that for years. To be fair, one can easily find the three external patches that make the game work fine: http://forum.worldofplayers.de/forum/threads/1340357-Release-Gothic-%C2%BD-%C2%97-SystemPack-(ENG-DEU)Once the game has been patched, it is an awesome piece of art. I highly recommend it. It is rewarding, and the playtime is long enough, especially if you like discovering everything yourself instead of following walkthroughs.The meta-gaming requirements are brutal, however. Primarily this is because the Gold Edition with the integrated Night of the Raven expansion is much more difficult to play than the original release. It targets experienced players, who have completed the original before. Not knowing in advance how to receive various bonuses that make your ""nameless hero"" much better, one likely makes some mistakes and will restart from the beginning a few times. Unless consulting a few guides (not walkthroughs!) before the first playthrough. On the other hand, if playing slowly and not wasting consumables and socalled Learning Points too early, the game becomes even more rewarding as you level up. Saving and reloading very often is required though, since there are multiple solutions for some quests, and it is strictly required to become a specialist instead of a jack of all trades.One also cannot avoid taking own notes in addition to what the basic in-game journal/log offers. The game is divided into multiple chapters, and in each new chapter, ""the world"" changes a bit, and one may discover something new in places one has visited before and by talking again to people one has talked to before. The game quests also differ a bit depending on whether you join the Militia/Paladins, the Mercenaries/Dragonhunters or the Fire Mages.Early on, the game could be named ""Errand Boy II: Gold Edition"". Fetch this, deliver that, rinse repeat. Run, run, run, collect and keep everything you find, because it may be of some importance later on (such as consumables in high quantity or items, which you can sell or give away all too easily without knowing that you've missed a chance). If you don't like being a pooly equipped errand boy, who may need to run away from packs of wolves and goblins for quite some time, avoid this game. It is an unforgiving environment you're thrown in. Else, enjoy the game and the first time you've killed a shadowbeast, an orc warrior, a pack of wargs or dragonsnappers.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Following the first Gothic and it's surprising success wasn't an Add-on as originally was planned but a proper Sequel that picked up where the story of the unnamed hero left of. You waked up some weeks after end of the first game in Xardas new tower (honestly how can he build tower after tower in the most fitting places?) telling you that you have to save the world.A big problem is that what people today get is the combination of Gothic 2 and it's add-on Die Nacht des Raben (Night of the Raven in english) which raises the difficulty considerably. Back then Gothic 2 wasn't an easy game since the developers thought it would be bought by people who played through Gothic 1. Since there was no character transfer (dumb decision) the developers simply raised the diffculty and when they released the add-on a year later, they raised the difficulty again thinking that the people who played through Gothic 2 had enough practice to survive. So people who never played it before beware: The difficulty is far beyond of what modern games are, no hand-holding, no overpowered items, even the first wolf  can kill you. If you make it past the beinning you will encounter a for it's time big world full of life. You will meet all the people you got to know in the first game, since they all fled after the barrier got destroyed and you're thrown right in between them, some are just there to make money, other fight for the king, some fight for the rebel who hold fort in a giant farm, all the while you go around warning everybody of dragons who are coming back (Yes, Bethesda stole most of the plot for Skyrim later) but again it's a classic old school RPG so you can choose which side you support. Wanna help the Kind? Wanna help the Rebells? Even in between you can choose to work for a thief guild, become a pirate, a dragon hunter or stay out of it all (again, Skyrim really stole a lot from this game!)Gothic 2 features a ton of quests, a ton of sidequests, a lot of freedom to do whatever you want to do and if you play your cards right you can trick all parties against each other  while making a lot gold. While Gothic 1 had really bad controls the sequel has them a bit optimized, they're still not great but not that different from the bad controls GTA Vice City from the same year had. Get used to them, at least the inventory is...not exactly better but different. Instead of having to scroll through columns everything is one giant grid that says ""have fun finding an item"".The Graphics are improved and i think look ok considering 14 years have psased, certainly it's amazing how a game from 1986 looked archaic in 2000 while a game from 2002 looks ok in 2016. We've come a long way and computers today can even move you through the city without lag, something even highend computers in 2002 were unable. The music is from Kai Rosenkranz, highly atmospheric, fitting and a joy to listen to. The german voice acting is great, the english one is a step below at least as is the translation overall, some atmosphere is lost.Still this is a great game with a good atmosphere and some fun quests and characters that you will remember for sure (honesly Diego is on the same level as Minsc from Baldurs Gate when it comes to ""oooh i remember that guy, he was awesome!"")

[!] Beware! As sold here, the game doesn't work at all and crashes before reaching the main screen. It's been like that for years. To be fair, one can easily find the three external patches that make the game work fine: http://forum.worldofplayers.de/forum/threads/1340357-Release-Gothic-%C2%BD-%C2%97-SystemPack-(ENG-DEU)Once the game has been patched, it is an awesome piece of art. I highly recommend it. It is rewarding, and the playtime is long enough, especially if you like discovering everything yourself instead of following walkthroughs.The meta-gaming requirements are brutal, however. Primarily this is because the Gold Edition with the integrated Night of the Raven expansion is much more difficult to play than the original release. It targets experienced players, who have completed the original before. Not knowing in advance how to receive various bonuses that make your ""nameless hero"" much better, one likely makes some mistakes and will restart from the beginning a few times. Unless consulting a few guides (not walkthroughs!) before the first playthrough. On the other hand, if playing slowly and not wasting consumables and socalled Learning Points too early, the game becomes even more rewarding as you level up. Saving and reloading very often is required though, since there are multiple solutions for some quests, and it is strictly required to become a specialist instead of a jack of all trades.One also cannot avoid taking own notes in addition to what the basic in-game journal/log offers. The game is divided into multiple chapters, and in each new chapter, ""the world"" changes a bit, and one may discover something new in places one has visited before and by talking again to people one has talked to before. The game quests also differ a bit depending on whether you join the Militia/Paladins, the Mercenaries/Dragonhunters or the Fire Mages.Early on, the game could be named ""Errand Boy II: Gold Edition"". Fetch this, deliver that, rinse repeat. Run, run, run, collect and keep everything you find, because it may be of some importance later on (such as consumables in high quantity or items, which you can sell or give away all too easily without knowing that you've missed a chance). If you don't like being a pooly equipped errand boy, who may need to run away from packs of wolves and goblins for quite some time, avoid this game. It is an unforgiving environment you're thrown in. Else, enjoy the game and the first time you've killed a shadowbeast, an orc warrior, a pack of wargs or dragonsnappers.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												One of my all time favorite rpgs. Gothic2 offers plenty of hours of rpg greatness. Lots to explore, tons of missions to do and enjoyable characters that you meet on your way. If you dont mind some older graphics then check this one out, turn the music up and turn the lights off and let your inner rpg geek out (;			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												As as fan of RPG - Adventure genre I must proclaim Gothic II as one of THE BEST for its genre... Story continues after ending of 1st installment and it sends you on a epic quest which you must complete. For 13 years this game stood its ground on top of RPG genre and I must say that only few games could stand on top with her. For its time graphics are really good, Story is amazing, gameplay is great and whole enjoyment is addictive. I highly recommend this game to any RPG / Adventure fan, he/she won't be disappointed.

												It won't be obvious when you're looking at this game but there is a strong possibility it won't run on your machine.  Judging by multiple requests for help on a number of forums it seems both Gothic I & II suffer issues on newer pc's.  I run a Windows 7/64 box with a high-end nVidia graphics card and both crash when you try to start a game.  I can't get a Steam refund unless I want to drop Arcania and Gothic 3 since I got it in a bundle (and they're both fine) so........ BUYER BEWARE!!!!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

If this actually worked, it would make 500% MORE SENSE in gothic 3 when i play it. as the character and story continues from the first gothic series. if you can actually get it to work.

												This game is, or probably 'was' the best game i ever played. After  a couple of Gothic 1 playthroughs, Gothic 2 was released and i instantly bought it from retail.My first Gothic 2 playthrough took about 4 days. After that i played the other 2 Factions (almost the same except the Guild specific quests). So you basically can play 3 classes, which are all unique and fun. You kinda have the Mercenary/Dragonhunter who is using his weapons only. The Mage who is using only Magic and the Knight/Paladin who can use the Paladin Magic and the Paladin weapons, which are very strong and not available to the other classes/factions.Most of the time i played without the Expansion, so the game was quite 'easy'. With the expansion, the game gets preeeettyyy tough and takes a lot more dedication and a lot more completion of sidequests to reach the late game content. You also have to be aware when to go for the new questlines with the pirates, because it has a fixed level range and if you are alrdy too high level it may be a lot less fun to play. The Expansion is great though, because it serves a complete new map with 2 more factions, you cant really join them, but you can do quests there and get some really cool items. Also its the first steps to the Pirate scenario that started with the game 'Risen'.To me this game is one of the best RPG of all time. May be a bit cooler for germans because of the unique dialogues and overall harsh language. They put a lot of love in the game and it shows.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												GAMEPLAY 8/10+It's not an easy game, it really isn't. It takes skills to kill an animal. I recommend being level 5 before attacking people.+Your fighting skills can be upgraded, aswell as your bow skills and crossbow.+The higher % your melee chance, the more and easier fighting style you get.-Moving is a bit sluggish and difficult, mostly when at an edge.-The critical hit system they added in Gothic II is a bit stupid. Even after 5 minutes fighting one guy, if he attacks youhe'll get a critical hit chance which can kill you in one hit.SOUNDTRACK 10/10++The soundtrack is perfect. It really fits in, every last bit from Kai. It's calm, mysterious yet epic in a way.IN-GAME SOUNDS 7/10+The in-game sounds are alright. I'm not saying it's bad giving it's a game from the year 2005. 2003 for the original version.+Flora and fauna sounds are amazing! Truly immersive.-English voice acting is terrible, they are all the same. I believe only 7 voice actors were used in the game.STORY 8.5/10+-While I did not enjoy the main missions from the Gothic II installment, the Night of the Raven main missions were truly fun and epic to play. You can be a pirate! arr... :3+Side missions feel like main missions (most of them).+Dragons. Yes, that's all I'm going to say.GRAPHICS 8/10+You may say the graphics are outdated. But it was made in 2005.+There are mods which makes the game able to play with Direct x11.-Some textures are missing. If you do not care that much about details then you don't have to worry about it.OVERALL RATING - 8.3/10 +0.2 for being an old game!What can I say? I played it since I was a kid. I enjoyed everything about this game and I really mean everything.I still play it. For me, it's more nostalgic than just gaming. I totally recommend this game! ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												One of my favorite RPG games ever. However, do NOT buy this on Steam. Like with everything else, they just dumped in their DRM and sold a non working product. Good luck googling patches and fixes (manual edits etc.) on german sites to make it work. If you buy it on GoG, it will work out of the box. Also, I would highly recommend getting the version without the expansion. As great as the expansion is, it adds a really illogical rebalance to the game mechanics, not only making everything far harder, but making some game styles unplayable. For example, you can no longer be a mage, since there is no mana regeneration and it suddenly takes 3-4x as many spells to kill a single mob. Needing several mana potions to kill 1 orc is not my idea of fun.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Doesn't want to work well for me. I'm using Windows 8.1 and I get really bad framerate, it also doesn't go into full screen mode, and while you can change the screen resolution in the config file, there's always an annoying bit of window border left. I tried a fix specifically for this issue with no luck. If it wasn't for the choppy framerate, this wouldn't bother me so much.As for the game game itself, the controls are sooo weird... Moving the camera around is painful, and it seems way too easy to bump into stuff and get stuck. The character movement just seems slow and clunky. I can't really say this is just a cheap knock-off of Morrowind without actually being able to play it properly, but I think I will just stick with Morrowind. Steam does not make playability a priority when releasing old games unfortunately. The majority of steam users are using modern systems, they should really consider that...			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I purchased Gothic 2 as part of a Gothic package.  When I run this, it simply crashes (like Gothic 1) on my ASUS gaming laptop with an NVIDIA GTX 965M.  I've never had a game crash like this on an of my purchases at Steam.  Although this looks like a good game, I can't even run it.  If you don't want to risk losing money on something that may not run on your computer, I don't recommend risking it on this game.  It isn't worth it.			",55,3,0,12,12,0,24

												Legendary. Starts right off where the 1st one ends. Quite hard at times. Especially because of stat grinding. Sometimes you need to become stronger in terms of stats in order to progress rather than player skill, althrough it is completely possible to complete the game without investing into combat stats at all. But that requires certain knowledge and a sly mind. So if you want to roleplay a guy who gets around being a weak rooster then you can do that, Run away from enemies! Overall, the world of this game is so detailed it is lovely, So much to do. Definitely one of the best RPGs ever made.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is probably just me, but I can't reccomend this game. Yes, I know that I have played less than 10 minutes, but that is because half way through the loading process when trying to start a new game, the game crashes. I have Windows 8.1 and a NVIDIA graphics card, don't know if the game conflicts with those (being as old as it is), but there is definetly a problem, as over 20 attempts to start a new game all end with the same message. As I got the whole franchise on sale, I'm not too dissapointed, but I really did feel that this game would be a great classic RPG. As the exact same thing happened with Gothic 1, I really think this series might be conflicting with updated software that came after it's time.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Absolute garbage. When you finally get the game to actually show up when you launch, you're met with a graphics error which prohibits you from playing until you change the ini settings. Once you do that, you're met with an access denied error which denies access from your game, not from any admin programs on your computer. I could not play it and the forums about these problems are more useless a castle without walls. I could have gotten Men of War for 2 bucks instead of this, when the sale was still on. Now I can't play the game, sale is gone, and here I be. Gothic is nothing but a piece of trash, and deserves to be treated as such.  ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												As a kid I loved Gothic 2. And I'm pretty sure I still love it.But after purchasing the Gold Edition with Night of the Raven expansion i just HATE this expansion so much. NR adds some cool parts to the story and surely makes the world filled with more characters and ideas what is much appreciated. (Vanilla Gothic 2 had some unused, empty areas which are basically in the game only to make use of them in the expansion - like the field of pyramids.) However the Gold Edition requires SO MUCH BORING GRINDING it's ridiculous. Most of the enemies are stronger than they were - to the point you have to spend dozens of additional hours to face them in a way you could do so in vanilla Gothic 2. The problem is the fighting gets really repetitive. You faced a hundred orks? Here is another 200. Farm them one by one.I've played this game in a completionist style for over 60 hours and I am so, so tired of it. And it's just a couple of weaks after I had great time playing Gothic 1 - which I always considered inferior. Another problem is the game was freezing for me once every 15-20 minutes. Thankfully saving and loading the games is superfast and you can get used to restarting the game, however this added to many, many bugs Gothic series always had completely shattered my immersion. For what I googled many people have the same problem on Windows 7, so I suggest trying a non-Steam version.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A game should work when you click ""Play"" from Steam. End of story.  If it doesn't, that stops a lot of people from even trying to play a game they paid money for.  I don't blame the game, I blame Steam.  After all the work arounds for the first Gothic, I finally had a chance to play.  Wow... it was terrible.  It didn't hold up at all.  Looked like an old N64 game in hi-rez mode and  controlled like a quadrapalegic smashing it's face on the keyboard.  Now Gothic 2 won't start.  Based on the negative experience I have had so far, I can safely consider this series a waste of money and write it off completely.  Trying to play Gothic is like forcing yourself to date an ugly chick just because you're bored and can't date anyone else at the moment.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												At least the combat is better in this one. However, it's still a janky, poorly coded, glitchy, unfinished game with it's only redeeming quality is the story and the environment. The main quest is often bugged, and you must resort to cheating in order to fix it. People will argue that this game is good and that those that don't like it just need ""easier games"" that hold your hands. I call ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. Those people are just as diluled as FF7 fanboys. This game has potential, and I'll admit it has charm that kept me playing for 30+ hours, but ultimately, I was more frustrated the fact that I was moreso fighting the actual game, than the enemies the game provided. That's not good design, that's not good gaming. I've played Risen and the Gothic series and can say that imho, Piranha Bytes is a company with potential, but don't learn their lessons, even 10+ years later. 6/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Posted: December 22, 2014
												I have seen this game compared to Oblivion many times in gaming reviews and recomendations.  Its defintatly not Oblivion or even close to the quality of Oblivion.  And, unless I am missing something major in the configuration, this game is very awkward to play on a computer.  The mouse look around is extremely sluggish and I cant find a mouse speed setting anywhere in the game.  Trying to fight in this game is terribly awkward as well.  To swing a sword, you must also push a directional button-so you swing and run the direction of your swing, both at the same time, constantly over running your opponent and the extremely sluggish mouse look around makes it take forever to turn back around to face your opponent.  Meanwhile you are getting butchered.  The voice acting is really bad too and I wont comment on the poor, blocky graphics because the game is quite old so that is to be expected.  I have been considering purchasing this game for a very long time(ever since I read the first review that compared it to Oblivion).  Now I am happy that I waited for it to go on sale for only a couple of dollars.  I might have loved this game in my early gaming days when my expectations were much lower but these days I find myself not impressed by it at all.  Of course there are going to be a ton of fan boys and old school snobs who are going to freak out over my review but thats par for the course.  Having said all that, I enjoy older games as much as anyone.  If the controls were a little more PC friendly, I could put up with the bad voice acting, outdated graphics, and simplistic good and evil story line.  But the controls are NOT PC friendly.  The only mouse support is a VERY sluggish look around.  Mouse isnt even supported in the main menu or your inventory(you have to use arrow keys to select items).  If you dont mind a lot of hand work in your games and a frustrating combat/movement system then I guess go for it.  Otherwise, dont bother.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Even CTRL-ALT-DEL didn't help. It wouldn't close when prompted to with keyboard commands and it wouldn't release the mouse. Restarted the computer, tried it again. Did the same thing. Looked around for an answer. Yep, there's a patch/upgrade/mod on a german website with german instructions on what looks like a fairly lengthy process to install. Save yourself the headache of fighting with this thing to get it to run. It wasn't THAT fun.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is like buying a new brand of razor.You see people telling you it's better, and you want to believe them because of the lackluster shaving experiences you've had in the past, so you buy the new razor. You go into the bathroom, ready for a nice and smooth shaving experience, but once you're a few strokes in you realize that it's pretty similar to the other razors you've used in the past. In fact, in some ways it's worse than your old razors. Then you find out that the people that have been telling you this razor is better bought it and only used it once or twice. Some of them just looked at some videos showcasing how ""amazing"" it is on the internet, or heard someone else tell them it was the best razor ever. Some people claim the razor was great when they used it 10 years ago, so how could it not be as good as they remembered? But you now know the truth. This razor isn't special, and many will pass on it or never know about, and they won't be missing much. You know that this razor is really just as good as all the other razors.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Gothic II is one of the deepest and hardest RPG I have ever played. This is surprising to see that the graphics have aged very well. The story is pretty good and generates interesting quests with a lot of politics and social interactions. Its world is one of the biggest I've ever seen after Oblivion and Fallout.Beware: This is the hardest RPG I have ever played (even harder than Baldur's Gate!). It is like the opposite of Oblivion: it is like a real life simulator and almost every combat is hard until the very end, yet the final bosses are not so hard to defeat.If you wish to try this game, I suggest you to play Risen first, which is way more accessible and still remain very nice and deep.

												A must have for any dedicated RPG players out there. By far the best one in the series of Gothic. Even though melee combat might be a tad wonky and the difficulty is sometimes too steep, it's well worth your time.The main plot is quite linear but you'll be surprised with the amount of freedom the player is given. For most of the side quests or sub quests, there are multiple ways to deal with the tasks. For a game this old it is absolutely mindblowing how fresh the design feels. Attention to detail makes the world feel real and it has a truly unique taste to it.If you have a bit of that old-school backbone when it comes to games that don't make themselves too easy, you'll definitely get quite a lot of value from this game. One full playthrough is around 50 hours; I myself finished this game around three times when it came out, and I just decided to play it again on Steam and was surprised by the freshness of the experience (50 hours and still going). The game has a lot of replay value, which in the RPG world isn't so common anymore.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Gothic 2 is alright overall. I can't say it's the best thing to ever come out because there are a lot of games currently out that are just simply better. What I can argue is that Gothic 2 is still entertaining and if it comes on sale again like it did (I bought it in a bundle wit all the Gothic games December 2013 getting a great steam sale deal.) It would definitely be worth picking up. The game is of a free roam style but still nothing like The Elder Scrolls and doesn't seem to have anywhere near the amount of content that The Elder Scrolls have nor does it have the same amount of exploration for you to do. What it does have are pain in the♥♥♥♥♥npcs that will 1 shot you on sight that you will have to learn to avoid until you reach a higher level and gear up in order to get any fun out of this game. Gothic 2 can be unforgiving and frustrating so I wouldn't recomend it if you're the kind of person who cusses out other players on Call of Duty, hurls controllers across the room on a frequent basis or makes death threats when he/she is angry. It also suffers from the occasional drastic frame rate drop (Which are limited to specific areas from what I could see 2 different spots are like this) or freeze which may require you to restart your comuter because you will not be able to get into the menu to quit the game. Overall despite it's flaws I still enjoyed it and i'm still having fun with it. So to sum it all up I guess i'd say 5.5/10 better than average far from perfection but a very enjoyable game.

												I played a hard copy of the original (sans expansion) and it is one of the finest PC RPGs of the previous generation. Even though the open world is a prison colony, there's so much to explore. The story is well-told and keeps you wanting to learn more about the game's mythology. Gameplay is much improved over the original.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Gothic 2 posses a much more challenging game for the fans of the first one. The nameless hero is back but lost all his power as new threats come. THIS TIME you must slay dragons and the champion of darkness. Explore the world outside that prison colony, meet old friends, Follow the path of the Paladin, the Magician, or the Dragon Hunter.The world is much larger making you free to explore a even larger world and makes the game more challenging by making you dedicate more learning points to stats and skills then you normally would.Note: You don't really need to play Gothic 1 to play this, but since your old friends from 1 will appear in 2, it'd be nice to know who they were.Gothic 2 is pretty fun and like every game has downsides. For example, in G-1 your friend Diego had a good voice, in G-2 he gets a new Voice Actor and it's just plain bad. Still I give it a 9/10, great but not perfect.""SPOILER"" Join the Militia if your a first timer, it's alot easier then others. ""END SPOILER""			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

IT'S WELL WORTH IT, THOUGH.)My favorite RPG, if not game in general, of all time.OF ALL TIME!You start out as just some guy (granted, you did essentially save everybody in the previous games, but rocks keep falling on my head...) who will be killed by any human he goes up against.Really.You will die.If you don't enjoy a challange, don't play this (or use god mode).You get to choose a faction; paladins, mages, or mercenaries. You help them through the rest of the game. You start as a guy who gets torn apart by a wolf, and eventually become a man who could probably take out the entire city.This is the game I have played where winning gives you the biggest feeling of accomplishment.And you can go ANYWHERE via the context sensitive jump system. And you should, as they will reward you.Get into the city via unconventional means? +200 exp.Climb up to a rock precepice? Get a faction-based amulet.Jump behind a temple? Find a broken-down car.Get behind the orc wall? MIGHTY ALIEN DWARF WAS HERE!(DO NOT BUY THIS GAME ON STEAM. THE STEAM VERSION HAS TROUBLE RUNNING, AND SOMETIMES DOES NOT EVEN RUN AT ALL.

Probably didn't back then either.Can't think of another game that makes challenging combat so rewarding, shame it plays like an absolute turd on Windows 8/750m/Nvidia optimus/touchscreen or whatever modern skull-duggery is causing my broheim to crab run everywhere and for an ugly white banner to appear at the top of screen.

Apparently only the current version of 2.6 works with fullscreen on 16:9/16:10 monitors and you gotta tweak it yourself which ALSO proved to be a big pain in the♥♥♥♥♥♥and after downgrading it, i had to download a patch that could be compatible to fullscreen 2.6 version. DONT buy the game, unless you have a 4:3 monitor and if you are a big fan of the gothic series. This will never get modern fullscreen monitor support from the devs but its possible to make it work if you look up on the net. POSSIBLE but very difficult to make it work on 16:9/16:10.

												The Gothic games are some of the greatest RPGs out there, and Gothic 2 is the best of the series. As any good sequel should, Gothic 2 improves upon the original and adds even more. The Gothic series is known for an immersive open-world atmosphere, unforgiving combat, and interesting characters; Gothic 2 has all of this in spades. In addition, this game adds some crafting elements (notably alchemy and runes/spells, with a little smithing thrown in) that were glaringly missing from the original. The world is roughly 3 times larger than the first (4 times including the content added by Night of the Raven) and is full of little nooks containing treasures, traps and monsters to satisfy your itch to explore.The game takes place shortly after the events of the first title and involves many of the original characters (and some familiar places). I highly recommend playing the original Gothic first, because it'll make the sequel that much more enjoyable when you encounter them.Whether you're leveling up stats/skills or interacting with an NPC, you'll often have to make decisions that will impact the rest of the game. Character progression is slow but rewarding, though you'll feel like there's not enough skill points to go around. This is intentional so that you're encouraged to focus on a particular style of play and is further emphasized by how the game handles factions. If in doubt, take some time to consider those decisions (or at least save in an alternate slot).While Gothic 2 is an amazing title, it's not perfect. I recall a quest involving Lares and Vatras that was very buggy and could potentially ruin your story progression entirely. The bosses are challenging, but are pretty much identical. Diego (a main character from the first game) is mostly an annoying and generic NPC this time around and was voiced by someone else. Being an older game, it's often a hassle to get running on modern PCs (there are guides that help most people) and even then is prone to crashing at the end of several cutscenes (skipping them seems to work, though you'll have to view them elsewhere). Thankfully, Gothic 2 is still very much worth playing despite these flaws.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Before playing I would recommend getting the community patch, there are guides to this in the steam forums. It fixes some potentially gamebreaking bugs. If the game gives you the ""Access Violation"" message, try running the game (gothic2.exe) as admin in the compatibility settings, this solved the problem for me.[TL:DR] Good game, nice story and world, wonky combat, great atmosphere.Full ReviewThe story and characters are interesting enough, and the lore is quite fun to delve into. Your actions have consequences, which I like. The atmosphere and world building is where the game shines. The weakness of your character is annoying at times, but at the same time it makes you slow down and really take in the world around you. In a game like Skyrim I never really felt like I was a part of the world, more like a strange alien creature for whom normal people were completely irrelevant. In Gothic 2 you get much more involved in the dealings of normal people, from farmers to merchants, and what you do to or with them actually matters, because you are one of them. It's really good. It actually feels kind of like you are a part of the world, a small person who rises up to glory through hard work and courage. The game? It's good, weird, but good. If you're new to the series I can't stress enough how important it is to take it slow and get used to the game. It's a bit clunky (especially the combat) and somewhat opaque when it comes to telling the player what they're supposed to do. Now, this isn't necessarily a bad thing in itself (as the numerous of elitist forum posters have pointed out), but when the map you have is basically just a picture with no named locations on it navigating can seem, and sometimes is, unnecessarily cumbersome. A feature to write notes on the map would be appreciated. A character might say ""Go to Onar's farm, it's to the east"", that's all you've got to go on. The map has some farm looking drawings on it, so it should be one of them.This would all be completely fine if not for how unbelievably weak you character is in the beginning. This game rewards exploration, but i doesn't at the same time. Sometimes your treks can be just fine, but then if you walk to the north instead of east you will die, because an orc decided to camp out here. He sees you, draws his sword and kills you in one quick slash. The best way to find out where you can and cannot go is simply to save the game, pick a road and see how far you can go before getting killed. It's weird, but you get used to it. After a while you will get stronger, while it's still dangerous to face off against a bigger group of enemies, you're not as squishy as you were before.My biggest gripe with the game is the combat, or how they decided to design some of it. When you draw your sword your character will automatically lock on to the nearest person/monster/giant bug, no matter who or what it is. Fighting with a companion. for example, is horrible; your character will constantly lock on to your companion instead of the enemy and you end up fighting the mechanics more than the actual enemy. It should also be noted that this feature is on by default and cannot be turned off. Fighting groups of enemies is even more janky, and the lock-on is still the villain. This means that, since enemies don't just stand and wait for their turn, you will constantly change focus from enemy to enemy, with the camera darting around desperately trying to keep up. It makes the fights infuriatingly confusing, a simple feature to just lock on to a single enemy and keep it locked would be so much better, or no lock on feature at all, honestly.All in all, a good game filled to the brim with ambition and ideas and perhaps too small a budget. If you like rpgs and have the patience to learn how the mechanics work I wholeheartedly recommend this.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I complained in my earlier recs of Risen and Gothic that Piranha Bytes has yet to nail an ending, but that's only because I'd yet to play Gothic 2.  Not only do they (mostly) nail the ending (setting up an interesting questline where you hunt and kill several dragons before recruiting a crack team of adventurers to help you hunt down the big bad), but the game leading up to that point is pretty much a near perfect ARPG: massive open world (which includes not only the entirety of Gothic 1, but 2 more equally huge maps), no level scaling, tons to do and kill.  The storyline is mostly just passable, but the game's strength is really more in open world exploration combined with the tension brought on by the fact that for most of the game you are very out leveled and thus could die at any moment.  I'm a sucker for story so I still probably prefer the Witcher series to this, but in terms of pure gameplay there's probably no better ARPG on the market than Gothic 2.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The 2nd game of the series and the hardest one.The graphics are better than in the first game, the sounds are better too and the story is great in my opinion.The gold edition even gives you Night of the Raven, the fun thing is that this expansion makes the game even harder (yay), gives you new enemies, a new world so you can explore even that when you get bored of Khorinis.You start the game weak and mostly everything will kill you but you will grow stronger in the game so don't worry.This game will steal hundreds of hours from you and you will enjoy them.And if you add mods the game will become even better. (It will require tinkering with the game)This isn't for people that want an easy game, you will be killed most of the time, but when you beat the game you will come back, i know i did (multiple times during the years).Note- The lack of playtime in this account is since i already have the non-steam (cd) version and it has mods in it hence me not playing the steam version.

												Gothic 2 posses a much more challenging game for the fans of the first one. The nameless hero is back but lost all his power as new threats come. THIS TIME you must slay dragons and the champion of darkness. Explore the world outside that prison colony, meet old friends, Follow the path of the Paladin, the Magician, or the Dragon Hunter.The world is much larger making you free to explore a even larger world and makes the game more challenging by making you dedicate more learning points to stats and skills then you normally would.Note: You don't really need to play Gothic 1 to play this, but since your old friends from 1 will appear in 2, it'd be nice to know who they were.Gothic 2 is pretty fun and like every game has downsides. For example, in G-1 your friend Diego had a good voice, in G-2 he gets a new Voice Actor and it's just plain bad. Still I give it a 9/10, great but not perfect.""SPOILER"" Join the Militia if your a first timer, it's alot easier then others. ""END SPOILER""			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Gothic II is one of the deepest and hardest RPG I have ever played. This is surprising to see that the graphics have aged very well. The story is pretty good and generates interesting quests with a lot of politics and social interactions. Its world is one of the biggest I've ever seen after Oblivion and Fallout.Beware: This is the hardest RPG I have ever played (even harder than Baldur's Gate!). It is like the opposite of Oblivion: it is like a real life simulator and almost every combat is hard until the very end, yet the final bosses are not so hard to defeat.If you wish to try this game, I suggest you to play Risen first, which is way more accessible and still remain very nice and deep.

Gameplay is much improved over the original.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A must have for any dedicated RPG players out there. By far the best one in the series of Gothic. Even though melee combat might be a tad wonky and the difficulty is sometimes too steep, it's well worth your time.The main plot is quite linear but you'll be surprised with the amount of freedom the player is given. For most of the side quests or sub quests, there are multiple ways to deal with the tasks. For a game this old it is absolutely mindblowing how fresh the design feels. Attention to detail makes the world feel real and it has a truly unique taste to it.If you have a bit of that old-school backbone when it comes to games that don't make themselves too easy, you'll definitely get quite a lot of value from this game. One full playthrough is around 50 hours; I myself finished this game around three times when it came out, and I just decided to play it again on Steam and was surprised by the freshness of the experience (50 hours and still going). The game has a lot of replay value, which in the RPG world isn't so common anymore.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Thee best of the series (IMHO).  In addition to my Steam time I also had the original discs.  Back in the day Night of the Raven wasn't as easily found so I bought the Steam version a few years ago when I saw it had it included.  This made this even bigger and more epic.  I am a huge fan of the Gothic series.  This one and the first one are better because you actually need skill and timing to prevail in combat.  Did I mention timing?  You can't go into your next swing too fast or late, adjusted by skill level, or you will fail.  None of that button mashing lameness in other RPGs (Divinity 2 for example) or annoying cut scene executions (usually one button, no skill needed, and repetitive).  THIS IS NOT MOUSE FRIENDLY.  There ya go.  I said it.  Now get past it.  Once you adjust to playing straight keyboard (rather quickly) it will not take away from the experience.  Open world, no hand holding waypoints for ten year olds.  Diverse world with MANY hidden bonuses for those who know to look in the nooks, high and low, in RPG worlds to find suprise gear/mobs.  The dialogue needs to be listened to but it isn't overwhelming.  Older graphics but engaging play mechanics is higher on my priorities.  Need cutting edge graphics, on rails, lameness, go buy a console or port.  That is all they make for the most part for RPGs.   If you like hard core RPGs this was made for you. BTW, If you get the black screen at start you need to modify it to launch in compatibility mode Wndows XP service pack 3 AND launch as an administartor.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I'm a bit of an RPG fanatic in general, and I can definitely appreciate the classics such as Baldur's Gate and Morrowind, and, in some cases, I can end up appreciating the classics more than I can the new blood. This is one of those cases.Before I get started, allow me to state that this game has an extremely unforgiving early game that neither of the titles in the paragraph above hold a candle to in terms of difficulty. It is unforgiving and you will die. You will die a lot. You will die so many times, actually, that you just stop getting mad all together. Of course, part of the charm in the classic RPGs is the difficulty, and Gothic II certainly doesn't skim on that. It is as deep, complex, and difficult as even any RPG out there.The architecture and design is clearly inspired by medevil Germany, especially the houses and buildings and whatnot, which are almost spot on for not only that time period but in some cases, modern German architecture. I found that to be pretty fun, admittedly. It really goes great with Sour Cream & Onion flavored potato chips. There are a lot of quest and all of the dialogue is voiced, and while the voice acting can be a bit laughable at times the dialogue itself is really great. Keep in mind this game was ported to the English language, and voice acting in ports is usually not very great. This time it was just us English speakers catching the short end of the stick for once, because I hear the voice acting in the original language is pretty dope. The direct dialogue itself is still pretty amazing, though. Very immerse dialogue in conversations that involve your character and you pick which way the conversations lead and whatnot, so I find that to be pretty fun.There are some minor issues with the combat system, admittedly. It'll seem a bit clunky at first, but once you get used to it there isn't going to be much of a problem with that. It won't be why you're dying, at least. Which you will die, by the way. Don't know if I mentioned that yet.The graphics are about on par for the time it was released, which it was originally released in 2002, so they shouldn't be too much of an issue unless you walk in with unrealistic expectations. Some areas they are lacking and some areas they're exceeding the expectations set. I don't really care much about that, however, as the strength in Gothic II is the quests, the dialogue, and the gritty realism. This isn't like Elder Scrolls where people welcome you with open arms. You're not wanted anywhere, and most people will treat you like absolute♥♥♥♥♥♥ There is little helping each other out and personal gain is always going to be a motive with every quest you take and every conversation you make. And people standing outside of taverns in the harbor district will try to take a lot of money from you with threats. And they will kill you, and you will die. If you have troubles running it, which many people will due to the poor future-proofing, just follow this guide:

												After giving up on Gothic 1 in chapter 3 because of of a lousy battle system, I decided to fire up Gothic 2. Man, what an improvement. After 6 hours of gameplay, this game gets 2 thumbs up. Great story and improved battle system. Still a little clunky, but much improved battle system compared to Gothic 1.Game did not run initially, had to add the fixes in the Danilch guide.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Eines, wenn nicht das beste Rollenspiele das die Welt je gesehen hat.Man ist aus der Strafkolonie von Teil 1 geflohen und wurde von Xardas, einem Magier befreit um ihm zu helfen. Um das zu tun schließt man sich einer Gemeinschaft an: Magier, Söldner oder Miliz.Jede Gemeinschaft hat ihre Vorteile, so dass es definitiv Wiederspielwert hat alle durchzuprobieren.Die Welt ist glaubwürdig gestaltet, es gibt zahlreiche Nebenmissionen und die Charakterentwicklung ist klasse gemacht.Man bekommt für jedes Level Lernpunkte und gibt diese bei einem Trainer aus um z.B. Schwerter zu steigern.Das Mana regeneriert sich nur durch Tränke oder Rasten, womit es notwendig ist, sich dieses einzuteilen und zu überlegen ob man den Ork mit einem Feuerball oder vielleicht doch lieber der Armbrust oder dem Schwert niederstreckt.Die Story (Hauptspiel und Addon) sind phänomenal und machen Spaß.Klare Empfehlung von mir.

												The Gothic series is my all-time favorite series of all time.  In particular, Gothic II is my favorite game of the series.  There is so much to do in the game, and it has an incredible world to explore filled with lots of quests and loot.  This game gets better the longer you play it.  Your character will progress in a meaningful way that will not just make you stronger but change the way you play the game.  Gothic II is the best game of all time!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This game is, in my opinion, one of the best games ever. It provided well over 100 hours of gameplay for me (although I did go through it twice) a great story with many sidequests.It also has a world where you can go anywhere without finding some annoying invisible wall, and may go back to previously explored areas right up until the end quest. The graphics look outdated by modern standards, but that shouldn't put anyone off.However, there is a downside - there are alot of bugs I encountered, such as the game crashing when i pressed escape too much or it not saving properly. But the fact that I kept playing even with these proves just how good it is.Another downside is the fact that this game set the bar too high, all newer gothic games just don't compare.

												This game is literally one of my most favourite childhood experiences. I dived into it with a passion not many games were able to spark in me over the course of the years. It's a shame that this game didn't quite get the popularity in the US as it should've deserved, in my opinion. This game is the continuation of Gothic 1 and its story with the same badass hero and his badass friends. The story and character development in this game is amazing and compared to other games that came around at the same time as Gothic 2 it is fair to say that it held its ground with shining excellence. The addon""The Night of the Raven"" expands the game almost twofold and gives an entirely new experience on top of the already fantastic vanilla version. I have to admit that tastes are different. Morrowind was a great game, but for my own tastes Gothic 2 Notr just has an undescribable edge. Should you buy it? Definitely! This game is 1,99€ on sale right now, what the hell are you waiting for?! (oh no, now I've got this catchy tune in my head)			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I bought this game for the first time in 2004, I don’t even remember how many times I have finished it, and I have even tried all factions at the same time, this way I got access to all of the quests and items specific to each faction. What a master piece. Finally I got the steam version up and running, here I go again Khorinis!!!Sadly I still keep on seen reviews complaining about the graphics, really? Apparently many gamers is all they care about, graphics; even if the game itself is a piece of crap or a senseless empty shell. I don’t know about the other fans but even the rustic graphics on Gothic 2 were just perfect for the environment in the game. A good example, what happened with gothic 3? Boy! What a rip off, I paid 50 dollars back then and I think I still regret it. What was the point on improving the graphics? Game all full of glitches, lost most of its essence it didn’t even feel like gothic anymore, it was a completely different game, not mentioning the brutally high specs for the time. That proves my point, yeah nice graphics 8/10 but 2/10 about the game itself, if I wanted to play and kill stuff for no reason in a beautiful landscape I would have played Halo on instead. At least for me a good game is the one that catches your attention completely, makes you feel it, gets you involved, and Gothic 1 and 2 are a great example of it, actually this game helped me define my path as a gamer, since Gothic 2 I became a big fan of role playing games.Highly recommended game 29.5 / 10 indeed ;)  LONG LIFE TO GOTHIC 2 AND THE NAMELESS HERO!!!!

												One of the more hardcore RPGs I've played. You'll start off a little frustrated at the fact your guy can be killed by rats, and the combat controls, which require use of the keyboard to attack forward, left, right and dodge.  Besides that, this is the first game I played that requires you to actually go to different trainers and use your gold/XP to upgrade. There is no other way. This is my second purchase of this game, and I can tell you that all the worl you put into your character actually makes you proud of your accomplishments from the first troll you slay to the last dragon. Unlike most RPGs, by the end you'll feel like you've actually transformed your character to something epic. Obviously old now, when it came out in 2002 (US version came out in 03) it was the most in depth and expensive game to come out besides morrowind. For a challenge, and a different Role playing game, try this.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
