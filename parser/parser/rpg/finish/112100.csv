												I bought this game a long time ago for a decent amount of money, but since it's a long game, I postponed playing it... Until recently.Many of the ""recommended"" reviews here are from people who spent a very, very short time playing Avadon. Had I written such a review when I was only a couple of hours into the game, it would have been positive, too. It was very fun at the start... but then it became profoundly NOT fun.You see, early on, you have a couple of quests and a couple of locations. You have various characters, you find items, battles are nice, you get better loot, your characters work in synergy... And then the game suddenly becomes a chore. Quests pile up. The quest texts never get updated. There are no indicators anywhere about the people you need to visit or return to. No indicator of what you need to do. I spent a lot of time going around and talking to people, only to find out that a quest isn't over. The loot doesn't scale up. Your damage doesn't scale up. And the game difficulty (I played on ""normal"") suddenly switches to ""most frustrating game ever"". You die. You die a lot. You are too weak. You need luck with the RNG, and you need potions and scrolls in greater amounts that you can obtain. Your abilities are on a large cooldown. Again, not enough potions to alleviate that. To add insult to injury, you spend vitality on abilities and vitality *does not recharge by itself*. You need to basically go back to the Avadon fortress on a semi-regular basis. There's no real quick-travel system, so every time you want to do that, you're looking at about five wasted minutes.About 15 hours in, I seriously contemplated quitting right there and then; but I said to myself ""you spent more on this than on many other games, so you NEED to finish it"". I had a quest to follow a warrior into the woods and clear out some spiders. ""Some"" turned out to be about four nests of four to five spiders each. They were teleporting spiders which cast corrupting spells and thus did a lot of damage-over-time. Took me an hour to finally win that sidequest. Okay, I said, this is one of the harder battles; let's continue. Then I found what was an almost unbeatable Shade. Somehow managed to get that done as well. Then I found an evil Drake that spawned minions *and* mind-controlled several tough soldiers (EDIT: forgot to mention that it was HEALING those soldiers, so every time you came close to killing one, it would be healed to max HP; repeat 4-5 times, while your characters die and you've spent all of your potions). That... that was unbeatable, and it was the turning point at which I resorted to cheats: bumped my characters to level 30, then constantly used healing, shields and ability cooldown reset.I gave up on the sidequests. I have no idea where I found most of the people and what I needed to do next (again - the quest system is extremely rudimentary and doesn't tell you anything). Even with constant cheating, it took me a total of 40 hours to finish the main story line.Disregard the ""recommended"" reviews, honestly, and check the achievements:Only 1/3 of the total number of players met a certain NPC called Redbeard, and that happens *very* early into the game.Only 1/50 (a measly 2%) of the players finished Avadon. Two percent. Wow.You see all those <40hr reviews? Yeah, they recommended a game they never finished. If it's so fun and great and awesome, why did they stop playing? Because of the issues I mentioned here. Let's not even get into ""OMG BEST GAME EVER!!11"" reviews from people with 1-5 hours in.Skip this. Honestly. Even if you get this in a bundle, it's just not worth playing. Get an RPG that's actually fun.If you *do* feel masochistic and try to play without cheating, I'll give you a tip: in this game, Dexterity rules. Get it to a minimum of 25.Highly not recommended.

												IT'S ABOUT TIME! Frankly this is probably old news to many of you reading this.  I'm ashamed that I didn't know about these Spiderweb titles previously. Gather round me children, for there's a tale I'd like to share.  Once there was a time when video games entertained the player an immersive story and provocative challenges that kept you playing for hours. I've never liked the term ""dungeon crawler"".  To me the crawler part implies slow which let's be honest, is generally associated with boring in the world of books, movies and video games.  When was the last time you couldn't wait to dig in to a slow book someone recommended?  So when I saw that genre ascribed to this and other Spiderweb titles I dismissed them pretty quickly.  I didn't feel like click-spamming my way through another shallow DC chasing the next-best weapon for hours on end - mindlessly racing to the next waypoint, only taking breaks to managing a mountain of gear (/cough...torchlight)...  So as I was browsing my games library through titles I'll never get to and I barely recognize, the term ""turn-based"" caught my eye.  ""Turn-based""...dungeon-crawler?  Now that's a name I""ve not heard in a long time.  A long time.  I must have played through ""Planescape: Torment"" three times since it's release.  The same can be said for ""Fallout 1/2"".  I can't chalk up their awesome replayablility to nostalgia any more.  These are simply incredibly entertaining titles and the reason I've played them all so often is that nothing after (to my knowledge) ever properly took up where they left off.  Well that was until I discovered this game.This game, like Planescape and Fallout 1&2 focus on story depth, simple, intuitive UI/game mechanics, and challenging ""strategic"" (yet simple) combat.  I don't mean simple as in ""easy"", I just mean you will very quickly become well-versed your battle playbook and the challenge lies in making good decisions as it is turn-based.  If you're familiar Fallout 1 & 2 or Planescape Torment then to put it simply this game is very similar to those but in a classic fantasy setting.    It's also a nice reminder of the days when RPG titles didn't hold your hand every step of the way.  The quest descriptions are clear, but the objectives are kept broad enough keep the players guessing as to how exactly to complete them.Combine all of the above with perfectly classic ""if-it-ain't-broke"" fantasy RPG elements and you have this surprisingly impressive game.  I can't recommend this title enough for old-school PC nerds like myself as well as newcomers.   I could go on and on but I gotta get back to the game.  I give it 2 ogre-thumbs up			",119,20,2,30,10,0,38

												If you're familiar with Spiderweb Software's RPGs, it will come as no surprise that Avadon: The Black Fortress is another extensive old school party-based trek through areas full of nooks and crannies with unique encounters and secret loot caches to be had, as well as exciting set piece encounters and an intriguing overall narrative.  That's pretty much true of everything they put out. The big changes to the formula are: a new world; a significantly more linear progression than most of the other entries in their lineup, a class-and-skill-tree approach to character builds, and party members who are fully fledged NPCs that contribute insights and dialogue throughout the plot as you move through it, can be spoken to between missions, and have their own side agendas you will have to deal with.The new world is an intriguing fantasy setting where five disparate and feuding lands have banded together in a defensive pact against pirates, invading empires, marauding humanoids and dragons, a blighted magical corruption, and other exterior threats. The pact is held together by the dictatorial enforcement of the Black Fortress Avadon, and they maintain a network of spies and enforcement agents to ensure compliance. The fairly unique conceit of this particular entry (and who knows, perhaps followup games in the series) is that you play Hands of Avadon, sent to enforce the laws of the pact and defend it from threats within and without. This gives you rather more authority and a much more fearsome reputation than your typical band of wandering adventurers, and this is used to good effect throughout, although alas you still have to contend with buying your own supplies, a tired RPG trope that seems even more out of place in this context (though they do attempt to explain it).The linearity is somewhat unfortunate, but things do open up as you gain access to more of the areas and return to zones on new missions, and most of the sidequests can be done at your leisure. Still, the flipside of linearity is that you're always being sent into challenges that you should be equipped to handle, and it's always clear what you're expected to do next, neither of which are guaranteed in more open formats.I am personally a big fan of Avadon's approach to skills and classes. I find the structure of new ability at rank 1, additional effect(s) at later ranks, and unlocking a secondary ability at a late rank very rewarding and I never feel like my points are wasted or that I have to save points from level to level just to advance at all, which have been issues I've historically had with the more freeform skill approach earlier Spiderweb games took (and other games with skill systems, for that matter). And Avernum in particular suffered from boring fighter syndrome where spellcasters got huge suites of spells to cast for a varied combat experience and fighters...got to hit things. Not here. The Blademaster class even passively is a blast, with heavy passive investment rewarding cleaves, a hilariously effective level of hit prevention, and the chance to riposte, curse enemies, or begin regenerating  if hit, and then on top of that gets group buffs and debuffs and attacks with additional secondary effects. The Shadowwalker hurls shurikens, teleports around, throws pots of acid and smoke bombs, backstabs and poisons, and is a huge fountain of damage in general.  (Needless to say, I was pleased when the Avernum remake cribbed from this system, albeit in a more Avernum-y way.)As for the NPCs - there's one of every type, you get them all pretty nearly immediately, they stay levelled with you even if you're not using them, and they all have interesting personalities and backstories. I've never been a huge fan of the ""party too large for everyone to simultaneously adventure with you"" thing, but this is about as good as it gets considering that.So all in all, another classic RPG. It's not quite as old school as previous series from Spiderweb, but the deviations from that formula mostly are in the vein of improvements in RPG design, in my book, not stepping away from the core appeal.

												Avadon: The Black Fortress is a fine modern RPG made in the old-school style. Except better: no swapping floppy disks or CDs! But it makes me a little sad to say that it feels like a chore to play. Visually, Avadon exists in a 1995 timewarp: Better looking than the SSI ""Gold Box"" D&D RPGs, but not as nice as the Baldur's Gate era games from Bioware/Black Isle. But Avadon isn't so concerned about appearances. What makes this old-looking game work in 2013 is how fluid the experience is. It looks dated, but it streamlines gameplay, and adds modern features like skill trees, and the ability to scale the game difficulty if you want to move more quickly through the game's difficult bits. And your character speeds around the screen! No more waiting as your party trudges around the map; this game respects your time, as your characters hustle around in loose formation.But this fast game pace brings me to the part that I don't like. Avadon is big on prose, like RPGs used to be. Avadon makes up for its stick-figure graphics by providing rich, descriptive storytelling. There's a lot of reading to be done, and no voice acting. So far, so good.But in Avadon, your character moves so quickly from encounter to encounter, you find yourself reading constantly. There's no break. It's like reading a book. Frankly, I find myself resenting how much reading this game is asking me to do. And I kept nodding off as I was playing.Baldur's Gate was probably a 80 hour game. Avadon makes me wonder how much of that time was just trudging around on the screen, revealing the dark parts. Walking from place to place. The pace was slow, but maybe that was an intentional break from all the reading we were asked to do back then. Walk a little, fight a little, walk a little, read a little. In Avadon, it feels like read-run-read-run-read-run. So... much... reading.I recommend Avadon, because I respect how fine of a job Spiderweb has done to streamline old game mechanics, while still maintaining a flavorful, old-school feeling. And the story's good! But bring your spectacles; you're going to be doing a lot of reading as you play.On a related note, I recently purchased a pack of classic Bioware RPGs from GOG.com. I plan to go back and finish the games from that era that I never played -- Baldur's Gate 2, Icewind Dale. I look forward to seeing how I feel about playing these games 15 years later. Will the pacing feel better than Avadon? Stay tuned to find out.			",168,52,2,18,21,2,22

												A very well-crafted game world. What the writing lacks in concision it makes up for in quality.  The RPG gameplay is engaging, if not a bit OCD-inducing. My major gripe with the game would be the repetitive ambient sounds used in place of music, but that mostly comes my having previously played other Spiderweb Software games that also recycled these sounds. Still, though, the gameplay and player-influenceable story are more than enough to make the game worth playing on their own.Edit: after reading some of the other reviews, I should mention that I'm playing on Casual (not ashamed to admit it), so I'm not really experiencing some of the difficulty-related complaints that others are. Pretty much the only difficulty-related thing I'm running into is that I don't really have a chance to use up my consumables fast enough on Casual, so I probably waste more time managing my inventory than I might on a harder difficulty.  But that's very minor.			",90,18,0,11,7,1,17

												My recommendation comes with a caveat, I am only recommending this to people who enjoy turn-based cRPGs. I personally am not a fan of turn based combat, which is the reason I eventually gave up on finishing the game.Visually and audibly, the game is nothing to write home about, being made by one person it is understanable and they are functional enough not to detract from the game in any major way.Gameplay in my opinion is bland and uninspired, the turn based combat is quite slow and you are often faced with trash mobs that make the game stutter along at a slow pace. Later battles are frustratingly difficult, as you have to spend a long time clicking through the turns before you sometimes realise you haven't a hope of winning and have to reload. I eventually got sick of trying to beat a particular fight and called it quits.Where the game shines is in its writing and story, I really enjoyed pouring over the descriptions of locations and the characterisation is pretty good in the people you meet. I find it a shame I couldn't bring myself to finish the game because I would have liked to know what happens.So I will recommend this game to people who are into old school turn-based cRPGs, but if slow pacing and turn-based combat make you yawn you might want to check elsewhere.

												Spiderwb Software is know for their old-school RPGs, and rightfully so.  Intersting NPCs, well thought out story, and a well designed world that feels alive.  Character advancment is solid and reminds me of Diablo 2.  The combat is turn based and fairly well balanced.  If you get stuck, or find it too easy, you can adjust the difficulty in game.  I'm at 40+ hours at the time of writing this and I think I'm (maybe) half way through, so there's plenty of content for your money.  Oh.. and no random encounters to frustrate you when you just trying to get around.  Once you clear out an area, it stays clear.That said, the graphics can be hard on the eyes.  Literaly.  If your screen isn't huge and you turn the resolution all the way up. It makes the text tiny (and there's lots of text!).  Moving around gets a little tedious at times when quests have you running back and forth. (There is quick travel, but it only goes so far.)This game isn't for everyone, but fans of classic PC RPGs will enjoy the nostalgia.  I know I did.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Meaning that whether you choose this or that made no difference whatsoever.Dont even bother trying to fight Redbeard. IMPOSSIBLE is the understatement of the century.			",452,219,14,60,30,5,53

												For all the RPG's Funs out there... This is a fair game in a reasonable price for the hours of gameplay that offers (100+).Grapics : 6/10 (outdated reminds me of 90's)Sound   : 3/10 (No music, no Speaking voice... just a repeative soundtrack in loading screen and ugly sounds during playtime)Story     : 8/10 (the best asset of the game... It's intriguing, it feels like a Hand of Avadon indeed  - There are decisions to be made and there is the feeling that the game is affected by them... (even if thats not the case)Gameplay: 6/10 (action points system + leveling up characters + abilities in each type of character and in each level = fair enough but could be a lot better.. How many AP's is exacly one attack? I finished the game and still don't Know 8? 7? or 1?)Duration: 7/10 (100+ hours and you dont get borred)SO FINAL SCORE --> 6 = (6+3+8+6+7)/5 for RPG Funs would go like this (if you thinking like me) --> 7.6 =[6+3+(8*2)+6+7]/5 (the story carries more weight on final score thats why I multiplied it by 2)If you dont like RPGs dont buy it			",97,52,0,70,15,0,30

												Let me just say, I love all of the Spiderweb games. That being said, Avadon just might be their best game. While it is most definitely more linear than Geneforge or Avernum, the story and companion dialogue more than make up for it. You can spend the game looking for twists on your first playthrough, but I would bet that you wouldn't be able to guess most of what happens, especially because a decent amount of plot direction depends on what decisions you make. Whenever you hear someone say something like, ""For a game to be immersive it has to have fantastic graphics and a mega budget"", show them this. I feel very fulfilled having just finished this game for the first time, and feel a compelling urge to start a second playthrough. Do yourself a favor and buy this game.			",305,127,1,123,52,1,29

												after 50ish long hours of fun and often intense gameplay i have beaten my first spidweb game.I highly recommend this game to anyone who is a fan of turnbased strategy rpg games. the story is very good the lore is awesome and its not too hard once you learn the basics. there are a few incredibly tough fights even on normal mode. i managed to get the keeper ending the servant of avadon ending. now im off to the sequel.but if there is one thing i dislike about this game is the fact that is contains multiple endings. now some people like or even love multiple ending games. as for me i rather despise them. for starters i like to have a canon ending and i also like to see all the story and when there is multiple endings that means the story branches which means i have to play even more. and while i love playing this game i do not like having to repeat the story only to go down a slightly different path. but now im just nitpicking, all things considered i HIGHLY recommend this game, and all the other products of this company.(granted i have only played demos of the other games but they are still fun.)

												The game doesn't have great visuals nor any music ingame, but that isn't why I give a negative rating. It starts quite interesting and the design of the first 'dungeon' is really good. Levelling the first ten levels makes your character a lot stronger plus the story and characters get you interested in more. I'd say after around half of the game it falls apart. The levelling gets boring and the combat tedious as every enemy uses special abilities every round to increase the difficulty. This is just annoying and slows the game down to a halt. The locations are overly reused and the story rushes towards the grand finale without making much sense anymore.Overall it's a not really bad turn based RPG, but it's simply not worth your time eventually. There are better RPGs out there and you should be playing them instead.			",3273,1350,120,379,430,37,487

												This is an amazing old school RPG, with an atmosphere very reminiscent of Fallout. Combat is turn-based and very tactical: range, position and zones of control are important, as well as proper use of character abilities. The party composition will vary, the player will usually have the main character as well as two out of four NPCs in his party.Additionally, this game is perfect for loot♥♥♥♥♥ players :P since there are no weight limits for the backpack. The weird isometric perspective takes about an hour to get used to, the controls are otherwise very intuitive.The story is quite original, for a fantasy game, and the characters are well fleshed out. The game is fairly linear, but there are many choices and optional missions along the way, and the story does give you a choice during some important moments. I very much recommend this for anyone looking to play a classic and fun RPG			",370,129,33,90,95,3,113

												Graphically, Avadon is very basic and quite primitive. The sounds also bear this same basic style, with the only music you will hear being from the main menu. All in-game sounds are done adequately though. You will hear your enemies roar and groan, coins, equipment, magic, and all other sounds you may come to expect from a fantasy setting. You should expect to do an immense amount of reading throughout the game. Because of this, the overall gameplay experience seems notably slow paced. While the story and gameplay are rudimentary, Avadon does flow, and there is fun to be had with the turn based combat, item looting, and enhancing the members of your party. Mouse clicking gets severely unresponsive as you play, causing the user to click each action three times or more. This is a major problem. To correct this, all one could do is play the game fresh from a system reboot. Within ten to fifteen minutes after the reboot, the mouse clicking and performance problems will return and stay. Very slowly, the game becomes more interesting and more challenging. The way quests are completed is somewhat awkward. You must go back to the exact place where the quest originated from, and go through the NPC dialog, exclaiming that whatever deed has been done. This would be okay if the map marked where these places are located, or where such NPCs are, but map markings are far from complete. Some quests are so ambiguous, that I found no other way to complete them other than looking at maps made available online. Several of the quests were created in such a way that they nitpick the player into minute details that are very difficult to discern. Avadon seems to drag itself most of the way, mostly because of its slow pace and repetitive game play, but also because of its drab visuals and minimal sounds. Some enemies can be challenging, and interesting to fight against. The variety in creatures is not expansive nor creative, but Avadon manages to keep the encounters enjoyable. The boss battles are difficult, exciting, and fun. The way abilities, spells, and vitality work together is both fair and balanced, providing for an appealing strategy between the usage of weapons and the rest of each character's repertoire. Ultimately, you will become acquainted with your character's powers, and you will eventually appreciate the game's subtle entertainment. The storyline is not very imaginative, nor is it very absorbing. It is conventional in every way imaginable. Also, once you defeat enemies located in a certain area, they will not respawn. Some of the keyboard shortcuts only allow you to activate their respective windows. Pressing the same keyboard shortcut does not deactivate the window. This is minor, but it is still a problem nonetheless. The quests are varied, but feel repetitive in execution. This is mostly because the environs and enemies look very similar from one to the next. Some of your adversaries are so arrogant that you will hate them and enjoy being the reason for their ultimate demise. The most rewarding part of Avadon involves leveling up your characters, equipping the discovered loot, and enhancing their specific abilities. The game often causes serious temporary problems with Windows if you Alt-Tab out of it. Performance issues are borderline ridiculous for a game with such a minimalist design and coarse implementation. In addition, the developer programmed the game to change the speakers' settings in Windows and not return them to the setup it was originally saved to. This is totally unacceptable. The performance problems in conjunction with the other developmental issues is proof of clearly awful programming, or at the very least inadequate porting from the original Mac version. There is basically no creativity whatsoever in Avadon. Every aspect of the game has been done before, for PC and consoles, even in the 80s. After a long while of repetitive, bland, and lackluster gameplay, you will hope for the game to end as soon as possible, but it doesn't. Avadon is clearly 50 hours too long. Much could have been condensed to save players from the tedium. After withstanding the exaggerated amount of hours, the final battle is incredibly frustrating, boring, and poorly implemented. In the end, I decided to quit trying and take a different dialogue path to complete the game. It is that bad. If you would like to read about how poorly designed the final battle is and how much players have complained, peruse the official forums. You won't have anything spoiled, as the ending could have been foreseen from the first half hour of play. This is all quite unfortunate. The finale left me with a feelings of time wasted and disappointment. I understand that the game was designed by one person, but with independent developers often excelling the multi-million Dollar studios, there is no excuse for poor execution anymore.Avadon: The Black Fortress is okay.

												Avadon was my first foray into the crazy world of game designer Jeff Vogel, and boy is it a treat. I sincerely can't remember when was the last good turn-based RPG released, but the Avadon games are certainly refreshing the genre.Great story, lots of interesting dialogue and a lot of great lore are the name of the game with Avadon.The story, while underwhelming at first, picks up after you complete your first mission in the lands of the Kva, and the fun doesn't stop until the end, all accompanied with epic, strategic battles that really have you figuring out a puzzle than simply rushing ahead if you play at a nice pace of difficulty. Most of the side missions all add a lot of life to the world and really make you want to play them and forget the main quest...most of the time.Combat is simplistic at its core. yet very subtle in how it chooses to show its difficulty. You pick from your team two members for each mission to assist, and they all have their unique and very intriguing differences that force you to take your time in choosing them before each mission. You all take turns to move and attack, and all the different patterns for each battle is pretty unique and makes for interesting battles every time you think about reloading!The graphics, while simple in nature, are all very well done, and fit well with the overall theme and are nothing to scoff at for any hardcore tbRPG gamer.I can't recommend it enough for people who miss Baldur's Gate, Planescape: Torment, and similar games.

												This was the first turn-based game I'd played since SW: Knights of the Old Republic.I enjoyed the storyline although to be fair it was rather predictable.  The variety of playing partners helped add to my enjoyment as well as their individual quests and motives added to the story.The difficulty level was just enough for me as a casual gamer to be challenging, but not so overwelming that I had to resort to cheats.I look forward to playing the sequel.

												Easily one of the most entertaining RPG's I've played since Morrowind. Has a pretty solid lore that give way to a genuinly intersting storyline with well written characters.If you like strategic isometric turnbased RPG's, and are willing to look past the kinda meh graphics, then you will absolutely love this game. A solid 8.5/10 from someone who doesn't rate things lightly.NOTE: Push past the graphics, you can do it. it's ♥♥♥♥in worth it.			",64,12,2,14,1,0,4

												Classic Spiderweb RPG - although a little worse than Avernum: Escape from the Pit which I played previously.+ Long and rich story with decisions+ many quests and companion quests+ character development- linear story with same locations- very easy difficulty compared to AvernumIf you are a fan of these games you should play it. If you are not familiar with Spiderweb games - try Avernum: Escape from the Pit instead!			",142,49,6,48,9,1,10

												Short version: a role-playing game where you control a band of adventurers on their way to fame and glory. 5/5Long version: Avadon: The Black Fortress is a role-playing game that acts as a spiritual successor to the honorable company Spiderwebsoftware's earlier productions of Geneforge- and Avernum-series. You choose a character for yourself, and soon enough will start to build a band of like-minded individuals to go out on quests together.The gameplay itself is isometric, and very fluid. The graphics, however, are not what makes this game -- it has never been so with Spiderwebsoftware. The real deal here is the plot, the story, the characters, and the (ironic) humour that you keep running to from time to time. The skill-system and leveling is also very interesting. Unlike in most games that include classes like warrior, rogue and wizard: the warrior-class isn't left up to just pure hack 'n slash. Every class has their own special skills and abilities that they can use in combat (and a few skills that can be used out of combat, such as picking locks). It is very much a thinking man's game. The one critical thing that is left to say is that this game is sometimes very strict in how it handles quest-advancement; it is very much a necessity to read the quest descriptions and not simply run from place to place mindlessly. (Fortunately if you get stuck you can go to Spiderwebsoftware's webpages and look up the official forums, there are a lot of thorough FAQs and helpful people willing to answer your questions.) All in all the game is very inspiring and unique, with every map and town hand-crafted by none other than Jeff Vogel himself.5/5, a must buy if you're into isometric RPGs, with a compelling storyline and good combat system.

												While the game doesn't look like much and also won't win any prizes for sound design (I do like the opening theme, though), the gameplay and storytelling is really good.The game is a text-heavy turn-based RPG, in which you control your character and up to two companions and guide them through various lands in hopes to protect the Pact, which is the goal of the inhabitants of the Black Fortress.And not only do you have your typical main quest, but lots of sidequests, which can give you money, valuable items or information, but also might change the outcome of the game, depending on the choices you make.The game starts out pretty easy. You don't have to mind positioning of your character or the use of consumables much, but both becomes more important the more you progress. Especially in the later parts it is vital to use potions, spells and other things at your disposal, unless you want to have a really hard time.As I've said, the game is text-heavy, so you should brace yourself for lots to read. The writing is really good though, even if the graphical represantation of the written isn't.If you don't mind the poor graphics and sound, have no problem with reading and like turn-based RPGs, than this is a game to consider.

												A disappointing turn-based RPG.I heard many great things about Avernum/Geneforge, two game series from the same developer, hence I had high expectations about Avadon. Unfortunately, this game features a really poor writing style, lame character design, terrible graphics, and no music whatsoever.The game world is quite huge. Sadly, this just mean very, very long empty corridors and roads. The RPG elements feature a nice, if very simplified, skill tree, equipment and looting system. You can also recruit a few people in your party which you have full control over them. While the combat is turn-based, the rest of the game plays in real-time.On the bright side, you can solve many encounters through dialogues, instead of fighting them. The game also has a well designed user interface and plenty of tool tips for about everything. Plus, for players who love hoarding stuff, you get to loot absolutely everything in the game, from trash lying on the floor, to bones and flesh from your fallen victims. And if your inventory is full, you can always unload all your trash to your other party members.Despite all my love for turn-based RPG's, I certainly can't recommend this game to anybody.

												An old-school dungeon-crawling RPG focusing on immersive reading and imagination. Don't go to it if you are looking for visual and auditory stimulations or deep character development both in mechanics and narrative, this is not a good game on those. However, it just provides a nice stage for your bold adventure, a medicore curve of settings for your (pre-defined) party to progress within. You, as a part-freelancer and order-enforcer at the same time, are not caught in a web of diplometic conspiracy, but instead trapped in compromised world full of conflicts, under the table. I would recommend this to people who don't mind simple and straight gameplay/content that is not procedurally generated, if exploration is what you really care. As an story-driven RPG, softcore and streamline, all you need to enjoy the game is to ignore the poor presentation of gfx/snd, and to get yourself immersed in, of course.Read before Act, you fool.---Pros:narrativecool backgroundactive journal recordno dialog mazecompanion interaction in dialogtons of garbage for your collectionsatisfying lootCons:need more character creation options for diversityneed bigger chars and better animationslacking of freedom of behaviornot-so-good gameplay balancepoor quest log updatingsomewhat clumsy interfaceNO background music			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Excellent old-school RPG that manages to combine a nice old-school feel without too much hand-holding with a high overall accessibility. For example, there is no quest tracker that tells you what exactly is the next step in each quest, but on the other hand if you carefully read the quest text you are never lost (and there is a log, in case you've missed something).pro:- very nice world and level building; people who like to explore maps in isometric games will greatly enjoy this- decent story with some ok-ish twists; I liked the ending (i.e. my ending; can be very different depending on your choices during the game)- some interesting characters- many areas are visited several times during the main story and then often the location and NPCs' dialogues are affected by events in the main story- good difficulty levels: I played on normal, skipped many smaller side quests (hence a bit underleveled during 2nd half) and did not do any min-maxing; with that approach, the combat was mildly challenging but never tedious or frustrating (with 3 exceptions, see below)- excellent customer support (I had a technical issue which was solved in under 24h)con:- drags out a bit during the last third; 1st playthrough took me 62 hours which I found a bit too long- 2-3 fights towards the end were very frustrating, in one case even after temporarily lowering the difficulty (in some fights my tank was stunned/charmed 90% of the time)Everyone who likes classic computer RPGs in the style of Baldur's Gate and does not mind reading quest and dialogue text should at least give this game a try.

												Anyone fond of RPGs would do well to acquaint themselves with Spiderweb Software. Avadon is a great place to start, or if you're already familiar with another Spiderweb series, it's a nice variation on the formula. That formula, in short: tactical RPGs where battles and exploration occur on the same map, with a vast amount of content, excellent worldbuilding, the freedom to make your own decisions, tons of items, quests, and secrets, and a fine dose of challenge. It's light on graphics, but that almost feels unfair to mention - once you're forty hours into your defense (or betrayal?) of Avadon, it hardly matters, and considering that it really means there's just more time and focus spent on the other areas of the game, I wouldn't have it any other way.As for where Avadon differs from other Spiderweb games: it's more linear (but still with plenty of sidequests) than something like Avernum - rather than traveling through one contiguous world, you discover new map areas one by one and can travel between them conveniently. One of the more interesting features of Avadon is your party itself - you create your own character, selecting from one of four classes, and then meet one representative of each class in Avadon, and generally can choose two of them to adventure with at any one time. This allows for some great character development, as your party members will react in their own ways to the situations in which you find yourself - at times even directly reacting to what the other has said. Between this and the various moral dilemmas you encounter, there's more story here than you can even get in one playthrough.And let's be clear: one playthrough is probably about 50 hours - I just finished at 71, but I'm probably more completionist than most and also tried a few things that I later decided were too difficult to be worth it (*cough* killing Redbeard *cough*). Some might see this as a downside - there are quite a few generic mobs to fight and your responsibilites as a Hand of Avadon lead to you revisiting the same areas (though different parts of the areas) multiple times - but on the whole there's just a lot of content, and a lot of interesting content.Now, it's not perfect. Trying to travel a large distance across a map is tedious, and the level cap feels unnecessarily confining (you have to actually be careful with skill specialization because you only have enough points to get halfway or so to a maxed-out tree). A few too many characters have the same visual models as each other (even major characters) to the point that they cease to feel unique.These are minor issues, though: it's an excellent game overall. Top-notch writing and top-notch design - if you're a fan of Spiderweb, you won't want to miss this one. And if you like RPGs and have never played a Spiderweb game, Avadon is absolutely a worthwhile place to start.EDIT: Updating this to note that I nominated Avadon for the ""Just 5 More Minutes"" award since I'm pretty sure the exact scenario of the award description happened more than once in the course of my playthrough.

												This is a hesitant recommendation and many reviews have been written over the years so I'll keep this very short.There's a great story to be told, but it's held up by some pretty weak mechanics.  Unfortunately, that tends to make the game drag around the three quarters mark.  If you've played other Spiderweb games, you know what you're getting into.  But if you haven't, I don't know if I'd start with this one.			",163,39,0,32,7,0,20

												I love this game so far. I generally like a game when many of the reviews say ""there's too much reading"" and ""the plot is too extensive"" or other similar complaints.  The flavor of this game is old-school, but the gameplay is crisp and the combat math is consistent and fair. Leveling and items are relatively uncomplicated but satisfying. But the lore is already huge. A vast cast of well-written characters spread across the sprawling maps of an enormous world. Many divergent dialogue with different results, and multiple ways to approach quests or tasks.  If you've played some of the older Spiderweb games, know that in terms of graphics and character levelling paradigms Avadon is modern in comparison, but otherwise the overall gameplay is quite similar.

												Not Spiderweb Soft's best work. Not even close. Boss fights can be HORRIBLY unbalanced. Been trying to beat the final guy for over an hour, on the lowest difficulty setting with a max level party and the best weapons/equipment in the game according to what info I can find online. Attacks that did ~80 damage to the previous boss now do at most 14 damage to him. His health bar hasn't moved a single pixel in the last twenty minutes. And the kicker? I've been using the cheat codes every single turn. Pretty much have to, the boss gets 5 actions most turns which he uses to apply conditions to all 3 party members. He keeps magically yanking his own soul out to create golems that make him completely immune to specific types of damage. Have to spend 2-5 turns smashing the golem before being able to touch him and most hits are registering damage in the single digits. Pure frustration.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Although the production values of Avadon are a *bit* low (really really low, my god the sound is cacophony) the game itself surprised me (positively).It is quite some time now that I've encountered a game with ""one more fight/quest/whatever before sleep"" vibe, but Avadon has it. I think it's more or less based on the combat system. It isn't anything new or amazing or complex, but it works. It's turn based, but you your attacks don't miss 3 out of 5 attacks. And you don't see hit chance, so you don't see your 97% hit chance attack to fail. The tempo is nice, it's not too slow. There are only few archetypes of enemies but each and every one of them has a lot of more advanced versions, which is quite nice. There is a nice number of skills and consumables you can use in fight. Using skills depletes your vitality. You have nice pool of it for a mission, but the with the rising number of hard fights, your vitality pool will go down. Your vitality refreshes once you get back from a mission, or you can use consumables. I didn't use them so far, because I like the tension. Is like being in a dungeon in BG, half dead, in desperate need of sleep but there is no place for that. This approach leaves out the boring sleeping part but keep some sort of tension.The item progression in the first 15 hours or so was great, new better items every few minutes. I was waiting for my character to level up so I could use them and I really liked the waiting. And thinking about which one to choose (you can equip only armor with certain weight, it's strength dependent). But after that it slowly crawls to stop.The character progression is really basic. You have four attributes and few active and passive skills. The number of skills isn't a problem, but the prerequisites are a bad idea in my opinion. As far as role playing goes, it leaves a lot to be desired. There aren't many opportunities to form your characters, to make choices. And I've read that the story is good but I don't see how. You are in your base, you'll receive a quest to go somewhere. You are out there for few hours and get back. You'll read few phrases which will ""advance"" the story and then you are out in the field for few more hours. I find it too divided and without any flow.It's certainly a nice game. The 30 hours I've spent in it so far were enjoyable. But it started to be boring and I'm not sure I'll go back to it.I can recommend it. It's certainly a better game than most out there.

												I played this game for a very long time.  Looking back, I'm not totally sure why I continued to play.  I don't remember playing the game with fondness; instead, I remember repetitive, lifeless turn-based gameplay.  Maybe it was just that the amount of games available for Linux at the time was quite limited, and I needed something to pass the time.  Anyway ...Of particular note, I think, is the moment I stopped playing this game.  I'm going to try to talk about that moment with some abstraction, such that it doesn't spoil anything about the game.  In (what I believe is) the last fight in the game, a new dynamic is introduced that none of the other fights in the game even came close to touching upon.  This would have been fine if other fights in the game had other, interesting dynamics, but combat in this game is largely a static affair.  So, when I went into this fight, I expected the fight to follow the same formula as every single other fight in the game.  After a few attempts, I figured out what was going on, and realized that the dynamic that was being used made it nearly impossible to win the fight using my max-level characters.I never played the game again.2/10.

												For supposedly being Jeff Vogel's worst game, it's really good.  I could imagine it being pretty boring on normal difficulty.  But if you crank it up, the combat is extremely strategic (and you can respec in this, which is a feature I always respect, especially in such a high-difficulty RPG).  Some of the bosses are really unique.The plot and setting are pretty good as well.  It's not super compelling, but it makes sense and fits the gameplay better than most RPG plots.  There's a big twist which you don't really see coming but which makes perfect sense in hindsight.  The party members are definitely well-written.			",307,98,1,57,23,2,30

												7/10Avadon is a new series among the games from Spiderweb Software. Unlike the Avernum series, Avadon is not a remake.It shares many similarities to the Avernum games, both in appearance and gameplay, but there are still some differences. For instance, this time you have fixed classes - Blademaster, Shadowwalker, Shaman and Sorceress - rather than being able to fully build your character the way you want, and abilities greatly vary between each class. One other difference is that while battle is still turn-based, when outside battle, enemies and NPCs can move freely (while in Avernum they only move when you do).Each class has their own strenghts and weaknesses, though I personally believe the Shadowwalker stands out as he's able to pick locks, deals good damage, has good defense and good area attacks. The Blademaster is a tanker and melee attacker, the Sorceress is a glass cannon and the Shaman is a mixture of healer, summoner and warlock as she's able to summon creatures, heal/buff allies, curse enemies and deal some damage. And regardless of which character you choose to be your main character, you can recruit NPCs to fill in the missing roles.The game has a good ammount of exploration involved, along with side-quests and even quests specific to certain characters in your party. The story is average - neither bad nor good and a little predictable at times.One thing that has to be said is that this game has one of the hardest boss fights I've ever had to face - not even kidding. Explanation in spoiler tag: basically, as you're fighting the last boss in the game, he'll start to take less and less damage each time until he's barely taking any damage at all, then absolutely no damage at all. You then have to press a button to reveal hidden passages in one of the walls, where you'll find that there are some strange ""vases"" which you need to destroy. They don't move, but they attack if you get too close. For each one of these ""vases"" that are standing, the boss gains damage reduction - with 3 up he takes barely any damage and with 4, he's entirely immune to all damage. So you destroy the vases - except they respawn after some turns... So you have to spend the entire fight dealing with the boss AND these vases. Be ready to use everything you got, it's not an easy fight at all.I still prefer the Avernum series, but Avadon is still a game I'd recommend.			",1998,642,64,205,142,17,217

												Do you miss the old school rpgs? Avadon might be for you then! Its a throw back to the days of Ultima, Baldurs Gate style rpgs, great dialogue and tons of roleplaying, you won't find any dumb downed roleplaying in this game. Jeff Vogel is an old school rpg indie dev that how do you say it... ""keeps it real"" for us geeks that LOVE a good rpg and not a glorified action game.  If you have patience and want an rpg that reminds you of the rpgs we would get years ago, give this game a try.Sure the graphics might not be the most amazing but hey, the gameplay, dialogue and characters are fantastic.

												Boring and soulless cRPG. Even if you like other of Vogel's series (Geneforge and Avernum) you should pass on this game, because it falls short in comparison. If you don't like other Vogel's series, then you'd rather enjoy hitting your balls more than playing Avadon. Annoying combat and interface, huge and empty world, boring dialogues and story. The setting is another fantasy, so I won't even mention how banal and unremarkable it is. Even if you get this game for free, it's not worth your time.			",390,117,27,79,52,1,87

												I played Exile and I liked it. This is no Exile.  I have no idea why I put in 118 hours into this game.  The GoodThe story is interesting.  The BadThe tactics part is horrible.   Enemy shoot through walls.  Things that look like they should block your shot don't .   This is the worse tactical rpg I ever played. The spell/power system is just bad. In most battles you get to use a skill once. Mind you I didn't finish the game after 118 hours so maybe you can use abilites more than once after you hit 119 hours.  Note I know the game is only 45 hours or so.  My play style might have made my characters way overpowered. Still combat was rather boring.There wasn't enough RPG in the game. There were a bunch of times the dialog options were lacking or just didn't matter.  There is no point to having multiple choice questions if 90% of the time the choice doesn't matter.The loot system is very bad. Early on I got some good gear.  I used the same gear for about 95 hours because I never find better stuff.   Most of the loot I find is just junkThe interface is functional but bad. I can't pick something up without it going into my bag. This is a problem when I wanted to put it in my quick slot. I should be able to grab it from the ground and drag it to where I want. I'm done with this sieres but I might play some other spiderweb games.  Like I said I liked Exile.  Go play that or Planescape Torment.   Final Fantsy Tactics is another good one.

												You know what this is? A solid old-school RPG where you get to choose what the hell you do. There are sidequests aplenty. (I'm almost certain I missed a few in my first ~40 hour playthrough.) There are different ways to handle your party members, certain quests, and even the story itself. It has some potent and well-designed optional fights if you want an extra challenge or bragging rights. And best of all, if you do happen to like it? I've been told this is the WEAKEST title from the guy who made it (Yeah, Spiderweb Software is one guy). Give the demo a try if you're on the fence but if you ever liked a Baldur's Gate or any game with fun turn-based grid combat and some freedom to play with quests and events, you'll want in on this.Then go buy Geneforge afterwards because that'll snag you 5 games for $20 and I am in the middle of those now and they really are even better.

												Avadon: The Black Fortress (in 3 hours)The Basics: Isometric top-down RPG Previous Time Spent: 5 minutesExpectation of learning Curve: MediumWhy I bought this: Gushing review from a writer at RockPaperShotgun followed by a steam sale.First Impressions: This game feels a bit like Fallout 1/2 meets a simpler version of Baldur's Gate, with isometric 2d movement of characters through environments, dialogue, hording of stuff(standard videogame RPG kleptomania), and grid based combat. A lot of this felt fairly flat to me, which I'll cover a bit more in the later portions.My 3 Hours with the Game: I began the game by choosing a name and class for my character. I went with Orrin Hatch for a name, and chose a class that I figured was basically a ninja/thief archetype. I was then treated to some basic info about the setting, and sent to a castle to begin my duties. Below is a screenshot showing my character, the inventory, and the approach to said Castle. Upon arriving in the castle, I was blown away by the ability to just wander around, pick up random junk, and engage in brief conversations with people throughout the sprawling grounds. Before long, I was assigned a sort of tutorial dungeon crawl, which entailed going into the castle dungeons, and looking for dangerous escaped prisoners. There, I got to see the way the systems of the game come together for combat, etc. This is an isometic, top down dungeon with tons of stuff. It was fairly fun up to a point, but I found it to break down into mindless backtracking, and easy to forget objectives. The dungeons sprawl a good deal, which is fun from an exploration standpoint, but gets to be a bit tiresome due to the map feature, which merely brings up an overlay. Additionally I found that there was a lot that just didn't land, including dialogue, and inventory management stuff. It took me until hour 2 or so to realize that stuff would fall on the ground, and the method for picking it up is opening the inventory and grabbing stuff from the ground. I'm used to other games, and was too lazy to actually read the manual, so this is on me. Additionally, I found that with dialogue, the writers often seemed to want to tell me things instead of showing me things with the writing. Combat was fairly fun, and felt like taking battles from 3.0/3.5 era D&D, grid and all. Early on, the battles seemed fairly flat and a bit too easy, but as the game progressed a bit, I found a decent variety of monster abilities and tactics that kept stuff interesting. All in all though, I think the combat from other games may have spolied me a bit too much. I kept wanting this to feel as dangerous as Darkest Dungeon or Wasteland 2, but only in one of the many battles I fought did I feel any sense of doom. My highlight:I had the most fun with the game once I made my way out of the castle and it's immediate surroundings and took a portal to Kva, a desert region. There, I had the mission of chatting up a dragon, and dealing with it's goblin/whatever ugly intelligent being problem. There, I felt like I was starting to get a sense of the fairly interesting political situation of the game, and the way a world like this might actually work. Also, as an old Baldur's Gate fan, I definitely enjoyed the sort of adventuring that just comes from wandering around while you have actual missions to complete, stealing stuff, etc. Plus, I got to do some super-tropey D&D style stuff, like killing rats/goblins, and talking to a fairly tiny dragon who lives in a magma chamber.The exploration was fun, and made it clear to me that there's a lot more to this game and story. If it hadn't been for that section, I probably would not be recommending it. But now I can see the potential.My verdict: I don't love this game due to some of the presentation issues and the flat feel, but I could see getting sucked in. I'd give it a qualified recommendation for folks who were very into BG, Fallout 1/2, etc., with the caveat that character creation is far simpler, and there is less of a sense of danger, at least in the portions that I tried. Another plus for this game is that I can imagine it would probably run really well on an older machine, or a laptop without a ton of resources. -JonPS: I won't be reviewing Avadon 2:The Corruption at this time, for fear of spoilers. As a result, the next game on my docket is Betrayer.			",103,22,0,28,7,1,25

												I absolutely love this game, I cannot say enough good things about it. It is just the right level of decision making and character choices without getting bogged down. Graphics are simple and very retro computer game style, which adds charm to the game, rather than relying on them. Seriously this is an amazing rpg, very much so in the realm of Baulders gate, but refined enough that you wont be bored or grinding to get to a better point in the game.

As such I found this game to be in my sweet spot, in that the graphics were simple enough my desktop didn\'t have any troubles, but they were detailed enough to be aesthetically pleasing.One quibble is that having chosen my character class, I found that two of the four helpers were such a natural fit for party balance, I never bothered with the other two.

Even though the character decisions doesn't seem to impact game progress all that much, there are plenty of incentives and hooks that just make you keep exploring it.Overall the game is quite enjoyable.

												As far as old school, Ultima-like RPG's go, this is one of the best. It's very heavy on the dialogue and lore - which, unfortunately, falls a bit short. The questing is ok and the character creation and design is interesting. I can't put my finger on why this isn't a very fun game, and maybe it's just that; I find it slow and boring.5/10 - are you into playing RPG's like you did on your Windows 3.1 or your C64, there's a chance you'll enjoy this. I'll give it another try sometime.			",407,244,7,75,47,3,67

												I do enjoy other Spiderware games. Just this one was Meh. Little to no actual unique customer creation. It feels like a bad mashup between turnbased strategy and diabloesque character skills, which simply left me completely underwhelemed. The skill tree is probably the most obnoxious part of the game, as it forces you to spend a massive number of points on skills your not interested in so you can put a couple points into the next Tier up.

												I really love Jeff Vogel's old Exile/Avernum games in the great sense of open ended exploration. There were secrets areas to stumble on and the game was not afraid of giving you nearly game breaking powers to reward you for making it to the end of that hidden dungeon.The new isometric games on the other hand feel much more constricted and linear. The lack of an explorable world map means you never get a grand scope and end up just completing missions people give you in basically the order they're given. It still gave me that old style RPG fix a bit, but the limited customizability was another strike against this game.As always, the writing is quite good given the large amount of content written.

And 100+h of gameplay.Same thing about the story - It is basically like an interactive book.

Story as well, the further you go - the more epic it will be.There are few moments where I felt things are not as refined as in Avernum series, but there were not that many of them. And In return, it focuses more on your companions for a change. Plus they managed to make it feel different (and maybe a bit simpler?) than Avernum or Geneforge series, so it is not a clone at all. If the previous series made you feel lost or confused, this one is easier to follow, but less open a bit (It does offer more choices though, later on).If you like reading, have good imagination and feel nostalgia towards old classic rpg games, you will love it.Nothing flashy here!

												There's a difference between making nostalgia fuel and deliberately worshipping the worst elements of old-school game design. Hideous UI design, sluggish combat, and a disjointed, nearly nonexistent story all seem to be misguided attempts to revive ""the golden age"" of RPGs. What finally made me give up on it was realizing that the game could repeatedly be crashed to desktop just by trying to open the inventory of a summoned creature. Was this thing debugged? Or is quality control what ruined gaming?			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I have nearly 500 games in my Steam account, and the vast majority of them are still unplayed. So now I'm dedicating an hour to each of these games and writing a series of One Hour Reviews. An hour isn't very long to judge a game on, so think of this as more of a first impression, and take this review in the spirit in which it's given. Be sure to read other reviews from players who have spent more time in the game. One Hour Reviews - Game 13Avadon: The Black FortressPurchase Date: 1/11/2013 I'm always reminded of the old Ultima games whenever I play a Spiderweb game. In a sense, you could call the graphics retro, but not in the pixel art style that you see a number of new games using.  Rather, everything is drawn as a 2D set of tiles, but in an isometric view to give a sense of depth.  The style will feel very familiar to anyone who has played games like Ultima, or the original Fallout.Although the graphics could be called simple, the presentation in Avadon offers a lot of depth.  Rooms contain a lot of small details; pictures hang on the walls, fire-pits burn with animations of smoke rising above, characters wear different styles of clothing.  There's enough repetition to see the game is tile-based, but nothing feels cookie-cutter about the presentation.  Not everything can be interacted with, but Avadon helpfully highlights things of interest when mousing over them.As I start a new game, I get to pick from a set of 4 characters, with each character being a different class.  These classes roughly correspond to the Fighter, Thief, Wizard, and Priest archetypes that I see in most games.  I selected the ""Shadowwalker"" class which is the one most like a thief.  I wasn't able to customize my character at all, except for changing the default name.  After selecting a character, the game asks what difficulty to start with, but this can be changed later in the game.  I decided to go with casual to start with.With my initial selections out of the game, I am presented with the exposition dump explaining my background and current situation.  Whereas newer games would introduce this in the form of cutscenes, Avadon uses a series of static images with text.  If reading a lot of text sounds like a turn off, then I would definitely recommend staying away from this game.  Avadon is a role playing game inspired from a simpler era where not everything was voice acted.  Avadon's story is meant to be read, not heard.  Avadon: The Black Fortress is so named as it is the starting point of the game, where my character is being sent to serve.  After the introduction, I start out in the courtyard, where the game's tutorial of sorts kicks in.  It's not really a formal tutorial, but rather a series of hints displayed at the bottom of the screen.  These hints clarify things like how to move around and interact with people.  The game also provides a mini-map which sits in the top right corner of the screen.  Clicking the Tab key will provide a larger view of the map.  One word of warning, the game will display various modal dialogs, and the map itself is in a little window.  One might expect to be able to move these around, but everything in the UI is static. At the bottom of the screen are a series of icons for performing actions.  The icons on the left are a set of static actions and menu items, while the icons on the right act as hotkeys for slotting spells and items.Soon I am interacting with my first NPC.  Conversations are fairly basic, with a block of text followed by a set of response options.  I get the sense that the conversations aren't very dynamic.  While I had a choice in responses, I suspect other than a slightly different block of text in return, the same thing would happen regardless.  It's highly possible though later in the game the conversations become more dynamic.The game doesn't waste any time getting into the first combat.  Given the presentation in the game, it's no surprise that the combat is turn based, with characters moving around on a grid.  Combat works much like one would expect, with options for a basic attack, using an item, or if playing a spellcaster, the ability to cast spells.  It's all pretty basic and easy to pick up.This brings me to what I appreciate the most about Avadon.  While Avadon wants to emulate the kind of role playing game that came from the 1980s, it manages to do so while remaining completely accessible.  I've gone back and played some older games that have not aged well, not because of simple graphics, but rather the severe level of difficulty and usability issues.  Avadon provides that bit of nostalgia, while remaining a fun game.Avadon isn't a game for everyone, but I definitely appreciate that games like this still get made.  This definitely gets my recommendation.			",404,112,21,134,55,3,62

												No one ever universally upvotes ""Not Recommended"" reviews, cause they want to come here to see others enjoy their game, usually. That being said, I'm not writing for upvotes, I just want to make a few things clear; this isn't the type of game/genre I usually like. I played it shortly, didn't personally enjoy it, and thus, can't recommend it. So why am I writing a review on a game that wasn't made for my tastes? Because I played it, and I'm recording my thoughts.Its audience is likely a niche one, fans of the old-school isometric RPGs of the 90s will feel relatively at home with good graphics, some modern gameplay mechanics, but that's about as far as it goes for me personally. No music, clunky, jerky movement and animation(if any at all). Walls of text constantly pop up in my face, which I wouldn't normally mind except none of it was interesting; the characters, the setting... and the controls just make me feel limited. The premise seemed alright, a fortress feared by all destined to put a stop to a warring world, but lack of customization or character depth led me to find nothing about the game worth being drawn into. While the gameplay itself seems solid, and definitely nails that oldschool RPG, and I give it credit for (i believe) one guy doing it all, Avadon just hit no buttons for me with its lack of atmosphere, characters, story or art.

												I have nearly 500 games in my Steam account, and the vast majority of them are still unplayed. So now I'm dedicating an hour to each of these games and writing a series of One Hour Reviews. An hour isn't very long to judge a game on, so think of this as more of a first impression, and take this review in the spirit in which it's given. Be sure to read other reviews from players who have spent more time in the game. One Hour Reviews - Game 13Avadon: The Black FortressPurchase Date: 1/11/2013 I'm always reminded of the old Ultima games whenever I play a Spiderweb game. In a sense, you could call the graphics retro, but not in the pixel art style that you see a number of new games using.  Rather, everything is drawn as a 2D set of tiles, but in an isometric view to give a sense of depth.  The style will feel very familiar to anyone who has played games like Ultima, or the original Fallout.Although the graphics could be called simple, the presentation in Avadon offers a lot of depth.  Rooms contain a lot of small details; pictures hang on the walls, fire-pits burn with animations of smoke rising above, characters wear different styles of clothing.  There's enough repetition to see the game is tile-based, but nothing feels cookie-cutter about the presentation.  Not everything can be interacted with, but Avadon helpfully highlights things of interest when mousing over them.As I start a new game, I get to pick from a set of 4 characters, with each character being a different class.  These classes roughly correspond to the Fighter, Thief, Wizard, and Priest archetypes that I see in most games.  I selected the ""Shadowwalker"" class which is the one most like a thief.  I wasn't able to customize my character at all, except for changing the default name.  After selecting a character, the game asks what difficulty to start with, but this can be changed later in the game.  I decided to go with casual to start with.With my initial selections out of the game, I am presented with the exposition dump explaining my background and current situation.  Whereas newer games would introduce this in the form of cutscenes, Avadon uses a series of static images with text.  If reading a lot of text sounds like a turn off, then I would definitely recommend staying away from this game.  Avadon is a role playing game inspired from a simpler era where not everything was voice acted.  Avadon's story is meant to be read, not heard.  Avadon: The Black Fortress is so named as it is the starting point of the game, where my character is being sent to serve.  After the introduction, I start out in the courtyard, where the game's tutorial of sorts kicks in.  It's not really a formal tutorial, but rather a series of hints displayed at the bottom of the screen.  These hints clarify things like how to move around and interact with people.  The game also provides a mini-map which sits in the top right corner of the screen.  Clicking the Tab key will provide a larger view of the map.  One word of warning, the game will display various modal dialogs, and the map itself is in a little window.  One might expect to be able to move these around, but everything in the UI is static. At the bottom of the screen are a series of icons for performing actions.  The icons on the left are a set of static actions and menu items, while the icons on the right act as hotkeys for slotting spells and items.Soon I am interacting with my first NPC.  Conversations are fairly basic, with a block of text followed by a set of response options.  I get the sense that the conversations aren't very dynamic.  While I had a choice in responses, I suspect other than a slightly different block of text in return, the same thing would happen regardless.  It's highly possible though later in the game the conversations become more dynamic.The game doesn't waste any time getting into the first combat.  Given the presentation in the game, it's no surprise that the combat is turn based, with characters moving around on a grid.  Combat works much like one would expect, with options for a basic attack, using an item, or if playing a spellcaster, the ability to cast spells.  It's all pretty basic and easy to pick up.This brings me to what I appreciate the most about Avadon.  While Avadon wants to emulate the kind of role playing game that came from the 1980s, it manages to do so while remaining completely accessible.  I've gone back and played some older games that have not aged well, not because of simple graphics, but rather the severe level of difficulty and usability issues.  Avadon provides that bit of nostalgia, while remaining a fun game.Avadon isn't a game for everyone, but I definitely appreciate that games like this still get made.  This definitely gets my recommendation.			",404,112,21,134,55,3,62

												Old school CRPG style game. More than exceptional writing, scripted events, lots of tense battle situations, and plenty of loot. You need to get past the initial part of the game to get to the good stuff, maybe an hour or so of getting your quests and companions, and then you are right in the middle of your first dungeon. I'm enjoying the story and the battle system. The battle system is grid-based, with a certain amount of action points to spend. The trick is learning how to exploit the grid and fight above your level when you get caught in a quest at the wrong time. This sounds like a bad thing, but it's actually a lot of fun when that happens!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is a fantastic turn-based party-oriented single player, story focused, old-school western-style RPG similar to the types of games that came out in the era just before Baldur's Gate (or very similar to BG if you play BG is auto-pause mode). The graphics are a little rough around the edges, but they have a unique charm. The story and choices that you make which have a lasting impact on the story branches available to you is really good. Characterization is not quite as good as, say, Planescape, or DAO, but still pretty good, you do get a feel for your companions and their unique personalities. I am probably only about 10 or 12 hours into this game but I've played it on a few different platforms at the same time, and I can verify that what class you choose and the companions you choose to take along with you can dramatically change the game play and even the story to some extent (choices available to you). I like the skill tree, it makes it so that even if you decide to be a shaman and also take the NPC shaman with you, you won't be carbon copies, you can be two distinctly different types of characters with their own role in the party dynamics. While I have not beat this, I've gotten far enough to easily recommend this to anyone. Besides, there is a free demo if you want to spend an hour or so to see if it is your bag.

												I was skeptical at first, but this is a really neat throwback.  The isometric graphic style reminds me of Ultima Online, but they're way crisper and look really clean.  The game runs smooth.  While the combat is turn-based, you're only stuck in those turns while in combat.  This means that you can wander around exploring and looting in real time but once you close to an enemy's proximity you switch to combat mode.  Even in combat it doesn't get overly complicated, which can be a tad disappointing, but it also allows the combat to be much faster paced than what you'd find in other turn-based combat games.  The storyline is engaging and interesting, and there have been many instances of dialogue that break the mold on RPGs only hours into the game.  No spoilers, but one example I could offer was talking to the warden of a prison and hearing him explain that treating the prisoners humanely and never torturing them was his policy.  There isn't a lot of cookie-cutter copy/paste generic archetype character development in this game, which is extremely refreshing.  I don't know how many RPGs I've started as a kid in a village that leaves to go fishing only to come back and find said village burned down, parents dead, princess / girl next door kidnapped, crystal stolen, etc.  This game makes an attempt to stray away from all of that when it can.  Even the flavor text seen when inspecting NPCs has had a good deal of thought put into it.  Another thing that's truly great is upon entering a new area you'll randomly get a written description akin to the old text-based games that helps flesh things out.I've read that this game is long, and I'm talking Ultima 7 long, which is daunting, even off-putting, but in some ways it's refreshing.  These guys seem to have put their time in and this game feels like it would be right at home on the shelf next to any title in the Ultima series.  Even your NPC buddies that group up with you will randomly stop you to talk about things on their mind, so they don't feel like lifeless dolls filling a job requirement.If I had one gripe, (I'm only allowing myself one because I'm still really early into the game) it would be that the characters don't change outfits when equipping new gear.  From a resource standpoint it makes sense... in a way.  You can have thousands of items and only a few outfit ""classes"" of graphics per each character, which makes sense for games like this made in 3D, but to have absolutely no changes at all in an isometric 2D game is a little disheartening.  Because of this you tend to overlook the icons of the new gear and find yourself only reading the stats, something I hate in an RPG.  I don't like items that boil down to numbers, plain and simple.Overall it's a great buy and a rare find in this day and age where the majority of RPGs concentrate on action and graphics while letting the story slide.  Seeing this game's Steam page initially made me cringe and recoil from the connotation of similarities to all the generic crappy RPG Maker games out there, so I wasn't expecting much, but honestly the more I play this game the more I'm blown away by it.  These devs show that going retro doesn't mean the story goes retro with it.  This isn't some 14 year old kid's weekend project made as a free Android app.Cheers.			",196,68,1,26,18,1,14

												Spiderweb Software has made yet another addictive game.As a long time fan of the original Exile series (and now Avernum series) I was a little nostalgic when I bought this game on sale.I played it, beat it, and felt a little empty inside.The game play is for the most part linear. You -must- complete every quest even if it's only an optional quest; because, there is very little experience to be had in this game. There's no random spawning enemies and that is frustrating. If you're stuck on a level or a boss, necessary to defeat in order to pass, you're ♥♥♥♥ed. There's also far too much walking back and forth in oder to get some of these ""optional"" quests completed. If you're looking for a walking sim with a little bit of action in it this is your game.Still, this game was pretty good. It's quiet similar to the Avernum series so I was left constantly curious if they somehow overlap in universes or something.Would I reccommend you buy this game? Absolutely. But buy it on sale.And don't expect to get alot of game play per hour out of this game, and though the game is set up for multiple play throughs, once you've done it once, the mystery is gone and so is the interest.7/10			",21,7,0,26,7,0,15

												A good throwback to classic top-down, dungeon crawling, table-top rpgs. Utilizes simple mechanics and decent ""old style"" gameplay. However, on that note, Avadon does not bring anything new to the table. It is painfully dull much of the time and remarkably unimaginative in everything save for the intricacies of npc dialogue which are Silmarilion-esque. In summary - play it if it's free or supremely cheap - otherwise, don't bother.			",752,262,10,73,45,7,81

												This is an RPG with skill trees.  Unfortunately it is only single player.  What is really kool is how fast it moves for a turn based.  Your characters move faster then run speed everywhere and when you are just clicking to attack the battles can move fast.  A traditional RPG with hack and slash aspects.  It's a good game.  If it is 5 bucks then get it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Don't be fooled by its close resemblance to a classic Baldur's Gate/Fallout early PC era RPG.  This game confuses narrative depth with bloat, loading every conversation with paragraphs of poorly written and cumbersome dialogue.  The combat is so shallow and unvaried, you'll have experience everything it has to offer halfway through the first dungeon.			",241,71,0,46,21,0,38

												This is truly a classic style, third person, turn based, roll playing game. It is reminisant if the SSI gold box series, similar to Buldar's Gate but not as emursive or has as much freedom in the games story. This game is not perfect but over all it has a very good story with some decision based lines and out comes. In order to complete some quests and parts of the story I did have to use a general game over view guide and codes easly found on the internet. I don't think it is posable to complete the game with out a basic guide or using some codes (even on normal) as the quest system is very simplistic and some of the fights are far too hard(not unlike some of the calssic games). Qusets do not up date on every step so it is sometimes hard to know exactly where to go and what to do. There was an excessive amount of dialog to read in the game. It was great that i could control up to three cahricters at a time even though only one was rolled by me. Over all a good game. If you like turn based RPG's and classic RPG's you should check this game out!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I was hoping for something more akin to the avernum but with a new start. I was disappointed. Avernum exceeds in mechanical complexity (mainly their many skills available) and setting depth. Avadon seems to be lacking in comparison. The skill tree is woefully simplified and uninteresting and the setting isn't as engaging to me. Just pick up one of the newer Avernum games.			",87,55,0,50,14,1,17

												Heyyo,Spiderweb Software have been making CRPG's for longer than I've been into PC gaming... that's a long time. They always do 2D sprites on a 2D isometric or top-down view and their games are always deep with solid RPG mechanics... usually it's just the storyline that changes between their game series, but trust me... if you're into CRPG's? This is a damn fun title to play. So build a party and start slaying some stuff! :)			",466,98,12,57,64,6,85

												This is absolutely one of the biggest disappointments I've  ever  had on Steam.   Please  - check my reviews, I'm no troll.   In fact, this may be my first bad review.  However - this game is a mess. It hangs up, saved games aren't reliable, the screen settings aren't reliable... read the forums. The most posted involve the game bugging and not continuing  (in any of a number of ways/quests).  What's sad ISN'T  that a game has bugs (though for a coding as old as this, it almost is) but that NOTHING is done to alleviate them in the years its been out?  This game is continuing to be sold - they rewrote it for Ipad - and it has the same quest lockups/resolution issues!  I'm sorry to say it  (because  I've TRIED to like this game) but it's not worth it. Look elsewhere.			",20,10,0,20,3,1,12

												A fantastic CRPG that excels in every aspect.  Turn-based, tactical combat that finds a comfortable balance of speed and challenge.  An immense world that rewards exploration and (surprisingly) remains interesting throughout--it never feels repetitive or empty as every corner hides a new discovery and reward.  The characters are beliveable and the choices they offer meaningful--in large part due to the amazing writing which is what really shines the most and ties everything together to create such an awesome, engrossing experience.

												Pretty fun game which is really easy to sink hours into, don´t let the graphics scare you away! Sure, it could be prettier but it doesn´t need to... Because it´s all about the gameplay, which rocks! The way the skills are designed is similar to Neverwinter Nights, but I´d say this system is more fun, as skills are get a cooldown, instead of you having to use one skill and then go to sleep in order to use it again... It forces you to be a bit more conservative but without making the game tedious. Be prepared also to read a lot of text in between (which I see as an interesting choice of design) and make some tough choices that do have an impact on the story and it´s outcome. Who´s side will you take? :-) However, sometimes there´s ALOT of reading where you just go ""aw come on, just get on with it!"" and there´s alot of walking from one place to another, which in some cases can be avoided though planning better, but seems like a waste of time...But overall, a good game which I played to the finishline, and that I recommend you to try out!

												I have this game on my old iPad, and decided I wanted it on my computer as well. I have finished it before.Avadon is an old school RPG, which means two things to keep in mind: 1. the combat is based on strategy, and 2. there's a lot of writing -- the game even describes the scenes you find, to make up for the lacking graphics. I'll elaborate on both of those.The combat. It's turn based, so there's no rush. Take your time, think about your next move if you need to, and be efficient: no going forward to meet an enemy that's coming at you anyway, use that move to attack with your ranged weapon. The enemies are limited, so you won't be able to grind for levels. That said, the levelling system is quite a bit easier than older games of this developer -- there are four very defined classes, and you'll be able to choose your next abilities without too much time spent studying the possibilities and planning, making for a somewhat less stressful experience, in my opinion. Something to keep in mind: bonuses to probabilities make quite a difference.As for the story: that's the focus of the game. You aren't here exclusively to combat enemies or plan the perfect warrior or finish the quest, you're here to read about a world and its characters. If you don't like to read much while you're playing, this isn't a good game for you. The story isn't action-based, either. It's a politically driven story, and your quests involve not saving the world, but keeping an empire stable and functioning. Of course, shades of grey and moral relativity abound. It's also an opportunity to get to know the characters in your party. They are well written and quite fascinating as a whole, representing distinct cultures of the fractured empire.If you're just dipping your feet into this genre, and the story sounds interesting, this is a good game to start and see if you enjoy. If you do like this genre, this is a great story and the strategy is challenging enough. Also to keep in mind is that the whole game was written and coded by a single person, which is quite impressive indeed.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												A solid western RPG with a good leveling and combat system. Monsters and quests are fairly standard RPG fare (rats, dragons, mad wizards), but the overall presentation is done well enough to keep you entertained for a good 20-35 hours if you stick to it. The writing is done well, with your character working to ensure stability in a medieval confederation of nations who hate each other. Its main weak points are the graphics (which I personally don't mind) and the fact that the first two main quests in the game (and in the demo) are the absolute worst that the game has to offer, which will probably turn off a lot of people. It gets much better after that. You won't think to yourself ""wow, this is the best game ever"", but you can have a lot of fun with the game anyway.			",467,153,11,75,48,4,66

												This game is alright I guess.  Grid-style turn based combat, text story, monsters, do jobs for your leader until the sort of obvious plot comes about.  Character skills are pretty normal and generic, as are most enemies.  The story is kind of unexciting as nothing truly interesting happens and the game hints at just about everthing right from the start.  This game isn't BAD by any regard, there's just nothing to wow, entertain, or surprise in any aspect of it (aesthetic, story, gameplay).On the other hand, the game is thankfully lacking in serious flaw.  No respec can slightly screw you over but you can just cheat for that, and the game lets the player be smart with stacked upgrades and things (dodge chance, for example).  Only a few optional bossfights are truly hard (played on Normal difficulty), although the problem is that this is often due to RNG deciding whether or not the boss wants to 1 shot a party member.This came out on iPad first apparently?  Not bad for a mobile market littered with awful games, especially with its VERY impressive 40hr+ length!  But on PC you probably have other things to play.  Pass unless you want a loy-key RPG to pass some time with.			",278,109,4,59,8,3,22

												A fairly good game for what it is - a somewhat ""old-school"" style RPG. The previous game, which was the end to a series, Avernum, was EXCELLENT. The ""demo,"" if it could be called that, let me play about 15 hours in before asking to purchase, and I was well sold. This game, Avadon, is the start of a new series/story as far as I understand it, and is built on a lot of the same systems. They pulled away from race/class and moved to new/unique classes and some premade characters and interactions, but altogether the game, and their previous games, are well written and enjoyable for what they are - classic PC RPG.

I've been playing games from this developer for ten years and I've loved them all. You can notice the developers' distinct style in this game right away. The difference is that this game 1-ups them all. If you like this, check out the Geneforge or Avernum series which are also on Steam now. **TONS** of gameplay for cheap.			",208,94,0,53,10,0,24

												Avadon is a great game initially which quickly becomes a complete chore. Quests stack up and become really tough to manage, it's difficult to find NPC's once you've completed a quest (in a really huge map), quest journals don't update properly when you've completed a quest, etc. It's a massive, massive game with a lot of potential. Hopefully Avadon 2 is better...			",58,18,1,9,8,0,6

												Another great Spiderweb Software release. Graphics are very simple/sober as usual, and there is no music, so you need to like CRPGs and use your own immagination to truly enjoy this.BUT the story is great (IMHO better than Avernum: Escape from the Pit), you'll be immersed in a very well designed and written world, and you will be asked to take a lot of decisions which will influence the ending of the game. Compared with Avernum, you will have a party made of your own character as well as predesigned characters with their own background (so this is a bit more like Baldur's Gate games, while Avernum is more akin to Icewind Dale).Sinnce storytelling is what I look for in a game, I'd definitely recommend Avadon to diehard CRPGs fans.

												Indeed great game but hard to navigate, you'll be doing alot of backtracking back and forth to NPC that allready gave you quests before and the maps are huge and empty. Quests and random doors that once were closed, activate after a certain point and you're not allways aware of it. You can't make your own notes on the map either.Some ppl consider the hirelings ""a breath of fresh air"" but you'll have to switch their gears and lose on the customisation. Then it's easy enough that doesn't really matter what your party looks like. at least 6h in, of which 4h were exploring the cities.So if Avernum 6 was 10/10 and played it 3 times, this one should get an 8/10.

												This game here was one of my first isometric, classic style RPGs. I guess you can say it opened the floodgates for a whole other realm of RPG gaming (hours have been lost, with even more still to vanish; time well spent!) at the time I was still being a great fan of RPGs all around (got heaps of them, even more now!!!), I picked up Avadon with caution, knowing that for it's price it wouldn't be a graphic breaking game.I'd never even played a Spiderweb Software game either, for that matter, and it was an interesting experience. The first thing I was surprised about was the epic soundtrack at the start. Unfortunately, this epic piece is the only real piece of sound in the game, plus some old audio files of swords swinging and animals growling, etc. The first mission sets off the story well, and so far, having not completed it yet, it is a good story. The graphics, as stated earlier, are nothing to go around shouting about. But they get the job done, and the writing is excellent, and though perhaps slightly less words are needed to state what exactly is going on, it feels mostly spot on. Even the side missions are fleshed out. They aren't (from my experience) about going around *kill X giant dingbats* and return to quest giver. The people have real problems. Unfortunately, with said problems, come in game problems. The journal system is very poor, and records barely anything except the beginning and end of a quest. This becomes infuriating as many people ask you for help, and you jot down things in your journal, and eventually you become lost as what to do next, when you are part-way through one quest and stop to do another close by. The combat is fine, with just the right amount of weaker foes spread between harder fights and opponents. It's a turn based, grid battle, but the grids need to be larger, as I clicked on the wrong thing, meaning a character fell in battle. All in all, this game is recommended. If you are undecided, try out the demo. If you are a fan of RPGs, I am telling you now, this is a great game.			",68,15,0,36,9,0,20

												I love me some Spiderweb Software, and the Avadon franchise is shaping up to be just what I signed up for all those years ago. As always, the graphics aren't a stellar explosion of high-res textures and models, and the gameplay is nothing revolutionary, but that's not why you play a Spiderweb game.Here's why you DO play a Spiderweb game, and this one in particular: thought-provoking story. You are a newly minted Hand of Avadon, sort of a fantasy-RPG FBI agent, who shows up at the eponymous Black Fortress immediately after the first- and only- successful attack on the institution itself. As the story progresses, you have to navigate a story that pokes at the idea of absolute power, government surveillance, bureaucratic corruption, diplomacy, and the Big Question: ""How much security do you give up in the pursuit of safety?""Also, you hit things with your sword. I guess.10/10.			",57,21,0,40,12,1,7

It is a slow paced game, but that's what I was looking for, and maybe you are too.			",2,0,3,6,5,0,4

However, as it looks like it's from the early 90s, it also plays like it's from the early 90s and if you're looking for a classic old-schoolish PC RPG, it's actually pretty good.  The writing is decent and the turn-based combat is a welcome change from today's more fast-paced whack-a-thon.Despite the look of the game, there's a lot of meat to be found on its bones, and to be fair, at least the backdrops and character portriats look pretty good.

												Surprisingly deep and engaging for something that look so simple - abandon all hope of shiny graphics ye who enter here. Yet, the setting, plot, characters, and ability to be as straight-laced or ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ly as you please (which affects NPC reactions, plot threads, and endings) make this, frankly, addictive.

												Good old style RPG.  A lot of reviews complained about confusion over tracking/turning in/completing quests.  This is not a problem if you take notes and draw maps and just pay attention to what you are doing in general.  Yes, this is the way we used to do things before the modern day mechanic of markers pointing you towards quest objectives or where to turn in completed quests.  There are also no indicators that tell when quests are available or who will give you quests so you will need to talk to various NPCs as you level to find out when new quests are available.  Again, this is the way it was done back in the day.  So if you like your RPG experience spoon fed to you, look elsewhere.  If you like having to pay attention and do a little work in your RPGs (as I do) then this is a game worth giving a shot.			",333,70,4,74,29,2,66

												Fun party-based single-player strategy RPG. A little too focused on forced-choice situations, but most RPGs have that problem these days.			",233,52,1,98,11,0,54

												Avadon is a VERY good classic D&D-esque RPG from the good old days of Baldur's Gate, which any fan (or hell, just anybody who thinks that they might enjoy the genre) of the classics should definately buy ASAP, as $10 is not nearly the appropriate price for a game like this one.

												(I've just bought this game. I'll update this recommendation when I've actually PLAYED it...)This is one for the old-school western RPG players out there. If you remember Ultima, for example. I've been playing this guy's games since before there was an Internet... perhaps not that long, but early 90's, when I was a spotty teen and bought the game by sending a letter with my credit card number to Seattle. Got my shareware registration key via return mail. That game was ""Exile: Escape from the Pit"", a game which the author remade in 2000, and is re-remaking in 2012...These games normally cost US$25, give or take. Valve convinced him to sell the Steam edition for US$10. At that price, you gotta buy.			",119,26,4,22,15,1,29
