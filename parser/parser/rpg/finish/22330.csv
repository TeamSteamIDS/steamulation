												Okay, where to start. I figured that there was no need for me to review this game as it is so successful, but, as always, All the Steam reviews on the front of the store page are one to two sentenced jokes instead of something actually helpful. Please thumbs-up this, if you like this review, for visibility.The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion is the sequel to the critically acclaimed The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind. Knowledge of prior storylines are not needed to enjoy Oblivion, though a working understanding of TES world lore will always enhance your experience in any of The Elder Scrolls games. A good idea is to just read some of the in-game books, from time to time, as you play the game. Some of the fictional books are amazing little detours from the game world. Oblivion and Morrowind are less fantasy experience and more-so a virtual world that you live in. With mods, this experience feels more real to me than some of the Dungeons and Dragons campaigns I've played. It's incredibly easy to get immersed into this work.Oblivion's main story leaves some to be desired. You are a prisoner who meets the Emperor (voiced by Patrick Stewart) and his guards as he flees a rumored assassination attempt through hidden tunnels in the Imperial City prison. Suffice it to say, that its' not really a spoiler that you witness the Emperor's assassination. Before the Emperor's death, he tells you that you are fated by the gods to save the Empire and ""close shut the jaws of Oblivion"". Long story short, you flee the tunnels and are sent to track down the Emperor's last remaining illegitimate heir (voiced by Sean Bean) as well as pretty much single-handedly repel the invasion of Daedra from Mehrunes Dagon’s hellish plane of Oblivion.However, in classic Elder Scrolls fashion, the main quest isn’t even the largest part of the game. The entire Imperial province of Cyrodiil is open to you for exploration. There are many guilds to join, whether or not you want to be a mercenary, a mage, a thief, an assassin, or a holy crusader. There is an abundance of miscellaneous side and freeform quests for you to do. I recommend the purchase of a strategy guide, not so that you’ll have a walkthrough, but because you’ll need some way to keep track of where everything is! There are many quests and areas that you will miss if you don’t scour the world for them. You can easily spend around 350 hours if you finish all of the main, side, and faction quests as well as the DLC. Many people just wander across the world, not even touching the main story.The mechanics have long been applauded as an improvement over Morrowind, level scaling aside. Morrowind offers a better story and atmosphere, while Oblivion offers a more modern experience. The graphics are a bit dated by today’s standards, but I still sometimes catch myself stunned by the beauty of Cyrodiil. Skills are a lot more streamlined than Morrowind, which I consider a negative trait, although it does make the game friendlier to newcomers. Combat is not as bad as so many people claim. To me, it really feels like I’m actually swinging the sword. The magic system is a lot simpler than Morrowind’s but a lot easier to use. It is not as good as Skyrim’s magic system, but still useful.The DLC The Knights of the Nine and The Shivering Isles far trump Oblivion’s main quest. Knights of the Nine puts on a holy crusade to fight against Umariil the Unfeathered, an ancient Ayleid elf who has come to try to enslave men once more. The Shivering Isles sends you to the frankly breathtaking realm of Sheogorath, the Daedric  “Mad God”. Most of the dialogue in The Shivering Isles will have you chuckling to yourself and smiling. And the atmosphere of the realm brings nostalgia from Morrowind to mind.Now, I am going to discuss mods. Oblivion’s modding scene is unparalleled by Morrowind or Skyrim. There are enormous overhaul mods, plenty of lore friendly stories, and enthralling and immersive stories and factions. You can even reach an added five or six hundred more hours if you play through some quality mods. Morroblivion, brings the entire landmass of the previous game, Morrowind, as well as all of it’s quests, items, NPCs, creatures, etc. You can then travel between the two provinces with your same character. Other mods add some of the other provinces from Tamriel. And a few mods have been so well rated that they’ve become known as unofficial expansion packs.Oblivion is an astounding RPG that will draw you in and stick with you for a long, long time. The replayability of Oblivion is excellent. The game was released eight years ago and I am still playing it to this day. You will not regret buying this game. Get the Deluxe pack for $25 that comes with all the DLC, themed player lairs, and, yes, even horse armor. It is well worth the price and you will get your money’s worth over and over again.

												I made a Khajit and he could punch stuff. I leveled up punching stuff, running places, and jumping to their maximum level but when I went to the arena I had trouble. I easily defeated my opponents by punching them until they could no longer stand up, then continuing to punch them as they lay bloody on the arena's dirt floor. I heard the crowd roaring as my fists crashed into the Grey Orc's skull; I felt their love wash over me like a crimson silk gown. Slowly, after the vampire scum gave out his last breath, I walked out of the arena. Not in triumph, not in victory, but in remorse. I had just punched my way through a dozen or more skulls, and for what? In my agony I gloomily set up at the The Bloated Float Inn, located in the Imperial City's Waterfront District. I woke up to the sounds of rustling, was confronted by a clearly beligerant bandit. The man had no idea I was the Arena Champion, he had not heard how I crushed the skulls of countless enemies with my punching, how I jumped clear over them with little effort, or even how I ran circles around the arena dodging every single attack thrown at me before pummeling my opponents into submission. The very idea of the man standing before me, a person unknowing of my athletic prowess, set me in to an uncontrollable rage. I don't recall what happened over then next ten minutes, but my memory picks back up again standing inside of the Inn owner's cabin covered head to toe in blood. I navigated back through the ship, which now more resembled a slaughter house, to try to find someone who could tell me what happened. Located in the messhall I found a naked shivering woman named Selene. I will never forget the look on her face when I approached her, a visage of fear so vivid the viewer can feel it. It was then I realized what event must had befallen the denizens of The Bloated Float Inn. The ingorance of that would-be bandit set me into a blood fueled rage. I slaughtered every person aboard the ship for his sin, that is, every person save for this trembling woman. I decided then and there to never use my fists again, I set off from the boat, WHICH HADN'T LEFT THE HARBOR, to embark on a pilgrimage. One that would encapsulate all nine divine shrines and eventually lead an unwilling khajit boxer to defeat the ancient Aylied king Umaril using only Talk good skill, run fast skill, and jump high skill. After defeating such an awesome foe I came to the conclusion that one need not fight with his fists to attain his goals. Through the use of hecka convincing words, speedy feet, and super strong legs, anyone can stamp out evil without ever lifting a finger.Oblivion taught me the greatest lesson of all, that fighting is evil.

												If you've just played Skyrim, then this is a much more 'Elder Scrolls-y' experience. It's not as pretty and some of the controls are odd, and yet it utterly trancends such things. If Skyrim's about exploring, Oblivion's about questing. The land is mostly just trees but the missions are much more varied and some are very well written. Especially for the Dark Brotherhood. This is one of the best deals on steam at any sale price. Thoroughly reccomended.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Lets compare this game with skyrim.1. Does Skyrim have an arena that you can compete or gamble in? No.2. Does Skyrim let you make your own spells? No.3. Does Skyrim have a quest about finding stolen potatos? No.4. Does Skyrim have a portal that leads to a realm made of lava and fire? No.5. Does Skyrim have an entire dlc about a mad god who gives you cheese? No.6. ""Stop right there criminal scum!""Now get this game... And close shut the jaws of Oblivion.			",20,5,0,18,5,0,7

												While people complain that the Elder Scroll games can be quite bland and you play an expressionless psychopath mass murdering your way to the top of society, Oblivion is a sterling example of one of my favourite things about PC gaming - mods.   I have hundreds from total conversions to one that adds little street cats that wander around looking cute.  Oblivion really captures the DIY aspect of PC gaming I love in a shiny giant studio package, allowing me to change almost anything i don't like about vanilla.  Unlike console people, to merely review and make judgements based on vanilla is to miss the beauty of PC gaming.  It's that kind of community that keeps an aging game fresh interesting and addictive.As far as the extras in the GOTY go, whether you care about player houses shapes much of  the DLC, Mehrune's Razor quest is a large dungeon, nothing mind blowing if you play with Lost Spires mod, but some very shiny loot.  The Knights of the Nine was a fairly straight-forward quest, would call it a good DLC rather than an expansion pack as such.  However although you have to seriously stab someone at the end, at least some of the quests have variety in what you have to do a bit.  However Shivering Isles makes this edition worth your money imo.  It adds some much needed oddness to the game, the kind of thing where you pause to think 'wtf is that?' as some creature shuffles or leaps towards you.  Without getting into the whole 'which elder scrolls is best', one thing i felt was Oblivion and Skyrim settled with standard pseudo-medieval europe fantasy world, whereas Morrowind felt quite alien, but with it's own culture to be read about and discovered.  Shivering Isles brings that to Oblivion.  The books are a delight, and it's nice to experience a daedric realm aside from the Deadlands (which while fun, never felt like a place people lived).  All in all and bearing in mind what i said about the still quite vital mod community, I totally recommend you buy this game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I've noticed that the reviews for Morrowind, Oblivion, and Skyrim tend to be about why that game is the best Elder Scrolls game and the others are terrible in comparison. I really enjoy all three of them (sorry, Arena and Daggerfall, you're just not very enjoyable by today's standards), so I figured I'll give reviews for each that focus on what's unique about each of them, and what kind of players that will appeal to.Oblivion was my first Elder Scrolls game (and my first open-world RPG in general), so it has a special place in my heart. Anytime I hear that music come up when I launch the game, it brings back all sorts of emotions and wonderful feelings related to discovering a whole new type of game that I thoroughly enjoy. As good as the music in Morrowind was, Oblivion's music is even better for me (both are better than Skyrim's).For positives, let's start with Oblivion being the most deliberate of the three games. What I mean by that is that things are the most contained and orderly in Oblivion. You don't ""accidentally"" do anything in this game, as opposed to Morrowind and even Skyrim to a degree. Leveling up is slower in Oblivion, and so you don't race through anything. It gives you plenty of time to savor everything. You don't start a new game and find yourself pimped out with super powerful gear or spells a couple hours later. The landscape is also fairly contained, with each region and city being unique in its own right, while not having any drastic changes. The most extreme the landscape gets (besides when you are transported to the hellish realm of Oblivion or the DLC that sends you to the Shivering Isles) is some snowy mountains in the north. And for this game, that works perfectly. You are in Cyrodiil, the center of the empire, and therefore the most refined. The somewhat subdued landscape fits into that perfectly. Compared to Morrowind and Skyrim, this game world is neat, orderly, and prim and proper. It makes you form an emotional attachment to the game, since you focus less on the landscape and more on people and feelings, while still enjoying beautiful scenery. And when you get to the Shivering Isles DLC, you're well versed in forming those emotional attachments, while now having some very bizarre and magnificent scenery to add to your playing experience.The biggest positive of Oblivion (for me) is one of the most pleasant surprises in the entire series. My single favorite thing in any TES game is what would seem to be some relatively minor DLC from this game. There are four distinct castles, lairs, caves, and towers available through the DLC. Each is geared towards a specific playstyle (warrior, assassin, thief, mage). There are all sorts of things available for each, and some questlines regarding them. I find myself spending a lot of time doing those quests and getting enough money to afford the upgrades, some of which are incredibly useful (alchemy ingredient gardens, a pirate crew that goes out and plunders for you every week, a dark shrine to Sithis that grants you potent powers based on your infamy, etc.). There are also unique items in each. Basically, they are the greatest player homes in any TES game, and they're official content, not mods. For the negatives of this game, we will actually revisit some of the positives I mentioned. It's slower than the others, which can sometimes make you feel bogged down. It's polished, nice, and orderly, but sometimes you want something more wild and rugged. Think of it as the difference between living in a nice suburb and living in a cabin in the Rocky Mountains.  There's not really anything wrong with this game, but it always stays in the safe zone. There are no glaring errors, but its peak is lower than the other games. Basically, Oblivion is content with always hitting singles or doubles, so that means that there are no strikeouts, but also no homeruns. Oblivion will disappoint you the least often of any of the three games, but also won't take your breath away like Morrowind or Skyrim does occasionally.			",13,5,0,12,13,0,14

												Bam. You're a prisoner. Then what? Oh, its just PICARD TELLING YOU YOU'RE IN HIS DREAMS. SECRET. PASSAGE. HE DIES (OH NOES) TAKE THIS SEXY AMULET. GET OUT OF THE SEWERS. EXPLORE FOR 100+ HOURS.Well, you can already tell this game will be incredible. But seriously, this game starts off very strong. You're a prisoner, with your crimes unknown to you. As long as you don't abuse the character creator (hehe...) you'll be able to mold your ideal elf, human, or orc... or cat... or lizard. But yes, many great awesome things happen in the first few minutes within the game. You may think the game is linear... until you exit that sewer. ""Can I go anywhere?"" ""Can I follow this road?"" ""I want that horse. Can I steal it?"" The answer to all this is a glorious ""yes"". Oblivion is at it's best when you're wondering along the vast land of Cyrodiil, exploring multiple dungeons, mines, and towns. Oblivion is outdated, but still pulls you into the world.Quests are great. Some surpass Skyrim's as far as story goes. (The Thieves’ Guild quest line is so much better.) There are both your typical quests with markers, and a well mix of a few. Ranging from some puzzle solving, to even being a detective, it'll keep you entertained. Help out a town by shutting down an Oblivion Gate (which furthers the main story), and now you can buy a house there, and buy upgrades for it, just for playing the main quest. Kill an innocent person, and have a very unique visitor appear, and follow a very dark path. Either way you'll be getting into all sorts of crazy situations, and it'll be a delight. Gameplay is more complex than Skyrim, yet not quite like Morrowind's. I consider it a perfect balance, as its tough, but very rewarding. If you're a weakling, maybe you shouldn't steal that horse just yet. Oblivion in a way pushes you to a certain type of major, as if you’re taking college classes. Keep shooting that bow, and you'll advance specially in that skill set, and use your experience to further develop this. But if you pull out a sword after not using it for three levels, well you might want to rethink what you're doing. It’s not hard, but the game defiantly wants to pick one type of combat and stick with it. This is fine to me, as I love dedicating my character to a specific type of combat. If I want to be good with a sword, and have some good magical ability as a side dish, I can do that. It'll just take time.This game probably has the greatest DLC ever. The horse armor has so much value... well not really THAT specific DLC, but Shivering Isles is a MUST HAVE. You're getting another free game when you purchase this. Knights of the Nine is harder to get access to due to the slow leveling progress, but is also pretty great. Get GOTYDeluxe, its worth the extra $5, you penny pincher. Mods, mods everywhere as well. There are some greats ones. In fact, this game taught me how to mod. I might of ruined my first save file(s) tough doing that, so be warned; there's no silky Steam Workshop bed waiting for you upstairs. You must use either your brain, or a Mod Manager application. For those complaining that it isn't working on Windows 7; The Steam (digital) version seems to work fine, and there's a mod called ""Unofficial Oblivion Patch"" which solves many conflicts and errors, and is stupidly simple to install. Get the latest version patched for your game as well. In fact, before even launching the game, you might want to do all these things I've mentioned. Also have the latest video drivers installed (derp).Oblivion may be old, but you shouldn't stick your nose up at it. It's great, and will always be great.			",164,11,2,11,17,0,6

												When I was 8 years old, my dad pre ordered the original oblivion on Xbox 360 for me. At the time I knew nothing about the game, he just thought it would be fun for me to play as a knight ♥♥♥♥ing♥♥♥♥♥♥up doing hoodrat elder scrolls stuff. I had never played morrowind or daggerfall, but the second I made my character I was hooked. I played oblivion religiously, collecting the official game guide, multiple physical maps of tamriel, and I even kept journals of all of my quests and wrote in the first person as my character. I would then go to school and share these journals with my friends who also had the game and who also wrote their own adventures down. It became a sort of 'guild' group if you will.Time went on and Skyrim came out in 2011 when I was in junior high, thus causing me to forget about oblivion and move on as the dragonborn. But just recently I was going through some of my closets getting rid of old junk I had been hoarding, and I came across a stack of about fifteen books hidden underneath some blankets and boxes. They were my oblivion journals. Frantically I plugged in my xbox, located the game, and fired that♥♥♥♥♥♥up. My heart sunk when I realized the disk had been scratched long ago. So I went on to steam and saw that the game of the year adition was available for a rather cheap price. When I was younger I never even knew about the DLC because I was so lost in exploring and creating my own stories for my character.Today, as an 18 year old, getting ready to move out of my house, I can tell you that the extensive world of Oblivion is much bigger than I ever remembered it to be.And to this day, the music that plays when I  treck across the land still brings joy to my heart. Please play this game and download it's DLC. It is a near perfect gaming experience filled with lor and action. 100/10 would be an elementary school dweeb because of this game again.

												Ah, Oblivion. What can I say about this amazing game that hasn't already been said? Now you may be wondering, ""Why is this guy writing a review when he doesn't even have 10 hours?"" I have played well over 400 hours of the game on my Xbox 360. If you started the Elder Scrolls with Skyrim, Oblivion and Morrowind may be hard to get used to. Pros-Okay graphics, considering the time it was released-Great story-Awesome spell crafting feature, and swordplay-Mods!-MUCH easier to learn and get into compared to MorrowindCons-Ugly characters-Some glitches Bethesda never patched-Oblivion gates can sometimes be confusingOverall, Oblivion is a great game, and I would reccomend it for anyone who wants to play an Elder Scrolls game. Personally, I never liked Morrowind (I own the GOTY edition on disc) but I played the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of this one. Mods have added tons of replayability to this game, and they have kept me hooked to this day. Thank you for reading my review, and have a nice day,			",86,10,0,15,2,0,10

												So, I bought Skyrim during a sale, played it the rest of the week, loved it. After much more hours, wanted to check out Oblivion, because I couln't get enough of the great series. I have 10 reasons for buying this piece of art:1/10: Get jumpscared by kahjiit who was hiding in a bush2/10: Disarm a deadra while having a sword duel and watch him run downhill chasing his fallen mace3/10: (almost) no racist people4/10: You can wield a sword and shield and heal yourself with a spell without the need of switching5/10: The game counts the amount of jokes you have made6/10: Epic battles in the sky above a giant wheel (the imperial city)7/10: You can actually place objects in your house wich you can move somewhat normal, and they don't teleport back when you leave8/10: Freedom as a mage to spell your own way (well except for some arts then)9/10: Get jumpscared by a village of invisible people10/10: THE. GUARDS. ARE. NOT. COMPLETE. ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥S.Anyway, if you loved Skyrim, you will love Oblivion, and probably even more. The slightly older graphics might be a setback for some, but after a while you feel perfectly comfortable with them. Just let your wallet fly to your pc and dive into hours of dungeons, cities, sigil keeps and joke-telling.			",112,27,0,15,15,2,9

												First of all, if your question is ""Should I buy this game, period?"", my answer is simply: Yes.If your question is ""Should I buy this game, or skyrim?"" the answer's a bit more complex. I would not say either one is better, but they're two different tastes, like vanilla and chocolate.In this case, I would say Oblivion is the vanilla. If you're looking for a straight-up, classic medieval fantasy, Oblivion might be more your thing than Skyrim, which is ""themed"" around the viking-style Nords. Likewise, Oblivion has the default fantasy setting of castles and forests and rolling green plains, where Skyrim is, again, Nordic themed, and focused mostly on mountains and snow.Because of that, and some differences in art styles, Skyrim and Oblivion look very different, to the point where I would almost say that might be the deciding factor in which game is right for you. Skyrim is very much a modern game, with fairly realistic art, and that includes the recent trend of realistic games to be primarily brown and gray. Oblivion, on the other hand, is vibrant and colorful, and perhaps a bit stylized. If you are longing for a colorful first person fantasy game, Oblivion is for you (if you're looking for a sidescroller, I'd recommend Trine). If you've been wading through the Real-Is-Brown trend, the sheer vibrance of Oblivion can be a real breath of fresh air.As for gameplay, the two games are relatively similar. I personally prefer the spellcasting setup in Oblivion over that in Skyrim - in Oblivion, you equip spells in their own slot, rather than in a hand (which could instead be holding a weapon), whereas Skyrim just treats spells like a sword that has to be put in one of your hands. Speaking of which, you cannot dual wield in this game. If you want to play a classic sword-and-shield knight, this particular difference in mechanics is more or less irrelevant, except that it's easier in Oblivion to cast the occasional healing spell.Furthermore, Oblivion offers a much greater degree of freedom in spellcasting than Skyrim. You can create your own spells by adding effects and designating whether the spell is a projectile, area of effect, etc. Enchanting and Alchemy are slightly more complex than in Skyrim, as well. If you like playing spellcasters, I'd say Oblivion is probably a better choice than Skyrim, which has you simply pick from pre-determined spells, and has a far more limited alchemy and enchanting system.The biggest mechanical difference is the level up system. Without a doubt, Skyrim's level up system is more user friendly and intuitive. It might be a little more friendly to those who want to play these games casually, where Oblivion requires a little more care, planning, and effort. In Skyrim, you level up your skills as you use them, and after you've increased any combination of skills by a certain amount, you can go up a character level (on the spot, even). When you do, you increase one of your three stats (yes, only three: health, mana, stamina), and pick a talent tree to put a talent point in, which gives you bonuses - with different talent slots unlocking as you raise the respective skill. In Oblivion it is completely different. For one thing, you have several stats, each tied to three skills. The number of times you level any combination of skills attached to a given stat affects how much you could POTENTIALLY increase that stat by when you level up (and if you dont' get those +5s, you will find that the game swiftly outlevels you). By the way, you only level up when you raise ten points in any combination of your class's seven major skills, and only when you sleep. Skyrim has no classes, and therefore no major skills. This makes Skyrim's character-building system a little bit more freeform, as you can, if you want, change directions as you go, if you decide you don't like a particular aspect. Oblivion allows you to create a custom class, but you're basically stuck with that choice after you finish the tutorial.In short, Skyrim has a simpler, more intuitive, more fluid leveling dynamic, good for building your character as you go according to what feels natural, while Oblivion might be better for those who like to plan or min-max, and requires a bit more thinking ahead.I should also mention that on certain computer systems, the music in this game may not work. It certainly doesn't work on my system, but otherwise the game runs just fine. From what I understand this is an issue with the CODECs and may be related to Windows 7.One other thing I think is important to mention is that this game, despite being a fantasy, is surprisingly arachniphobe friendly. As someone with arachniphobia, I find it hard to deal with how ubiquitous giant spiders are in fantasy games. Skyrim's spiders are particularly horrifying. But Oblivion has no (true) spiders at all. It does have the Spider Daedra, which are essentially spider-centaurs, but I didn't find them particularly phobia-triggering. They're also very rare outside of the oblivion gates, so you won't often find yourself being jumped by one unexpectedly. If you are an arachniphobe looking for a fantasy game, I HIGHLY recommend Oblivion, especially if you're comparing it to Skyrim.Also, this game has Martin Septim.That's reason enough to buy it.

												Oblivion, in my opinion, is the best game of all time. It gets a bad reputation among fans of other elder scrolls games, you see the argument that Morrowind is the game for patient players that can enjoy an older game, and skyrim is this big new awesome RPG, and so Oblivion is seen as some weird spot in the middle of the two. Yet I repeat, oblivion is the best game I have ever played. Many Morrowind players dislike Oblivion with the argument that it is less inclusive and immersive than Morrowind. But then why is Skyrim the only game on par with Morrowind? Skyrim, the game with less weapon types, the game with the worst alchemy, the game with the worst magic? Skyrim's graphics barely surpass the incredibly captured beauty of Cyrodil, and they had five years to make skyrim. They had four to make Oblivion, and your blind grandma could easily tell the difference between that and Morrowind graphically. The gameplay was also a complete overhaul from morrowind to oblivion. People talk about how Morrowind's or Skyrim's fighting systems are so much better, with Morrowind's realistic feel that you have to be good with the weapon type or you will be awful, or with skyrim's realistic feeling combat but Oblivion completely build anew the combat system of morrowind, made it insanely more realistic, and remains the only game in the series that you can have a sword, shield, and spell at the same time. From Morrowind to skyrim each game got easier. Morrowind is the most difficult of the three, with no quest markers on a compass, and no advice or help whatsoever. But when I went to play skyrim it was the easiest thing in the world. Anyone can take a nord with a battleaxe and beat the game. Oblivion is in the middle. Oblivion isn't like the insane difficulty of morrowind, showing how hard each quest would be were you actually to do it in real life and record the words that someone said to find a secret location. Oblivion helps you, but is not easy. The game has an easier start, but if you can remain powerful past level 30, that's when you know you're good. Skyrim is just always easy. Progress through oblivion is kind of like progress through life. The lower your level, the less you have to worry. But as you grow into the game it takes constant effort and maintenance to remain successful. In oblivion you have to have a gameplan. Will you be a thief that goes around and gets rich to make sure they have the best equipment in the game, and talks your way out of hard situations? Will you be the the brute warrior that relies on lots of stamina and power to take down less physically gifted enemies? Or will you be my personal favorite, the mage that can go about every situation in a million different ways? Sure, you can mesh these things to any degree, but the point is that if you don't go about it correctly with skills that make sense together or you use the wrong race, you won't be successful later on.You could go on forever about the systems in place in oblivion that make it unique and amazing but Oblivion is the game that revolutionizes combat and especially graphics (Oblivion had some of the best graphics the world had ever seen, and was made on such a large scale that's almost an unimaginable feat) but sticks true to the elder scrolls mentality. Skyrim is a game to pull people into the franchise. Skyrim is the start of a new generation, a worse generation, of TES players. Oblivion is the peak in the series.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												What can I say about Oblivion. I was gifted the game when it came out on the Xbox 360. And after that, I continued to play it till I gave the game to my girlfriend 6 years later and bought the GOTY version on PC, which I'm playing at this moment. I have a lot more hours on PC Skyrim simply because I thought it would be better.  I was wrong. I'm now adding to my collection of inhuman hours of Xbox 360 Oblivion.  Don't get me wrong, dear Skyrim fanboy. It IS a great game, with amazing atmosphere and graphics. It one-ups Oblivion on graphics, since it's 4 years younger. But when it comes to atmosphere, Skyrim might as well be a cardboard box. Here's why:  Oblivion's soundtrack is rich and beautiful, unlike Skyrim's flat ""Dovahkiin"" ""Badass"" default track every time you get in a battle.  Skyrim's main questline is almost nessisary, since it contains the Shouts that are so very fun to use. Oblivion's main questline, however, is lots of fun, and optional. You'll miss out on items, but you'll never be lacking in a critical game ability that was the gimick of the entire launch.  Skyrim is flat and snowy, with SOME differences around the eastern and southwest parts of the map. And when you are in those green areas, it still feels like it's about to freeze over. Oblivion has snow, beautiful snow in fact, but it's SO diversive in the enviorment section. Beaches, forests, mountains, valleys, rivers, lakes, ponds, actual Oblivion, it's all amazing. And the colors are so vivid, with reds and greens and yellows and blues and OH GOD ITS GREAT.  When you fight a bandit in Skyrim, you're swinging a pool noodle at a mural. When you fight a bandit in Oblivion, it's head will twist to the left when you deliver the final blow with your Elven Mace, it's body crumpling to the ground, ready to plunder ( and sometimes teabag ). No silly spinning death animations that need a mod to disable like I have, just ragdoll. Like real life.  All in all, Oblivion is ahead of it's days. It was an improvement to Skyrim in the atmosphere department, not graphics. I LOVE Skyrim for all of her faults ( one of my favorite gaming moments of all time were my first 2 hours in the Forgotten Vale, absolutely breathtaking ) but Oblivion takes the cake. Morrowind? That's a different story. Totally different subject. I don't have much experience with the game honestly, so I can't effectively make a decision over who wins in the entire trilogy. And yeah, it's a trilogy. ( EDIT, I know Elder Scrolls isn't a trilogy. I was tired and wrote this half-arsed. Stop commenting on it :) ) ESO sucks♥♥♥♥♥♥ I said it.  Buy this game, with the DLC. It ain't no map pack, it's two seperate and amazing questlines. Just buy the game. Right now.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I love this game. I love the atmosphere. I love the Sidequests. I love the main quest. I love the ARENA!! (which was absent in Skyrim) I love the cities, especially Anvil. I love the fact that there were only like 13 voice actors for the entire game. I love that there seemed to be 2 voice actors for 1 person sometimes. you can be talking to a beggar and he will weakly say  ""I can eat for a whole week with just a single coin."" so you give him a coin. And he he will boomingly say ""BLESSINGS OF AKATOSH UPONG YE!!"" in a completely different tone that makes it sound like a different voice actor. I love wedging myelf between a bookshelf and the ceiling and jumping nonstop for a good 30 minutes to raise my acrobatics. I love murdering the adoring fan at the top of that one mountain or just leaving him standing out in the middle of nowhere and leaving him there for days. I love how when you walk into different buildings it actually felt like you were in a different place(every building in Skyrim felt the same to me) I love the persuation wheel thing that changes the NPCs facial expression. I love randomly exploring the world at times with no point or destination. I love how you can spend hours, and hours, and hours, and hours, and hours trying to level up your mercantilism by just 3 points. I love delving into bottomless caves and ruins just to find someones lost sword. I love hearing the sound of goblins getting wrecked by a longsword. I love jumping on top of roofs and shooting an almost endless supply of guards. I love the lockpicking.I love talking to Ma'iq the Liar outside Leyawiin and trying to keep up with him as he runs off. I love, love, LOVE the soundtrack. In fact I love the soundtrack to this game so much that I use part of one of the songs as the ringtone to my phone. I love finding that one enchanted glass helmet of the coast near Anvil. I love this game. And you should love it too. I dont have many hours on it on steam but I put over 500 hours on this game when I was a but a young teen on the PS3. Do yourself a favor and buy this game.			",52,3,0,4,2,0,6

												The first time I played Oblivion, I hated it. I thought it had the worst character models of all time, and the combat took too long and felt unnecessarily difficult, I immediately developed the opinion that Skyrim was the best game in every regard. That was probably one of the biggest mistakes I've ever made concerning a video game. The thing about oblivion that makes it the polar opposite of Skyrim is that, the more you play Oblivion, the better it gets. Meanwhile Skyrim is magical at first, and then progressively gets way too easy and tedious. So heres why you need to play Oblivion in 2016:1) The combatAs mentioned antecedently, Oblivion combat system is ♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ at first, but then, very similarly to Morrowind, you feel yourself getting progressively more powerful. You start as someone less dangerous than a native american toddler with cerebral palsy, but turn into one of the most epic warriors on the face of Tamriel. It also requires more skill, you need to strafe and blocking actually consistently makes a difference in who falls first in an engagement. Although there are no fancy decapitation animations, it still rewards more of a sense of completion, since you know that you have to be powerful to slay this person or creature.2) The StoryOblivions many storylines, particulary the Dark Brotherhoods, blow skyrim out of the water. The characters have so much more depth than, ""I came from X and I'm gonna hostile to you now but after one ♥♥♥♥ing quest I'm gonna worship the ground you walk on"" They will start to like you more after every few assassinations, depending on how well you perform them, and when its done, you wont just be their favorite warrior, you will be their leader. Same with the main quest, rather than just running around dungeon to dungeon, killing the draugr ""boss"" at the end. There are many different types of quests within the main storyline, and honestly it feels like a complete movie at a certain point.3) The questsYou know whats better than having to go into a tunnel fight the draugr minions, fix a puzzle with the directions right in front of you, and have it be the same puzzle every time? EVERYTHING is the answer to that. Oblivion has such a vast arsenal of different variations of quests that it can throw at you, poisoning someones food, chasing a unicorn, etc4) The worldThe final point I'm going to rant about is that the world of Oblivion is more interesting than Skyrims in almost every regard. The people have their own conversations, and the game somehow manages to give personality to all of the random conversations as well. For example, when a nord and an imperial had a conversation, the imperial said, ""those nords sure are hostile"" and he immediately said goodbye. That sort of discomfort in the face of racism adds so much personality and says alot about the world itself, and the bigotry is hurled in every direction from every direction. It also, despite a weaker engine, still looks prettier, due to its bright colors rather than white and brown. BY AZURA BY AZURA BY AZURA			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is quite possibly the greatest game I have ever played in my entire life (WoW: TBC is the only other contender). Where to begin? I'll tell you a story. I remember it was 2006 and my dad was looking for a blueray player. The only options were like 800 pounds or so, or you could buy a PS3 which had just came out. So my dad opted for a PS3 and it came with a game I had never before heard of called 'Oblivion'. I being 14 years old of course wanted to play CoD 4 instead but decided to give it a shot to see how the graphics were on the new gen of consoles. I popped the disc in, game booted up and I started a new character. I had no clue this was an RPG game (had just gotten into WoW) and was encouraged. After completing the intro quest and liking what I'd been playing, I stepped out into Cyrodiil for the very first time and my frickin jaw dropped. I had never seen such an incredible environment in a game before and I was blown awaay by how beautiful and colourful everything I saw was. The deer running around in the forest, the serene water and the gorgeous nightsky. Amazed instantly and I knew this game was something special. Immediately I set about just running around, not caring about finding enemies to defeat or quests.. I must have explored for a good hour or so before delving into Imperial city and figuring out what was what. It took me a while but I got onto the first quest, got to Kvatch without much trouble and then I Was blown away again when I went thru the Oblivion gate. Being 14 at the time, I was a bit frightened of the Dremora and scamps in there so I actually avoided the main questline for over a year whilst completing many many other questlines first. Yes, it was in fact an entire year before I completed the main questline and I'm glad that I did wait before I did so because it was an incredible day (I binged for 24 hours straight, with no internet guide to keep me from stumbling). Epic battles, evil monsters and edge of your seat quests as the story unfolded. Ending with the giant dragon in Imperial City and the equally giant battle with the Oblivion monsters which ended in victory for my character (conjurer/destruction/staff type of guy). But before all that I completed the fighters guild, mages guild, dark brotherhood, thieves guild AND arena questlines. I experienced nearly all of the Vanilla game before the main quest, and that it how I think this game ought to be played. At the time, this game was so huge for me, it blew my mind in so many ways. I spent every other weekend at my dad's glued to his 42"" plasma screen playing this game for hours. Questing, exploring, conquering, trying out new builds and playstyles. Every session I discovered something new in the world. It took me weeks of playtime to experience this game fully, but I definitely have done everything there is to do in this game, including making a ladder of paintbrushes to break into the Arcane University prematurely to enchant my gear with chameleon and thus become invisible. Or duping 100 steel swords randomly in the middle of the market district.. Hey, the exploits were just as fun as the game itself sometimes!Seriously, this game defined my existence from 14-16 years old. I'm 24 now and it's still just so good. It's not AS huge as it was, but going back to all of the old towns, the old dungeons and remembering the location of EVERYTHING is priceless. I used to lose myself in this game for hours and get lost in the game itself too. The little details I can recall with alarming clarity too. Like the bandit on the long bridge just south of Imperial city. Or the layout of all the old forts and where the enemies are and how many there are and what weapons they usually spawned with. The enchanted glass helmet in the sunken ship at the very bottom of the map I happened across one day exploring. Amazing...I could continue to ramble, but you get the point. If you haven't played this game, I highly recommend. It is better than Skyrim in every way except in graphics- but you can fix that with a few mods and then it looks just as good if not better. I have a lot of hours on Skyrim too, but far more on Oblivion. This game, it is THE game of the decade I feel and the work BSW put into it in unmatched. The attention to detail is insane and the storylines are immense. The soundtrack too, is incredible, and I'm listening to it right now with tears in my eyes writing this review and remembering that time in my life when everything was so bright and good and the only thing I had to worry about was when I was going to go to my dad's house next to get lost in Cyrodiil.

-Quick Review-The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion is a massive open world game developed by Bethesda and released March 20, 2006. It would take too long to list all the various quests, armor, weapons, enchantments, and magic spells you can learn/create, simply trust me when I say this game is an adventure waiting to happen.-Detailed breakdown review-Story: This is probably one of my personal favorite parts of Elder Scrolls of Oblivion, once you get out of the starting area you can make your own story, or follow the main story, or go search for your own quest. If you wanted, you could become a villain, you could also become a hero. The choices are completely up to you.The whole Elder Scrolls series is very rich is lore and diversity of environment, you can read in-game books and learn useful facts about the monsters you fight. Not everyone will do this, but I ended up learning what all Trolls are weak against, and I've been using it in all Elder Scrolls games since.I won't say much more about the story, because most of the fun is in finding the quests and stories yourself, and of course forging your own tale.... however there is one additional thing to note, in the Game of the Year Edition you get the Shivering Isles Expansion, and there you meet my favorite character in the whole series.Game Play: You can control the camera to play in third person, or first person. (personally I always thought third person looked silly... the knee's bend funny, and when you jump your legs stay straight. seems like an indication of ""play in first person"").You could be a necromancer and summon skeleton hoards, you could be a thief and sneak into combat, you could be a warrior and smash your enemies faces in, you can be a mage and even create your own skills, you can be a ranger and pew pew, a monk, an acrobat or any hybrid combination of what I've said and much much more.Achievements: There are no Steam Achievements in this game, you can certainly find plenty of challenges online to test your skill in the game, or simply increase the difficulty of the game.Price The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Game of the Year Edition is priced at $19.99, as always, I suggest you wait for a sale, but if you already know you like this style of game you won't lose money out of it, since the game is getting ""old"" *cough cough cough* you should probably look for a good deal out of the game, it goes on sale often.Conclusion: This was the first Open world game I ever played, I absolutely loved it, and I still remember the fun I had playing the game. The stories/quests are very memorable and the game play was dynamic and very fluid. I recommend this game to anyone who enjoys open world or RPG's.------Edits and updates------Edit/Update March 18, 2015:I redid my review for Oblivion, thereby normalizing it into the framework I do for all my reviews. (No one ever read the old review anyway, you're not missing anything)Update June 23, 2015:Corrected release date from 2007, to 2006.Update September 14, 2015:Here's the URL to see my review for  Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim (Including links for Skyrim DLC reviews!)

												My favorite game of all time!!!I remember going over to my friends house when I was a young man and he had this game called Oblivion on his xbox. I didn't know anything of the game but one day we decided to start it up. Choosing my race and fine tuning my character was something new to me and blew me away. Then the game continued with the dark elf mocking me from my prison cell.At that moment I was hooked and bought it for myself the next day for Xbox and then a year later for pc. It was the first game I modded and I closed every gate and explored every crevice of the map. I have spend thousands of hours on this game on the non steam edition and will play this game off and on until the day I die. I am a die hard fan of this edition into the series and no other game has ever lived up to this. You exit the sewers and the whole world is open to you, it is your destiny and you can play how you want. All enemies scale to you so you can go anywhere on the map. North east south west it does not matter forge your own journey the game allows you to role play to the max being who you want to be.My all time favorite game gets an 11/10 and will always be the best game in the series in my heart and I hope you can get the same expirenced as I have.

												I played Skyrim before Oblivion, but still feels Oblivion has much to impress me.After I saved Kvatch, people started calling me ""Hero of Kvatch"".After the Bruma Battle, a statue of my character was built beside the city gate, which was generated based on my weapon and armors instead of using a pre-set one.After the main quest line, all the guards hail me as Champion of Cyrodill when I pass by.After I became head of a guild, I recieve unique benefits like a real man in charge.After I became Grand Champion of the Arena, there is an adoring fan who wants to worship the ground I walk.All these details make me feel like that I am really living in the world and making a difference. I am really changing my place in the age of chaos through hard battle and honest work.Instead, in Skyrim, guards still call me a sneak thief after I saved Skyrim from dragons. Nobody on Solstheim recognizes me even after I saved their asses from Miraak. I helped a Jarl to reclaim his throne but all I got afterwards is ""You are not as dumb as you look"".Bethesda, WTF?============================================================pros:+Not bad graphic as a game in 2006. +Despite some strange looking NPCs and their strange chit-chats, Cyrodill is a much better place than Skyrim, considering climate, city scale, politeness of the guards, etc.+The Woold Elves are so cute.+The Shocking Oblivion Gates.+Elder Scrolls music never fails to impress.+Magic crafting. College of Winterhold looks like a bunch of rookies in comparison.+Newspaper about the quests you have done. I don't know why they cancel this in Skyrim.+Shivering Isle is really something you should not miss.cons:-Bug. Bug never changes.-Poor motion design. Takes some getting used to.-Awkward NPC chatting systems. Mother and daughter greet each other like strangers, have some random talk, say goodbye, and then immediately greet each other again.-Useless followers.-Dungeons are like f**king labyrinths and have little to offer other than common monsters and meaningless random loots. No related quests. No background info.  I can see why Bethesda hired experienced level designers to construct dungeons in Skyrim.-It ruined my life like Skyrim did.			",18,1,1,7,2,0,0

												Okay,So as a person who started off in the Elder Scrolls series at the game Skyrim, oblivion never really appealed to me. It looked so outdated, i couldnt stand the graphics, and having briefly watched people play it in the past it didnt look like it could ever compete with a game that holds such a great magnitude as Skyrim. I am happy to say that i was completely ignorant for thinking that and Skyrim will be collecting dust for a while. So my friend gifted me this and i started playing, the first few hours were like meh, not sure what to think. As i explored more of oblivion and got into the main quest and starting seeing the guilds, the mechanics in this game and the depth surpass skyrim in literally all aspects.. And ive only been playing for around 3 days now and already clocked in 20+ hours. The amound of lore, the unbelievablely deep quests and the characters that you remember. Its absolutely mesmorizing. To think of the age of this game and the fact that im just starting now, in 2016, to get into oblivion i dont even know what to say. This game is the best rpg ive ever played in my life. It keeps the player interested as i continue through the game and keep wanting to learn more and oblivion actually makes you want to learn more about the lore behind the elder scrolls. It has inspired me to eventually buy morrowind as ive become so interested in the lore behind the elder scrolls because of this game. It feels so much more authentic than skyrim. I enjoy the combat so much more. And it is so much more immersive than skyrim wil ever be. And i only have very few mods for the game. The exploration aspect of the game is so much more rewarding than skyrim's and you actually have to put in a lot of work to become even somewhat powerful. This game is a committment and makes you work your♥♥♥♥♥off for the things that you want. So anyone who plays the hell out of skyrim and thinks its the best RPG. I dont care what year it is, put that game down and give this one a try. You wont regret it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

OverviewThe Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion is the fourth installment of the series and one of the most known and loved fantasy RPG in gaming. Released in 2006 by Bethesda, the game is still very played to this day, and has a very active modding community, which is a testament of the life-span of a great game. Embark on a journey full of lore, quests and dungeon explorations in this masterpiece of a game.The ProsEnticing Gameplay - Oblivion is a game that really nails it when it comes to gameplay. You always find some new quest to do or a new dungeon to explore, people to gossip, barter or fight with. The large, open map provides many opportunities to explore and create your own adventure. Even if you already completed the game and know the majority of quests, it’s still fun to replay them. The quests are very well done, and much more diverse than one might expect, primarily due to the rich backstory they provide.Long Completion Time - Don’t worry about running out of things to do. There are over 200 quests and 400 locations to discover, explore and loot. Not to mention this is a Role-Playing Game. You can have multiple playthroughs, each with it’s own different approach on what and who you are, how you attack, and how you respond at moral decisions in quests.Beautiful Soundtrack - This game has, in my opinion, the best soundtrack in the history of gaming. The music is very well made for each situation. It is relaxing when wandering, thrilling when in battle. Jeremy Soule really hit the nail on its head on this one. Modding - Head on over to Oblivion Nexus to download and install a few of thousands of available mods, that fix most if not all problems vanilla oblivion has. Bug fixes, texture enhancements, ENBs, UI redesigns, quest mods, item mods, gameplay tweaks, and so much more are being offered by the modding community. This is one of Oblivions strongest points, and will definitely make the game several times more enjoyable. Just make sure you take your time to research, download and organise them before you start playing. Expansion Packs - We all know the famous “Horse Armor” DLC fiasco, but let’s not get in the way of its actual expansion packs, namely Knights of the Nine and The Shivering Isles. The latter is considered one of the best expansion packs that were ever released, and comes included in the Game of the Year version on Steam. It adds lots of new content, including maps, items, quests, characters and  gameplay elements.The ConsVanilla Version - This is just informing you that the vanilla game you get when you first download it is a bit underselling. The graphics are outdated(Duh! 2006 game) and there are quite a few (hundred) small bugs and other inconsistencies that may occur during gameplay, the faces of characters look… well, hideously ugly in some cases. All of these problems and many more are easily fixed with a few tweaks and mods and you can enjoy a better, prettier, and more stable version by installing them. There are loads of bits and pieces I could write long rants about, but there’s a mod for all of them, so I won’t bother. I will concentrate only on the things inherently bad about the game that cannot be fixed (in most cases)Voice Casting - Given that Patrik Steward voiced about 5 minutes of emperor Uriel’s lines, the budget was already out the window, so we are left with about… a few handfuls of voice actors, each representing their race. This makes it a little weird having every member of a gender and race sound the same, with a few exceptions. Albeit, in order to do this, each actor recorded the entirety of the dialogues, even ones that would never be used by their characters, for safe-proofing. A lot of work to be admired, however the problem of little to no diversity between characters’ voices is a little disappointing. Which isn’t to say they sound awful. The sound quality is good and the actors are talented. It’s just that everything sounds the same. Also, you may encounter beggars that change voices radically between different topics.Totalitarian Crime System - There is a running gag of the telepathic guards that roam Oblivion in search for you. Doing any murder, even in complete and utter stealth, even in the most devoid of any witnesses location, that crime will be recorded, a bounty will be placed on your head, and sometimes guards might leave the cities in search for you and they know exactly where you are. Not only this, but touching items is a crime. You are a guest in someone’s home. You see a misplaced fork on the table and just want to nudge it a bit to align it with the plate. Yup, you are going to be arrested. Or say you broke in someone’s house late at night, and you steal an apple. That apple is now known throughout the entire province of Cyrodill as being stolen and cannot be sold to anyone but thief guild fences. You can come to a merchant with 20 apples, but he will specifically know that only 18 of them are righteously yours. You can’t sell the other two. How!? Why!?Uneven Leveling System - (fixable by mods) The world seems to be leveling with you, which seems stupid. By about level 20, every common bandit you find will be equipped with the best grade weapons and armor, which breaks the immersion and unbalances the game. Also, attaining the perfect character (max stats) requires a deep understanding of the leveling system and painstakingly much micro-management.ConclusionIt may seem the cons list is longer, but trust me, this game is amazing. It is one of my favorite games of all time, and have been rocking a lot more hours before I got it on Steam. If you like RPGs, then this is a must have. I recommend it with all my heart. Be sure to mod it and to try to find everything there is to do in it.

												A definite must-buy for a fan of The Elder Scrolls series. ""Ermagerd Skyrim is better Oblivion sucks cus graphics!!!11! You're just an Oblivion fanboy!11!!!"". Well no.I first started playing The Elder Scrolls series a few years back, when Skyrim first came out because of all the hype. Reason why it shows a ridiculously low number of Skyrim playtime hours on my Steam profile would be that I didn't get the Steam version as I didn't have a Steam account then. I finished the entire main storyline, finished all the DLC, 90% of all sidequests and explored almost 80% of the dungeons in Skyrim.Now, I only got Oblivion after much insistence by a few of my friends. At first, I was very turned off by the bad graphics and  combat system. I compared it a lot with Skyrim, but I tried to look past the graphics. It was then I got really surprised. Funnily enough, after playing Oblivion for awhile, I like it better than Skyrim. I appreciate and get attached to the characters in Oblivion more than the characters in Skyrim. Maybe it's because the character development in Skyrim pale in comparison? Or maybe it is because they hardly (almost never) kill off companions in Skyrim. In Oblivion, a lot of the main characters of the side quests  even the main quest  get killed off, and you cannot simply ressurect them using console  like if you accidentally kill off Lydia in Skyrim. Face it, everyone does that , because their death is crucial in that plot. I like the change of pace in Oblivion compared to the rest of the games I have played so far, because you are not the main hero here. You are just a Blade, assisting the next Emperor to take over the throne and stop Mehrunes Dagon. You do not get to do the final blow to the villian, you do not get to be ""hero"" at the end of the main storyline. Because someone else close to you will do it for you. And trust me, you will get this feeling of emptiness for a very long time after that.The soundtrack is really beautiful here, although it may make you feel lonely especially when you are exploring the wilderness. The horses actually make a satisfying galloping sound, although they are not as ridiculous in climbing vertical walls.If one were to compare Skyrim and Oblivion, I would say they are both incomparable. It's like comparing an apple and an orange. They are similar, but you cannot directly compare them both. If you are looking for something different, and something more story-based, and a f*ck ton of plot twists, go for Oblivion. But if you are more of the graphics, modern-day sandbox game which follows a linear plot, go for Skyrim instead. Overall, I enjoy this installment, will definitely put in more hours in this game.

												Stop right there criminal scum! Oblivion needs you!--WARNING--Make sure you buy the GoTY DELUXE version of the game - if you don't, you'll miss out on all of the smaller DLC, as they are not sold seperately and cannot be purchased afterwards!EDIT:If you're looking for better graphics, check out Oblivion Reloaded @ Nexusmods, link here: http://www.nexusmods.com/oblivion/mods/45749/?Oblivion Reloaded replaces previous versions of OBGE and overall is more power and efficient than alternatives (possibly even ENB).So yep, the game is still being modded.--Reviewing Oblivion is a little tricky for me because I've had it for years. Many, many years. I've literally had it since sometime during good ol' 2007. Thousands of hours easily poured into the none-steam version of the game, and time I do not regret putting into the game.It was, simply put, a centrepiece to the later years of my childhood. I enjoyed it so much I bought it on Steam too, so in case I ever lose any of the disks for whatever reason, I've got the steam version as a backup.So beyond countless hours playing the game, I've also got another issue. Mods. One really should not review a game on the basis of what users have created out of it -- even if modding is a huge aspect of the game -- but I do have some difficulty doing so accurately doing so, so you may have to bare with me.Gameplay:Oblivion had unique gameplay. For someone who had never played anything like it, Oblivion was something above and beyond anything I'd ever played. To this day, Oblivion has a number of unique gameplay features that aren't present in, say, Skyrim. I'll give some big differences below.- An attribute system. Each attribute governs a number of different skills and has a number of affects. Attributes such as Endurance, Agility, Intelligence and so on. For many players such as myself, these attributes add something extra to the game.- Fame and Infamy system. Your actions have a limited impact on the world in terms of disposition. People will react to you differently - murder lots of people, and people will react to it in terms of their opinion of you.- Repair skill and durability of weapons and armour - you need to manage the integrity of your equipment, or else watch it degrade and eventually break. There is even a hand-to-hand skill, so you can train yourself to kill people with your bare fists if you want to.- Disposition system. People like you more or less depending on events, infamy/fame, quests and even the silly mini-game in the game you can use. Personality attribute also has a big impact.- Scaling in the game is, to be blunt, terrible. At the beginning of the game, you'll find a rather friendly and not so hostile world. Deer will roam the wilds and slaughterfish will slaughter you whilst mudcrabs pick at your corpse. Skyrim does this slightly better, but mods can fix this in Oblivion.- Birthsigns are selected at the beginning of the game and have a permanent effect. Your birthsign will have a number of effects, ranging from lesser and greater powers to minor impacts on your attributes. This initial decision may full well shape your character in ways you will not be able to change later.- Working item moving. It's much better in Oblivion than Skyrim - you have much more control over the moving of items around your house and all that, with fewer bugs and what-not.- Lots of different armour pieces. Greaves, Gauntlets, Chestplate, Helmet and Boots.And much more. Actually, there is an entire page dedicated to it right here, including the differences between Morrowind too: http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Differences_Between_Morrowind,_Oblivion,_and_SkyrimNow onto modding (my original review with minor edits). Beyond vanilla gameplay, which intitially I thought was great, mods can turn the game into something completely different. Add in Deadly Reflex or UV to get a deadly and bloody game, despite being somewhat unrealistic. Or maybe go for Duke Patrick's combat mods and find yourself playing a realistic combat game.Or download thousands of other mods and mix and match to create a game that is unique for you. Don't like the levelling and skill progression? No problem. Grab numerous mods that edit the system, changing it into something more casual, more hardcore or even something completely different. XP system? Gotcha.I've played the game through multiple times over the years. I have to say, I'm still not bored of it, though I did take a break for a couple of years whilst I played Skyrim and Morrowind.Graphics are a little bit dated. But plenty of mods around it to bring it up to Not-Quite-Skyrim quality.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												90% of my time spent playing was: duplicating poisoned apples, placing them in guard barracks, and watching guards slowly die11/10 would buy horse armortl;dr: It may follow Bethesda's formula of open-world enjoyment, but this one (and Morrowind) doesn't hold your hand.  It has enough RPG elements to make one playthrough of the game different from another.  Combat and bugs are aplenty, but the quests and varied map make up for those shortcomings. 9/10I first played this game back when I was 13. This was the first Elder Scrolls game that I was subject to (I was slightly too young to be interested in Morrowind at the timeit was released).  I had never played a game that allowed for such open-ended exploration and freedom.  This blew my mind when I first played and it seemed like there was always something new to find out in the world.  As a kid obsessed with this new experience, much of the flaws never really surfaced.Fast forward 10 years.  For nostalgia's sake, I take another trip down memory lane.  It isn't as fantastic as I remember it (but nothing is as good as the first time).  The exploration is still the best part of this game (as it is with all Bethesda games), but the problem is, once you've seen everything, a game can get old quick when it relies heavily on exploration.  This is the problem with all future Bethesda games (but that's a conversation for another time).  The quests are what elevate Oblivion.  There are still some fetch quests, but I think those are few and far between in this game.  If there are fetch quests, they dress them up and throw in plenty of twists to make it interesting.  The best part is there are tons of quests in this game.  Reliving those, or trying out new ways to complete them made this second playthrough incredibly enjoyable. Oh, and do yourself a favor and play through the best DLC/expansion Bethesda has ever made.  Shivering Isles was so diverse and included so much content that I feel like I still haven't done everything to do there.  Downsides: Bugs, no real controller support, potato faces.

												TL;DR:Oblivion is my favorite game of all time. You should defiently buy it and never play any other game, ever. I'll give it a 10/10 for what it is. The game is just amazing, though bethesda REALLY seems to have a thing for tracking down sons/famiy members or people in their games.(Martin, ""Dad"", Shaun, the blade guy in Morrowind).P.S. This game is better than Skyrim in a lot of ways.Story:You start as a prisoner in the Imperial City Prison. Sentenced for unknown crimes (Great for having an RP backstory). The Emperor comes down into the dungeons, it turns out your jail cell just happens to have a badass escape route out of the city. You end up escaping the city with the emperor, along the way you find out a little about what's going on. The Emperor has the ""Amulet of Kings"" which is used to create a barrier between your realm and Oblivion (hell).Mehrunes Dagon (main antagonist), god of Oblivon, wants to invade your realm. His little idiotic cult followers called the ""Mythic Dawn"" help him do that. They assassinated the Emperors sons and now have came for the Emperor himself.Now it's your destiny to take the Amulet of Kings and locate the Emperors ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ son, kept in secret, hidden away & make him Emperor and ""Shut close the jaws of Oblivion"".The story is awesome really, though the game lacks as a choice-based RPG. There's no choices (There's a few in the Dark Brotherhood (Assassin Guild)). The storytelling is amazing, -------World Development:Oh boy, this is where the game really shines. Bethesda is known as MASTERS of world development & Oblivion is no different. The game is set in Cyrodiil. The world is a bright, beautiful & vibrant place. It's very diverse (The game is set in the center of the continent, so has bits of everything). From Anvil, a port town on the west coast, to Bruma, a city of the Nords, far to the north in the mountains near Skyrim, to Leyawiin, a city far to the south, mostly inhabited by the Argonians and Khajits (Lizard and Cat people, beast races) a dark, swampy-like town.Or even the Imperial City itself, the largest city on the continent, filled with all the races and culture from everyone. Also the arena where you can pay to watch people beat eachother to death.RPG-ness:It's not a choice-based RPG. You can't choose sides and nothing conflics, but honestly it's not a bad thing & i'm sure there's mods for it anyway. It's more of an RPG that expresses a sense of freedom for the player. You can literally walk anywhere and interact with things, drag objects in the world around using the game physics, kill almost anyone you see and just take in the world. Anywhere at anytime.If you do NEED a choice-based RPG for your library, i'd definetly reccomend Dragon Age Origins (probably my second favorite game).(Same music composer too, Inon Zur, known for The Elder Scrolls, Fallout, Star Trek, Pirates of the Carribean, Prince of PErsia and more)Races, characters, voices etc:Cyrodiil, being set in the center of the continent, is home to all races, it has a large feeling of diversity, each city generally has a larger population of the race that the city is closest to their home province. The voice acting is great for ever race and there's a large amount of culture to it too. You'll here ambient dialog from characters in the street talking about things around the world & all NPC's wander around openly, they all have their scripts that they follow daily, at certain times they'll do certain things. Counts and Countesses will sleep at night, then attend their courtroom during the day. Places open and shut and scripted times and everything acts like a real world.-----------Overall I LOVE this game, it's a MUST have for any RPG/Open-World/Fantasy lover. If there's anything more to say I might add more to this review later.			",130,40,1,31,14,0,12

												People can say whatever they want, but Oblivion is way ahead of all this Morrowind and Skyrim stuff. There's still something unexplainably charming in it, and every visit to Cyrodiil is filled with joy and excitement. Although the game mechanics and the visuals are a bit outdated now, Oblivion provides the same old emotions and remains deep and intriguing.May the Night Mother wrap you in her cold, loving embrace.

												I was first introduced to the Elder's Scrolls franchise through Skyrim. I like it so much that I decided to try Oblivion. I'm glad I did. After clocking more than 100 hours in, I can say I like it more than Skyrim for its quests, colorful world and great mechanics. Now that I played both games, I think Bethesda decided to make Skyrim more accessible. Oblivion will give you a world of opportunities and invite you to explore.The graphics aren't the best, and combat is weak, but if you enjoy roleplaying a character and exploring a fantasy world, consider Oblivion. You won't be disappointed. Also, if you can pick up the DLCs. They are worth it for this game.			",36,22,0,15,1,0,5

												There's no  way  a short review such as this   can do justice to a game like Oblivion, it's too massive and there' too much to experience, especially when you factor in the number of custom made modifications that are available for this game.  Almost approaching the same as Unreal Tournament and the early Battlefield games (BF1942, BFV and BF2); we're talking several hundred gigabytes of free content at least (I have around 500GB for Oblivion and over a Terabyte for Battlerfield 2).The initial stage of the game where you have to escape the cobwebbed, dark and sometimes dank dungeon is   a little depressing, but still   a pleasure to experience the first few times around (it’s one of only   a few  linear parts of the game - another one is where you get transported into a painting), then you hit the outside, exiting the dungeon via a sewer drain.  On my first time it was a moonlit night and I was actually awed by the sight that I beheld.  I could see   the dark shapes of mountains and   the moonlight gave an eerie look to the small clouds slowly passing by.  The sky was full of glittering stars and I could see some distance ahead to a small broken down castle keep, all of which, even in the dark looked amazing.  I thought Morrowind was fantastic, but this was even better. I waited utill sunrise and was even more impressed by the amazing vista before me, Mountains  clothed in forests, morning mist,   a sun rise that looked almost real and  amazing,  the lush grass waving in the breeze, and    a whole host of other things swamped my  visual cortex.  Every step of the way, I marvelled at how realistic the grass, rocks and other objects looked.  Buildings, the imperial city, villages and towns all had their own distinct feel and charm.  The transition from night to day and back to night  is a pleasure to see; with HDR lighting, bloom effects, specular highlights and  parallax mapping  giving the game    some of the best visuals I’ve seen to date (well, maybe not the last    couple of years of AAA  game releases).  The effects are amazing, even now seven years after its release it still looks brilliant.  You can get several mods that improve many of the textures (the largest of these is around 3GB in size).The usual RPG elements are present; for example, levelling up, plus  resource collection for  crafting magical weapons and  potions as well as stocking  yourself with  better armour, weapons , arrows, spears, potions etc.    Combat is nothing special, but still satisfying when swapping between bow, sword spear and magic.  Despatching enemies isn’t too hard, especially once you’ve got a steady stream of healing potions.If you still haven’t purchased this game, now is the time to get it.  It includes   the expansion The Shivering Isles and the mod package Knights of the Nine that contains several   new missions, etc.  You can see several videos HERE,  HERE, HERE, HERE and HERE.The first one is  the escape from the dungeon, the next  two videos are in and around Cyrodiil  and the last two relate to the Oblivion gates.

												The Elder Scrolls: Oblivion is by far my favourite in the series. I have played the Elder Scrolls since Morrowind came out way back and have continued it's amazing legacy in my life to this very day. Of course, it comes with bugs and glitches but what do you expect from a massive RPG such as this? Anyways, besides from the graphics and quests, my favourite part of this game has always been the modding community and also being a part of it.My days began way back when I was 12/13 so a good 6 years ago, when I discovered mods and how awesome they were. Graphics were always an important thing in mind so mods such as Qarls Texture Pack 3 (the best one at the time and still is I believe) was an amazing thing to have. All the small mods, such as keychains, graphics, sound overhauls, OPEN CITIES etc were what made this game, and also the rest in the series truly amazing. Sure having a flying dragon or flying skyship was awesome, but it wasn't something you'd always be using and seeing. There were still many bugs in the later releases however an Unnofficial fix was released (many times) to fix what Bethesda could and did not. This helped greatly with smooth gameplay and to fix errors.I haven't covered nearly 5% of what I wanted to type as this game is just truly amazing and my favourite in The Elder Scrolls. Check out PlanetElderscrolls and The Nexus for mods and make sure you know what you're doing by reading the Readme files and guides.If you have only played Skyrim, you probably won't like Oblivion that much because everything isn't as 'immersive' graphics wise, but to us who started here, I think we can agree that the Replay Value outnumbers Skyrim's.

To this day, I still think Oblivion is the best Elder Scrolls game thus far.Yes, I've spent over one houe playing the PC version, but I've spent hundreds of hours playing the 360 version.However, this game is quite old, so while the graphics aren't terrible, your experience with this game would be ten times better with a few graphical enhancements.Graphics aside, the core plot is one full of mystery, adventure and sometimes shock. The side-quests (There are probably over one hundred of them) are quirky and range from being pretty short, to really long and complex.The environment, like many RPG games, can be repetitive and sometimes quite boring, however, this is countered with multiple buildings/shrines/portals scattered throughout.The alchemy system is, in my opinion, far more easier to learn and more rewarding to use than any other elder scrolls game. Not surprisingly, more complex potions can be made with a higher alchemy level.Unlike Skyrim, you don't ""wield"" spells, that is, you can walk around with a sword and still a spell equipped without any compromise.I recommend this game to those who are looking for some nostalgia.I recommend this game to newer players who don't mind installing some graphics mods.

												Oblivion is a beautiful experience. Rich characters and absorbing questlines within a game that brings Tamriels central province to life. As 'old' as it is now, Oblivion still holds up as a fantastic experience and is well worth playing, even if your only previous Elder Scrolls game has been Skyrim. There is very little handholding and figuring out how basically anything works is a myriad of frankly hilarious trial and error. There is almost nothing I don't love about this game aside from Bethesdas general ability to write less than interesting main questlines and have a habit of placing a large number of copy pasted Dungeons throughout the game, but the rest of the world is filled with more than enough to quench the thirst of the avid adventurer.*♥♥♥♥♥♥s*			",174,62,1,29,18,2,14

												In Skyrim, if you use magic, all you need is Destruction Dual Casting, Impact, and four enchanted items to hit end game. In Oblivion, even the most cheap and knowledgable player who utilizes power leveling and walkthroughs to get the best gear/spells at the fastest rate possible will still experience a sense of progression and improvement far into the highest character levels.The musical score is god tier.Although repetitive, the voice acting is pleasant and cohesive (if you don't listen to the beggars).The environments are colorful and interesting, whereas Skyrim's world could have been created by a three year old with a pair of grey and white markers.If you like RPGs, Oblivion is a must.

												In my Opinion Oblivion is still better than Skyrim. The story and the Quests are waaay better. Just as an example: Skyrim Magic University Mission is quickly over, and the uni itself doesn't even feel like a place people study. In Oblivion the questline is really long spread out over all major cities and the university is a giant place with the feel of an acutal university. And where as the ending of Skyrim is kinda meh (you fight a dragon, so what? You did that the entire game) The Ending in Oblivion is epic and memorable.Also Oblivion has the best expansion ever made aka shivering Isles.That is not to say Oblivion doesn't have its flaws. The major gripe I have with this game is the leveling system. It is really easy to ""misslevel"" you character, making it weaker the higer level you get. Leveling is almost stressful. You have to grind 5 levels per attribute or else you are missing out on stats. It is even benificial to only level up skills that are not your main skills as that makes you deal way more damage than you should have per level.  ",68,32,0,14,9,0,29

												This being one of the first RPG i ever played, it blew me away. This game is just so well put together that it leaves me to want a remaster or something of the sort. However, the game isnt without its flaws. Specifically, the combat can seem dull and repetitive if you play it with an aggro mindset, not bothering to avoid attacks and spam health potions. Another flaw for me personally is the difficulty setting. Finding the perfect sweetspot varies from character to character. Enemies will either become total wimps getting one shot by any attack or be absolute tanks that drain your resources to nothing. What i would more prefer is something along the lines of fallout 4's survival mode damage, where you and enemies both have increased killing potential. That aside, this game has characteristics that far outweigh the cons. My personal favorite being the music. This game's soundtrack, in my honest opinion, is amazing. I feel myself getting lost in the harps, flutes, and violins when wandering the various cities. Ominous music kicking in when i enter an unexplored cave. But who could forget the epic tones of the games title screen. Another great thing about this game are the secrets hidden throughout the landscape. Perhaps a bow or chest that you would have never stumbled upon in a first playthrough. Another topic i wanted to touch on is how you play this game. If you are the type of person that loves getting to the end fast and wants instant gratification, maybe this isnt your game. I think you have to be the observant type, listen to the dialogue, read the books, dont rush through every quest like you are in a hurry like so many others do. You miss out on the little nuances the game so delicately hides. You can appreciate the game on another level. Though this game is very outdated, i feel it gives the game a certain charm that few others have. It was the RPG that paved the way for future games of its genre, and look where we are now. These are just my thoughts on the game, the may not be true or subjective, but i hope i can convince someone to experience this game the way i have. Much love and thank you for reading.

												Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion is a gem within the Elder Scroll series.What was good about Morrowind was brought over to this 4th installment of the series, and of course, what was bad. Was either taken out, or refined and polish for a much smoother experience.This game is huge, then what the game let's on. From quests just about almost everywhere you go. With impress lore and backstory. Not to mention the various challenges in these dark and creepy dungeons. Another great thing about Oblivion is it's class system. Unlike in Skyrim where you play as you want. Here you play based on a set of class. And therefore the game experience for you could either be hard or easy, Depending upon what class you play as. To add on the 500+ in Oblivion you got a stable (still active) modding community plus DLC quests like Knights of Nine and Shivering Isles. Which that place adds even MORE hours into Oblivion.  To add on this amazing experience is these beautiful towns and cities filled with the sam- der i mean different variety of characters each one having their own set schedule, personal opinon, and even the way they see you (through fame or infamy status) the world is very active around you within this game. There are at least two negatives about this game, that i can point out.1. NPC's are literally forgettable, this being the reason why Skyrim's NPCs are vastly superior than Oblivion's NPCs, and more flexiable than Morrowind's NPCs. The Oblivion character models are literally the same, except with a few minor face tweaks with the hair, nose, eye color and so on. Plus with the same voice acting it doesn't really help who is who in the world.2. Combat is sluggish, Yes. Even though it's a class based system. It will take a while, a long while before finding the right tune for your character to even remotely survive in the combat. Really it's just: block, lung, block, fire a spell, block. Rinse and repeat. Sometimes you are on the defensive the entire time or not even bothering going through that dungeon and just drinking buffer poitions outside the dungeon. Can you say it's because of the player level..perhaps. But even then the combat is still sub-par.If you love a cross between Morrowind and Skyrim. I highly recommend getting this game. This is the one to have in your RPG collection.			",95,27,0,34,11,4,25

												Fantastic game! Oblivion is one of those games that only comes from time to time, just imagine how much the developers put into this game, time, ideas , money. Thank you Bethesda! I confess it was the first game in the Elder Scrolls series I played, so I can not compare to Morrowind, and Skyrim I barely played, then I'll make a review based solely on impressions of the game.It took a while until I get to continue on a character and finish the main quest, the game requires dedication, Cyrodill world is vast , the possibilities in a TES game well, you need to explore,  learn about, otherwise you will getting lost as I did several times and so I abandoned the progress with other characters.The wealth of detail is impressive, the plot of the main quest not, but everything else makes up for this fact, the quests are very well written, some are so smart that I was surprised. The possibilities are endless too, this is a true Role Playing Game, you can make a character and be what you want from a killer thief going through a heroic warrior to a simple traveling merchant, or all together.The graphics are outdated and mechanics are strange at first sight, especially the combat and movement, and the animation of NPCs give the impression that they do not have emotions. Despite this the game is still very good, the graphics can be improved with mods, you get used to the mechanics and also the sound effects are well done. The community is huge and active, there are thousands of fan-made mods that help solve problems, improve gameplay, graphics and add content that make it practically a new game.I highly recommend it, but as said, you need to devote to it, it takes a while to get a feel and learn how the gameplay works, how the skill system and leveling for example. But there are wikis for it with everything you can know about TES: Oblivion, I recommend consulting to aid, but being careful with spoilers, of course.9/10			",237,47,12,43,21,2,57

												I have literally played over 8,000 hours of this on the 360, from when it came out to now, and I assure you, with the inviting atmosphere, intruiguing plot, and plethora of content, this game is still a masterpiece, even now. And to anyone who is looking for a good familial bonding game, I recommend this one, as it has an inviting artistic style and intuitive system of leveling where those playing get quite the cathartic fantasy experience. Although I have played morrowind, this one was my mainstay, since I never got to play morrowind for long. Favorite game. 10/10.			",30,6,0,7,1,0,0

												A very enjoyable RPG with a wide world and variety of combat options. I would recommend using the widely available unofficial patches, especially the ones fixing bugs and modiying the level-up process - the original level-up process is quite arcane and can actually make you less powerful, especially if you don't understand how it operates.

												Oblivion makes some arguable improvements over Morrowind, as well as some massive steps backwards. Some of these mistakes would be fixed in Skyrim, while others will be ignored or worsened in some sense. As a full experience, Oblivion is a big open, sometimes annoying, technically and gameplay wise, but still mostly enjoyable overall. However, unlike Morrowind, where if you looked past the graphics now you could likely get immersed, Oblivion has numerous barriers preventing it from matching Morrowind.Compared to Skyrim, the combat feels somewhat choppier. It is faster at some points, but it manages to feel a lot more simplistic. I definitely prefer non-magic combat over Morrowind's dice roll simulation however, as combat finally feels responsive. Magic crafting also returns from Morrowind, and still feels very powerful at higher levels. However, I actually, for whatever reason, prefer magic in Morrowind to Oblivion. Learning a school of magic however, unlike Skyrim, is still worth doing regardless of playstyle due to the ability to cast regardless of whether both hands are occupied or not. Oblivion is, combat wise, the halfway point between Morrowind's more traditional style and Skyrim's faster combat, so benefits and pros of both apply here. I don't actually mind it, as like I said, magic feels superior to Skyrim, while in most other areas, combat feels more responsive than Morrowind.Location-wise and graphically, Oblivion is very green and bright. It has a better colour pallet than non-modded Skyrim, and there are definitely graphical improvements over its prequels. However, the location itself is generic. It's all greens and old elven architecture and medieval towns, rather than the alien lands of Vvardenfell's plains or Skyrim's cold mountain ranges. My main problem with Bethesda worlds has always been the very small population, and the Imperial City, although more populated than anything in Skyrim, still feels empty, and the NPC's all have very funny looking faces. Character models in Bethesda games always feel like the lack, and Oblivion is a prime example here. What feels like a let-down is that the beast races no longer have unique animations either for movement. This is more an immersion thing, and animations never affect your gameplay experience, but if you had played Morrowind before Oblivion, you'll likely notice it.The soundtrack is quiet and peaceful. The scores are always nice in Elder Scrolls games, and although I don't have anything in this game I prefer over Morrowind (which Bethesda seemed to like as they were re-using the compositions even before the Dragonborn DLC in Skyrim), the music all fits and helps build on the games atmosphere, which is all you need a soundtrack to do.The guild quests in Oblivion are some of the best in the series. Although the main quest becomes a bit of a drag, the Thieves Guild and Dark Brotherhood in particular have some of Bethesda's best quests and plotlines to them. Highlights include the Gray Fox and his final heist, and The Dark Brotherhood as a whole. There aren't any quests in Skyrim that compete with the quests here. The Fighter's Guild also has a few interesting ones and the Mages Guild suffers from the same problem that the College of Winterhold suffers from in that you can be hopeless with advanced magic and become the archmage in a few days of joining. The Arena is a massive missed opportunity, as fights never feel that big and the questline can be dusted off in about 30 minutes, which is massively disappointing. Guilds are definitely stripped back from Morrowind, due to the removal of skill barriers between the low and high ranks. Although this means that the player will be able to see everything, it means that unless you force yourself to roleplay, you can see everything on a single character. This is something even Skyrim dodged with its Civil War questline. This becomes even more self-defeating if you originally played it on the XBOX 360, and you were allowed to pick up every achievement on a single character.The Shivering Isles expansion included is brilliant. You have to play it more than once to see everything, and although a bit short, gives a far more varied world than Cyrodiil to explore, and Sheogorath and the residents of the isles have fun, over-exaggerated personalities that fit perfectly with the theme of madness and misery the expansion is going for.Overall, Oblivion has very nice ideas. The best ideas of Skyrim seemed to appear here, albeit somewhat under-developed, and although not as focused as Morrowind, it still maintained the RPG gameplay that Bethesda seems glad to phase out more and more as they release more games themselves. Worth a buy, and with mods, just like all the other popular Bethesda games, if it doesn't crash, you can go on and on, possibly even fixing your own personal problems with the game.

												★★★★☆""Live Another Life in Another World"".  If only every game could boast that as a key feature.  + Ragdolls+ Fitting music+ Captain Picard+ Optional difficulty+ Fast Travel & Quick Save+ Immersive and varied world+ Loot everything from everyone+ Interesting quests and locations+ Fully voiced endless NPC dialogue+ Countless ways to complete quests+ NPC and Faction relationships/alignment+ Unique and detailed spell crafting system+ Varied equipment, both visually and functionally+ NPCs.  While they can occasionally get laughable, this is probably the most alive NPCs have ever been.  They have schedules, they have conversations with eachother, they have unique appearances and stories, you can fully interact with all of them, and they react somewhat reasonably.  There isn't a single civilized NPC in this entire game that is just a copypaste non-interactive background filler, aside from maybe city guards.  + Considering this game is 10+ years old, the graphics hold up pretty well.  With a few extra settings forced on from your Nvidia control panel, it can even compete with most modern indie releases.  Aside from faces, ohgod the faces.  +- Can't kill important NPCs+- Mage is by far the best playstyle+- Levelup skill categories by using skills relevant to that category.  While this is an interesting idea, it causes some lame issues, like AFK running into a corner, or spamming spells at nothing to grind exp.  - UI is painfully clunky- Inventory weight limit- 3rd person is not viable- Graphic performance varies greatly, between 30 and 300 FPS- So many ""come back tomorrow"" quests, which don't even update when tomorrow is ready* Mods			",302,25,6,60,22,1,51

Pros:-Amazing open world gameplay-Beautiful graphics-Massive content-Comes on steam with all expansion content-Varying character build paths-The best thieves' guild plot arc-Oh come on, it's basically Skyrim Lite, just buy it already.Cons:-Persuasion wheel.  Ugh.-Horses are disappointing-Occasional voice acting issues-Occasional glitchesOverall: Skyrim lite.  Pre-Skyrim.  If you're here and you haven't bought this yet, but you got any amount of enjoyment out of any other Elder Scrolls game, just hit the purchase button.  The graphics are a little outdated but still beautiful.  The world is every bit as expansive as you might expect from an Elder Scrolls game, and honestly, I think I prefer a lot of the guild plots for this more than for Skyrim.Oblivion improves on so much of what was introduced in Morrowind, and when played, it's easy to see what was kept and refined for Skyrim.  The game is fun.  With a world this massive, and mechanics this complex, there are bound to be a few bugs.  And there are.  But they are remarkably far and few between for such a huge game, and the polish really shows.  My biggest gripe is when talking to an NPC, and the voice actor for the pre-assigned sound bytes changes between conversation topics.  You can't sound like an angry cowboy one moment and a hoity toity nobleman the next without ruining immersion.  This doesn't happen often either - but it sticks out enough to be memorable.Still, if you're here, you know what this is.  Just buy it.  Or wait for a sale.  But you owe yourself this experience if you ever loved playing any sort of role playing game in your life.  There's something here for everyone.Bottom Line: Obvious recommend.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I originally bought Oblivion because I couldn't afford Skyrim when it first came out, and this was on sale. I was immediately sucked into Tamriel, and I can honestly say that this game has aged immaculately. I did go on and play Skyrim for a long time, but Skyrim requires so many mods to fix lackluster questlines and glitches. Oblivion's only con is that the people's faces look like potatoes, but it's really not that big of a deal. The Oblivion quests that are available are so much more interesting; you really feel like you're there. It's so immersive and the writing is incredible. You don't have to force yourself to feel empathy for the Emperor, and this game is never too easy. I don't find myself looking for ways to make this game more immersive or interesting; I don't find myself searching for mods to fill the void left by poorly written quests and plotholes. I started playing Oblivion again because I wanted to see if I'd find it as interesting as the first time I played. I can tell you I'll be playing this again and again and again... 10/10 game. Worth every penny, and then some.			",52,17,1,14,9,0,3

Posted: June 22, 2016
												Oblivion was one of the first games I ever got for the Xbox 360, and remains my favorite in the series-- not as poorly aged as Morrowind, not as unnecessarily trimmed as Skyrim.  It has the core of the Elder Scrolls games intact, a memorable world, graphics that still hold up decently, and the full physics of the 7th gen Gamebryo engine.I sunk hundreds of hours into the game back on Xbox.  The thing is, I never even beat the game.  The main questline was interesting, and very well-done overall, but it pales in comparison to not just the amount but the quality of the sidequests and guilds.  That's something Skyrim simply hasn't impressed me in-- the quests all feel like their own set of explorations and fights, rather than ""go to x and kill y to get z.""  The quests of this game all feel like something special, whether it's reading from an old journal to follow the path to a lost village, jumping into a painting to find a missing person, or helping someone fake his death to avoid paying debts.  The sheer amount of variety and quality in each of these quests will give you massive amounts of content that, unlike Skyrim, are actually fun to carry out rather than an excuse to walk around a frozen tundra for a bit longer.That in general can summarize Oblivion; there's attention to detail in pretty much everything.  Those random burned-up books in Fallout 3?  Every single one of them is a text, fully written and readable, which can be collected.  Random plants you harvest?  Craftable into poisons and potions.  House you bought for a too-good-to-be-true price?  Secretly haunted by a necromancer!  There's always something to surprise you about the game, whether it's just how much of the world you interact with or some of the downright strange things that can be found.Even the random events can completely catch you off guard.  While walking to Weynon Priory with the priest from Kvatch (early part of the main quest), I came across a regular looking cabin in the middle of the forest, with no-one around.  When I walked in, there were skeletons everywhere inside and a charred corpse on the furnace.  This has nothing to do with the rest of the game, is never explained, and completely caught me off guard.  This was 8 years after first playing the game!  There are other strange things you'll come across, but the less spoiled, the better.Speaking of strange, the Shivering Isles DLC is included with these versions of the game.  That's important, as the Shivering Isles is a massive DLC.  Originally going for $30 alone on Xbox Live, the DLC adds a massive new map and storyline where you get thrown into a world that's downright insane.  Two new sets of armor and weapons, memorable and insane characters, even more great quests, and overall just a brilliant addition to the game.  While I haven't played Knights of the Nine, and little needs to be said of the Horse Armor that you don't know already, the DLC for this game based on that alone is fantastic.Overall, what makes Oblivion special is that it holds up.  Yes, the combat can feel a bit spongy, but Skyrim has a very similar problem with its enemies.  Unlike Morrowind, the combat has a very important part: consistency.  No more RNG hit-and-missing, no more weapons divided into a thousand different types; the skills, gameplay, and controls finally make sense, especially compared to Morrowind and Daggerfall.  Even the visuals are great, though as a now decade-old game, you should expect some pop-in and lifeless faces with Bethesda's infamous awkward zoom-in angles that thankfully aren't present in Fallout 4.So yes, I do recommend Oblivion-- quite easily, in fact.  It's still to this day one of my favorite games of all time, and I don't know why I waited so long to start playing it again.  I've picked an entirely different build from my old character, and was honestly surprised at just how different of a game it feels like now.  This game has not only aged well, but compared to its other entries now stands out as an example of how to make an open-world game timeless.			",220,27,4,11,15,2,25

												The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion is an absolutely great title and is one of, if not, the best titles in the Elder Scrolls series. Oblivion was my very first introduction to the Elder Scrolls and I enjoyed the game so very much from start to finish. The sense of immersion along with the well balanced gameplay and epic storyline was quite enjoyable for a roleplaying enthusiast like me. This title is so chock full of adventure and combat that it will keep you busy for hour upon hour which will eventually compile into weeks and months before you realize it. Graphically, you have to remember that this title was released quite a few years ago, it pales in comparison to some of todays RPG's but even so I found the basic game to be quite beautiful with a uniqueness of it own that completely fits the fantasy world and story that it places you in. I said that graphically ""it pales in comparison to some of todays titles"" but I think this game still looks as good if not better than alot of the current roleplaying games available...this title was ahead of it's time and the work that the developers put into it definitely shows. Of course, as with many of Bethesdas RPG's, after you finish the basic game the first time you have the ability to modify the game to your liking for many more playthroughs by way of the Oblivion Nexus. You can mod the game from the start but I as well as others agree that playing through the base untouched game the first time is a wise thing to do. This title is simply fantastic and is highly recommended!!!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Legendary game it will always stay in my heart.Honestly if you want to start elder scrolls you should defiantly start from this one.I admit it doesn't has such great mechanics at combats as Skyrim has but it has better quest mechanics and the fact that it lets you make choices of what is going to happen its what makes this game amazing. Skyrim also has this but not as much as oblivion does.			",10,1,0,4,3,0,4

												Oblivion one of my favorite games of all time.Morrowind is were it all began and Skyrim is the result of years of refinement, but Oblivion is the ambitious middle game in the modern Elder Scrolls games. Why? I first started playing Oblivion about a year ago, this was after i played Skyrim.When i first started the game it felt a little off. The controls were weird the graphics and the animations were a bit lame.After i played it for a while i actualy noticed that this world felt much more alive than Skyrim.I forgot the time and it really gave me the drive to explore the game.The Quest were just unique from one another and there wasn't a single quest i thought was boring. When i was deep in the game i forgot about the animations and realised i actualy liked the graphics from Oblivion more. They are much more alive instead of all the depressing and boring snow from Skyrim.In terms of physical appearance Skyrim is ofcourse alot better, and well it does look nice but i actualy like the positive environment from Oblivion more.Its just such an awesome and fun game even today.You just have to get into it, and when you do you will not get out.I never know what to expect in this game and it always keeps me excited.If you have the money go buy it, i am so glad i started it once when i just was bored. Its totally worth it!Oblivion- Awesome questing - 14 Guilds - Positive and nice environment- Fun Combat - Amazing SoundtrackFor an old game, it just never ceases to amaze me every single time.

												Story? Great, but morrowind's was better.Gameplay? It has aged. I won't hide it. Skyrim really has better mechanics for basically everything, but this game is a lot simpler to pick up and has better quests and storylines.Atmosphere? Best out of the series. Although they couldn't afford to hire more than 8-12 voice actors.Graphics? Good for a game from 2006, but it still looks amazing on max settings. Still, graphics mods polish it.Physics? Try decorating your house. It's painful.Leveling up and build system? Complex, but dumbed down from Morrowind, for the better.Game length? Doing every quest and completing every guild + all the DLC = More than likely 200+ hours. Very rich.Better than Skyrim? Absolutely. But it has aged, and won't live up to the more modernized style of Skyrim.Has it aged well? Not quite, but you can still play it if it doesn't crash. From what I know, some cards actuall aren't compatable with the game. Mainly AMD cards, but see what cards can run this game before you buy it. It may be 20$ thrown out the window if your card isn't compatable.Most negative reviews are either about how it can't run on their computer or how people like it for nostalgia. Don't listen to those reviews. The game is well worth the 20$ if you are really into vintage games like this that are heavy with roleplay elements that aren't dumbed down.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion is one of the greatest games I have ever played. Made in 2006, the game still continues to amaze me, to this very day! Back those days, this game was considered as one with the most realistic graphics (Even today, they are not bad). And it was a HUGE leap from it's predecessor, Morrowind, by all accounts. But, of course, it is not perfect. Nothing is.Well, here's my pros and cons of this game:Pros: - the main storyline - the world's size and details- character customization- the guilds and their respective quests - the spells (better than Skyrim's if you ask me)   - the ability to make your own spells (Not available in Skyrim)- the look of the cities- the soundtrack- Mods, the possibilities are endlessCons: -  the lockpicking system! - armor and weapons can break and need repairing (OK, this is probably made to add realism, but I still find it annoying)- too little amount of voice actors- fast travel made it too easy (you have access to all the cities in the beginning so that really kills the exploration feeling)- combat was a bit dullBut despite it's minor flaws I still enjoy the game. And recommend.			",54,7,0,8,7,2,4

												Right after its release, Oblivion divided people on many patterns. I've heard friends who felt it was not a big step above Morrowind. In other words, they were disappointed with how little was changed. They wanted more of new game design decisions, and Oblivion, following all basic guidelines of the previous games, was not such a huge leap forward that someone expected. At the same time there were others, who felt lost and enraged with the amount of obscurities in compare with their beloved TES 3. ""Conspiracy of simplification"", some people called new trends, shown in the Oblivion. ""They trading deep, thoughtful gameplay for WOW moments!""...It's been almost a decade since then. We saw Skyrim, Fallout 3 & 4, many other open-world RPG and wanna-be RPG titles. While it's a common thought that Oblivion was not a bad game, the main question is - Is it worth something now? If you haven't played it before, by what conditions would you like that game and will be motivated to actually play it? Simply put - should you buy it now?In the line of Elder Scrolls games, despite common lore, every volume is quite unique. Morrowind goes with oriental motives, religious cults and huge, comprehensive and insane magic sandbox. Skyrim is about Nords, snows, dragons and their powers, and really huge open world to explore. Really, like hundreds of hours of adventuring...TES IV has its own focus - the Central province of Empire, being overrun with hordes of demons from the lower plane called Oblivion. The problems of central governance and very dramatic main storyline, with all adventuring and other freeride activities pushed away in favor of highly orchestrated quests. The Empire in perils, the one and only Emperor dead, along with all legal heirs... The high dosage of Pathos seems unavoidable. Is it a bad thing? No. The Oblivion still much more free-play oriented than, say, Dragon Age Origins or Witcher. And those ""orchestrated"" quests are not giving the feeling of moving in the narrow intestines of scenario where you're more of the observer rather than actual actor. Some of those quests will be memorized as perfect examples of quest-writing and performing. You know, the gold book of RPG quests, bonfires, fanfares, all that stuff...Sure, the creators of Oblivion dropped many of the gameplay mechanics that Morrowind fans were proud of. On other hand, we've got a world much more alive and reflecting with your actions, than it was before. All those things that were simply nailed to the one place in Morrowind, including god-like beings like Vivec - in Oblivion have not only a place to be, but the duties to perform and some logic to praise or disregard the course of current events in the game plot. Although... less static doesn't necessarily means good dynamics. It is safe to say that the world of Oblivion is not that capable for providing player with adventures as Skyrim. Besides main story line and some of fraction quests (like assassins or Daedric quest lines), some of us could even find that Oblivion is somewhat dull. On the contrary, the world of Skyrim is noticeably less colourful, so there certainly will be others, who like Oblivion More than Skyrim...You know that? You should try it for yourself. Placing yourself in the sabatons of the knight-by-fortune, saving the Empire from fires of Abyss...My mark will be 7.1/10. I'd give it more, would there not been all those useless pricy dlc's like shiny ""armored"" skin for horses. They downgraded my overall expression out of the game, but it is still a nice piece of work, well-worth of attention from any RPG fan.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This is my favorite Elder Scrolls game and one of my overall favorites! Bethesda pulled off the atmosphere in Oblivion better than Skyrim and even Morrowind. The factions and there questlines are amazing and story is rich with lore as always. You can make your own spells and create your custom class. Even though the main story is a little short, I enjoyed playing through it, the faction questlines, the daedric quests, and all of the others in between. The cities and towns are a decent size and some are beautiful! If you haven't played Oblivion, I strongly recommend you do! A vast map to explore, deep story, and many hours of fun and adventure!

												This game...what's there to say that hasn't been said?My steam hours on this game are pitiful, but my love and years with this game PREDATE steam.Sitting at the family computer at 10 years old in 2006, scared deathless of how dark the sewers in the prologue were.And I never stopped playing. Even 5 years later when Skyrim was released, I returned to Oblivion after Skyrim satisfied me.This game was my first RPG, it's home.RIGHT, sentimentals aside, how's the game:+ It looks amazing, there's something about the graphics style that even today stands out to me, despite the vast improvements graphics have made over the years.+ The soundtrack is honestly the single most beautifully composed game soundtrack of all time. Fantasy orchestral symphonies for every mood and atmosphere and moment.+ The story is fascinating and wonderful, plunging you deep into the world of Tamriel and all its rotating elements, from the seperate guilds to the conflicting gods and deities, with smatterings of political intrigue thrown in but not so much it feels heavy.+ The voice cast is just absolutely stellar, the celebrity castings of Patrick Stewart, Sean Bean, Terence Stamp, and others, still standing out as spectacular work. They are a voice cast deserving of better facial rigging software than they were given.+ Fully customizable fantasy RPG character developments. Laid out and easily manageable and, if you desire, exploitable.I'd give a negative list, but honestly, I love the flaws in this game:+ The ragdolls are ridiculous. I love them.+ The character models are so, god, damn, ugly. I love them.+ BY AZURA BY AZURA BY AZURA. IT'S THE GRAND CHAMPION.+ Among the scariest facial rigging I've ever seen in a game. Many of the expressions wrenched out by certain lines of dialogue, haunt me.+++ The absolute best piece of DLC ever created for a game. Ever. Shivering Isles.Rating: 10/10 Still wishing Bethesda updated this instead of the far newer Skyrim. Seriously Bethesda. Wtf.			",78,13,0,13,19,0,19

												It's taken a long time for me to think of the correct words I wanted to use to describe Oblivion.I first played Oblivion on my friends Xbox 360 and was immediately hooked - I went straight to our local game store (Our town still had one in those days) and in there was a guy who was being made by his parents to sell all of his games to cover his ridiculous phone bill that he had wracked up, it was hundreds of pounds. I got his copy, a battered old case with a cigarette burn on the cover. And I loved it. It was probably the game I spent most time on, ever, on my good old 360. Now that I have evolved into one of the PC master race, it was time to do it all over again.Now, I will start here with Oblivion's flaws. For as much as I like it, it does have them and it would be unfair not to mention them. As the game world itself is huge, of course the associated bugs and glitches come with them. There are hundreds, and I suspect not all of them have been found. Some of them are quest breaking and some of them are literally game breaking, so they can be highly frustrating. On PC, this is not so much of an issue due to the all godly console commands. Combat is clunky, and especially in melee combat - you can get stuck in a hit cycle from multiple enemies and just have no way of defending yourself. The voice acting in itself is quite literally a cultural phenomenon. Yahtzee (our lord and saviour from Zero Punctuation) was 100% accurate when he described characters talking, to themselves, about the shop, owned by themselves. Its a solid attempt at a procedurally generated NPC conversations but it just falls short of the mark. The speech skill/persuasion is baffling in this game, and often I just ended up bribing people to tell me what I wanted.It hasn't aged terribly well in line with modern RPGs, but this does not matter to me so much - however, this could be an issue if graphics are your marker of a good game. The upcoming Skyblivion mod will seek to remedy this, and good luck to the development team on this - if you're ever in the UK, I'll buy you a drink. It does occasionally crash for no reason, but that could just be my particular set up.I could sit here and write pages about why I love Oblivion, so I won't. Its not just a game, its an experience. It is a lush, huge world with many different areas to wander, and has hundreds of dungeons, forts, caves, even shipwrecks to explore.  The quests and quest writing is miles above other Elder Scrolls games, the guilds in particular are fantastic - The Dark Brotherhood blows Skyrim's out of the water. I've never managed to complete all of the quests, I still find new NPCs, locations and quests to this day. It has a good chunk of DLC available - including the much derided horse armour (Seriously, give it a search - it was a bit of a mess). However, the available content also includes the legendary Shivering Isles DLC, often considered to be one of the best ever DLC packages made. It adds well over 30 hours of new content, and its not just new weapons or armour but an entire new world to explore, set in the Alice in Wonderland-esque realm of Sheogorath. That, Bethesda, is how you should be doing it. I'll stop gushing now. Seriously, if you let it drag you under - you won't come out for weeks. Cheese for everyone!			",21,4,0,9,15,0,13

												Oblivion is my favourite game and in my opinion the greatest game of all time. When i first picked up a copy of oblivion i was only interested in FPS games. After putting in the disc and hearing the theme song  i knew this was something special. I watched the beautiful intro spanning over the imperial city in awe. I dived head on into the character creation and spent a good half an hour tampering with these (at the time) weird and facinating races. I chose a nord and proceeded through the tutorial, talking to Patrick Stewart's Uriel Septim and feeling some importance. My first battle was with the rats at the crumbling door that took me by surprise but i still won. I proceeded through the dungeon slaying beasts and looting as i went. I saw the death of Uriel which still tugs on my heart strings to this day.i remember leaving the sewer for the first time and just being in awe, the beauty of cyrodiil is unmatched to this day. The size of the cities dumbfounded me. There are critisims for them being too generic however I love the way they look it feels medival yet fantasy. I remember seeing the imperial city and being taken a back. i plowed through the oblivion gates which are a stellar contrast to the soft features of cyrodiil.after completion of the campaign i felt lost, i didnt know what to do, (the ending is very sad). Luckily the side quests had enough ti keep me entertained for hours on end, as with the lore. With over 1000 hours of gameplay compared to my 800 in morrowind and 200 on skyrim it is safe to say this is my prefferd elder scrolls.sometimes i like to turn it on and just walk through the forest with the enchanting sound track and just reminice. i beyond reccomend this game			",15,0,0,2,1,0,0

												I hope I dont get hate for this, but i think this game is better then skyrim. Skyrims gameplay is 10x better, and all the systems for leveling up and all that, but the oblivion story oh my god... Wether its stealing back some jumbo potatos to a mad kajhitt, to saving the world from a giant demon, you choose your own path. If oblivion was remade with skyrim style gameplay, then it would be the best game in the world. Just oblivions quest are capabul of making you laugh, so i would really reccomend this game!

												This is the best of the Elder Scrolls, from a time where the Role Playing actually mattered in RPGs. This game was also a turning point for the franchise, settling on the middle ground between completely unguided character exploration and a little bit of as helping hand from the game itself. An absolutly amazing gameplay experience awaits you in Cyrodiil, the heart of Tamriel's Empire, and when you have finished there, you can venture into the Shivering Isles to experience one of the best DLC's ever made. Period. I cannot explain the glorious nastalgia I feel everytime I hear the theme to this work of art. 10/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Only a few hours in, and although there aren't too many character customization options like Skyrim does. Ho-ly crap does it make up for the tons of content. I feel like this is the Fallout 3 to Fallout 4, whereas the newer game dumbed down the game a little to cater towards more players, but the earlier one has much better gameplay overall.3 hours in, and planning on more, as much as my statements probably don't count, considering low playtime. I do reccomend this game, and while it may be confusing at first if you've already played Skyrim, its super addicting.Please, do yourself a favor, and if you have a life, don't buy this game, but if you don't like the rest of us basement dwellers, pick it up, its totally worth the price.

												Oblivion may not be as advanced as Skyrim, but in my opinion it's still much better. When you join a guild or faction in Oblivion, you slowly work your way up to the top. When you join a guild in Skyrim, you are super important right from the start. For example, The Dark Brotherhood in Skyrim has you as the listener right after the first couple of grunt quests. In Oblivion, you don't become the listener until the very end, after you've poured your heart and soul into completing every quest. This is just one example, all of Skyrim's guilds are like this. Oblivion makes you work for your success, its storyline is better, and the overall feel of it is much more memorable. Skyrim is a good game, Oblivion is a FANTASTIC game, 10/10 would erase my memory and play Oblivion all over again. So before you buy any other game, STOP RIGHT THERE CRIMINAL SCUM, get Oblivion GOTY Edition.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Oblivion has to be my favourite elder scrolls game. this is despite a long list of flaws, including: poor character models, an incipid lockpicking minigame, lack of dungeon variety, horrifically bad dialogue assignment, generic npcs, bugs, poor optimisation, and only one Patrick Stewart. It's strengths lie in it's excellent story telling, incredible art design, and possibly one of the best dlcs of all time in the form of the ''Shivering Isles''. Oblivion manages to suck hours of your life away with each session. So don't buy this game if you have an infant to care for or it will probably starve.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												This was my first ES game... and what a game it is! There is no other game where I could just be lost in as much as this one.Everything about it is just MAGICKAL, this fantasy world grabbed me by the shoulder and it presented me with this amazing story and lore! But, somehow, I feel it brought me more than just that, something I cannot describe right now... maybe its just nostalgia talking? I do not know. Maybe there is something to do with the countless hours I spent just thinking about how Tamriel works and creating countless stories about random people and recreating the main stories with concrete characters just so I can proceed to playing the game interpreting them. Well, we'll never know. Shout out to the guys who made Morroblivion, this mod brings the God-tier (literaly) Elder Scrolls: Morrowind to the graphics of Oblivion, thank you for making me experience that!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Bethesda Softworks has made a name for itself by making games that were WAY too ambitious for their time.Oblivion is no exception, when i escaped the first dungeon, after fighting for my life against some cult known as the Mythic Dawn, i had absolutely no idea what to do next! And the great thing is, i didn't have to do anything. Oblivion is the sort of game where you are encouraged to walk the woods picking up daisies or to go hunting deer. There are so many things to do! If you are someone who is new to the fantasy/rpg genre and eager to get your feet wet, then Oblivion is for YOU!Enjoy :-)			",39,2,0,8,5,0,1

												Oh Oblivion, Oblivion, Oblivion you are such a ♥♥♥♥ing good game.A perfect game in many respects.Do yourself a favour, and admit this is bethesdas ultimate RPG, more of an RPG than Skyrim and groundbreaking in many ways.This game is not only extremely ahead of its time, but is an instant classic. I don't think a fantasy RPG could come close to what this game can do considering it was almost 10 years ago.Considering the original pc version, xbox 360 version offline hours on this I must have played 800 hours-1000 hours over the years. And I could still easily play this game and find something new.From its rich world and cities that just feel.. right.. real.. to its radiant AI system and the main quest being enjoyable while being rather questionable.This is easily one of my most favourite games ever and likely always will be.

												I've been playing this game since release date. This many years on I am still addicted. My hours of gameplay time only reflect my playtime since buying the Steam copy in 2014.If there is any game I could call perfect; it's this. As a long-time Elder Scrolls fan, dating back to Morrowind on Xbox, Oblivion is my favourite game in the series; and in the world.Nothing will ever compare to the beauty of this game, no graphical or combat improvements will ever change how I feel about TESIV: Oblivion.If you're someone looking to play this as you started on Skyrim or ESO, all I can say is GIVE IT A CHANCE! You're never a true Elder Scrolls fan if you don't like Morrowind OR Oblivion. Only REAL fans like these games. I shall never accept anyone saying this game is bad if they have only played Skyrim or ESO. Because you are noobs and aren't open minded.TAMRIEL AE DAEDROTH!I love you, Oblivion. xxxxxxxxxx			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												It says I only have 3.5 hours on this (as of written review), but that's through launching it with steam, I've sunk at least one thousand on my old 360 back in 06-07.I know more people are familiar with skyrim, so if you've played skyrim and want to check out oblivion, here are some things you need to know.-Lock picking system is very different and can be much more challenging at the higher ranked locks.-All the npc's kinda look fat and ugly. (you'll have to get used to it)-The terrain is a lot more lush with green forests, not like skyrims winter tundra.-Every NPC ♥♥♥♥ing hates your guts and doesn't suck your♥♥♥♥♥♥ You're no dragonborn here, your practically a nobody until the near end of the game.-No duel weild magic and swords.-Dark Brotherhood, at least I think, is a lot more fleshed out with better quests.-Modding community is not as alive as skyrim (but it's there) and oblivion doesn't have the steam workshop supporting it. You'll have to use nexus if you want to mod, although the vanilla game is tolerable.-Voice acting I thought was a lot nicer, I can only hear that one male nord voice for so long.There are plenty of other differences but to me both games are just as good even with their differences.9/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												What is there to say about Oblivion, aside from it possibly being the last great RPG that Bethseda has made, or possibly ever get around to making. It comes from a time when Bethseda was changing markets, from PC based RPG's, to more casual easy to pick up games. It also came at a time when games were first marked with the treachery known as DLC. It would be a lie to say that Oblivion does not suffer from this casualization to some degree, the forefront simply being that system requirements for consoles forced the devs to reduce content in a lot of areas. namely spells such as levitation or jump from Morrowind as players would be able to fly over city walls that simply had to be closed off. It also brought along click and go fast travel. Morrowind was all about exploration, getting lost and killed was all part of the game. This lost feeling never really happened with Oblivion. However, along the lines, Bethseda never really was sure about everything. they still had proper enchanting and spellmaking, they still had very good quests and something that Skyrim was never given. Character building. Simply being able to set up your character made the game feel whole. Bethseda's has always been bad with supergod main characters over agent of change characters for RPG's... but in the sense of the universe, it makes sense, for who the character is. Skyrim didn't give you the opportunity to set up your character. You could be anything. Oblivion, you could be anything as well, but at least you still had skills you were mastered in, attribute's about your person you can change. Morrowind, you better make damn sure to use the skills you started with until you had the gold to start training in them. before that, well, you better select some Magic skills if you wanna even talk to someone from the Mage's guild. And the quests. If I said gravekeeper would you know who I was talking about? what about this 50 gold for a set of nice silverware. mother? Ayleid statues?Cheese, Yarn and lettuce? if you don't, well, you should. if you haven't played it, you would instantly know why you remember these once you do. because, unlike future games. questing involved questing. not going into a dungeon dodging skinwalking jerky geezers who occasinally yell at you so hard you roflcopter the floor whilst saving the day from bad dragon. or another settlement needs our help.

												Dear God This is a BEAUTIFUL GAME. The Gameplay, The Feel, The Intensity,The story,... THE WORLD. Oblivion is a truley aspiring and wonderful addition to the great Elder Scrolls Saga. in my own opinion , Oblivion dominates over its very successful predecessors, those of which all have thier own very unique and lovable aspects and styles while still maintaining the entire feel of the series. Although I have played (with intense Love) Skyrim for many years (even after playing the entire Vanilla + the DLCs) I find my self going back to the one before, OBLIVION. when I play in this world, i feel a greater response to the environment of the game and what it offers than that of which I do in pretty much any other game. Aside from my personal view, Oblivion (for its time) had exceptional graphics and overall quality,compared to the games of our later generations, it still rocks the boat, (and seems to still be loved pretty much the same if not more than when it was in its new released years, ((when it was brand new)) .I love the Game, Thats all I need to say, but if ya wanna hear a better response than this ^ just message me.-SaltE60			",6,0,0,1,0,0,1

Posted: December 10, 2014
												I have been wanting to review this for a while on Steam. When I first picked this game up in 2007 for the Xbox 360, I fell in love with The Elder Scrolls at a level Morrowind could never install upon me.62 hours played? That's on the Steam version. I have well over 1500 hours invested in this game. And there is STILL a bit more ccontent I haven't covered.  Mostly small things, like fetch quests and in 100% honesty I have never gotten around to finishing the Knights of the Nine DLC.Visually, the game hasn't aged very well. Combat wise, the game is rather simplistic. Let's talk about those.Now I usually don't take visuals too seriously, but keep in mind a game of this scope back in 2006 didn't have high requirements for visuals. A lot of people complain that the faces of most of the human races look really odd with questionable colouring, and that Orcs just look like green humans with different lips and teeth. Completely true. However, that doesn't really do much to your immersion, in the long run. The enviroments are huge, the number of running proceses overturns the 300 mark, and in 2006 you couldn''t have good graphics, a huge world AND good performance all at the same times as loading areas smoothly and quickly with no FPS drops. For what it has to work with, the visuals at the time were very good. Well done, lads.Segmenting towards gameplay, let's talk about the combat. If you have played Morrowind, it will feel dumbed down, if you have played Skyrim it will feel rigid and overly fast-paced. The combat AI is pretty bad. I'll give you a rundown of every enemy's AI:Melee Weapon equipped, no Shield.:If the enemy is visible, attack it. Between every 3-5 basic attacks, use one of 3 power attacks. If low on fatigue or have just used a power attack, block for a few seconds. Successful block means it's time to basic attack 2-4 times. Restart cycle. Never block if you are a monster like a zombie, troll or bear, but do block if you are a Ogre, Spider Daedra or Mountain Lion.Melee Weapon and Shield: If the enemy is visable, charge in. Do same formula as with no shield equipped, but block before each cycle and power attack if the opponant attacked you while blocking.Ranged Weapon:Fire when visable. Step aside between each shot. If enemy is close, switch to melee weapon if one is in inventory. Magic User:If it breathes, cast a spell at it. If it is close, use a touch spell. Use melee weapon when they are close, then back up after 1 cycle. Yeah, not the smartest combat AI ever. If they have a low movement speed, you can literally just kite them with a longsword, spell or bow, and they will never once change tactics. Bad AI is bad. But when not in combat, they are generally interesting. They react to your crimes, reporting them to he guards or shrugging it off depending on how much they like you and what factions you belong to, and each and every civilized NPC has a full in-game month's worth of routines - shopping, sleeping, talking, running around on a horse until they get killed by highwaymen... very detailed stuff. The rest of the gameplay is what makes up for the poor combat. Oblivion was designed as a story and world-centric RPG, rather than a combat-based one. You can spend 200 hours just shopping and decorating your house alone. Did I say ""house""? I meant ""houses"". There's 8 of them, without DLC. I personally wish the Shivering Isles Expansion - the biggest expansion for the game - had a house you can buy within the Shivering Isles. It's a new map to explore, with crazy good quest lines, and possibly the best Daedric Prince of them all, Sheogorath, Prince of Madness. Let me give you some of his Scottish-voiced lines:""I once dug a pit and filled it with clouds....or was it clowns.... it doesn't matter, it didn't slow him down. But it really began to smell! Must have been clowns. Clouds don't smell, they taste of butter. And tears.""""I'm a little busy here! I'm trying to decide what to have for dinner. Oh, how I love to eat. One of my favorite things to do. Go talk to Haskill, he's got more brains than a brain pie! Ooh...brain pie... perfect! ...Care to donate?""""Wonderful! Time for a celebration... Cheese for everyone! Wait, scratch that. Cheese for no one. That can be just as much of a celebration, if you don't like cheese, true? You've run a maze like a good little rat. But no cheese for you yet. Well, maybe a little.""Sheogorath is a riot. He'll keep you coming back trial after trial, just to hear some of his amazing rants. He's easily my favourite Elder Scrolls character.You cannot trade between shops to earn income like in Fable, which is unfortunate, but also stops getting the best items early from being too easy. However, with a lot of trading done, you can buy and sell for the exact same price, making late-game adventuriing fill you up with so much cash that you won't have anything to do with it all... except buy more houses and fill them with the rarer spoils of your journeys.The map, like I mentioned, is HUGE. the outter map is almost the same exact size as Skyrim, however there are much, much more dungeons and caves to explore. The map is litered with them, all of  them unique in one way or another. I just there were more old forts and ruins with bandits and marauders instead of monsters, vampires and spectral-kind. Finding the correct armour peices can take quite a long time. Needless to say, at the very least this gives you more incetive to explore. Once you finish a dungeon, don't forget about it entirely. Give it a few in-game weeks and the place will be full of new inhabitants, ready to be cleared out of your favourite treasure trove once more. Class specifications can be a bit... pointless. 90% of the time, unless you are hardcore into RPing, the best class is a Thief-Battlemage-Assassin-Warrior-Illusionist-Bard-Healer. Yeah... lategame you just kind of stop specializing because there is a poor integration for choosing your specific, well-thought custom class. You eventually will just start specializing in everything, rather than being solely a mage or a theif. Because  the game is so unstructured, the only way to get your perfect fantasy is to handicap yourself with strict RP rules.Speaking of RP, this game is a goldmine of oppurtunities. I have been streaming my RP playthrough of a theif who uses non-combat magic to get away with his endeavors. Using Invisbility spells to pass by unnoticed, life-detection to know where the enemies are behind walls, and should I run into a pickle, I can dice them up and place them on a hamburger with my dagger fit for Chef Ramsey. (I don't know how Chef would respond to a Argonian Meat Burger, but I'd imagine it would be something like ""THIS LIZARD IS SO UNDERCOOKED A SKILLED VETERINARIAN COULD STILL SAVE HIM!"") You can live a life as a dashing warrior, a powerful wizard, a simple townsfolk who is secretly the guy murdering all of the beggars and sucking their blood from the neck... you name it, you cann RP it. Except Werewolf. Sorry, Twilight fans, no re-enacting New Moon for you. Oh, and tons of small bugs. Double-equip a scroll that you have multiple of and drop an item. Bam, unlimited gold if you sell them, and duplicates of your favourite decorations. A few rare, but still present, glitches that make quests uncompletable. The game is massive, the game is immersive, the game is unbalanced. The game is exciting, the game is relaxing. My wife's legs really need waxing. I do like this game, Sam I Am.A solid 9/10 Final Verdict. The game hasn't been aging well, so play it while it's still a technical marvel. Not out-of-date yet, but then, what or who truely marks a game as timeless?			",139,35,3,29,13,0,9

												First off, I own Oblivion as a non-Steam game and I've spent well over 75 hours playing it.Secondly, this is probably my favorite game ever made. It's definitely on my top five games ever. Oblivion was my first Elder Scrolls game, so the outdated graphics and gameplay didn't bother me even though I got it in 2014. The combat is basically like slicing butter, but it's fun. I love how vibrant and human the ""potato-head"" NPCs are, and how colorful Cyrodiil and the Shivering Isles are. The soundtrack is the best ever for any game. I actually bothered to purchase it on iTunes.Oblivion is a game I'd want to live in.Buy it. Buy it now. Even the horse armor.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												After playing Oblivion, I can see why many people love this game. It has many features missing from Skyrim, such as equipement decay and spell making (that's awesome). One thing I don't like about it, is the combat, it's very slow, and well I like faster combat. The quests are very nice and creative, such as the one where you go inside a painting. The guild quests are very nice. The Fighter's Guild was very boring in my opinion (The Companions had a better questline), the Mage's Guild was okay (The College of Winterhold is sort of similar), the Thieve's Guild actually made me feel like a thief, the Dark Brotherhood was also nice with lots of twists and murders. Then you have two great DLCs, one with a short but good story with good rewards and the big one that gives you a new land, weapons, spells and laughs. Buy this game, don't let its age fool you (there's plenty of mods to change your mind).			",48,3,2,9,1,0,1

Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing.			",74,4,3,10,9,0,2

												(This review is going to be astronomically long, so bear with me! TL:DR; is at the end.)I remember the first time I played Oblivion. It was at a friend's house when I was seven, back in 2007. I didn't understand it much, but I got to watch him play it on his old television and I got a small turn for a while. Eventually, I got my first Playstation 3 in 2009. Oblivion was one of the first games I ever bought for the system.Between the endless interesting quests, to the big open world that was the best for it's time, it was one of the best experiences in video gaming that I have ever experienced.Now it's 2017, and I have just started playing Oblivion again.I have two hundred or so hours on the retail version, and roughly 30 hours on the Steam version. Time and time again I find myself returning to Oblivion just to play through the Dark Brotherhood questline or to just explore all the dungeons and forts that the game had to offer.I would even daresay that this game beats Skyrim. Skyrim's graphics are certainly much better, but to me, the game dumbed down on a lot of the elements that made Oblivion great, including a mediocre story, poorly made (and much less) side-quests and a broken vanilla follower system.But enough about Skyrim, this is about Oblivion. I'm going to list all of the positives, negatives and other features that are a little in-between.POSITIVES+ Excellent main story.+ A plethora of side-quests that are even better then some of the main quests.+ The Thieves Guild and the Dark Brotherhood's questlines are excellent.+ Good controls.+ The Shivering Isles and Knights of the Nine are EXCELLENT DLCs and NEED to be purchased with this game.+ An all-star acting cast who do a very great job at their roles.+ Very well detailed dungeons, forts and caves.+ Many different cities with dozens of quests, along with many interesting characters.+ A lot of well-written books inside the game.+ Many different weapons to choose from.+ Customise your own class and what skills level up your character.+ A lot of spells to choose from, including many other ones that can be bought.+ The Mage Guild and the Fighters Guild. Their questlines were pretty good, however, they didn't return in their same form in Skyrim. The Companions in Skyrim represented the Fighter's Guild and the College of Winterhold represented the Mage Guild.+ An amazing soundtrack. From the quiet songs while you're trading with a merchant in the Imperial City, to the heart-wrenching song playing when you enter an Oblivion gate, this soundtrack is quite possibly the best in the Elder Scrolls series.+ Weapon degradation. You can use repair hammers to repair your weapons, where in Skyrim, you couldn't do that.+ Alchemy. I enjoyed the alchemy in this game a lot, especially when I needed to upgrade my Alchemy tools whenever I levelled higher!+ The voice acting is on-par with 2017 video games to date. With the famous 'Lucien Lachance' scene being one of the best scenes in the entire game, just because of how the actor portayed Lucien in that very scene.+ The visuals are pretty damn good. Skyrim's visuals were excellent, but felt very drab. Oblivion's visuals were perfect for how many players envisioned Cyrodil. From the beautiful green trees, to the snow near the Blade's temple at Bruma, the scenary and visuals are excellent.+ The end of the main quest. The end is very well done, and it's short and simple. Much better than Skyrim's in my opinion.+ The Arena. It may be repetitive sometimes, but for me, this was one of the best questlines in the entire game (taking a back-seat to the Dark Brotherhood). From the Gray Prince realising his true identity, to the many battles you will have to win to become the 'Grand Champion', this is another reason why Oblivion is so good.+ Random encounters. They may be less of them than Skyrim, but coming across a Highwayman when crossing a bridge near the Imperial City, or M'aiq the Liar outside of Leyawiin, I just found more enjoyment in those encounters.+ The Ayleid Ruins. Skyrim tried to replicate the Ayleid Ruins with the Dwemer Ruins. To me, I found them a lot less interesting than the Ayleid Ruins in Oblivion. The beautiful arcitecture and design, (along with the value of all the Welkyd stones that you could collect) made them a lot more fun to explore, then Skyrim's substitute.I think that covers all of the positives. Now, onto the features that are a little positive, and a little negative.AVERAGE~ All of the guards have the same voice actor, so good luck trying to find a certain guard if it involves a quest.~ The game stutters infrequently (at least for me) and it breaks immersion.~ The AI isn't very good, especially the Bandit and Mage AI, where they will just run right into my blade instead of being tactical or running away.~ Glarthir. That entire quest is absolute garbage. The only thing that's good about it, is being able (you can choose not to) kill him and take the reward.~ Merchants seem to have infinite gold. It makes no sense that if a Merchant has 800 gold, you can sell 795 gold worth of potions to them, and be able to sell them more as long as you keep the amount to under 800. The gold never depletes!~ Lucien LaChance's ending. I don't want to talk about that.~ I'm not going to say that the Zombies are hyper-realistic, but they are too scary for me.Now...onto the negatives.NEGATIVES- The UI. It is clearly designed with the Console in mind, and it can be extremely frustrating and sometimes un-usable due to it's awful inventory interface and merchant inventory interface. The only way to really use it, is if you download a UI mod for the game from the Nexus.- Levelling up. Being able to level up your stats while you're sleeping? Overall, the levelling up system is good, but I just found it really curious as to why we need to sleep to level up.- The Lockpicking. It is a good minigame, but the problem with it is, you can just Quicksave in front of a locked door, then reload whenever you are caught or break a lockpick.- The intense lag. The game can range from 30 to 200 FPS (only up to 90 in my case, and that's with a GTX 970). For a game that is over ten years old, intense lag in some places (such as Bravil or the Arena) is unnacceptable. Download mods to fix this and greatly reduce your lag.- The Adoring Fan. You know what I'm talking about if you've finished the Arena questline.- Invisible walls. Like in Skyrim, Oblivion has a LOT of invisible walls. Couldn't big mountains have been put in place to force the player to stop and not be able to hit an invisible wall? The only positive to this, is that when mods open up new lands to explore (Elsweyr Arquenia, etc), all you need to do is disable the invisible walls.- The fame and infamy system. Fame isn't such a problem to me, as it makes a lot of sense, but infamy seriously annoys me. I want to be able to complete the Dark Brotherhood and Thieves Guild questline, but I can't because each mission or murder grants you infamy (even when nobody sees you doing these crimes) and eventually, guards will attack on sight if your infamy is high enough.That's all I could think of.Oh, also, a massive positive.MODS. Enough said.TL:DR; Oblivion is an amazing game and is the best Elder Scrolls in the franchise and it is definitely worth picking up (ASWELL AS THE DLCs) and should not be missed at any cost. It overcomes it's shortcomings with an amazing story, world and cast of characters, that are unforgettable.GET. THIS. GAME.			",88,18,0,14,12,0,2

However, if old graphics are a problem to you then this game might lose some of it's magic. Also the voice acting wasn't done with the best budget ever.

												This is probably the best Elder Scrolls game ever. It has very nice looking graphics and all...The main storyline is awesome.There are several factions like The Dark Brotherhood, Thieves Guild, Mages guild and The Fighters Guild that you can join.Also there is a lot of side guests to do.There is an arena you go and fight on or then you can go and wager on it.There is a lot looting to do and caves to rob...You can also make your own potions, enchant items and make your own spells!You can buy and decorate houses as you like or then you can just break into someone else's house and pretend it's yours...You can get robbed too.You can kill people stealthly with poison apples...Or then you could just go hunting or just talk to everyone...And if you have Game of the Year Edition Deluxe you will have many awesome DLC's too.The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion: 10/10 Best game of 2006 and one of the best games of all time.

												An epic, truly epic. Of all proportion  The game will draw you in and take you into its self, it is so immersive and in my opinion the greatest of all role playing games. The feel is so geniune, so original and so magical.. it's like watching a medieval fantasty film from perhaps the seventies.. if you can imagine that and have a splendid feeling, then you must be interested.  There is no comparison to this. Absolutley not. It is far too spectacular in its glory for that. Now you must understand that this game brought me into the world of role playing games, my favored genre, for their humming realism and grand feats of imaginative speldour, I got the game of the year edition, and that disk span in my xbox for well over well, my save game had 657 or so days there. I would say around three thousand hours I have played Oblivion.  Now one who has the skill to tell a detailed tale of their adventures in life may do so wonderfully. I belive it would take me much more practice to do enough justice that would suit my liking to this game. I will only ramble on at things that come into my mind.  So for the overall aestheics... oh man. words really cannot do justice on this. It is something very very special. Now this does give me nostalgia and so I am being biasedly complementary here, I remember the smells of snack food like oranges and the smell of meat and pasta, or any other combination.. and dust.. dust gives me much nostaligia of earlier days. This goes well with the theme, a quite colourful and dainty civilisation, obvious fantasy articles and easy lovely heads up display : ). Please man, if you like, check out a video of some menial gameplay from someone else, to get a feel of what this is like  I shall get into some gameplay descritions now, (which I must say are not entirely top notch) as I say, you must be imaginitive! That is the magic touch, for me at least.. well they go so well if you add your own self to it :), so they work simply, and add no mess, like they are working real time and are a glance at the world, moving you ever further.  Now I hope I do not have to tell you what you can do! As with many other games of its kind, you can... go foraging in the forest for example, find fruits & berry leaves for example, and go to a station of which you can work to boil up potions... you can do the vast array as normal, with no taints, no faults.  I am telling you, this is a super extrodinary game. A pioneer! I suggest that you must own this game, you know there is a balance of, mountains and snow, swamp and rivers, grassy hills with nearby caves, farmland and noble cities.. creatues galore, none out of place or without a story intertwined. The serenity.  Oh my I could call this perfect. I do love it. Well that is all I shall say, for if you do not know of The Elder Scrolls then, I say get to.			",336,68,5,47,19,3,18

												I would like to start this out saying I played Skyrim before I played this.  I went in with Skyrim is my favorite game ever.  Now i'm torn.  Even with Skyrims overall gameplay and graphics being better (due to it being a newer game), I still think Oblivion is a tad bit better.  The quests are better.  Which does it for me.  The Dark Brotherhood and Thieves Guild quests are soooo much fun.  You are able to immerse yourself in the world that is Tamriel so easily.  Sure there's like..7 voice actors.  But I don't care.  The one complaint I have about this game is that it isn't controler compatible on PC.  I prefer mouse and keyboard, but sometimes my boyfriend is using the desk and I am unable to play.

												Let me give you an idea of how my first hour outside the tutorial went.Talked to 7th person seen so far.Gave sidequest.12 Slaughterfish scales.Explore lake for 10 minutes, attempting to find slaughterfish.Notices quest marker pointing to slaughter fish.Kills slaughterfish for 30 minutes.Goes back to NPC, Expects crap reward.Gets ring with unlimeted water breathing and +2 Athletics.Is happy.Now, Let's compare this to my first hour of skyrim.Kills chicken.Entire town attacks.Reload.Gets quest for claw.Goes to mountain.Gets claw and Dragonstone.>1.5 hours have passedClaims reward.Measily 100 gold.Goes to whiterun.Talks to JarlBecomes thaneGets♥♥♥♥♥♥enchanted leather armor.Goes on killing spree.You know, both of the games have their flaws and benifets but...I can see my self playing 650 hours on this game, Just like I did skyrim....But let's admit Oblivion did way more things right....

												Mini-Review for Oblivion, requested by an user.The question I've received: With skyrim having a great modding community, is there any reason to still pick up Oblivion?Well, Yes. But allow me to explain.Skyrim has the better graphics, better soundtrack, better combat, better ai, yada yada. All the stuff expected from having a better engine.While vanilla oblivion in itself can offer you a lot:A main quest that's of a grander scale as the one in Skyrim.Far, far more side quests.A plethora of explorable areas.Actually more in-depth factions, reputations and guilds.Better item distribution and item quality dispersion(when do you get this/that type).Enfin, the real question is: All that vanilla stuff is great, but it can be modded into skyrim as well!Well... Oblivion's mod-database is still far greater than the one skyrim has to offer as of now.Graphics and Music can be easily improved, especially in the realm of character textures.I'd personally also recommend many of the city overhauls and terrain improvements.However, the real treats are in the more complex mods. Oblivion has had a far larger amount of time to develop it's mod pool and thus has far more complex mods for whatever tickles your fancies.In short: If you're in love with modding your Bethesda games, Oblivion is certainly worth picking up and is easily moddable to your heart's content. Even if you're not into modding the game itself holds its own unique charm and well worth experiencing, especially if it happens to go on sale!So, hereby answering the request: Oblivion is a must have if you're fan of the TES series, well worth considering if you love modding games, worth a try if you started at skyrim and wondered what events lead to it, and if you're new to Bethesda's TES series a fair point to start.~Rose			",22,7,0,19,8,2,15

												TES IV: Oblivion is my personal favourite RPG of all time. The athmosphere, the gameplay, the music, the roleplaying action, the potato faces, i love it all. The game obviously have flaws, but the good outweights the bad by a longshot, and it is one of the greatest gaming experiences of my life.I havn't played it a lot on PC. I have about 500 hours on the Xbox though. ( Didn't have a gaming PC as a kid ).			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I'm not going to give this game a negative review because in no way does it possibly deserve it; Oblivion is one of the best games ever released, and with mods can easily compete with modern titles such as Fallout 4 and GTA V for amount of content. That said, buyer beware; the game is not well optimized for modern PCs, and will (not may, will) crash in inconvenient points, and even worse randomly corrupt save files. Keep multiple backup saves if you do decide to purchase this game for PC.			",60,4,0,10,6,1,11

												Oblivion is a weird game. When you first enter the Imperial Dungeon, you will be put off by the strange potato men and Uriel Septim's shadow glitches. Keep playing, and soon you will find yourself immersed in a massive region, with the best quests of the entire Elder Scrolls series. It is my personal favorite for questing, and you will not regret your purchase.			",22,4,0,11,8,0,4

												First off, I have over 300 hours in this game on Xbox so don't be fooled by my low playtime on steam. Secondly the fact that I have over 300 hours should tell you that this game is worth playing, if it isn't enough I break down what makes this such a great game and where its strengths and weaknesses are in this review.      Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion is an open world role playing game that emphasizes on player freedom, exploration and creativity.  You play a prisoner of the imperial army who meets the emperor while he is trying to covertly get out of the city when a cult of assassins are killing members of the royal family to wipe out their bloodline. During the games tutorial you get recruited abruptly to help guard the emperor during this escape. Here you will get some insight on how to play the game and how the character progression system works as well as a taste of the lore of the elder scrolls universe. Once this brief but effective tutorial sequence is over you emerge a free man/woman free to do WHATEVER you want.  You can take part of all number of activities and explore the vast province of Cyrodil; you can sink hundreds of hours into this massive very in depth game.      The things you can do are extensive in Oblivion. There is the main story which is engrossing and varied though a little on the shorter side. There are four guilds you can join complete with their own quest lines which are all fantastic and very interesting with cool characters and feel distinctly different from each other. There is the ""Fighters Guild"" the ""Mages Guild"" the ""Thieves Guild"" and the ""Dark Brotherhood"". There is also the arena where you engage in gladiator style fights with some of Cyrodil's greatest fighters and most viscous beasts. You can also visit shrines of the various gods in the game and do quests for them, these are some of the best in the game and all are unique and yield cool rewards. There is also a plethora of quest's to do for the citizens of Cyrodil which are amazingly mostly unique and quite fun. There are countless caves, castles, and other locations to find and explore. There are houses through out the game you can buy and decorate ranging from shacks by the water the exquisite manors. Of course you can also spend hours on hours training your character and interacting with all the npc's in the game. The amount of content in this game feels endless and can be binge played all day, day after day with always more content seeming to pop up all over the place.      Oblivion takes place in Cyrodil as I mentioned earlier in the review, the central province in the continent of Tamriel. Cyrodil is the seat of imperial power where the Septim bloodline has reigned as emperor for generations. The Septim bloodline has a power, related to the gods themselves and they now face being wiped out by a sinister cult whose motivations are dark and mysterious. The Elder Scrolls series is rich with lore, Bethesda invented gods both ""good"" and ""evil"" with personalities and beliefs all unique from each other. The relationships the gods have with mortals are very interesting. You can spend hours reading the various books in the game learning about Tamriels history and learn more about the various groups and their own history, it's insanely extensive.      The gameplay is an interesting but mixed bag. The graphics look dated, the animations are clunky and the voice cast is extremely small for a world with so many people in it but it's pretty easy to overlook with all the goes right in the game. For combat you can use melee weapons ranging from swords to maces to axes as well as ranged weapons like bows. Magic is also very prominent in combat as well as for utility in the game. Combat is kind of stiff at times but it works fine and is easy to get the hang of. The leveling system is one of the elder scrolls’ biggest strengths and weaknesses simultaneously. You level your character by leveling your skills, these skills vary from ""Blade Weapons"" too ""Lock picking"". Leveling you skills increases your overall level, so if you spending all your time leveling utility skills like ""Alchemy"" and ""Athletics"" but without leveling your combat skills like ""Destruction"" magic or ""Archery"" your character will be poor in combat which will make getting things done difficult. It’s also important to think clearly about what kind of character you want to make, this will determine what skills you should focus on leveling in the early game, once these skills are at an adequate level you can then branch out into other skills that are catch your interest. Leveling up other skills will allow making your character more malleable in different situations. Remember, solving all your problems by swinging an axe into people's heads isn't the best way to handle all situations. Also all the music in the game is fantastic.     In the end, when you take all the good and the bad together you have an imperfect but very awesome RPG. You can lose all your spare time for a long time with this game, and you will love every minute of it. The two DLC's that the game of the year edition comes with, ""Knights of the Nine"" and especially ""The Shivering Isle's"" are fantastic extra content, the latter is one of the best DLC's I have ever played. It's like a whole game in itself almost. This is a fantastic experience and I would recommend it to anybody. 9/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												It's an amazing rpg, what more can I say? The graphs are overall good, combat is ok, and the setting is superb. Personally I feel this is one of the better roleplaying games out there, in terms of immersion. The character creation is especially detailed, allowing you to create complex and interesting characters. The world is huge, but not so big that its overwhelming. Whenever I play this game I almost always have an interesting adventure with some kind of story, just from the complexity of the world. It's a game in which you can just play and enjoy, without relying solely on premade quests to keep you interested. Overall I would strongly recommend this game.			",61,8,0,13,8,2,10

												Back when it came out on Xbox 360, this game introduced me to the wonders of Bethesda open world games and quickly became one of my favorite games of all time.  Since then, I've played Morrowind, Fallout 3 (as well as New Vegas from Obsidian), Skyrim, and Fallout 4.  After coming back to Oblivion on PC with numerous excellent mods, I'm inclined to say that this might be my favorite out of all the aforementioned Bethesda games.  This game is a masterpiece.

												Here I am, in 2016. This game is 10 years old. (Roughly half my age.)This was the first real RPG I had ever played.At first, I thought this game was horrible, mechanics were too complex, animations were too stiff, and the zoom-in-on-your-face dialogue was a real suprise.But after continuing to play, I fell in love. Every faction, every city, every dungeon, and like 70-80% of the characters are beautifully made. Character progression is flawless, you can actually see and feel yourself get more powerful throughout your playthrough. NPCs will have conversations with eachother,(that may or may not be centered around the main character.) I know of at least one NPC who even will actively try to steal things from other NPCs. And the stories packed into this game are just great. Bethesda manages to inject even the most simple bear pelt-gathering quest with life and personality. And if that isn't enough, this game has two add-ons that could easily be full games on their own, equal in depth, and life.			",24,3,0,20,2,0,6

												I've played a lot of Oblivion in my time, both on and off Steam. The biggest source of frustration was always the opaque leveling system. Recently I read a guide here on steam that made me feel silly for not getting it. The problem is that if you don't understand the leveling system, and go by the game's premade classes, it will be much harder to play once you get to higher levels. They vastly simplified the leveling in Skyrim, which is why I preferred Skyrim for the longest time. However, I think that Oblivion wins for memorable quests and characters, as well as having a more complex and satisfying role-playing experience. 8/10			",8,0,0,8,3,0,7

With ~30,000 mods and plenty of Official DLC's, this game has massive replay value, and can be a brand new experience every time you play. If you've never played it, loved Skyrim, but disliked Morrowind, Oblivion is a great in-between-er, and well worth your time and money.The main quest, as with all Elder Scrolls titles, isn't the main focus of gameplay here, and is fairly short in comparison to the whole of the game. But even without the Official DLC's, and all the mod possibilities, the ""vanilla"" game itself can give you hundreds of hours of game time. With a plethora of quests, choices, and almost unlimited possibilities, I highly recommend this game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The Elder Scrolls: Oblivion is an open world adventure experience that (for its time) opened up to a world of incredible proportions. Get over the dated graphics and awkward dialogue and you'll be immersed in this wonderful RPG that allows you to wander with no strings attached. The game rewards your curiosity and desire to see what is over the hill and what that village you see on the compass contains. Quests of differing demands are around every corner, everything from guilds, demonic gods, counts, common folk and lowly beggars are awaiting your appearance as their everyday hero. And it comes with one of my personal all time favourite soundtracks.The game's biggest flaw lies in its level progression, like any RPG you level up with the skills you use often but the main problem arrives as the further your strength grows, the stronger the enemies of the world gets (i.e. bandits will run around with rare armour and weapons that you went through hell to acquire yourself). The combat itself is unsatisfying with magic being boring to throw and most melee combat to be block'n'slash (I heard there are mods to fix that). But once you get used to it you see a magical world with lots of adventure and people in distress to save.9/10 - ""Hey, you're the one they call the hero of Kvatch!"" Get used to that phrase, it's less impressive than it sounds.			",225,62,4,25,22,0,32

												This game is easily my favourite Elder Scrolls Game. Perhaps because I played it first and therefore have nostalgic attachment to Oblivion; but nevertheless it is superb. The buildings, forts, caves and especially the music all create a charming, surreal and entralling atmosphere that I haven't experienced to a similar extent in any other video game. Unlike Morrowind, it is easier and some people may not like the fact you are given the exact marker for the active quest etc. Some people who have started on Skyrim may not like the 10 year old graphics which are somewhat outdated. It is a masterpiece so definitely give it a go10/10 would recommend. Very immersion, much loot, such greatness.(always resist arrest criminal scum)			",29,2,0,5,1,0,0

The life and times of a boy lost in CyrodiilSo one day I was casually cliff jumping my way up the Jeral mountains, and I stumbled upon two Imperial Hunters having a casual archety competition. In an attempt to join in, the two of them started attacking eachother in a duel to the death. The next day, the Grey Fox decided to give me his hood for the rest of eternity. Giddy like a child opening their best Christmas gift, I put it on in the middle of town to let the whole world know that I look like the most wanted criminal in the world. 6 guards rushed up to me and said I was under arrest ""for everything"". Baffled and in the rush of the moment, I killed 5 of them. I then thought to myself, ""♥♥♥♥♥♥it's probably the hood"". So I took off the hood, and the remaining guard looked at me as if I was his best friend. We had a nice little chat about the Emperor's death, and we went about our business like nothing happened.I once stumbled upon a cave with a goblin's head on a spike at the entrance. I thought to myself, ""I bet there must be some really nice people in here just trying to ward off enemies with that pike outside, maybe I should go inside"". So I went invisible, just in case I was somewhere I shouldn't be. It happened to be a nest of vampires, so, as one does, I casually went up to one of them to make conversation. He immediately drew his sword, indicating that he wished to engage in combat with me. I killed him, and went invisible as to avoid any of the others bothering me. I then observed his colleague pass his body. He checked to see that his friend wasn't just sleeping. Realising that he was in fact void of any life, he blurted out ""huh, must have been the wind"".10/10 perfect AI, would change absolutely nothing about this game. Best game I have ever played. The story is fantastic, the side quests are genuinely fun and enjoyable, and the DLC adds more to the game that 10 modern DLC packs would to any modern game. This game has aged well, and with mods, can be maintained to modern 'standards' in graphics. I wish games like this were made today, and I cannot wait for Skyblivion (Oblivion remade in the engine that Skyrim uses).This game sacrafices a good combat system and sometimes poor environment for a truly perfect questing experience, and an incredibly diverse magic system. There is too many good points to explain in a review, so just buy the f$%&ing game. I played over 2000 hours on the PS3 version, and recently bought it in a Steam sale. Even after all that time spent, this game is still a joy to play and explore. You decide how you want to play it, and how you are percieved by everyone in the world. This is, and will always be, my favourite game of all time.			",113,3,1,6,5,0,11

												Oblivion, the prequal to Skyrim and the sequal to Morrowind, released 20th of March 2006 was the fourth installment of The Elder Scrolls franchise.There are things i think that Oblivion did better than skyrim;1. The class system was better, you chose your star sign right at the start NOT JUST THE THIEF, MAGE AND WARRIOR, all of them, your attributes and class was chosen right at the beginning of the game as well as the star signs.2. I thought that the magica system in the game was better as you could use the restoration or any destruction spell whilst wielding your weapon instead of having to unequip your weapon and equip the spell.3. I overall think that the main questline for Oblivion was better, as i spent a good 20 hours on it compared to when I completed Skyrim's questline at just 5 hours. The questline of Oblivion was also much more diverse and detailed compared to slaying Alduin which is nearly exactly as difficult to take down as a normal dragon. I found defeating Mankar Camoran was quite the challangeI'd just like to add that i totally prefur Skyrim over Oblivion just because there is much more to do in the way of exploring and the guild questlines were better in my opinion.

												Once the dust had settled I tried Oblivion for the first time in close to a decade, and I found a game I really didn't hate anymore.Oblivion strikes the balance between depth (Morrowind) and playability (Skyrim). It features very well designed quests and far more improved combat. With a world that is full of color, and a wide assortment of locations. From snowy plateaus to sandy beaches filled with twitchy Argonians.At the same time the game is still flawed. It's a game that hasn't aged very well graphically, and the RPG elements are very hamfisted and lacking. There are thankfully mods that fix all of this, and I don't recommend playing this game vanilla. If you do, all you'll find is a game filled with potato people. One where you are legitimately stronger at the beginning of the game due to how badly coded the levelling system is.

												One of my favourite games of all time. This game has an incredibly open world to explore with plenty of quests to keep you occupied. The story is brilliant .... not to mention Sean Bean's voice as one of the main characters :).  The Game of the Year edition includes two great expansion packs, Shivering Isles and Knights of the Nine. There are plenty of items and weapons to collect along the way, not to mention a variety of spells to use which become more advanced further in the game. Like many RPG/Adventure games, you level up once you have exceeded enough xp points. This enables you to customize  your character and how you want to play the game, ex, stealth, melee, ranged or magic. The graphics are amazing with an ace soundtrack. If you enjoy Adventure games, you will love this game and be playing it for a long time :) 96%			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												As someone who came from Skyrim, this was significantly different, but in my opinion a good type of different. This may be because Skyrim and Oblivion seems to focus on two different things.

												The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion... Maybe one of the greatest game's ever to be released. Made by Bethesda Softworks you can expect alot of bugs. Yet, you will see alot of adventure and interresting dialogue. The game's story is that the gates to Oblivion (AKA hell) has opened in Cyrodill, and you. A prisoner off the Imperial Prison needs to seek a way out off the prison with the Emperor, and also find the last heir to him and shut close the jaws of oblivion. The game has a great atmosphere and it has alot of enjoyable colors aswell. The areas are simply beautfull, you always feel the need to explore the open world and also help the people around you when you actually listen to all their problems.When playing you will see alot of NPC's, some NPC's will only be talkable during quests or guilds. Or they might have a quest or just be people that are there to fill the area. There is about four guilds in the game, following the Thieves Guild, Dark Brotherhood, Mage's College/Mage's Guild, and ofcourse Fighters Guild.The story off the Dark Brotherhood is that you have just been spyed on by a man when you have killed a innocent, he will tell you to kill a man (Not saying due to spoilers) when you have done so you are invited. But to the guild you will be nothing but just a new member. You do quests to advance and aqually mean something in the guild.The Thieves Guild is similiar to the Dark Brotherhood in the sneaking aspect. But you can't kill people as that gives you a boun ty. The story follows: You have been thrown in jail, the people off the thieves guild take you as a criminal now and has given you a chance to join the group. You start off as a normal low ranked member, not being of much use, but it will change when you become a higher rank. The story of the Mage's Guild is self explanatory. Mage's Against some evil people. This guild is the most boring one in my opinion, but if you're playing  a mage I recommend this guild. The Fighter's Guild, this one is very mixed for me... it didn't have much for a story except for stop that guy, do that, stop that guy. But was still very interesting and had alot of fun moments. Overall, the Elder Scrolls: Oblivion in the ends turns out as a great adventure game with alot off challenge and alot of fun, you will spend about possibly even 90 hours trying to complete everything or less if you just wanna finish the story, but then you're just missing out off the actual game. As the game is very good and still has quite decent graphics compared to some games. I give this game a 9.5 out of 10 due to how it was made and how much there is to do. The graphics aren't the greatest but are actually quite decent. This game is very recommended from me if you like adventure and RPG mashed togheter.			",166,12,2,18,7,2,7

 Games Good......Needs Workshop 9.9/10 (Kidding, its 10/10) EDIT 8/23/2016: With the Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim getting a remaster, I felt like I needed to get back over here, I still recommend the game, don't get me wrong on that, but the game definitely needs an improvement on the factor of optimization. This is the list of ideas I wish Bethesda would at least just toss to Oblivion to at least show that they still care on past games...- LAA Patch: Oblivion only uses up to 1.8 GB of RAM, for a 32 bit .exe, that's a pain for someone on a 64 bit with 16 GB RAM, if you are keeping the 32 bit, at least make that default like Bethesda did Skyrim. The LAA Patch would allow Oblivion to use the full 4GB 32 bit uses and honestly if they do the second option, it'll only benefit the 32 bite systems out there by a slim margin.- 64-Bit Engine: We're not asking you to just go ahead and remaster the whole engine, but considering I can get frame drops with my setup due to the engine being limited? That's really annoying, we're not asking for a revamp, but an expansion of the engine used in Oblivion to where we can basically cram more items in there.- Proper Multithreading support: I got an A10-6700 from AMD, and it's quad core. This game sucks with quad cores. Fix. That. 3/20/17 Update: Got myself a good computer over Christmas, main improvement was the upgrade to an i5-6600K....It works better now.If Bethesda believes that the task of doing this is ""mountainous"" to quote their VP for Public Relations/Marketing, hell we can probably do that with the code for Oblivion if they released that too, but I can almost guarentee that won't happen unless they completely retire the game.Seriously, I wish this had more attention, and it hasn't. Maybe because I'm the only system somehow that has issues with my game stability, I don't know. But I wish they at least took a look at the nescessary stuff........Now, because I couldn't sate my hunger completely, a few optional additions wouldn't really hurt.-Controller Support: I seriously want to use my Xbox One controller with this game, it works with 360s layout- heck I run GTA V with the 360 layout and on my Xbox One controller. But if they can release this game on Xbox, they can at least make it to where I can use the Xbox controller in Oblivion.-Steam Achievements: Same. Same exact thing. They have Xbox Achievements for Oblivion. Steam has their Achievements as well, that's not mountainous at least.-Workshop: Cause *Shrug* I don't like Nexus Mod Manager and manually downloading 20 mods when I want to can take way too long, it would be a good idea for me.So. Yeah....I wish these were in Oblivion, and I hope this game has its improvements. I know what I am saying is much, but I'm PERSONALLY (I don't know about others) asking for a PERFORMANCE patch, not a remaster, something along the lines of what I believe Asphyr did with KOTOR 2, they improved the game with a massive performance update with controller support, higher resolution support, achievements, etc. That's what I believe a good example would be of where the game can be improved in terms of the level done..If that is done, I would be playing this game so much, heck...I don't know what to say. Seriously, just make the game more optimized because it simply isn't, the rest is just stuff that I thought would be nice with Oblivion, and seriously, it's within that grasp, it won't be mountainous to do it, you just need to allocate some time, some manpower, and most especially, the money to fund through the effort. If Bethesda isn't planning on doing anything else with this, at least help modders optimize the game at least more in-depth than LAA aware and Oblivion Stutter remover, etc.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												It's been ten years - although in my particular case, it's only been about seven, when my family first rented the 360 copy - and I've been obsessed ever since. Sure, I like Morrowind and Skyrim, but Oblivion was my first introduction to this series and it left a certain impression. I don't think any video game could ever come close for me.Thank you, Bethesda, for this beautiful game. And to anyone who's thinking of playing it, even after all these years, I highly recommend it.			",29,3,0,12,1,0,1

												The first time i played this game was somewhere around 2009 or 10 for PS3, after being hooked on Fallout 3 i thought that this game was going to be just as awesome and time consuming, but it was difficult for me to get hooked as i did not understand the lore to this game much. Fast-forward to 2011 when i got my copy of Skyrim i found that i was able to play an Elder Scrolls game, and i found it to be one of the best games i have ever played, and went well over the 300 hours of gameplay estimated for the game.After playing Skyrim i chose to play Oblivion again, and i loved it. After having a bit of knowledge on the lore and the way Elder Scrolls games worked i found that the world of Tamriel became a more interesting, and definitely beautiful place, but i never did complete Oblivion until today on the PC. (18/10/2014)I can tell that Cyrodiil is very much based on England, or countries alike; with the vast and beautiful forests to explore to the rolling fields and meadows of County Skingrad and The West Weald, i felt like i had taken a journey back in time to the days of Albion, where tales of magic, dragons and heros were told in regular supply. The experience of delving into the past in Ancient Ayleid Ruins was exciting and jumpy, and all the more rewarding once you come out with a good bit of loot, gold, and tons of welkynd stones... maybe too many, but aside from the visuals and personal experience, i found the story to be very much like the fantasy stories of gold, and i cannot believe i never took the time to follow the main storyline before, but alas, i have now completed it.There are a few letdowns however, one being the lack of variety in voices for NPCs, and the very static movement of the animations for the game. I admit this was made back in 2005 and was BGS' second major 3D game, i think, but it made the game quite immersion breaking at times, and nobody would want to be pulled out of this amazing world. Speaking of voice acting, there were times where the voice acting for certain characters were not on par with the voice acting of the regular NPCs, and i found this to be disappointing with the amount of quality this game tries to bring to the table.Graphically this game has a very artistic feel to it, for where it wants to be as realistic as possible, it still has a sense of handmade effort in the visuals that gives what you see value, because the world of Cyrodiil is like looking at a painting: a true masterpiece.So my final rating for this game is a very strong 9.2/10Before entering the world of Tamriel, i recommend looking up on some of the lore, i would recommend ShoddyCast on YouTube with it's lore series, but this game, and Skyrim, are a definite purchase.

												Shortly after I escaped from the royal dungeons, I received aletter from an old friend, telling me where an legendary pirate's lost ship was to be found. Turned out, it was a nice little spot to create my own little base of operations. So, I set about to create my own little pirate haven. In looking for funds to begin my pirate operation, I became a holy knight leading a religious crusade, and now have a cult of fanatical knights serving me. Then I took over my own little slice of Oblivion and became a Daedric Prince.All because I though it would be cool to have my own little pirate base and needed cash to get it going.

												An incredibly solid RPG. The sheer variety of gameplay elements available, paths you can take, and quests in the game make it well worth a purchase. There is no reason why any RPG aficionado should not own this title.Oblivion is far from a perfect game, but I can think of very few titles that come as close. It’s among the very best in terms of gameplay, audio, and graphics.Assuming one has a system with the muscle to run the game and the player is willing to accept some technical glitches, there simply isn't a better RPG experience available.

												The king of kings in the fantasy gaming community. This game series defined what a fantasy world should be like and is the foundation of any good fantasy RPG. Though it seems old to many young gamers, this game is a must have for any gamer that loves fantasy settings. Each race in Oblivion has its own strengths and weaknesses, greatly defining each race and seperating them from everyone else. For instance, Bretons (A race in Oblivion) can wield powerful magics and start off with more magical energies than other races, though they are weaker than most. Khajit can sneak around more easily and can use their claws as weapons to hurt their foes. There are many different classes in this game, each one serving a certain role. Do you want a warrior who also uses magic? Or would you rather prefer and rouge that uses illusions to hide his tracks as he steals jewels? If you don't like any of the classes, there is an option where you can create your own class, tailoring it to your own needs and wants. Combining a magic wielding class with a race that specilizes in certain classes of magics will allow you to become the greatest mage in the world or creating a two handed wielding orc to become the most feared barbarian in the lands. And the fun doesn't stop there, each adventure is more interesting than the last. One play through may have you encounter a door to Oblivion where you must close the door before more demons pour through. Another play through may have you collect a strange weed with mystical powers. No play through is ever the same.If you haven't played Oblivion and you are interested in Fantasy Settings, then Oblivion is a must have in your library. ",71,5,0,18,22,2,19

												Only got this on steam cos my disk copy stopped working. Been playing since it was released in 2006, and I can safely say that Oblivion is easily the best Elder Scrolls game. It's a more complex and deep than Skyrim could ever be, but also better looking and it's game mechanics are easier to understand than Morrowinds, and with none of the frustrating combat. Also IMO has the best music of the series, and it is also the only game in the series to let you have true free reign in creating your character. All the games before only let you select from a limited number of faces, while Skyrim only lets you choose presets. Oblivion has sliders which can change the shape of every part of the face. This lets you create some true ""masterpieces"" of character design:

 The storyline is also great (and doesn't have the bad ending of Skyrim) and with the Shivering isles expansion you get even more crazy. Oblivion, unlike Skyrim, also gives you the ability to create you own spells which is great fun. Only things that are worse in Oblivion are the graphics (obviously), and the combat. The combat is still good, but Skyrim's combat mechanics are much better. I would still recommend this game every day over Skyrim.			",179,21,1,20,22,1,42

												People complain about ""Oh, why are you playing Oblivion when skyrim had much better GRAPHICS?"" (They always seem to spit that word more than say it.) Well, I've got news for you: Elder Scrolls is not CoD with swords. It's about the overall experience. I don't need stunning graphics to reel me in. It's also not a game series that you ""beat"". Oh sure, you might finish the main story, but DO YOU KNOW HOW BIG THESE GAMES EVEN ARE?!?!?!? If the scale isn't your reason for buying this game, DON'T BUY IT. I don't want an elitist ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ going ""I beat this game. Why are you still playing it"". There. I'm off of my soapbox for today. (If you don't know what that means, too bad. look it up.)

												Fresh off the boat from Vvardenfell, I was hard on Oblivion early on. It's appropriate to compare the two games, but not as closely as I did. And while I still got far more hours and enjoyment out of Morrowind, there was a depth of charm to its successor that I had long overlooked.On a technical level, I find little opposition that Oblivion broke new ground in making such a big world function as well as it did. The employment of Bethesda's new ""Radiant AI"" served as a welcome relief to the NPCs of Morrowind, whose highlight of day-to-day activity was walking twenty steps to the left. While there were aspects of this innovation that Skyrim would later improve upon, it was awesome to see the people around me wake up, go to work, go to the tavern, go hunting, eat, sleep, pray. Population centers felt alive and I started to feel the community instead of trusting that it was there.Voice acting was another... ""improvement."" You didn't have to read large blocks of text anymore because God forbid. Bethesda boasted that dialogue took up half of the game's data with over two full days of voice recording.When I first learned this, I felt reluctant. I feared that no matter how much voice acting one is willing to pack onto a DVD, there isn't enough time or money to capture the alluring exposition of Morrowind, the details of the relationships and backstories; no voice actor Bethesda got their hands on could hope to capture what I imagined when I spoke to a Telvanni lord.Well, I was right. Long, detailed information was butchered, mainstreamed. There were hardly any topics to discuss, and I didn't feel like I could have a true conversation with anyone the game didn't deem important enough. Talking to a random bystander about their trade not only developed a character, but the world. I didn't have that anymore. Every gender of each race (for the most part) had not only the same voice, but the same speech. It was almost silly. With the big step forward in immersion with Radiant AI and voice acting, it was a shame to take such a step back in what was perhaps my favorite aspect of Oblivion's predecessor.I also had mixed feelings about the induction of fast travel. I let it go; if I wanted the immersion, I could always refuse it (even though I knew any such commitments wouldn't last). Looking on the bright side, I could enjoy completing quests and keeping the story going. Returning instantly to the doorstep of my favorite places would help me savor and rediscover them, when before I might have put it off for dread of the trek until I was too powerful to care. So, while I will always appreciate the punishing journeys of Morowind, I suppose I can mark fast travel as a net positive.And they finally added horses to make travelling faster!Um... okay. Maybe they would provide some other combat or burden benefit?No. Not really. So, uh... moving on.The graphics are beautiful. Stunning. I was impulsively critical of the ""normality"" of the setting compared to Vvardenfell. Yes, Cyrodiil is more familiar, but in hindsight I don't see why I should have trouble accepting that this particular part of a much larger and dynamic fantasy world is simply inspired by Medieval Europe like many other works of fantasy whose familiarity I forgave, even welcomed. Maybe it's because I expect more from a game, maybe it's because the story left me wanting (which it did, but it's not that simple--- more on that shortly). The vistas of Cyrodiil ran unrivalled in gaming at the time, and few with today's technology can match its brilliance, especially when considering how interactive and detailed every yard of it is. Now, Dagon's plane of Oblivion, for which the game is named, that's where I stop defending the lack of inovation: classic Dante. And Daedric architecture was, altogether now, far more intriguing in Morrowind.Just as Oblivions's landscapes hold up today, the general facial designs of NPCs were subpar even then (aside from the beast folk, but then I resented that they were streamlined to equip footwear).But where did Oblivion shine? Where did Oblivion not only stand up to Morrowind but arguably surpass it?The faction questlines.The main questline was not very interesting (still blows away Skyrim), though it managed to turn out a few likeable characters (Baurus, Martin, uh... Jauffre was okay, I guess). But the faction quests were truly the greatest strength of a solid game. Morrowind's were less linear, giving players the choice of advancing through work in different parts of the map (the superior concept, in my opinion); Oblivion allowed a single path, but not only provided a heavier narrative, they gave the feeling that you were part of something. Both systems have their strengths and weaknesses, but Oblivion's Mages Guild combined the two...You had to impress the leader of each installment of the Mage's Guild, each with their own personality, style, and agenda, much like Morrowind. Once they are in agreement, you're rewarded with access to the previously locked mechanic of magic-making and enchanting in a place that felt like a functioning school. There, you work your way from grunt to archmage in a series of quests that begin benign but gradually rise in importance to the finale. Was it perfect? No. But the structure and pacing brought the experience to life for me. I enjoyed every quest.In terms of story, the best of Oblivion (and the series as of Skyrim) was the Dark Brotherhood. The characters, the atmosphere, the plot and the individual quests were beautiful. Sometimes it felt like a different game entirely. I'll never forget when it was all coming to a head, I stepped out of a lighthouse and the brutal, depressing scene it housed, and spent a quiet moment watching the sun break the horizon over the sea, uncertain of the future. It was magnificent.The Thieves' Guild came close to the mages guild in terms of structure, and close to the Dark Brotherhood in terms of story: a well-balanced and enjoyable adventure.Oblivion's factions set the bar, and I couldn't wait to see what Skyrim... well, we'll get to that another time.Finally, on to combat. Yes, it's more fun to swing a sword when the sword is going to hit its target, and the employment of modern physics made it satisfying to knock your enemy over a table with a deathblow to the face. What's more, Oblivion did what I would have sworn was impossible: it made magic even more useless than it was in Morrowind (at least then you could cast offensive spells through items--- laughably overpowered, but I loved it).When Bethesda made Oblivion, they set out to build a whole new game from the ground up. As to be expected, there were changes that I liked, changes that I didn't. Did Oblivion stand up to Morrowind? I think not, but given the style of its development, it didn't have to. I can't help but respect Bethesda's willingness to drop all their assets and start anew. While Oblivion belongs to a series, it belongs to its own part of the series, just as Cyrodiil itself lies as its own little world in widely-varied Tamriel, and in ways neither can nor should be compared to the others.In the end, we need to be realistic: how many games lie outside Bethesda's world so big, where no matter which road you choose, whether you take a road at all, you know you're going to find something worth seeing? That is the marvel of Bethesda, the greatest RPG developer there is.			",459,51,12,47,50,1,80

												It is an absoulute astonishing game I love it, I was introduced to it 5 years ago and STILL play it to this day. It is a HUGE game to spend great time and hours either looting through caves or pickpocketing the town folk or even doing quests , The main quest is great (I will not spoil it for you) but even when you complete the main quest I guarantee you will NEVER treck through all the caves and ayeleid ruins on this game or ever complete. It is better than skyrim becuase of the great looking graphics its AI might be bad at times but overall it is a great game to be made in 2007. I hope you buy this game.   (P.S. just get elder scrolls anthology for 29.00$ so you can play all of their games also sorry for any spelling errors bye <3) If I were to rate this game 1/10 I'd rate it 20/10			",31,4,0,9,3,0,1

												Oh... OH...! This game. oh my god, this game, its just so good. Coming from someone that didn't play the originals, which I've seen some of but haven't really played, this game is just fantastic. The story works so much nicer than Skyrim's where you are 'The chosen one' type of story, common.In this game, you start out as some dude in prison (not unlike any other Elder Scrolls game) and are thrust into a world of crazy♥♥♥♥♥♥to deal with. But instead of being 'The Chosen One', youre just some guy through the entire game that just happened to be in the wrong place at the right time. You get released from prison and walk around doing whatever you want. Theres not many side quests like Skyrim has as you can beat the entire game fairly quickly. And unlike Skyrim, some of the best weapons you get yo have to spend a 3 month hike trying to find and then when you do get it, oh boy, its life changing.If you've played Skyrim and enjoyed it, then play this and enjoy a real game. Sure theres less mechanics, but its by far not E rated like Skyrim, made for kiddies was.			",228,23,2,14,12,3,2

												Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion is one of those games where you can fully immerse yourself within it's environment and society. The world (called Cyrodiil)  has multiple regions of landscape, all giving you a taste of wildlife and roleplaying elements, like old, swampy caves or a great fort in the uplands of Colovia. Everywhere you go you can interact with the environment, from plants and mushrooms to animals and NPCs.When you open the grate out of the sewer for the first time you realise the immense beauty of lake rumare, but thats the tip of the iceberg. You could if you wish, follow the main quest, and complete it how the developers thought it would be like. Or you can find your own path venture into an unknown cave, or explore the Imperial City's marketplace and see what it has to offer.The game has oppertunities to be each class as you will, and a race to go along with it. You could be a High Elf Mage, the Arch-Mage of the Arcane University, or a Nordic Warrior, leader of the Fighters guild. There is a great range of quests to complete and level up your character. You may want to find certain items and loot dungeons to find them, while selling what else you find.The Shivering Isle DLC, lets Sheogorath the Daedric Prince of Madness invite you to his realm, where everything is run a whole lot differently. The Knights of Nine DLC sends you on an epic quest, to defeat Umaril, who threatens Cyrodiil, while worshipping the Nine Divines. Depending on which pack you brought, one edition will come with four DLC houses, each with their own quest, and some other miscellaneous DLC.So go explore Cyrodiil in all its glory. Be a Warrior, or a Thief, or a Mage or even all of them together! Thats the thing with Oblivion, its an inviting world at your fingertips that will never get old.However they could patch up on the Havok Physics a bit.			",21,3,0,2,7,0,10

												Oblivion is the sequal to the critically acclaimed TES 3 Morrowind, and predessessor to the well-known Skyrim (TES 5). This time it is set in Cyrodiil, the Imperial Province of lush forests, snowy mountain caps and dark swamps, all to be explored at will. There are nine major cities, Anvil, Kvatch, Skingrad, Chorral, Bravil, Leyawin, Bruma, Cheydinhal and the Imperial City, plus many other minor settlements, temples, farms etc. Right at after character creation, you are taken by the Emporers guards on an escape from the palace dungeons, before he tasks you with delivering the Amulet of Kings and shutting closed the jaws of Oblivion.

I saw a mudcrab the other day.Also N.B. I am not necessarily a fan of Role Playing Games.The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion is Bethesda Softworks' blockbuster and hugely popular open world lite role playing game, set in the medieval fantasy world of Cyrodiil.The gist of the main storyline is that the Emperor, Tiber Septim, is assassinated literally 10 minutes into the game by a cult worshipping Mehrunes Dagon, who aims to invade the mortal realm and ask the kitchen sink of humans, ogres, dwarves, elves and assorted petting zoo people, to submit to literal hell. Following your convenient escape from the Imperial Prison, you play tennis with the required artifacts with this cult and the Daedra, and your goal is to restore stability to this world.It's a 2006 game, and for its time I will admit, it looks decent. From a technical standpoint in particular, the real time shadows are remarkable, while artistically, the bloom post processing works rather well to give a fairy tale feeling. Unfortunately, the big graphical offenders are the crude animations and the character faces, good god.Voice acting is hit or miss, usually miss. The spoken voice lines often sound different between one another and there's no consistent tone. It feels like about 10 people total voiced every single character in this game. The rest of the sound design is just about average, with other small blemishes.Gameplay is where the big problems arise. Improving your skills is done by performing the feats associated with said skill: Armorer is increased by repairing weapons and armour, while Destruction governs use of offense magic spells. You have 7 Major Skills personally assigned at the start of the game, and increasing these skills by 10 points across the board will allow you to level up the next time you sleep, after which you decide which of your main Attributes you want to increase. In theory, sounds good. In practice, the existence of level scaling enemies means that, in the game's vanilla state, you have two practical choices: get your pen and paper out and keep track of exactly which Skills you have improved, to maximise your Attribute gains at the next level up, or outright skip levelling up and fight, loot or interact with whatever using just your beefed up skills. Attribute level up bonuses scale with how much you've improved your skills, so you can end up overlevelled and underskilled, and mincemeat for the other baddies in the game unless you either mod the game, keep track of your skills in a manner that defies roleplay, or outright skip levelling up, also defying roleplay. It is probably the worst levelling system I've seen, where unless you play in a specific way, you won't stand much chance against future game challenges without lowering the difficulty.The world is fairly large and stocked with places to venture into, and side quests to complete. For the most part, they're passable, they give me, an action guy, a chance to mash and bash things into pulp. The stealth system is fairly robust, though it gets ridiculous later on where a skill in the high 70s and a ring of 20% Chameleon will make you literally invisible to certain enemies, even as you push them around. MagicMagicka is an important asset to most every creature capable of casting it, with a variety of effects ranging from standard fireballs, lightning strikes, frost attacks, heals and buffs, to summoning minions to fight alongside you, granting water breathing or water walking, and even skipping the lockpicking and persuasion minigames. The lore is huuuuge, as kind of expected from a series apparently spanning 10 years from this game's launch. I'm sure avid followers of the lore will find every little error in continuity to nitpick on, but I'm personally rather impressed on the number of unique NPCs, lore books and other fluff to make it feel like a lively place. If anything, this does it better than stiff, robotic NPCs doing the same routine every day, but that one's partially excused because otherwise quests would be way harder to complete.The base game might be a mixed bag, but mods most certainly make it much more bearable, and much more fun. The modding community is incredibly devoted still to this 10+ year old game, continuously putting out updated graphics mods, a more modern and conventional levelling system done via quest completion, rebalances, new magic spells and weapons, new creatures, and even riding a Nine Divines damned dragon.The basic storyline with minimal sidequesting will last about 20 hours, but finding everything will take you way, way longer. It's kind of addicting, and it's got its own charm.If it's cheap enough and/or you're an RPG-lite fan, this is worth a play, most certainly. For everyone else, mods are your allies, and you should still give it a whip.			",82,7,11,7,10,1,7

It's really good, and I'd also recommend Skyrim and Morrowwind (Though be warned, the combat in Morrowwind sucks!)This game definietly improves upon the gameplay aspect of the series.I'd recommend this game to everyone!

												Say what you will about the repetitive oblivion gates and the potato face character models, this game is a triumph in open-world gaming.  Radiant AI makes the game feel much more alive than previous Elder Scrolls installments.  The Dark Brotherhood faction remains the single most intruiging questline I have ever played in a game.  You will hear npcs telling rumors of events that you yourself participated in, making you feel that your actions have had some impact in the world.    The Shivering Isles expansion that comes with this game is probably the best DLC I have ever played.  It is arguably a tighter experience than the base game.  Morrowind fans will likely experience a bit of nostalgia from the alien landscapes featured.  This game's only real problem is that everything that it tries to do doesn't always work as intended.  This is most obvious with how npcs interact both with you, and with each other.  You can have a perfectly pleasant conversation with an npc, only for him to tell you to shut up and leave him alone when you say your goodbyes.  While this is oftentimes comical, it is also immersion breaking, which is a bit hit for a game whose biggest draw is making you feel like an inhabitant in a living world.  Also, dungeons can feel a little repetitive, as designs are often reused.  It's hard to have every dungeon feel unique when there are so many of them in the game, but I would still expect a bit more variety than what we got.  I wholeheartedly recommend this game to anyone who enjoys rpgs or open world games.  The amount of solid content you're getting for 20 dollars or less is incredible, and should not be passed up.

												It is an absoulute astonishing game I love it, I was introduced to it 5 years ago and STILL play it to this day. It is a HUGE game to spend great time and hours either looting through caves or pickpocketing the town folk or even doing quests , The main quest is great (I will not spoil it for you) but even when you complete the main quest I guarantee you will NEVER treck through all the caves and ayeleid ruins on this game or ever complete. It is better than skyrim becuase of the great looking graphics its AI might be bad at times but overall it is a great game to be made in 2007. I hope you buy this game.   (P.S. just get elder scrolls anthology for 29.00$ so you can play all of their games also sorry for any spelling errors bye <3) If I were to rate this game 1/10 I'd rate it 20/10			",31,4,0,9,3,0,1

												Having played Skyrim first, I was afraid that Oblivion was not going to be able to impress me just due to the sheer step backward in innovation and technology. However, I was proved very very wrong. If you have already played Skyrim and liked it, or are just interested in the series, I can highly reccomend this game. Give it time to fully immerse you. Give this game a chance. It is a huge, with hours upon hours upon content. Oblivion surprised me in that a game much older than it's succsesor still held up to the gold standard put forth by today's games. If you liked any other TES game, or even Fallout, give it a go, it's only 5 bucks! (I actually reccomend the Deluxe Game of the Year Edition, you get more content for 1 dollar more.)

												Oblivion is the sequal to the critically acclaimed TES 3 Morrowind, and predessessor to the well-known Skyrim (TES 5). This time it is set in Cyrodiil, the Imperial Province of lush forests, snowy mountain caps and dark swamps, all to be explored at will. There are nine major cities, Anvil, Kvatch, Skingrad, Chorral, Bravil, Leyawin, Bruma, Cheydinhal and the Imperial City, plus many other minor settlements, temples, farms etc. Right at after character creation, you are taken by the Emporers guards on an escape from the palace dungeons, before he tasks you with delivering the Amulet of Kings and shutting closed the jaws of Oblivion. From then on you have the entire province to explore at your own will. You can join guilds such as the fighters guild, basically the legal vigilanties of Tamriel, the mages guild, who are basically the wizards of the empire, the thieves guild, which is an illegal guild of robbers and thieves, the dark brotherhood, who are the spiritual assassins who worship Sithis and the Night Mother, and the Arena, which is pretty self explanetory.A good understanding of TES lore is recommended, and will always make the game feel more real. I recommend this series to bring you up to speed. https://www.youtube.com/user/ShoddyCast It will inform you on the many races, religions, provinces and more that exist on Nirn (It also explains what Nirn is). Or you could read the many ingame books as an alternative.The only downsides I can think of is the chat system, which is a little outdated, and the stupid essential NPCs. Unforunatly they removed Morrowinds 'you can kill anyone, as long as you can deal with the consequences' system in favor of appeal to casual gamers.

												Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion is one of those games where you can fully immerse yourself within it's environment and society. The world (called Cyrodiil)  has multiple regions of landscape, all giving you a taste of wildlife and roleplaying elements, like old, swampy caves or a great fort in the uplands of Colovia. Everywhere you go you can interact with the environment, from plants and mushrooms to animals and NPCs.When you open the grate out of the sewer for the first time you realise the immense beauty of lake rumare, but thats the tip of the iceberg. You could if you wish, follow the main quest, and complete it how the developers thought it would be like. Or you can find your own path venture into an unknown cave, or explore the Imperial City's marketplace and see what it has to offer.The game has oppertunities to be each class as you will, and a race to go along with it. You could be a High Elf Mage, the Arch-Mage of the Arcane University, or a Nordic Warrior, leader of the Fighters guild. There is a great range of quests to complete and level up your character. You may want to find certain items and loot dungeons to find them, while selling what else you find.The Shivering Isle DLC, lets Sheogorath the Daedric Prince of Madness invite you to his realm, where everything is run a whole lot differently. The Knights of Nine DLC sends you on an epic quest, to defeat Umaril, who threatens Cyrodiil, while worshipping the Nine Divines. Depending on which pack you brought, one edition will come with four DLC houses, each with their own quest, and some other miscellaneous DLC.So go explore Cyrodiil in all its glory. Be a Warrior, or a Thief, or a Mage or even all of them together! Thats the thing with Oblivion, its an inviting world at your fingertips that will never get old.However they could patch up on the Havok Physics a bit.			",21,3,0,2,7,0,10

												My personal favorite entry in the elder scrolls series. Graphics and combat mechanics may not fully be up to par with those of skyrim but do not let this games age fool you. Oblivion has a great world to explore with a very fulfilling main questline and plenty of equal if not more exciting side quests and questlines. There is so much to do that you will never get bored! 10 out of 10 in my book.			",46,2,0,9,0,0,2

												Not the best one but the one I spent longer on than any. This TES epic was the bane of my existence on xbox and I racked up more than 100 hours just trying undo the vamprisim - at the time, I had very little college, no job and no internet. Oblivion was the perfect game to eat up all the extra time, sometimes spending 12+ hours on a day (without DLC) - The GOTY is worth every penny, I haven't even scraped the surface but now with work, relationships and animals to look after, my oblivion days are very limited. If you've never played a TES game, get the ♥♥♥♥ out and do so now! Oblivion has all the ingredients of a perfect RPG you can just sit back, smoke a joint and binge to high hell on for many, many weeks. Cannot say enough about it without ever saying too little, just buy it and play it to high hell.			",372,95,31,62,56,2,76

												some people say that oblivion is much worse than morrowind, that it is boring and so one.i played oblivion a lot and i can say that it is different to morrowind, but still good. i can agree that the main quest is not very astonishing but the thing about TES is that main quests didn't really matter because there is so much other cool stuff in this universe. once i had to travel through the painting into the painted world to save his artist. the other day i participated in vampire hunt which was started by the vampire himself. once i got A REALY LOYAL FAN who followed me EVERYWHERE. the other day i stayed at the inn located on the ship, and while i was sleeping that ship was HIJACKED BY PIRATES. and so one and so long, so many fascinating adventures!the most interesting part was the shivering isles addon. i suggest you first to finish the main quest (if you want to finish it sometimes) and only than go to the shivering isles, because this one is so good, and everything else is less bright after it. this sheogorath guy, he knows how to entertain!oh and i have an announcement for my fellow argonians: YOU CAN WEAR SHOES IN THIS GAME.

												In my opinion, Oblivion is the best out of all 5 of the games in the series. (Yes, even Skyrim, don't kill me) It's better because It has charm for days, the storylines and quests are engaging, it has Patrick frickin' Stewart, the combat and magic are tight, the voice acting is loveably campy (plus it's leaps and bounds better than that of Skyrim), one of the best DLC add-ons ever (Shivering Isles), Criminal scum hating guards who loathe when you violate the law,  Patrick Stewart, ingenious spellmaking and alchemy systems, you can actually see the sun, HORSE ARMOR, THE ARENA, A CASTLE YOU CAN LIVE IN! And did I mention PATRICK DAMN STEWART!?With all that said, the number one reason why this is better than Skyrim is: in what the heck other game can you go on a bloodthirsty massacre across the countryside and get off with a slap on the wrist, but get sent to rot away in prison for months for merely touching a noble's tweezers!?

												STOP!YOU VIOLATED THE LAW, by not playing this game.Oblivion is the first RPG i ever played back in 2008 when I had it on disc (don't judge me) AND I LOVE IT WITH ALL MY NONEXISTENT SOUL!You have the freedom to do whatever you want from the beginning of the game **Spoiler Alert**  after getting out of jail **End of Spoiler Alert**. This freedom can include anything from buying bread to satisfy your nonexistent hunger to punching people in the face. And then you have the main story and a billion other sidequests from potatoe faced townsfolk and guilds.Most of the DLC's are also good but the shivering isles is the best DLC I have ever played adding over 10 hours more of gameplay (and the best character ever, Sheogorath CHEESE FOR EVERYONE!) but then there are pointless ones like horse armour which should have just been free in an update like the mounted horse combat in skyrim. The player homes DLC are also pretty cool, the best of them being the fighters stronghold but the wizards tower is also pretty damn cool.And not to mention the modding community which is still alive and well after like 8 years of the game being available which is amazing and there are some great mods like Elsweyr Deserts of Anequina (which may have been taken off of oblivion nexus)that adds an entire new country to explore with new monsters and rideable elephants.10/10 would violate the law again.

												I only have three hours clocked in on Steam, but on the 360, I've probably spent hundreds of hours of my freshman year in high school walking against a wall to build up my sneak skill.Oblivion was my gateway back into the world of RPG's after I had strayed off into the void of CoD and similar titles. A friend of my older brother had let us borrow a handful of games for the 360, and this was one of them. While my brother didn't touch it, I took the leap and tried it out. It was love at first sight.And I'm 99% sure that I never gave it back to the guy.Anyways, everyone looking at this game is probably comparing it against Skyrim: which should I buy? My answer is definitely both, they're both worth the money. I've literally bought both of these games twice, putting my investment into these games close to 200 bucks, and I don't regret it, not even a little bit, but if you have to choose between one or the other, here are the pro's and con's for both games.Oblivion:+Hundreds of hours of gameplay+Highly replayable+Great character customization+Great storyline+Great not-storyline, seriously, just wander into some town and you can    go days before you remember that the world is in chaos+I personally like the alchemy and speech functions in this game, but I    know some don't+Spell crafting, OMG!!!!-Graphics are now dated-On Steam, there is no controller interface :-(-No dual-wieldingSkyrim+Hundreds of hours of gameplay+Highly replayable+Great character customization+Great storyline+Great not-storyline, same as above+Dual wielding+DRAGONS!!!+Very deep-running political agendas in-game+SMITHING-Shouts are lame, I think :-p-Not as much weapon or spell variety as Oblivion-Graphics are better than Oblivion, but some things are just ehh-Landscape isn't nearly as pretty as in OblivionAll the negatives are purely from nit-picking, there is absolutely nothing about these games that I'd consider as being ""deal breakers"". Buy. Play. Devote your life to Talos today!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												In my opinion this game may be better than skyrim.  I know it doesnt have great graphics but thats the beauty of pc, you get mods for that.  The Oblivion story blows Skyrim's out of the water.  The DLC is my favorite from any game, it adds two new worlds and many awsome new weapons. I would give this a 9/10 a true gaming gem			",66,3,1,8,5,0,6

												The Elder Scrolls IV is a game that is munch between The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind's gaming legacy and the extremely popular Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim. Many people would ask, Should I get (or still get) the Elder Scrolls IV? Of course. Oblivion is well known for its scenery, extensive side questlines, and a remarkable story. The game has aged and its skill system will make newcomers rage (the skill system is mediocre at best, but it not really good). Oblivion was one of the first role-playing game that I've purchased for the Xbox 360 back in 2006. The game was really popular back then with so much things to do. Spend hours exploring caves and dungeons. Become the Grand Champion in the Imperial Arena. Become the Grandmaster for the Mages Guild, the Leader of the Fighters Guild, the Master of Thieves for the Thieves Guild. Each character you encounter would have a unique personality and would have a quest for you to do. The soundtrack for the game is absolutely the best and it would make you just sit and relax just to listen. There are varieties of environments in the game, ranging from the spring-like setting, the pouring rain in the southern side of the map, to the blistering cold in Northern Cyrodiil. If the setting of Skyim makes you a bit...""dull"" (meaning that you are tired of playing  the dominated wintery and snowy map of Skyrim), you can come back to Oblivion where all kinds of weather is featured in one game. Like other Elder Scrolls games, Oblivion should be in your gaming library. For gamers that had played Oblivion before, its time to return to Cyrodiil.			",158,20,2,21,16,2,40

												I cannot even begin to explain the massiveness of this game.  Very much like Skyrim it is completely open world, RPG brilliance.  From the very start the choices you make, and quests you complete start to define your character for the hero they will become.  Right off the bat i am going to give this game a 9/10.Story:  Oblivions story is centralized around the idea that Tamriel is in chaos because the emperor was mmurdered, and without a new emperor to light the dragonfires cyrodill will fall into darkness.  In addition to this massive panic towards the death of the emperor, Oblivion gates (Virtually gates to hell) start opening up all across the province.  It is your job to go in and destroy these gates, and crown the new emperor for Cyrodill.Factions:  I have to say that this is possibly one of the best faction systems in any game.  contrasted only by Skyrim.  The way it is set up allows for multiple factions at once, and allow you to become the almighty ruler of them all.  The factions are: Mages Guild, Fighters Guild, Dark Brotherhood, Thieves Guild, and The Arena, other lower end factions also exist but these are the ones with the most quests involved.  Each of these has a seperate unique storyline that from time to time will also cross into other factions.  Quite revelating.Visual Appeal:  My computer has an I5 processor and was able to handle almost everything on completely high res (with the exception of shadows and sometimes water), but with that in mind, and the fact that this game was released in 2006...8 YEARS OLD, its still incredibly beautiful!!  The view of the landscape that tranistions from Grasslands, to forests, to the jerall mountains, to the swampy regions of Leyawiin...Takes my breath away.  Though other Elder Scrolls games primarily focused on one regions appeal, morrowind to swamp, and skyrim more to snow, this game perfectly incorporated all regions as it was central bound.Gameplay:  This games main focus revolves around classes that fight in unique way, while also simaltaneously questing.  These mechanics are very strikingly similar to the Legend of Zelda, and if you have ever played a Zelda game, you know perfectly well how exquisetly it accomplishes this.  There are three basic classes, warrior, mage, and thief.  All three of these have their attriubtes, but the remarkable thing about this game is that you can freely choose what you want!  Though choosing your base class at the beginning with determine what skills you are more adept at, you are still able to combine any skills with any other skills.  If you want to be a battleaxe wielding, light armored elf with excellent conjuration skills. You are able to do that no problem.  This system allows you to perfectly mould out your character to what you feel would suit you best.Quests:  If you do somehow manage to beat all quests in the game, then sir i owe you a gold medal.  If i recall correctly i believe there are around 500 quests in the game to do.  Which some can be completed by simply delivering a package, while others like the main quest will make you toy around for 10 hours before being completed.  The multitude of quests in this game is astounding, and will have your interest hooked for the long haul.Final Impressions:  Oblivion is by far my favorite fantasy game of all time let alone my actual favorite game of all time.  I personally own about 5 different versions of the game because of my love for it.  Though it says on my steam profile i only have 9 hours on PC, i had approximately 50 hours on my other steam account, and on xbox...i would be baffled if it said anything less than 600.  This game has a deep connection with me because of Bethesdas brilliance to bring forth such a revolutionary game such as this one.  Even if this genre is something you cant see yourself getting into, i challenge you to play at least the tutorial, join a single faction, and kill a baddie or two and tell me it hasnt captured your interest like it did mine.  In conclusion this is an amazing game and a must buy for every person who has steam. ",65,9,0,8,6,0,3

												My local mall had a Gamestop that is now a fragrance store. One day little old me wonders into Gamestop to look at the new games they have and Oblivion catches my eye. “Huh, Elder Scrolls? What's that? The cover and screenshots on the back look cool” I said to myself before going to the register. It was sunny and I had a cut on my hand from my grandmas cat. It's weird how you remember stuff like that. I go home and install the game on my families computer in the living room and was hooked on just about everything about the game. The freedom of exploring, the locations you get to visit, the quest lines, everything just blended together so well to create an open world fantasy RPG. Sure there's dumb stuff like characters looking like potato sacks and there only being 3 voice actors and some bugs, but they all added to the charm of the game. Oblivion is probably my favorite game of all time for sentimental reasons. I played the hell out of it and want to introduce it to my nephews(who are already into games like Zelda) when they get a little older but until then I would wholeheartedly recommend Oblivion.

												The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion is by no means an inferior product to the excellence that is Skyrim... In fact, Oblivion thrusts you into a completely unique and enjoyable setting with it's very own quirks and traits. Gameplay is the most simple out of the trifecta (Morrowind, Skyrim), but it's the visuals, the outstanding soundtrack, and the immersive, breathing, world which lend to the game it's very own flair - it's own brand of flavor, not any worse, and yet, not any better then it's respective ""siblings"". With it's very own memorable moments - and yes, it's glitches, Oblivion still manages to dole out an impressive array of content (yes, even the horse armour...). Overall, Oblivion stands tall in regards to the quality of the given product, and is a must have for any fan of the Elder Scrolls series.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Fantastic game and a masterpiece. While some of the voice acting and graphics are bad and outdated, the storytelling and the gameplay bring out the brilliance of this game. The lore of this game brings you into it's world and makes you feel as the adventurer you are playing as. Gameplay is well engaging except for some problems that affects leveling and monster scaling. Monster scaling was not implemented well, I personally had no problems with it but I know of past horror stories of ""facing certain monsters is hard"" or ""the monsters were too easy once I started leveling"". Certain scaling elements slow down the battling but not much that causes this game to be unplayable.The main story writing is great as it shows how you are not the main character but as the catalyst that brings the Oblivion Crisis forward. Each of the Guild's storytelling try it's best to make you a part of the guild. Each guild has different strengths and helps raise your character for leadership. Each of the DLC's has the Bethesda touch to them. A couple masterful story-based DLC and immersion DLC. A lot of people could argue that the Shivering Ilses DLC is better than the base game. Each character has their own backstory and motavation that is found out. Dialogue in-game is some of the best writing in any game. Sadly some characters lose their impact because of the voice direction choice, of each race having the same voice character with not many pitch or tone changes. But several characters stand out. The skill and attribute system is somewhat towards the classic RPG feel and actually effects your character in-game. Animations in the game are not super diversed but is immersive. After puttting in a lifetime of hours in Oblivion in all platforms PC is the ultimate tier of playing this game. Not only does PC help strenghten what consoles failed to work with being on PC offers mods. Mods also offer ways to fix the usually Bethesda glitches and mechanics. Mods have been made for more than 7 years now and is still being made today. Any RPG fan should definitely play this game and live through it's worlds.I could just sit here and tell you what Oblivion did better than Skyrim or Morrowind or tell you what Skyrim or Morrowind did better than Oblivion. But there is no reason, they might be continuations in the series and its lore but each game should be measured by themselves rather than the other games in the series.			",4,1,0,5,1,0,1

												I can still remember when I first got The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion. My older cousin was playing it, and after only 20 minutes of running around as his character, I was utterly hooked. I was about...16 years old? Perhaps younger?The game itself is, for it's time, revolutionary, and it pioneered an entirely new kind of open world RPG, with 'no' invicible walls except for the required ones to put a limit on the generated world. Other then that, every door, was accessible somehow, and every plot of land was reachable. There was not a direction you could not go in Oblivion, and as an RPG, that made it priceless.The game also hosts rather higher tier voice acting. For example, Patrick Stewart(Also famous for starring as Xavier in X-Men, and Captain Jean Luc Picard in Star Trek: The Next Generation), lays voice to the majestic Emperor Uriel Septim, whom you meet during the tutorial of the game.The game, for customization, offers an impressive array of possibilities, with multiple races, hair styles, and direct face molding sliders to make you look truly unique(Or outright silly). It also offers a believably long winded skill system that permits you to become more talented in certain professions and skills as you perform them.As with most Bethesda developped games, Oblivions Engine is uniquely compatible with 3rd party Modification software, allowing Mesh, Animation, and Scripting artists etc. to work almost entirely independantly in the game, limited only by the game's graphical capabilities, and their own imagination. The amount of modifications(Or mods) released for Oblivion, is vast, but has since been passed by its successor; The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim(I should mention that Oblivion by storyline standards, happens 400 years before Skyrim does, and takes place in the Tamrielian province of Cyrodil, the homeland of the Imperials)Some individuals will argue that Oblivion is unplayable without mods, but I must say, Oblivion is one of the only games released by Bethesda that is truly a remarkable, fulfilled, well thought out and extremely precisely and expertly executed video game that by no means requires mods to be playable.On a scale of 10 hearts? I give Oblivion an 8.5 hearts. The game's higher tier voice actors, coupled with its engaging story, and the impressive free roam oppertunity, the large cult following and the engaging, high quality modding community, this game is, in on itself, a culture, and I would dare to say that you cannot call yourself a gamer without having walked the adventure filled, dangerously beautiful landscapes of Tamriel, and its many unique provinces.

												When this game first came out, I only was only about 10 or so. I only got to play it every now and then on my brother's xbox. Going back now and really getting into the game, it still holds up. I always had fun with this game back in the day, and it's still incredibly fun. It's a game where 10 years later, you'll still find new things in it. 10 years later, the graphics are a little dated, but not horribly ancient. However, the story and the soundtrack more than make up for the now-dated graphics. This game is one of my all-time favorite video game soundtracks. God bless Jeremy Soule.			",80,16,1,18,6,0,5

Don't Miss This Post-Modern ClassicAlthough I may view other games as being objectively better, The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion is the single-player game I will always go back to. It is more than a game to me. I view it as true Post-Modern art and something of a lifestyle choice. Bethesda tried to recreate little parts of reality in the interactions between customized NPCs and their scheduled AI. They failed horribly and created instead listless deformed humanoids that lack the intelligence to do little more than bump into one another and echo the same conversation they heard from their previous collision. They lack the social awareness not to steal apples in front of a crowd of guards, nonchalantly stumble over corpses in the town square, or calmly approach a man wearing the recently murdered Emperor's robes.These NPCs do not resemble human beings at all, questionably apart from their character models. They are insane, compulsive, and often ghoulish creatures. (Searching through random NPC houses will commonly unearth dead bodies, Dread Father shrines, and other signs of repulsive activity.) It is inspiring in a way to see a thing so close yet so distant in reference to human society.Bethesda realized all of this in a moment of unbearably historic revelation and started work on the game that marks their Self-Actualization -- Shivering Isles. The people of Sheogorath's realm, the Shivering Isles, are each driven mad and suffer from individualistic fixations. Creating a society of manic and demented people is precisely what Bethesda was meant to do with their perfect skillset of brilliant writing, AI that requires specific targets and times, awkward animations, and ugly character models. Instead of accidently creating a weird RPG, they intentionally directed their labor to the highest-valued function. Shivering Isles is absolutely entertaining to explore as a result.As a whole, there is an impossible amount of content to experience. For nearly 10 years of consistent play, every new game has revealed new quests (some that don't appear in the journal) that I somehow missed. The quests are consistently hilarious and even have expanded my vocabulary. Exploring is vastly rewarding, as you can discover schedules, backgrounds, and dark secrets of NPCs. There are a fair amount of treasure and unique items hidden about the world, as well. (This contrasts with Skyrim's limited content that ends in repeating quests and NPCs that reveal all there is to know about themselves in 20 minutes of town dialogue.) The game is not without its problems. The dungeons are cookie-cutter and rumors are oft repeated. The combat is stupid, but if you are playing Oblivion for the combat...(LOL). The clothes and armor are not as pretty and differentiated as Morrowind's, but you can still make a few cute outfits. If any of Oblivion's shortcomings bother you that much, though, the modding community has more talent and creativity than the devs.I unfortunately lost my disc 1 while moving, so I repurchased Oblivion on Steam recently. This edition has no problems on my Windows 7 and comes with Shivering Isles and the objectively trash Knights of the Nine thing. (It's boring, has rewards that could only impress a lvl 10 and can be completed in one sitting.) That's fine, tho', because Shivering Isles alone is worth the MSRP of this product. Heck, even just the soundtrack is worth the MSRP.			",46,36,1,13,7,0,7

												Has a charm about it, the character creation is so hilariously bad it actually adds to the charm and so does the voice acting, the game is quite enjoyable (Would reccomend modding obviously for rebalances and other trash)Not as good as Morrowind but it will do.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I'm going to start off this review by saying that I've played this game from a disc since the year it came out (so pretty much for ten years lol)  and only recently got the steam version, so I would say I have 2000 hours + on this game. So I know what I'm talking about when I talk about this game. Character Customization The customization is great and leaves you with infinite possibilities to making a character.There are 21 skills and 8 attributes in Oblivion, allowing you to customise a class and a birthsign to give boots to certain skills and aspects of your character.This brings me onto the  leveling system At the start (when you choose a class) you can choose seven skills to be your ""Major skills"". You will get a +20 boost in each one and you will level up these skills much faster.Also, upgrading these skills allows you to progress to your characters next level. You can now upgrade your attributes based on the skills you learn. Story/Quests This game is story rich and you will absolutely fall in love with it if you like RPGs.The main quest itself is epic and will take you a while to finish, But the game has SO much more than that (not to mention DLC).With 200 + unique quests it will take you years to fully complete this game and even when you have, there's always Knights of the Nine and the Shivering Isles which add so much more to the game. Graphics/Visuals Obviously this game is no match for Skyrim and GTA V but the graphics are amazing for 2006 standards, and are still alright for today's standards.This game looks great in terms of landscape, it's full of colour and very vibrant. (In my opinion it looks better than skyrim)But overall this game's graphics are pretty good and the general visuals of this game are very appealing, and you can run the game on a toaster. Soundtrack This game's soundtrack is one of the best out there IMO. The main theme of this song is instantly recognisable and very fitting to the story. (The opening cutscene still gives me chills when I first hear the main theme) Interface You can enter the main interface by hitting Tab. This contains your Inventory, Spell menu, Journal, Map and an overview of your skills. Each category is like a drop down menu, which is very easy to navigate. Modding Modifying this game is very easy and mods can easily be activated and deactivated in the launch menu. Some recommended mods:- Midas Magic- The Lost Spires- Cheidenhall Pet Shop- Rebuild Kvatch DLC Buying DLCs adds so much more to the game, though i would only recommend the Shivering Isles and maybe the Knights of the Nine.The Shivering Isles is like another entire game. It has a completely different world (you can easily travel between the two using a portal), it has new monsters, spells, and of course quests, with one main quest and several side quests.The Isles itself is a very interesting place with insteresting places and people, including Sheogorath, the Madgod, the insane ruler of the Isles.I would give TSI 9/10.The Knights of the Nine is pretty much just another main quest added to the game, and I'm not going to lie it's pretty fun. I would give it a 7.5/10 SUMMARY (THANKS FOR READING THIS FAR) This game is simply everythig you could ask for in an RPG. It's exciting, epic and just a great experience. A must-have for RPG or Bethesda fans.If you haven't played an RPG before this is a great place to start. With adjustable difficulty you can learn the game pretty easily.I would completely 100% recommend this to anyone. It's just an all-round good game. If you are buying it I would recommend the shivering Isles too, as it adds alot to the expeience. MY FINAL RATING TES IV (without DLC): 9/10WITH DLC: 10/10!!!Just... just buy this game			",38,1,0,4,11,0,3

												In my opinion this game is better than Skyrim and is hands down the best game i have ever played. The quests in this game are more focused on the storyline of said quest instead of just hacking and slashing your way through to complete the objective. The AI are sometime a tad clunky but hey thats the game. The main questline is amazing and so are all the DLC's questlines, all indepth and each tell their own story and add onto the overall greatnesss of the lore in the Elderscrolls games. 11/10 Would play for rest of my lifeP.S. The main questline is like nothing Skyrim or the other Elder Scrolls games could bring. I mean witnessing the Emporer assassinated and then helping his son rise to the throne against all things including a Daedric Prince, its just a overall great gameBuy it			",81,4,0,10,4,0,8

												This game embodies what every open world game should be, the ability to choose how much of the main story and which elements you want to follow. You could do a mix of main and side quests as I do on most of my playthroughs. Another option is to only pursue the main quest line, and then once that's finished, delve into the rest of the world. Or you could choose to ignore the main quest entirely and play 40+ hours of interesting side quests fleshing out the rich, beautiful world the characters inhabit and then come back to the main quest line only once you've explored the entire rest of the world.I would also suggest looking into mods once you've played through the game a time or two as this could add hundreds of hours of gameplay, scenery, and characters that are as good or better than the quality of the original game.(Although I'm new to this game on steam, I've played hundreds of hours on my original physical copy.)

												The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion, now offered as the GOTY edition, is one of the most famed role-playing games of its time given its huge open world. Set in a fictional universe where knights, orcs and elfs live, Oblivion offers a magic and worthwhile experience that allows you to explore a world set in medieval times. However, it should be noted that the game's engine suffers from a few flaws (mouse acceleration, occasional crashes, etc).			",339,109,2,23,21,4,34

												Before I bought this through Steam, I spent thousands of hours playing it. I'm so glad it's available here. No more scratched discs. You can't go wrong with a title that inludes ""The Elder Scrolls,"" well, unless they put ""Online"" after it, but that's another story. The Elder Scrolls games are deep, rich RPGs with so much to do you can get lost in them for weeks of real time and forget the outside world exists. I find myself using terms and quotes from this game when I am forced into real life, hoping, desperately to find others like myself. If you do something to anger me? ""Hope you rot, criminal scum!""There was a girl who suggested I play the previous Elder Scrolls game. She gave me a wonderful gift. I forget her name. I forget everything that happend after I got it installed. ""Another satisfied customer.""This is a true roleplaying game in that it lets you be whomever you wish, advance in whatever skills you like and live however you want. Go play the main quest, help the people out or just ignore all that and explore, find your own path. No one is going to force you to save the empire. Don't want to be a grand hero? Fine. How about becoming a thief instead? Perhaps you'd like to gather exotic ingredients and make powerful potions to try on people or even sell. Become a master mage or a truly accomplished assasin. Either way, make your mother proud. There's so much content I am incapable of writing intelligibly about it (or some would claim anything else). There are many races of people and humaoid creatures you can play. There's a full political game, crime awarness and punishment, people to impress or alienate, and a kingdom to save or doom. I'm sure others have written about all that. If you haven't guessed, I'm a fan, big-time. This is perhaps the best money I ever spent on Steam. I mean, if I calculate what i spent on every edition I have ever owned and divide by the number of enchanted hours I played, it would come down to less than a penny an hour to be absolutely delighted. Did I mention I like the game? The selection of weapons, armor, people, places and things to do is dizzying. As I said, I've played it thousands of hours before I bought it on Steam and I've never felt I've explored the entire game. I would MUCH rather go back and play it some more than write a decent review of it. There are currently 27,787 user-created MODs for this game on just one website, adding even more to the game. This makes the game infinately replayable. It also means a LOT of other people love it so much they made their own stuff to place in the game. Adding MODs to this game is very easy and extremely fun. I saw something about dated graphics, but here's where it gets good. There is a HUGE modding community that has not only added characters, quests, locations, and everything else conceivable to the game, but they have visual and sound creations to bring the dated game to modern standards.  I am delighted to announce that this game runs better than ever in 2016 in Windows 10. You can make it look and sound more wonderful than when it first shipped, back when it enslaved us in the greatest addiction of our lives. Okay, so I started the game in a dank, stinking prison cell. Wait. I thought this was supposed to be a fantasy. I don't like it when games are TOO close to real life.....			",179,27,4,43,63,3,38

												Amazing combat system, amazing atmosphere, takes you into a glimpse of the good and bad, poor and rich. The cyrodilic land of one of my favorite race's: The Imperial's. The heartland inhabitant's of the empire. This game will take you into a literal RPG and will give you shiver's from walking into a dungeon, a heartwarming welcome when you enter a town and be approached by your fellow friend's you meet on you journey's. I've logged in 1000's of hours into this game, read every book, did every quest, had every item, enchanted with all possible enchantment's, and casted every spell. Every town has a diversity, you'll want to go to the one's you're most welcome at. Every character has a specialty, you'll want to focus on your favorite's and never regret it.10/10 Even when compared to its better-half, Morrowind. ",26,1,0,7,4,1,5

												Not my first Elder Scrolls experience, but definitely my first to actually beat. The main story is entertaining and will take 20-30 hours to complete. I somehow managed to accomplish that task at level 5... and as a vampire. The enemy level scaling is very evident and proves to make the game far easier than it should be. That being said the interaction you have with the people of cyrodil are the main attraction. you'll take missions ranging from destroying oblivion gates to massacring a house full of guests agatha christie style. Plenty to do and much to see, Oblivion earned the title of Game of the Year.			",161,16,2,13,4,0,13

												Offers infinite replayability and hours upon hours of gameplay and exploration.There are hundreds of quality (...or at least entertaining) mods out there to enhance or add more to your experience as well.The amount of hours I have in the game right now are only from one run through the game, and I still haven't finished the shivering isles.I do have one major criticism however, and that is the level scaling. The enemies level with you. Those random bandits you had trouble dealing with at the beginning of the game? Well, they're going to have gear on par with yours or maybe even significantly better than yours as you progress into the game. It really ruins the sense of progression. However, this can be fixed with mods though if you don't like it, like most issues in the game. (Though I kept it the way it was)			",80,8,0,13,3,0,3

But the game is beautiful. If you are looking for fast-paced COD-esque action, go somewhere else. However, if you are on the fence about getting this game, get it. It's got some problems and short-comings, though nothing perfect is flawless.I give this game a 5/5, call me biased, if you dare. Just make sure you have a lot of time to kill when you get this.

												Yet another game will cost me 300 more hours. Also thanks to modding community, Cyrodiil is still an amazing place to explore.Until now TESIV's details surprise the hell out of me, even watching the Blades fighting you will receive skill bonus. Although some background stories related to some quests is not as obvious as you imagine, once you try to dig into it, you can find a completely new aspect about the event you currently involved. This is the most interesting story-telling style about TES series, and I love it, totally. My gameplay time might give you some idea ;) Just friggin' buy and play it!			",146,69,4,41,5,0,14

												Despite its flaws, (e.g. bizzarre looking faces, caves all being nearly identical, etc.) this is still my favorite elder scrolls game. The quests are (imo) leagues more interesting than skyrim's. It definetly has its quirks but to me, that makes it all the more enjoyable.			",109,23,0,8,6,0,7

												I have to be 100% honest. I have recently completed Skyrim, I'm most likely going to add more mods so I can play it over and over as I have fallen in love with it...I had Oblivion on my account ( Probably in a sale and forgot about it ) but after completing Elder Scolls V, I wouldn't of thought I'd enjoy this game... Anyway, I have only played it for... 15 Minutes? And I feel a little stupid, this game is just as perfect as Skyrim and I can't wait to relive the Elder Scolls again!If you are unsure about Elder Scolls and unsure if you'll enjoy something different, as I did ( I play games like GTA )... Give it a couple of hours and it'll grow on you and become one of your best games!Weirdly, I recommend this game! and I recommend the series too!10/10 - Nice work!			",346,72,24,34,53,5,39

												If you are planning to buy the game be sure to get the Oblivion GOTY deluxe edition to avoid the disappointing discovery that you missed out on some DLC. There is no legit way to upgrade from the 'normal' GOTY to the GOTY deluxe version besides buying the whole game a second time. As Todd Howard said in an interview about Oblivion: 'We made the game for hardware that doesn't exist.' Ten years after release that turns out to be a good thing. You can play Oblivion in 4k right out of the box and it looks pretty good with all settings on ultra high. If you invest a little time in modding the visuals are on par with Skyrim. Don't take complaints about the dated graphics to seriously as more often than not the underwhelming hardware is to blame.Like in the other games of the TES series you face a huge open world and the main quest being not stellar is not bad either.But the main quest is not what most players love to do in an Elder Scrolls game. It is the masterfully created living and breathing world with hundreds of side quests that keep you playing for hours and hours with always something new to do for you. And some of the quests are really memorable and I would go so far as to say the best in the franchise.The soundtrack by Jeremy Soule is spot on and one of the best you'll hear in any game. Shivering Isles is the best expansion I've ever played. See? I could go on and on. I should at least mention the massive content the modding community has contributed over the years. Giving you many more hours of enjoyment.All this can be yours for a few Septims - I mean €/$. You owe it to yourself to try it out if you are into RPGs. Oblivion is not a perfect game by any means - but it is very good and a technical masterpiece.			",1263,510,44,142,109,6,165

												Oblivion was great for its time. Released in 2006, that was the year before I graduated high school and attempted college. I played it to death and back on the Xbox, probably netting a few hundred hours. I remember getting the manual and reading it in class, like it was any other textbook.Now I've recently returned to it, several years later with an improved computer and modding capabilities and it does breathe some life into the game. While I can agree that Oblivion, by itself, has not aged well... It helps to mod it up to increase resolution, textures, and getting a mod to make everyone's faces look a lot more... normal. Doing all of that, it's like coming back to an old (but prettier) friend.Shivering Isles also continues to be a fairly fun expansion to play through. With two whole armor sets to work towards, dungeons with great loot, and a main quest that is extremely rewarding in terms of magical powers and loot, it's great to play through once more. (Incidentally, SI is also the most stable part of the game. Not a single Crash-to-Desktop or bug to be found while I was running around the Isles. Perhaps I was lucky, but perhaps the expansion just runs that well).I can understand how newer aged gamers may not care for the game too much... But Oblivion is worth exploring for some retroactive nostalgia if you started this franchise with Skyrim. Play this, and I'd also recommend Morrowind while you're at it. Happy gaming!

												Oblivion is the worst TES game ever. Then Skyrim came around and a good half of the TES community kinda changed its opinion. Turns out that Oblivion's actually a pretty good game.Almost as soon as you get out of the prison you realize just how different this game is compared to Morrowind. A lot of people hated this, but this is not actually a bad thing - even Morrowind kinda gets boring after a while, so a change in the setting keeps this game varied. Especially since Oblivion is good at doing what it tries to do, which is to be a game with a pretty comfy medieval fantasy atmosphere. However, it's mostly Jeremy Soule's soundtrack that does this because the game's graphics are incredibly lame and make this game look like the painting world from one of the sidequests. Speaking of sidequests, they're actually better than Morrowind's. They're a lot more interesting and a little bit more varied, so they almost become these short self-contained stories. I personally think that Oblivion has some of the best guild questlines in TES games ever. Dark Brotherhood is simply amazing and Thieves Guild was also pretty cool and Thief 1-like, with a really neat final quest to boot. Other guilds were not that great, sadly, because there was almost no improvement to the way quests are structured in this game. For some reason, Bethesda thinks it's really great to do this thing where they give the guild quests a storyline that becomes clearer the more quests you do, but then start throwing you off the trail by giving you lame tasks. I found the sidequests to be the real icing on the cake, because the main quest was pretty lame and brought nothing unique to the table. Overall, the base game is actually pretty good. Sure, some things got dumbed down compared to Morrowind, but it's also not cool to hate this game anymore, so there you go.Then Shivering Isles came out. ""And, behold, it was very good"". It almost feels like more effort was put into this expansion pack rather than into the ginormous base game. It was very interesting to be in this weird world, meet all those strange oddball characters who, this time around, had actually good and almost unique voiceovers, and do these bizzare quests. And, of course, who could forget Sheogorath? It's worth playing the expansion for the single purpose of hearing his amazing voiceover and reading his hilarious dialogue. Sadly, I can't say that all quests and sidequests in this expansion were great, but it's still worth to play Oblivion simply for Shivering Isles only. By the way, it's an actually good expansion pack done by Bethesda -  that's one for the books!Knights of the Nine is also supposed to be an important thing. However, it's not. It's painfully average and incredibly short. It's supposed to consist of 11 linear main quests, yet a good 60% of them can be done in a matter of 30 minutes. The writing is almost nonexistant, but the armor and the bossfight in the sky were cool. If you think that's not too bad, then just remember the fact that this pathetic excuse for an ""expansion pack"" used to cost 10 or 20 buckaroos when it just came out.			",295,48,6,36,25,2,47

												What can I say; I loved this game, but after being spoiled by the game-changing, genre-defining phenomenon which is Brink, I feel like playing this is a bit of a step down. It leaves much to be desired.Where's the intense parkour? The deformed character models? The completely redundant grenades? The dark and edgy storyline? The overwhelming feeling of buyer's remorse and deep sense of depression after small incriments of gameplay? Oh well, guess I'll have to wait for the long overdue Brink mod for this game, to bring it upto par.Until that day; 9.6/10When that day comes; 11.3/10			",42,4,0,16,5,0,16

												Solid game.  I would not play without some sort of graphics mods.  Starts the downward trend from Morrowind in the number of equipment slots and this continues downwards into Skyrim which has even less.  Leveling system is the same as Morrowind.  They axed a number of skills.  They didn't both to put spears into the game.As for voice acting... I would rather have had blocks of text to read.  The voice acting is a great addition, but not when seemingly every NPC you come across pulls from a voice actor pool of ~10 people (sic).  In Morrowind, they gave the important NPCs voices and everyone else had text blocks.  At least then you weren't faced with the realization that everyone had the same voice actors for all of the dialogue.Even with the negatives, which is mostly just nit-picking, 7/10.  I wouldn't play it again, but I enjoyed myself with it while I played it.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Oblivion is probably feeling a bit forlorn these days, with most of the hardcore crowd sticking to Morrowind and most of everyone else abandoning it for Skyrim. And it's no great mystery why this is the case, but I still think Oblivion is a game that shouldn't be overlooked, with the proper precautions taken.It's no secret that Oblivion is an RPG full of problems. The most grievous one in my opinion is the level scaling system, which scales basically everything in the game from dungeon loot and quest rewards to enemy equipment, gradually making the game more tedious as you level up until you finally find yourself face to face with a highway bandit who somehow found a full suit of Daedric armor and you just have to wonder where your decisions went so wrong that led you to this moment. The persuasion system is literally a joke, in which you just play a little wheel minigame where you dish out your best knock knock jokes (or boasts, if they're into that) until they have no choice but to tell you everything they know so that you'll leave them alone. I still don't know what the Speech stat even does, because as far as I'm aware you can start working on your standup routine fresh out of prison and never suffer any penalty. There's very little feeling of character specialization, and there's no reason at all to not be the leader of every guild in the game, the owner of your own order of knights, and more because even if you want to play the game as a stealthy archer or something the game all but forces you to become a combat focused character where your major choice boils down to ""magic or hitting things"" and there are no guilds that are strictly designed around a certain playstyle, making each of them less interesting for the people who did specialize towards one guild. The main storyline in general is fairly boring, and even the Shivering Isles expansion is fairly dull, to the point that I didn't even think that the collective content of it as a whole was as amusing as the single little Sheogorath quest in the base game.The good thing is that thanks to the magic of mods, most of Oblivion's faults can be fixed, and when you can play through the game without being constantly reminded of its flaws there's a lot to like, instead happily focusing on preventing the game from crashing whenever it feels like it. While it certainly has its fair share of tedious quests, Oblivion has a surprising amount of actually interesting content. I found myself enjoying more sidequests than not, and there are a few that are up there with my favorite quests in any RPG, like a certain Dark Brotherhood quest. Most of the ""organized"" quests like the guilds (for reference, play the Dark Brotherhood if you want to have fun, play the Thieves Guild if you want to pretend to have fun, play the Mages Guild if you hate fun, and play the Fighters Guild if you really hate goblins) and main story fall flat and feel like they build up too quickly for an ultimately weak payoff, but the real good stuff is in the one-shot stories you'll find in the towns and wilderness. Another perk of Oblivion is that it's home to the outstanding mod Nehrim: At Fate's Edge, which is a massive total-conversion mod that is arguably better than any of the Elder Scrolls games.Ultimately, Oblivion isn't an amazing game, but it can be pretty great or at least good after a bit of tweaking. As a special note, if you buy the deluxe edition I would personally recommend just disabling every minor DLC instead of bothering to grab all their unofficial patches, because as a whole I found them majorly disappointing in that almost all of them were just cheap excuses to get you things for free, like a house that has an ability that lets you skip one of the longest sidequests in the game or a house that has everything you could ever need for alchemy or any other of like 5 houses, quickly leaving you desperate for a quest that doesn't end with a deed to a mansion after being overloaded with a dozen quests you don't know the first thing about the moment you leave the prison. Even Knights of the Nine, the not-expansion expansion, is fairly short and not really interesting at all, unless you just think the armor reward looks cool. Ideally I'd recommend just not buying the deluxe edition at all, since the regular game of the year edition comes with the two worthwhile bits of content, but since there doesn't seem to be any way to buy the rest of the dlcs separate if you're a completionist you may as well jump for it. But overall I think Oblivion is definitely worth playing, especially since it goes on sale fairly often.			",574,245,9,46,42,6,55

												I am not so good at the whole review thing but here is my review on The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion® Game of the Year Edition!I don't know what it is about Oblivion that makes me keep coming back for more. It was the third Elder Scrolls that I ever played, and personally my favorite. Everything in this game was perfect. I could have played Skyrim with ease if it had everything that made Oblivion what it is. Skyrim, in my opinion, lacked something. Maybe it was the setting. Maybe it was the story. Maybe it was the higher sense of exploration and less emphasis on slashing your way through enemies. Maybe it was the breathtaking soundtrack. Here is my pros and cons list of this game and my final verdict.Pros: Masterful story, great combat although bow can be a pain sometimes, side quests that will keep you hooked for hundreds upon hundreds of hours, memorable characters, I could literally get so caught up in seeing what certain npc's would be doing and seeing how there everyday lives unfolded one time i remembered seeing Penniless Olvus dead next to the poor guy were a few guards my best guess of what happened to him is that since he begs he might not have been getting enough to live and tried his hand at pickpocketing someone and got caught because i saw a good amount of gold on his corpse.Cons: Bow combat can be annoying if you did not mean to pull it back because there is no way to retract it, potato faces which you can easily overlook, and not many voice actors but can also be overlooked seeing as how the quests are great.The point is, is that this game brings endless possibilities for you to experience and how you play the game is up to you. Will you be a great hero who fights off the mythic dawn and puts a stop to corruption, or will you be a crazy bloodthirsty serial killer who teases the guard egging them on to catch you, perhaps even becoming a adverage citizen earning money off of game, errands, and or investing in shops. The choice is yours, but i can what I can tell you is that you can not pass up on playing this game it is just such a well thought out game, I myself have put in over 1k hours on this game on console, steam, and pc disc combined. If you have not got this already go and get it now, trust me you will not regret it! Final result 5/5 WILL PLAY AGAIN!			",123,13,3,16,16,1,17

												Noticed I never reviewed this game, my favorite Elder Scrolls game.First off, I have played this game mostly on Xbox 360 at the time it came out. At least 500 hours worth of gameplay, at least.This game has all that is needed to make it a great RPG.Quest, Magic, swords, clubs and monsters. Also a modern version of the Morrowind class system.Being that the newest addition of the Elder Scrolls games, Skyrim, is out at the time I write this I will provide a short review for those that know skyrim but have not played this.If you do not like Skyrim, but found Morrowind to old fashion. You will enjoy Oblivion greatly.Pros-Magic system that is vastly superior to Skyrim and Morrowind.-Magic spell crafting-Best Guild Quest lines out of all the Elder Scroll games.-A large map full of dungeons and monsters.-LOOOT !!!!-Large variety of monsters/animals and enemies.-Potion crafting-Variety of equipment.-Very Long and memorable main story quest-More quest than I can count.-Shivering Isles DLC adds a huge new land to discover, with quest galor.Cons-Unless you level up your level in weapon skills, weapons will do jack♥♥♥♥♥♥in damage.-Level Scalling. -Weapon Scalling.-Few graphical Gliches in some dungeons.A great game.

												TL;DRBuy Oblivion right now.---------------------------------------10/10 would spam jump to win again.Play this game. I have in total about 700 hours of Skyrim (mostly not through steam). I bought Oblivion GotY edition while it was on sale a few months ago, but I never really played it. I just started to play it, and let me tell you, it's good. The lockpicking, magic, speechcraft, combat, side quests, humor, etc. etc. are all much more enjoyadble and overall better than Skyrim. It has so many cool and interesting features that make it super immersive, super RP-friendly, and really fun. Dialogue with actually funny jokes and combat that isn't ""click to win"" like some *cough* games are really appeals to me. Seriously, I'm surprised that it's this good. Everyone always told me it was super hard and that I shoouldn't get it, but I'm glad I did. Time to buy Morrowind.			",35,2,0,12,3,0,1

												Personally, I would say Oblivion is one of my favorite games I've ever played. Sure, it might be a little old and it might not look as good as Skyrim, but honestly the game makes up for it in content. Plus if it bothers you that much, there are some good mods out there to fix that. I would say that no game I have ever played has ever given me quite the same experience. I don't want to spoil anything but I've owned the game on Xbox and loved it enough to buy it again.Oblivion has a huge world to explore full of ruins, dungeons, towns and castles. The main questline is amazing but to be honest, I loved the DLCs and guilds more than anything. Oblivion is a very detailed world that you can really get into. I've spent hours just doing side quests and admiring Cyrodiil.I would absolutely recommend this game to anyone who likes open world games. If you can get this on sale it's even better. You won't regret it.			",127,21,1,26,16,0,12

												This game is one of the best in The Elder Scrolls series. The fantasy music and beautiful scenery make completely up for the perhaps outdated graphics. Even people who aren't a fan of The Elder Scrolls franchise will probably enjoy the game. I had hoped that Bethesda would have implemented more from this game into Skyrim, like the unarmed skill line which makes it possible to make a fighting beserker type character. I love this game.

												This is my most favorite game that I have ever found, and I have seen/played many.  I have played thru it many times for many hundreds of hours.  I believe it plays truest to the original intent of the old school role play game.  I have spent many hours researching for another, but none are as good as Oblivion.  Many games call themselves RPG, but they  do not come close to the true depth of detail for roll playing as Oblivion.  Quit frankly, many games that are taged as RPG are very waterd down versions of the original styl of RPG. If Bethesda remasterd the graphics, I would by it again even though I own 3 copies.

												While I don't like the way Bethesda is making their games easier and dumbing down their content, this game is still enjoyable.  I'd rather they didn't remove so many skill lines, or remove negative consequences. You can do it all in this game, you aren't forced to choose right vs wrong, nor is there any real depth to the characters. You can kill anyone you want without consequences. The point of a Role Playing game is your actions should result in game changing events, there is way too much hand-holding going on. This is more like an FPS in a Elder Scrolls setting.

												This is by far my favorite Elder Scrolls game. I owned the hard copy previously and when I saw it on Steam I knew I had to get it. The environment in this Elder Scrolls is the best out of all the games. Tamriel has a peaceful air to it filled with vibrant color and good amounts of green. The story is easy to follow and maintains interest. All of the side quests and other distractions give this game 1000's of hours of gameplay potential.The only complaint I have about this game is the leveling system. The level of enemies is based on your level so if you focus too much on levelling non-combat skills, the enemies become very tough to kill. This is more then made up for by the rest of the game though, so I'd still give a 10/10. Shadow guide you.			",126,18,5,13,13,0,11

												The game that defined the modern RPG and arguably the best game ever written. In the two years since escaping from the Imperial prison I have become a holy crusader, a gladiator in the arena, fallen from grace, spent an uncomfortable two weeks as a vampire, defeated at least one ancient evil, driven ghosts out of my home and been made into a god. Also, there's some problem in Kvatch, which people keep on referring to as the 'main quest'.Massive, I'm nearly 200 hours in and there are parts of the main game and bits of DLC I haven't even started to look at. With the 'unofficial' patches from the community this game has had most of it's bugs fixed and runs well on modern PCs. Other community mods make it an incredibly pretty game, fix gameplay issues and add oodles more content.Look at http://www.nexusmods.com/oblivion for mods and patches.			",103,27,0,31,8,0,12

Veterans of this game (And Morrowind) Will agree to this. If you want to level up super quick...Acrobatics and Athletics in your main skills... Running and Jumping is how you level those skills...

												This is the epitomy of the fantasy genre. It has perfect mechanics for getting into RPGs without being too streamlined or confusing. The environment is perfectly put together and will keep you invested for months at a time. The levelling is set up so that the game can actually get harder as you play, instead of easier and boring like another game in the series. This is the perfect game to play as a first RPG, and it will keep veterans just as entertained. This game is far over-shadowed by its comparatively mediocre sequel, and I highly recommend everyone to play this game and some of its predeccessors for an idea of what a true open-world fantasy experience should be.

												Played this game for hundeds of hours on console recently got it on steam. Oblivion has always been my favourite game in The Elder Scrolls series and perhaps in my top 5 ever.The open world of Tamriel's central province Cyrodil is stunningly georgeous for a game made in 2005 and remains iconic to this day. The story is in my opinion the best the series has ever produced and this game is easily home to the best DLC from and Elder Scrolls game, The Shivering Isles.Oblivion unlike its younger brother Skyrim (Also a great game) Isn't easily mastered and does present a challenge at higher levels, Yes you get god like strong and epicly awsome equipment ans spells but so do your enemies. And the best enchantments on weapons eat up your soul gems.Oblivions class system is somethinng I missed in Skyrim, It makes you focus and develop your Character along the 7 skills you chose though you still can master all skills though any skill you did not chose as a major skill doesn't level you up.The combat at levels 15+ clearly rises in difficulty. Enemies start staggering you in close quarters and you sniping skills need to improve fast along with adding some poisons and preferably an enchantment on your bow to keep getting those one shot kills.I could write a novel on the game but in short Oblivion is an excelent open world rpg with a great story fun characters and factions and always gives you something to do 10/10 if you havent played this get it asap			",111,12,5,31,6,0,13

												You know, Bethesda doesn't exactly make really excellent games... you buy their stuff because they're the ONLY high-profile developer out there that makes their particular variety of open-world RPG. In a Bethesda game, you can go anywhere on the (typically) VERY large world map, and do just about anything you in-game character in capable of doing at anytime you please. That level of freedom to do whatever the **** you want goes a long way.SO, while Oblivion has a whole list of stupid/annoying mistakes and flaws, it's still worth playing through a few times or more. There's just SO MUCH you can do with it, especially if you start modding, which can really make this game shine.			",127,54,2,52,16,3,25

												This game is my absolute favourite. No doubt, it was one of my first introductions to RPG and i'm greatful me and my friend stole it out of my brother room and spent the next three days playing it with little sleep. i still play it to this day, and have it on mulitple consoles including PC, obviously. The mainquest is cool but nothing too special, but it's the rest of the game that sets it apart. Amazing quests, amazing weapons and armour. the DLC is all pretty incredible and adds many hours of rad gameplay, it's like the never ending game of awesome that I'm still exploring. I most definitely reccomend this game.			",24,3,0,4,1,0,2

												All in all, I find this game way more appeling than its more modern counter-part, Skyrim. In my opinion the guilds are a lot more immersive and in-depth as you work your way up the chain in a way that makes sense for that particular group; battling evil necromancers and getting recommendations for the arcane university, rather than Skyrim's cast a simple spell get into the arcane college. The main story is also pretty epic, as the invasion of the daedra draws near ever minute, you along with the local Blades need to take certain actions to stop this onslaught. Need a break from quests or need something else to do in the game? Well you can make your own adventures by clearing the local fort or dungeon, either by yourself or with a group of adept adventures behind your back. The only issues I came across dealt with the leveling up/character build mechanic. Cookie-cutter characters are hard to make as a wizard build has to be purely towards the most magicka to cast the higher tier spells; warrior builds and theif builds aren't as restricting, but are still a little rigid. Also at a certain point your character becomes ""too good"", as your attributes hit insane heights. You become really hard to kill, save for a room FILLED with top quality enemies or a named legendary enemy. I'll admit that the perk system of Skyrim is better, as it rewards using skills and allows for intresting characters to form. Would give this game around a 9.5/10. The DLC's are amazing btw.

												The game that defined the modern RPG and arguably the best game ever written. In the two years since escaping from the Imperial prison I have become a holy crusader, a gladiator in the arena, fallen from grace, spent an uncomfortable two weeks as a vampire, defeated at least one ancient evil, driven ghosts out of my home and been made into a god. Also, there's some problem in Kvatch, which people keep on referring to as the 'main quest'.Massive, I'm nearly 200 hours in and there are parts of the main game and bits of DLC I haven't even started to look at. With the 'unofficial' patches from the community this game has had most of it's bugs fixed and runs well on modern PCs. Other community mods make it an incredibly pretty game, fix gameplay issues and add oodles more content.Look at http://www.nexusmods.com/oblivion for mods and patches.			",103,27,0,31,8,0,12

												Ok...My review here is very similar to the one I did on Morrowind ( Read it here http://steamcommunity.com/id/BringerOfDusk/recommended/  )They tried to fix my main issue with Morrowind, in Oblivion. They Dropped the skills down to 21 (Was 27 in Morrowind).  Same deal though. Some skill choices take forever for you to level up. Some you level up instantly (figuratively...) Veterans of this game (And Morrowind) Will agree to this. If you want to level up super quick...Acrobatics and Athletics in your main skills... Running and Jumping is how you level those skills... And by leveling your main skills you level your charecter.			",92,2,0,14,7,0,15

												Played this game for hundeds of hours on console recently got it on steam. Oblivion has always been my favourite game in The Elder Scrolls series and perhaps in my top 5 ever.The open world of Tamriel's central province Cyrodil is stunningly georgeous for a game made in 2005 and remains iconic to this day. The story is in my opinion the best the series has ever produced and this game is easily home to the best DLC from and Elder Scrolls game, The Shivering Isles.Oblivion unlike its younger brother Skyrim (Also a great game) Isn't easily mastered and does present a challenge at higher levels, Yes you get god like strong and epicly awsome equipment ans spells but so do your enemies. And the best enchantments on weapons eat up your soul gems.Oblivions class system is somethinng I missed in Skyrim, It makes you focus and develop your Character along the 7 skills you chose though you still can master all skills though any skill you did not chose as a major skill doesn't level you up.The combat at levels 15+ clearly rises in difficulty. Enemies start staggering you in close quarters and you sniping skills need to improve fast along with adding some poisons and preferably an enchantment on your bow to keep getting those one shot kills.I could write a novel on the game but in short Oblivion is an excelent open world rpg with a great story fun characters and factions and always gives you something to do 10/10 if you havent played this get it asap			",111,12,5,31,6,0,13

												After playing many hours of this game on my ps3 I decided to also pick up the PC edition for the add-ons and mods. This game has yet to fail to wow me in terms of scope and design. Sure the world may feel empty and your actions inconsequential, but it doesn't really bug me. I think it's pretty sweet that  I can be the listener for the dark brotherhood at night and be a holy crusader by day. The levelling system, though in many ways worse than Skyrim's, reminds me of an old-school style hard core RPG in terms of the skills and attributes. All in all, you would do well to pick up this game and give it a go.			",142,20,2,18,14,1,32

												If you don't have this game, or if you have never played this game, then you are missing out on one of the best open world games that has ever been created. The map is huge, the art style and the different environments are beautiful, and there are tons of quests to distract you from the main story. There are different guilds you can join that can appeal to different tastes. Honestly, the only main problem that I have with this game, other than a few small glitches, is the Oblivion gates. They're fun at first, but they can get a little repetitive. Still, this game is one of my top 5 favorite games of all time. 9/10			",254,45,1,34,9,2,22

Got it when it first came out for the xbox and enjoyed it until it broke. :(The game is extremely customizable (like any Bethesda game. x3) looks decent and the controls feel decent. Now the game is infested with more sexual mods than actual mods. (sort of) Really good game to start practicing mod making and generally have fun on. Its an open world rpg game full of fantastic fun. Save dames from evil centaurs, kill that evil dragon of morgul and become a powerful wizard. Dont play this game unless you want to be stuck in your room with your computer for the next 20 years.

												A wonderfully rich game in the series and has hours and hours of content.  I remember when I first saw Oblvion at the E3 XBOX Conference I was astounded at how good this game looked.  I first played it on the XBOX 360 and have since seen it on the PS3 and the PC.  This game on PC was a hog when released, but on more modern machines, including more modest ones today can run this game looking as good as the developed had intended.  Many of the screenshots uploaded show off the rich environments of the Provence of Cyrodiil.  Like many games in the Elder Scrolls series you start the game as a no one and find yourself in fortunate circumstances which enables you to wonder the world.  Upon the first part of the character creation where you have a myriad of options to taylor your character exactly how you want you do find just how deep this game can be.  Game play for Oblivion has departed a little from previous entries as it is now more action based, where your states do not determine IF you will hit the enemy but how much damage, if they block and so on.  So it is not the TRUE RPG experience that many might have expected if you love Morrowind.  But it enables a player to quickly get into the swing of things and as you progress through the story you find yourself sometimes feeling more powerful than you are and will undertake some foes that are just out of your reach, BUT, with the mechanics of Oblivion it is not beyond impossible, creative ways to get objects between you and your enemy, knowing when to run, are all options if you find yourself in a sticky situtation. Many of the objectives in the game are leveled to your character so none of the quests seem too difficult and other than a small handful of quests you can do most (the others will not unlock until you reach a specific level).Leveling is easy, you have major and minor skills, get your Major skill up a level and you will level yourself.  Minor skills level up as well, at a slower rate.  This is where it will be a good indication as to how you will want to play your character since if you pick a warrior load out but find you want to sneak around then sneaking skills will take longer to level.  So to increase a skill you use it, fight enemies with a sword to increase your blade, hit them with damaging magic and your destruction will increase, sneak around the dark corners of the world (and there are many) and you will get better at doing do.The music by Jeremy Soule is one of the best sound tracks he has done and I even love listening to it as I find myself looking over the vistas the game presents.  The music dynamics do over an insight if you have annoyed an enemy, but it is a good indication especially when you do not know from where they are coming at you.  The biggest let down with an unmodded version are some of the sound glitches that happen, where audio will cut out, it will come back after a period of time but you will find yourself wondering the wilds and making no footsteps, but the most difficult one is the weapon strike and knowing when you have hit your enemy as it can disappear to.  But I believe there is an unofficial patch can fix many of these issues.Under newer operating systems this game might just crash from time to time, I have found when the in-game dialogs display as white and not textured it might be a good time to save.  Save often, make sure the auto saves are also set, on PC this takes no time and you will be welcoming it after a few crashes.All in all this is a top addition to the series and would highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys a solid RPG experience and a game that will sometimes make you just want to sit and enjoy the view.

												My neighbours always welcome me like ""Hello, Dunmer!"".I always loved to close every Oblivion Gate I found. Right now, my neighbourhood is free of Oblivion Gates. Cats can find food more easily since no Daedroth try to steel their food.Shop owner at the corner of my street gives me free sweetrolls every morning, because I killed the minotaur at his backyard.Before enchanting my sport shoes, I wasn't able to catch my bus. Now, I never miss it.And since I leveled up, people keep saying ""You smell of death, been conjuring up dead things?"".			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												One of the best RPGs that I've ever played. You will have plenty of fun with this game and once you beat it vanilla, it's time to install mods! Mods for this game are soooo much fun. Anything that you can think of, they add to the game. Want new quests? Done. Want rebalancing of level? Easy. Do you want more weapons? How about a mod that adds 120 immersive weapons? Yes, there are many, many mods for this game.My only complaint with this game is that it may crash every once in a while, mods or not, because Bethesda games usually crash a whole bunch for no specific reason. Sure, you can have 8+ hour sessions where the game will run smooth and not crash whatsoever or you can be playing for about an hour and have it crash when you enter an interior. In my opinion, the game is badly optimized but that's the only con, and the pros outweight the cons by A LOT.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Oblivion. My favorite Elder scrolls game so far! I've played all of the main titles except for Daggerfall, and the Online one, but man, this game is fun! You can craft your own spells once you get to the Mages Guild in the Imperial City! I like Oblivion better than Skyrim, because you don’t feel like you’re carrying a backpack full of rocks, you can actually cast magic while holding a sword and a shield, and Cyrodiil is not as cold and miserable as the neighbor to the North!Another thing I like about ES4: Oblivion is once you level up your acrobatics and athletics a bit, you can run really fast and jump super high! I like this game better than Morrowind, because you don’t have to be a specific class build to actually land a blow, the only downside, is it discluded the levitation spell from Morrowind. I still have yet to beat the main quest line, but I beat the Mages Guild, beat Shivering Isles, and Started on the Dark Brotherhood, and it’s honestly one of my favorite RPG’s Ever! On a scale of 2, I give this game a 10. 10/2.Edit: So far, I see no need for mods, The game isn't as glitchy and broken as Skyrim, and the story and characters are fun enough, that I only play Vanilla!

												This is the first elder scroll games i got.  So Far  The game is really well made!Review--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------The elder Scrolls  Oblivion is a open world,story rich  game that take place in the Medievil era. The graphics in this game is good back then in 2006 or 07.  The game has a lot of option to do, Like quest, go to caves, and more. The Story is very intresting that It's like someone is reading a book. So far after more then 15 hours of the game, I got addicted  to the game. The game is made by one of my favorite company of all time is Bethesda, same oh made Skyrim,Fallout NW, and etc. I was going to get Skyrim but my PC is so bad that i can barely run games above 2009. (unless it's a 2d shooter or platformer) The Soundtrack is by far the best soundtrack yet. The elder Scrolls is a really well progamed game. If you like dungons,dragons, then this game is for you--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Positive-Great story-Customizeable character-Very Open source- Peaceful soundtruck-big modding community-Open world-Good Graphics back then in 2007-Quests--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Negative-Crashes-Bugs-erorrs (sometimes)--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Rating9/10 ""Loved it, one of my favorite games  of all time""			",159,10,6,13,14,1,4

												How to play the PS3/Xbox 360 version of Oblivion: 1. Spend hundreds if not thousands of hours playing the game, it's super funHow to play the PC/Steam version: 1. Spend 10 hours installing mods 2. Play the game for 5-10 minutes until it crashes 3. Spend an hour trying to figure out why it crashed 4. Give up, and then uninstall and reinstall it 5. Repeat steps 1-4 until you feel like crying and/or punching your screenOblivion is one of my favourite games of all-time, as well as one of my least favourite games of all-time. I highly recommend it, but don't let the mods ruin your experience; pray to the Nine Divines that they will enhance it.			",132,14,1,28,5,1,11

												The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Game of the Year Deluxe EditionBe prepared for a detailed review of this game. If you're considering purchasing this, have a read and see what you think before doing so!Positives:+ Pleasant graphics for a game almost a decade old (2006).+ A huge assortment of quest to complete, such as the Thieves' Guild, Dark Brotherhood, Fighter's Guild, Mage's Guild and Daedric God storylines. Lots of miscellaneous quests too.+ Massive map to explore, lots of locations including caves, bandit camps, forts and ancient ayleid ruins. Snowy regions and lush forest, open grasslands and swamps, very varied terrain.+ Wide array of weaponry, many, many skills to level up, use magic, archery or melee combat to strike down foes. Mix your own potions with alchemy, become a master of acrobatics or conjure powerful beasts to do your bidding. + Hundreds of hours of gameplay to engage in. Fun for the first 100-120. Anything in excess of level 40 starts to see boredom set in. I recommend taking regular breaks to avoid the repetition, in which case it won't be so noticeable. + Large mod community.Negatives:- Extremely flawed and stupid monster levelling, giving you no sense accomplishment when you progress to higher levels. Many creatures will be levelled to you, meaning that, at higher levels, you'll be required to spam click attacks for ages to get kills (ogres, goblin warlords, gloom wraiths). Keep in mind this is using the best weapons available, with the highest skill level. Much to your disdain, you'll spend hours clearing out caves or forts filled with insanely high hitpoint enemies. Not fun, not a challenge, just a complete and utter waste of time.- Caves, dungeons and other places have a lot of loot potential and you'll have fun in the beginning collecting fragments of armour, potions and gold to pay for adventuring supplies and purchasing houses. However, after awhile there's literally nothing to spend your cash on. All of the equipment I've sold has resulted in stockpiling over 300,000 coins, with nothing practical to spend it on. Every elder scrolls (even the latest instalment to the series, Skyrim) has had this issue.- Dumb AI that gets stuck when you jump onto rocks and cast magic or shoot arrows. It doesn't understand how to reach you. The AI scripting for conversations is also ridiculous. There are only a limited number of discussions citizens can have between each other and these all feel very, very unnatural. It's as if the designers didn't bother to implement realistic dialogue. - Many textures for forts or caves are re-used and do not look unique. This gets dull later, rather than sooner, but it's still a great downfall of the title. The layouts of many locations are similar. They might have different pathways, include an underwater cave or a bridge, but for all intents and purposes, most locations have a familiar feel to them. There's little excitement in that regard.- Modding requires excessive use of complicated tools that are not only time consuming but annoying. Not to mention the countless glitches that conflict with gameplay.- Character levelling comes to a sudden halt around levels 40+, it becomes so infrequent that you feel like you're achieving nothing at all, apart from going on errands for a number of characters you don't care much about.The Shivering Isles Expansion:Positives:+ New textures compared to the base game, an entirely new environment, new colours, new armour and weapons, new characters, new monsters and new quests. Consequently, this expansion does have a feeling of freshness to it. +Around 30 hours of additional content, which is not unreasonable for an expansion.Negatives:- Despite the fact that there are various changes and new features, the dreadful monster levelling system remains, which never fails to detract greatly from the experience (unless you go to the Shivering Isles at a lower level, at which point it becomes bearable).- Rather horrible voice acting for Sheogorath, too try-hard in its approach, quite off-putting and didn't seem like a genuine portrayal of the characteristics the developers wanted to exhibit, which was a God of Madness.Knights of the Nine Expansion:Positives:+ A new and intriguing storyline (for the most part) based around the Nine Divines, where you must complete a series of tests to retrieve the ancient armour of Crusader Pelinal Whitestrake, in an effort to defeat the infamous Umaril, a Daedra who poses a threat to Cyrodiil. + Some extra locations to explore which have been added to the map during the expansion, but nothing really new other than aesthetics (the Crusader armour and weapons). + There's a real feeling of reviving the old Knights of the Nine Order, as people will approach you to swear their allegiance. You'll fight side by side at the end against Umaril's minions in a big battle, which is cool.Negatives:- Many of the places you'll visit are filled with the standard enemies you'll encounter in the base game, there is little difference in the design of these locations to other ayleid ruins or forts in the base game as well.DLC Add-Ons:Positives:+ A number of new houses for those interested. There's a Wizard's Tower, a Castle and an underground Cave that can become new homes, some of them include enchanting and spellmaking areas for convenience.+ A few additional activities to partake in, like collecting dwarven artifacts stolen by bandits, to repair an Orrery at the Arcane University. You can also investigate the caverns beneath anvil to find the resting place of a pirate ship and the mystery behind it. In the East of Cyrodiil you can travel to Sundercliff Watch, a fortress that holds the powerful Daedric item, Mehrune's Razor.Negatives:- Some bugs which interfere with how the house DLC works, causing problems with them being unable to be purchased or relevant questlines not progressing.Overall Score: 7.5/10The Elder Scrolls: IV Oblivion is almost a decade old as of 2015. It's still a very entertaining and fun game, but one should also be aware of the numerous problems it has. Worth picking up on sale for under $10.			",66,3,0,9,2,0,8

												the elder scrolls iv: oblivion is not realistic. if you're looking for realism, go away. the elder scrolls iv: oblivion is not graphically impressive. if you're looking for impressive visuals, go away. the elder scrolls iv: oblivion has a lot of content. if you expect to finish this game in your lifetime, go away. seriously, leave. you are wasting your time reading this.with that out of the way, here's my review. this is the game that quite honestly set a foundation for modern RPGs. it has everything you would expect in your average RPG: spooky dungeons, loot, exploring, a large amount of quests... but here's the thing. oblivion isn't an average RPG. it has a LOT to offer for what its worth now, and frankly i found this to be more engaging than skyrim. here's why!as i mentioned at the beginning of this review, it does not hold up well to todays standards. everyone has baby butt faces and it seems everyone, including the scrawny elderly beggars, is voiced by the voice actors that portrayed the intimidating imperial guards... it just looks goofy. but, if you strip it down to its core functions, you get a pretty solid RPG with plenty of features to occupy your mind.it may seem redundant at first: whack whack whack, slice slice slice. you start to realize dungeons look almost exactly the same. but fear not! there are plenty of treats to keep you occupied as you level up. dungeons start being populated by more frightening enemies, you start to get better tiers of armor and weaponry... you also start exploring some of the guilds and their special quests. i found myself forgetting about the main quest after 50 hours of gameplay involving side quests and world exploration... then realizing i still have the amulet of kings in my inventory. sorry emperor!!one of the highlights of this game--one of the reasons i find it TONS more exciting than skyrim--you can LITERALLY GO TO HELL. is that cool or what?! i think so!! bethesda games aren't known for having the most engaging main quests but this is honestly one of the main reasons why i prefer oblivion above skyrim. the story just feels more intriguing to me. in the DLC shivering isles, you can go to this crazy ""other world"" that has new enemies, new dungeons, and more content. i like that skyrim has naturally fixed the majority of what made oblivion so goofy (mods have fixed most of these problems anyway) but i find myself coming back to oblivion, a game nearly a decade old, and playing hour after hour only realizing that my entire day consisted of waking up, sitting down for 14 hours, and going back to bed.i really, really, super duper wish i could talk about this game for hours. thing is, the elder scrolls is a series you have to play for yourself to understand. still though, i hope this review was helpful for you RPG-goers <3			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												It is a great game. So far I have around 40 hours on it and I have completed the main quest, thieves guild, dark brotherhood, arena, mages guild and almost the shivering isles. The review will be in 6 sections- graphics, combat/magic, guilds, dlc, main quest, overall.Graphics:Obviously due to its age oblivion is not looking great but it has aged quite well and the graphics does not change the fact that it is a great game. Also this can be touched up with mods.Combat/Magic:The combat is not great and not particularly enjoyable. I therefore enchanted my self an OP bow early that does a ton of damage spread over a large radius(it one hits pretty much everything in a certain radius from the guy that was hit with the arrow). However I like the fact that you can cast spells whilst having other weapons equipped unlike in skyrim.Guilds:This will be an oblivion to skyrim comparisonthieves guild is better in oblivion- you steal more, get better rewards and it is less of the dungeon crawling.dark brotherhood I would say is equal. In oblivion it is long but entertaining whereas skyrim it is short but sweetmages guild is better thsn the college of winterhold. The recommendations can be tedious but the rest is a lot better.fighters guild is do not know about as I have not done it.Arena is better than the s**t bards collegeDLC:This will be a skyrim to oblivion comparisonOblivion has a lot of useless dlc that pretty much equals hearthfire so i will only be talking about Knights of the nine, dawnguard, shivering isles and dragonborn.Shivering Isles is amazing and the best part of oblivion. It at the very least equals dragonborn another amazing dlc.Knights of the nine looks great whereas I did not much like dawnguard.Main Quest:Oblivion main story was a better plot the skyrim and felt more important. However the oblivion gates mechanic and the dragons both got boring. I enjoyed playing through both of them a lot and to be honest if you enjoyed either of them you will like the other.Overall: If you like skyrim do not be afraid to try oblivion. It might be tough to get used to but it is definitely on par with skyrim and if produced tomorrow would probably be a better game. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Many mechanics are flawed, the graphics are out-dated, it's buggy as hell, little to no controller support, every enemy is an arrow sponge past mid-difficulty level, and combat is terrible. You may be wondering at this point why I gave this game a positive rating... it's because this game is beautiful. This is the game you bring home to your mother, unlike that trash Skyrim (I love Skyrim). This is the game you cuddle up on a couch to, playing all night on xbox or playstation because you can't cuddle with a mouse and keyboard. This is the game that taught many people, including myself, what an rpg could truly be. This game did not have the extroardinary success that Skyrim had, nor did it redefine how gigantic an rpg could be like Morrowind, but what it did do is further push the standards, raising the bar even further than ever believed possible. This game helped further shape what it means to be an open world rpg today and like all Bethesda Game Studio's games it is a timeless classic that no matter how ugly, old, or broken it may seem; you have to give it a chance. Escape prison, help what was believed to be a simple farm boy become the emperor he was born to be, become a professional thief, help and fight daedric princes, join a guild, explore the world, become an arena grand champion, become a lethal assasin, become a true madman, and CLOSE SHUT THE JAWS...      OF OBLIVION!			",28,0,0,9,1,0,1

												Aside from the rather dated leveling scale, this game sports a fantastic soundtrack, wildly ambitious storylines, whimsical environments, and playful atmospheres.You can easily get a few hundred hours out of the romanticism of Cyrodiil, the brutal wastelands of Oblivion, the holy crusade of the Nine, and the maniacal whimsy of the Shivering Isles, even without mods.

												This game is simply.. No, insanely amazing! When you start playing it.. You're bound to crave for more.The exploration is worth it, you can go on exploring for hours. I found myself doing the main quest and often stop to explore something that peaked my interest, or simply started talking to a random NPC and got a new quest to do, that embarked me in another journey of finding more amazing stuff.This game is definitely worth picking up if you like RPGs, you'll get your money's worth, the gameplay can go on for hours and hours since there are many side quests and exploration you can do!

												It's a modern classic. I'd reccomend both this and Morrowind (with the right mods for morrowind). Honestly, even though the Knights of the Nine expansion gives you overpowered armor (due to the fact that there's always a leveled version availiable, if you know how), it provides enough challenge to be fun.

												Oblivion>Skyrim. Morrowind>Oblivion. If you like Bethesda RPG's and are tired of the over simplification of their games, Oblivion is a nice medium between ""I have no idea what I'm doing in this game(Morrowind)"" and ""I wish the game didn't hold my hand so much(Skyrim)"". I have beaten every quest in the game twice now so I am pretty comfortable in my viewpoint. When it came out it was a 9/10 in 2006... by todays standards I'm gonna give it a 7.5/10.My only compaint is that the environment scaling to the characters level completely destroys any sense of looting and novelty when exploring things. For instance, in Morrowind you may encounter a cave populated by extremely high level enemies at level 1. 99% of people are gonna die and just not come back until a higher level. But if you are intuitive, or can just really design a good build maybe you make it past them. And find some insane Daedric artifact or weapon, something ACTUALLY WORTHWHILE. I wish TES would go back to that type of system, it added such a huge element of surprise to the game and made exploring things actually worthwhile.			",20,0,0,4,0,0,1

												ES IV Oblivion is a game that will amaze you from begining to end. Enter Cyrodil in a time of doubt and conflict where a cult threatens to destroy Tamriel and everyone on it because of its beliefs. Fight against man and beast in this increadibly expansive world were you are greeted with hundreds of hours of entertainment and enjoyment were even with its dated grafics it shows you the beauty of Cyrodil. Amazing game with good graphics and beautiful music. What sells it for me is the beauty of the story and the how the deep lore brings you in to the game and engages you in it. Never a bore or chore to play a game as amazing as this.You can always mod and change anything you dont like (for me it was the barter system) but with mods anything is possible.9/10			",165,79,1,15,31,0,7

												I haven't scratched the surface of this game yet, but I can tell it's going to give me literally years of enjoyment.  If Bethesda were able to swing it, I'd bet a remake/remaster would be very well received, probably moreso than even the Skyrim remaster.  This is the Ultima X we wanted but never got after that abortion of a game:  Ascension.  It's actually quite overwhelming to get into if you do any research beforehand, so I'd probably suggest you close your eyes and just push the buy button.  You probably won't be disappointed provided you're able to get it running ok on your Win 10 computer.  There are some good quality of life mods on nexus for this game that will enhance gameplay and overall stability.			",26,0,0,4,4,0,2

Everything about this game just blew me the ♥♥♥♥ away. The music was amazing, the lands were fun to explore and the plot is still unique to this day. The story itself isn't very original: Ancient prophecy is broken so some duder has to unbreak some stuff so a bunch of duders don't kill all of the duders. That isn't what makes the plot unique. What makes this so different than normal is that you aren't the duder who's unbreaking things, you're a duder who breaks other things to help the main duder unbreak the stuff that wasn't supposed to be broken. You're just some ♥♥♥♥ that hits stuff with a sword when it gets in the way. You don't even play that big of a part in the story as a whole, you're just kind of there yet at the end of the day you feel more accomplished than you ever will in real life.Buy this game.

Found out missions that are not even shown in your journal (got help from oblivion wiki). When I got mad I killed lots and reloaded my save. In time I had a save that I continue time to time just destroying and killing everything. It's dlc's were a game changer and shivering isles was full of fun. But I was not able to close every oblivion gate, complete every quest, play It on hardest difficulty and try out mods like morroblivion. And that's why I picked this game again. And because It is a part of me as a teacher of english and morals. So... have at you!			",249,38,2,29,11,3,20

												Oblivion I feel is the weakest compared to Morrowind and Skyrim. It lacks the refinement of Skyrim in combat and radiant AI as well as Morrowind depth and quest connectivity. Nevertheless, I always enjoyed Oblivion quite a lot as it was my first TES game and the one the modded most heavily. While it can be quite bland in some places, I could always look past that but it could put off quite a few people. Then there are the mods. Personally, I always found that, at least for the moment, Oblivion mods are the easiest to find and most plentiful out of the TES games. Most MW mods seem scatter across various sites while the big Skyrim mods are still in deveiopement. Overall, I would say that it is still a pretty good game that definately is worth it.

												ES IV Oblivion is a game that will amaze you from begining to end. Enter Cyrodil in a time of doubt and conflict where a cult threatens to destroy Tamriel and everyone on it because of its beliefs. Fight against man and beast in this increadibly expansive world were you are greeted with hundreds of hours of entertainment and enjoyment were even with its dated grafics it shows you the beauty of Cyrodil. Amazing game with good graphics and beautiful music. What sells it for me is the beauty of the story and the how the deep lore brings you in to the game and engages you in it. Never a bore or chore to play a game as amazing as this.You can always mod and change anything you dont like (for me it was the barter system) but with mods anything is possible.9/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Ignor the amount of hours I've played, cause that doesn't even come close to the 1000s of hours I've put into the game before steam. Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion is possibly one of the best RPGs I have played in my life, and still is to this day. It can seem a little outdated at times but there is an unlimited amount of amazing and very creative mods out there that can make the graphics better, fighting better, everything you can think of better, so that this game can live on for years to come. If you love amazing sound track, mind blowing story and lore, breath taking views of landscaps, the great love/hate relationship bond with Sheogorath, and so - so very much more. Then this game is 100% for you. And if you havn't even played it yet, shame on you.... WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR?!			",32,4,0,9,6,0,2

												While I have only played mere hours of this game on PC I have played days and weeks on consoles.  I had this game on release of the PS3, after waiting months after its release on Xbox.  I had to have it.  It revolutionised the gaming world for me.Oblivion has perhaps the most in depth questline of any game I have ever played, by questline I include the side quests in the world.  There is something for anyone in this game.There are many faults to this game, graphics, gameplay, voice acting (not the main characters for these are done superbly by Ian McKellen, Sean Bean and Terence Stamp).  But it is a world begging for adventure.If you like stories of questing and heroes then this is for you.A gem among RPGs.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Just hearing the Sunrise of Flutes theme, or listening to Sheogorath's enough to make my ""gaming day"" .Scenario is decent, it has its share of epicness and the gameplay is fine, but i strongly advise to run an overhaul like OOO to get the best modern experience out of Oblivion.You'll be amazed by the amount of mods available for this game, oh by the way it might be more than 10 year old, but it still rocks visually ! Back in its times having a computer to run it properly was def a privilege haha !Won't tell more, just that it's one of the best RPGs out there.Buy for the sake of uhmmm, well... BUY!

												How to level up skills:* means it can be done AFK-Sneak*: auto-run while crouching into a corner where you fight the goblin shaman in the tutorial, keeping the rats in the pen alive so that they can detect you-magic skills*: make minimum cost/effect spells of the 6 magic categories, find something to weigh down the cast magic button (for destruction, make the first spell effect heal you for the same ammount the destruction magic damages you)-alchemy: EAT ALL THE INGRDIENTS!-Armorer: you can find repair hammers as loot in unowned containers in dungeons and cities, which saves you money...-Mercantile: ...and then sell merhcants repaired, looted gear you won't use at 2-3 steps up in the haggle slider, selling everything one by one, instead of all at once-Athletics*: run everywhere until maxed...-Acrobatics: ...then bunnyhop everywhere until maxed-Block/Aromor skills: equip shield and armor from armor type(light or heavy) that you will use...-Blade/Blunt weapons: ...and block enemy attacks until they stagger, then hit them with the lowest damage weapon from the class you'll use(clubs or rusty iron daggers are my recommendation) until they aren't staggered, repeat until maxed-Marksmanship: use your maxed acrobatics to get to a spot melee enemies can't reach you, use a rusty iron bow and iron arrows, and turn them into pincussions-Security: get the Skeleton Key from Nocturnal's Daedric quest and this becomes useless-Speechcraft: spam the wheel choices in the minigame as fast as possible, or ignore this and use Charm spells from Illusion-Hand-to-Hand: Embrace your inner Rocky Balboa, only carrying a silver weapon until you reach skill level 50, which allows you to harm normal weapon immune creatures.

												How do I describe a game that is so important? So life-changing? This game is the definition of a masterpiece; from the way characters talk to you, recognize your feats (""It's you! The Hero of Kvatch! This is truly an honor!) to the way that you can wander anywhere you like and still experience a challenge; enemies will test you throughout the game. Some people don't like this form of levelling, but I love it; it keeps the game entertaining right through, unlike other RPGs, by which the end of the game I feel like one of, or maybe all of, the Nine Divines. In this game, things are kept challenging and given enough variety with all of the enemy types (Minotaurs, Land Dreugh, and an army of demons). This game truly is special to me. GameplayA first/third person rpg in which you can be any character you wanted to be. Ever dreamed of being a lizard who had a penchant for eating whole rounds of cheese at midnight every Fredas?Ever wanted to be a mighty warrior who enjoys stealing plates and pulling cutlery from dead wolves(?) Or perhaps you want to be something a little more... regular? The combat is probably the weakest part of the game, though luckily it's easy to master and the enemies remain challenging. You can go and talk to any friendly NPC and chat with them about the rumors of the day. Sometimes it's nice to pick up a note about a deed that you've done. ""Did you hear? The Fighters Guild is recruiting again."" StoryThe gates of Oblivion have been torn open after the Emperor's assassination. All his heirs lie dead, and you hold the Amulet of Kings, the key to this entire dilemma. The world is about to end-! But the world can wait because someone just asked me to investigate a merchant who is selling wares far below the average price... ooh some flowers by the side of the road!Graphics, Atmosphere and SoundThe graphics are looking a little rough these days. The potato faced people look sort of freakish to first time players, but after some hours, you come to appreciate their strange charm and their samey voice actors. The buildings, trees and grass all look nice from a distance, but standing face to face with them, some textures leave room for improvement. The voice actors are indeed all the same pretty much for each species; almost every Orc is acted by the same person, and so on, but you can get past that. The music is beautiful, I can't choose a favorite track. Very peaceful stuff. The atmosphere is impeccable and I love the way arrows bounce off metal surfaces but sink into wooden and flesh, the way characters and their cities look like they are actually lived in. Skyrim does this, but not to the same effect. I feel as though I am right there, in the moment. I am in Cyrodiil as I play Oblivion. That's how good the atmosphere is. ConclusionWait, you mean I haven't convinced you of the merits of this game which makes my day every time I play it?Play it. jmcone's Personal Rating: Essential ",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Quite simply the best RPG ever made. Even better than Skyrim. It has better questlines, a better story, and for me a more immersive experience. The fighters/mages guilds and dark brotherhood questlines are more exciting than the main story. A masterpiece of storywriting, every place and item has a story. Ive put 400+ hours on this for xbox360 and ps3. Its that good. Get all dlc, as the 'shivering isles' character sheogorath is one of the best / funniest npcs ever. I've played a playthrough atleast once a year since its release, and probably will again before the next TES5 comes out 11/11/11.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Personally, I like this game better than Skyrim as it has a way more interesting story and characters. But that is a matter of belief in the world of Elder Scrolls gamers. If you feel like it, you should install some mods (See Community Guides for the 10 mandatory mods) and enjoy the game. After installing those, the game is gets way more depth as well as a lot of bugfixes.About the game itself, it's a must-have when it comes to western RPGs.			",1953,538,92,178,179,15,191

												Oblivion, Oblivion, Oblivion.Back in 2008 I bought an Xbox 360 and Oblivion. Over the next few months of being unemployed I played the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of it. Did everything there was to do, saw everything there was to see. Shivering Isles, Knights of the Nine, all that good stuff. If you're looking at this you're probably considering buying it for PC, which has all of that great content plus mods. Get this and play it forever.			",558,140,34,79,99,7,92

												For sure, one of the greatest fantasy games to-date.  I've cleared more than 300 hours in this incarnation, so time to write a review.I first purchased Oblivion while still in a life and death struggle (in more ways than one) with Morrowind, so I sat on it for a long time before I started playing.  When I did start playing, it was like a breath of fresh air.  The vanilla game was more than a little buggy but no worse than Morrowind.  It now looks very dated compared to more modern games (let's face it, it is ten years old).  It also frustrated me that the entire world levelled up with me.  As my characters gained in ability, so did the world around me, meaning progress quickly became entirely meaningless.This opens up one of Oblivion's better points.Since Oblivion was released, the modding community have updated and improved pretty much every aspect of the game.   Enhancements to textures and display features can transform the game's appearance.  The content of the open world has become even more open, with huge game-world additions, many of which being 'lore friendly', offering a deeper and wider world to explore.  Game mechanisms have also been updated and improved, and new spells, magical items, enemies and quests are available in vast numbers.  In my build, the world no longer levels with me.  Even the game's audio is open to enhancement.All of this choice will then introduce a dilemma.  These add-ons are not always stable, and the more one adds, the less stable the game becomes.  A gaming evening on Oblivion without crashes is unknown to me, and I have spent a great deal of time building the best possible platform I can.  Despite this, I count the crashes as part of the cost of having Oblivion with all of the extra content I have, and I would not want to play the game without that content.  And let's be clear:  Oblivion was not above random crashes even in its 'as shipped' state.So, what have I added that keeps Oblivion alive for me?I wouldn't play without Oscuro's Oblivion Overhaul, the Unofficial Patches, Better Cities, and Unique Landscapes.  Despite some issues, Oblivion Reloaded has also become part of my standard build.  CM Partners adds two new dimensions - many more characters to interact and quest with, and a whole new level of instability to live with (which means I currently have it disabled).  Add to this a raft of game-play modifications and you have my basic build.This build allows me to explore a large game-play world that is a thing of beauty.  The original content was very extensive but the Mods expand it further.  Most of that additional content is good, although there are some moments that make me cringe.  At 2.5 Ghz and with Nvidia 970M my frame-rates are good - especially during indoor game-play.  Avoiding the crashes (or saving when recognising the signs of an imminent crash) has become part of the game-play.The biggest negative - No network play (as designed, and no mods to allow it so far as I am aware)So, to sum up.  A vast and flawed masterpiece.  Not as vast as Morrowind but not so flawed.  Above all, a game of great beauty that influenced many that followed.  Even today, it is worth the time and effort needed to keep it working at the optimum level for me.  My optimum level may be something different to everyone else's but that is another plus.  With a little effort (and more than likely a lot of patience) it can be configured however you want it.To borrow a well used phrase:10/10.  Would spend hundreds of hours perfecting my modlist again.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												My favorite game of all time, Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion is truly a masterpiece. I have spent thousands of hours playing through it on the Xbox 360 back when that was a thing, and will likely match that feat again on the PC.The gameplay is stellar, the explorable world is massive, beautiful, and filled with interesting dungeons, quests, and fights, the AI is revolutionary, and overall it is just extraordinarily fun.My only gripes with it are the graphics, which are universally agreed to have not aged well (a problem solved relatively easily with mods), and that Bethesda has yet to remaster it (here's hoping).Don't get me wrong, Skyrim is amazing, a work of art in and of itself, but it doesn't quite compare to Oblivion for me. In fact, no game does, and I hate to think no other game ever will. But whether or not this is the case, I am glad to have played Oblivion in my lifetime.			",0,0,0,1,0,0,0

												I played this back when I was first in middle school, so the review might have a bit of bias towards it. Nevertheless, Oblivion is personally my favorite elder scrolls game despite its generic european fantasy setting. The main selling points for this game are the side quests, specifically the guild quests. I wont spoil much, but they will make an impact on you and you will feel for some of its characters. Gameplay wise, oblivion has decent combat, even with the ability to actually dodge in all 4 directions. You might want to mod the game up though, but I fnd oblivion to have this charm that other elder scrolls games lack. personally 9.5/10compared to other TES 8/10			",66,4,0,10,3,1,0

												Many mechanics are flawed, the graphics are out-dated, it's buggy as hell, little to no controller support, every enemy is an arrow sponge past mid-difficulty level, and combat is terrible. You may be wondering at this point why I gave this game a positive rating... it's because this game is beautiful. This is the game you bring home to your mother, unlike that trash Skyrim (I love Skyrim). This is the game you cuddle up on a couch to, playing all night on xbox or playstation because you can't cuddle with a mouse and keyboard. This is the game that taught many people, including myself, what an rpg could truly be. This game did not have the extroardinary success that Skyrim had, nor did it redefine how gigantic an rpg could be like Morrowind, but what it did do is further push the standards, raising the bar even further than ever believed possible. This game helped further shape what it means to be an open world rpg today and like all Bethesda Game Studio's games it is a timeless classic that no matter how ugly, old, or broken it may seem; you have to give it a chance. Escape prison, help what was believed to be a simple farm boy become the emperor he was born to be, become a professional thief, help and fight daedric princes, join a guild, explore the world, become an arena grand champion, become a lethal assasin, become a true madman, and CLOSE SHUT THE JAWS...      OF OBLIVION!			",28,0,0,9,1,0,1

												Pretty much the very definition of an open-world RPG. Cyrodiil is massive, and is a joy to adventure through and even too look at. There is a lot of detail in the world and it is clear that a lot of time and love went into making an authentic looking, immersive fantasy world. That being said, the most important part of any RPG is the depth of the character customization and leveling, and Oblivion does a fine job at that. You can choose your race and change your appearence with a good amount of customization. The skill customization is deep enough to be able to play as seperate playstyles as a nimble theif who is great at lockpicking and a bow, a knight who wears heavy armour and wields massive battle axes, or a magic using mage. Having your skills level up the more you use them just makes sense, and has your character develop naturally, evolving on how you're playing the game without breaking up gameplay. The other most important thing in any RPG are the stories and sidequests. There are enough sidequests to make your head spin, and a lot of them do have interesting stories to tell. A lot of them I don't want to give away, so you'll have to find them on your own. There is also a great amount of items you can find and loot. From different weapons like swords and axes to different sets of armour, there's a lot to find in this game.Now for the things it didn't do particularly well. The story of the main questline isn't really that interesting, atleast to me. It just felt too predictable, and the segments where you actually travel into Oblivion itself were all really boring. The beautiful thing is, however, if you don't like the main questline, you can just skip it. An open-world game this massive is also prone to have some bugs. There are not a huge amount of them, just enough to warrant a mention. There are also a number of quests that aren't too captivating, but again, with this much content, you can't strike gold everytime.  There also seem to be a lack of voice actors and actresses in this game. There can't be more than ten of them; you will be hearing the same actors speak for totally different characters constantly. Combat also isn't the deepest thing in this game, it's usually just mindless swinging at enemies until they die first. Ranged combat with bows and magical spells fare a little better, but not by much.Now, this is the Game of the Year edition, so it comes with the two major expansions for the game. Knights of the Nine I didn't particularly care, mainly because I didn't find the storyline particularly interesting and it didn't add very much content-wise. Shivering Isles, however... holy crap. That's one of the best expansions to any open-world game ever with a very interesting new world, lots of interesting stories to tell, and overall just tonnes of new content.This game is worth your time and money. Nothing beats going on an adventure that you craft yourself, and Oblivion does a fantastic job at that.			",178,16,0,17,7,0,20

This game is for people who love a deep story and love to choose what happens next.Go to all the cities of Cyrodill, or get some mods and go to other provinces, maybe Morrowind? Find secrets at every turn! Start one quest, accidently stumble upon another.Decide the fate of man as you, along side the Blades fight the evils within Oblivion!If you want one of the best RPG experiences ever, get this game.

												To start off, this is my favorite game of The Elder Scrolls series, I've spent +200 hours playing this game.This game is heavy, very heavy, I'm level 35 and I'm still getting kicked by some baddies. You start off as a prisoner, like in every other Elder Scrolls game.  The general storyline is alright, it could be better, but it's still very nice, it gives you the feeling to continue and watch what will happen next.The graphics of this game is not a total ""Wow this looks amazing!"" But it still looks alright.All of the citys are amazing, they're big, but it doesn't top the Imperial City, it's just AMAZING, I've never spend so much time playing in one single city.The modding, the f*cking modding, it's amazing, I enjoy it very much, there are so many mods, and there are still mods beeing created and updated, and holy crap, I modded out my oblivion very much, and it makes the game so much better. If you want to have a game that you can mod it madly, this is the game for you.			",130,26,2,14,31,0,6

												The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion, is an epic game. There is flaws however, like that really stupid speech minigame, and the NPCs not showing any emotions when they talk to each other. But besides those and a few other issues, its an excellent game! The world is so open to you, and Cyrodiil is so beautiful. I did not really like the main story and the fighters guild  quests that much, but I loved the Dark Brotherhood quests and the Thieves Guild quests. Overall, i give it a solid 9/10. If you have not played it, shame on you! ~ R.O.B The Robot ",33,4,0,10,6,0,3

												I was first introduced to Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion when it came out on Xbox and now since discovering it again on PC, I'm reminded of why I never made a dent in the main quest.The open world of Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion allows you to explore outside the main quest line due to the factions/guilds, side quests and the hidden ones.The Unofficial Elder Scrolls (http://en.uesp.net/wiki/Oblivion:Oblivion), I find espicially helpful when I'm stuck on what to do or where I need to go and mods such as the unofficial oblivion and shivering isles patches will make it difficult to go back to vanilla.Overall, I enjoy this game immensely and I highly recommend it.

 im only 5 hours in and thought i should make a first impressions review! i have grown up with the elder scrolls games and none have captured me as much as this. the start is fantastic. you awake in a prison, no idea how you got there. you get mocked and made fun of by a dark elf! Assasins have came and killed the emperors known sons and tried to kill the emperor! fortunatly he has been brought down to the prisons by the blades to escape through the secret tunnel in your cell. you are called out and questioned by the emperor but its ok he has seen you in his ""visions"". you are trusted to escape and follow them down the tunnel. you are then told to stop following and cut through a broken wall. along that way you fight skeevers and goblins. you acquire your first set of weapons and armour and head out. along the way you meet up with the emperor and the blades and help battle along side them.  ***SPOILER*** Unfortunatly the emperor is killed by mythic dawn / daedra and you are given the amulet and told to give it ito jaufree. so fast forward and you close an oblivion gate and dig deeper into the mythic dawn.... The Verdict so far.. so so far im enjoying how in depth thew game is. the combat is actually aged decently well and holds up. the story is capturing and brings you in quickly, the cities and towns actually give you feels. i remember walking around imperial city for the first time on xbox 360 and it meant nothing to me. i was young and only likes killing and stealing :D but now i get a warmish feeling from everyone greeting you and acknowledging who you are! Overall so far its an easy 9/10 only con is that camera angle sometimes and the slow movement until you level it up :D ",78,8,5,19,6,0,5

												A game that I will always come back to every now and then. This is in my opinion the BEST Elder Scrolls Game. This game has so many locations and quests that I still think I might not have some of them after all these years. I originally owned this game for PS3 and sunk well over 1000 hours in it. Later on I bought a DRM free copy for PC. Then one day I finally I had to buy it on steam. You can create any type of character you can imagine. You can craft your own spells, make your own potions, buy a house, buy or steal a horse, explore and find some really unique weapons just about anything you'd want to do in a fantasy rpg. The story is pretty long and doing most of the guild quests take a while so I'd say if you get invested into this game you'll be playing for at least 100 hours or more.Also this version of the game includes the mini-dlcs that bethesda made like Wizards Tower, Thieves den, Battlehorn(is that right?) Castle, and horse armor. For the price its definitely worth it if you've never played this game before because you'll get hours of fun out of it. 10/10 probably the only game that I think is deserving of this rating in a long time.

												Hallo.If you're reading this review you most likely never played Oblivion before and wonder if it's still worth it.Yes.It doesn't feel outdated in any way. Of course the graphics are not as detailed as in current games - but it still looks beautiful and fits the game very well.The gameplay feels good and I actually prefer it to Skyrim.The open world feels big and open and getting from A to B is rarely tedious or annoyingPersonally I don't like the main quest that much but there are dozens of side quests, missions and things to explore that you can literally play hundreds of hours (including 2 very good DLCs and various brilliant fan made) without touching the main story.A lot of fan made mods let you personalize Oblivion and you have as many as you can wish for!In conclusionIf you are even slightly interested in this game and you think it might be for you - you should definitely give it a try!I'm pretty sure you won't regret it.

												The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion PC ReviewThe Elder Scrolls IV might be one of the best open world rpg's of it's time so I decided to pick it up during the Discovery steam sale. This game consumed my life for 2-3 weeks while I was finishing guild quests, exploring this expansive world and getting immersed by the lore of this video game.Story: 9/10The Elder Scrolls IV has a mediocre main story but the Guild quests and side quests really make the story of this game one of the best in all Elder Scrolls games. If I was to do the main story of this game alone it would take me less than 8 hours and bore me to death but the side quests really where the majority of my 50 hours in Oblivion were spent. In some of the quests in the Dark Brotherhood I was having so much fun doing so many different contracts for them. Almost all the guild and side quests were exponentially better than the side quests of many other Rpg's because of their intriguing plots. Overall, The main story is mediocre but the side and guild quests are where oblivion's story shines.Gameplay: 7/10The gameplay of this is mediocre and could get boring at some times.Since I played through the game as a Warrior-Destruction mage most of the game was filled with mashing my mouse and keyboard while occasionally blocking just to get my block skill up. Even though the combat was mediocre the leveling system was horrible in my honest opinion because in this game you get weaker by leveling up. Even though the gameplay and leveling system were not so great all the other systems in the game were refined(Questing, Alchemy,Etc.). Another horrible aspect of Oblivion's gameplay is that the dungeons all look the same and also make you backtrack through them sadly. The only other gripe I have with this game is horrible map system that was really confusing to navigate. The gameplay might not be the best part of this game it isn't unplayable but can sometimes get enjoyable mashing away at hordes of dremora. Graphics-8/10The graphics in this game were awesome for it's time in 2006 however I can say that the graphics look beautiful some times however the character models look completely hideous at times really showing the age of this game. The dungeons also look horrendous as their is no variety in their aesthetics but some times as I'm riding through the world of Oblivion and the sun shines on the world making the game look awesome.Overall-8/10This game may not be the best rpg ever made but it's a must buy for gamers who like rpg's with expansive worlds like Skyrim and are willing to look past some gameplay and graphic issues. So this game gets a 8/10			",189,10,0,25,7,1,4

												dont judge a book by its cover. oblivion might look a little 'cartoony', but its packed with many features and details such as amazing AI, many quests, guilds to join, places to explore, etc.. oblivion is my favorite game in the 'TES' series. one of my favorite features is the AI. no matter where you go, the NPC's of oblivion are doing their everyday job. i really like this because in most games the NPC's only do things when you are around them. i think this gives oblivion more of a living aspect compared to some of the other TES games. overall, i totally recommend this game.

												This game is literally the best game i've ever played. I've played all the games from zelda, to world of warcraft, even minecraft and beyond, and I can say without a doubt in my mind that this is the best out of all of them. It's even better than it's more popular successor, skyrim. Great story, hundreds of hours of gameplay, amazing replay potential, tons of mods and a great community, plenty of guilds and classes to check out, even make your own, it's great in so many ways it's hard to count. The ONLY problem I have with this game is that it's not on mac! I played it on the ps3 and a lil on a laptop i used to own, and loved it, but am not capable of playing it currently because it isn't on mac. Anyways, enough rambling trying to get a mac release, this game is a must buy, and at 15-20 dollars for ALL the dlc and potential mods, it's the best 20 dollars you could ever spend on a video game. 10/10.

												To start off, this is my favorite game of The Elder Scrolls series, I've spent +200 hours playing this game.This game is heavy, very heavy, I'm level 35 and I'm still getting kicked by some baddies. You start off as a prisoner, like in every other Elder Scrolls game.  The general storyline is alright, it could be better, but it's still very nice, it gives you the feeling to continue and watch what will happen next.The graphics of this game is not a total ""Wow this looks amazing!"" But it still looks alright.All of the citys are amazing, they're big, but it doesn't top the Imperial City, it's just AMAZING, I've never spend so much time playing in one single city.The modding, the f*cking modding, it's amazing, I enjoy it very much, there are so many mods, and there are still mods beeing created and updated, and holy crap, I modded out my oblivion very much, and it makes the game so much better. If you want to have a game that you can mod it madly, this is the game for you.			",130,26,2,14,31,0,6

												Oblivion: it feels like a parody of Skyrim. Not only are Skyrim's graphics better, but the world itself just feels more serious and realistic than its predecessor. The game is sort of a more relaxed Skyrim, that was my first impression.But nonetheless, I can guarantee you that I had more fun with Oblivion! There are few games that made me laugh so hard. But don't think that Oblivion is all about laughing. The game is filled with very entertaining and well made side quests that feel as if they aren't side quests, but the main story itself. I actually did not play much the main story, just because the side quests were so good!The graphics? Nothing special nowadays, but definately playable!  The game is just so good, that you will probably get more immersed than in Skyrim, even with the simpler graphics. Hours will fly by and you won't notice. I guess that the graphics also helped create more complex environments. The cities in Oblivion are much bigger than the ones in Skyrim. There are endless hours of fun in the cities, from messing around with the guards to exploring sewers and doing quests. It just feels more complex than Skyrim! Don't get me wrong, both are excellent games, but have slight different approaches. Skyrim is a masterpiece of beauty and thrilling adventure, while Oblivion focuses on the complexity and fun of its world. My suggestion? Buy both!(Don't trust Steam hour record! I have endless hours of offline play in both games!)			",21,2,0,5,1,0,0

												Oblivion is a near perfect RPG. It was the first game I played in the Elder Scrolls series and I loved it and is one of my favorite RPGS. There are so many places to explore and dungeons to delve. There is a lot of choice with a lot of complex systems and every skill has its use. This game overall is a better RPG than skyrim do to it actually having a class system in which you pick your major skills and attributes. The lore is AMAZING and I know that is the nerdiest thing to say but shut up. So bad things being the combat is clunky as hell and some of the animations are ridiculous. Terrible voice acting, sometimes you will hear a conversation between two NPCs with the same voice. Other than those ""classic Bethesda glitches"" the game is amazing. Recommend to anyone who likes RPGs and sanic guards.			",178,16,0,21,9,1,6

												Modding this game is a requirement, your birthright and what makes this game better than Skyrim.  The graphics overhaul available by modding is well supported by the community and fills the gap in the vanilla game.The rest of the game just rocks, the game world is huge, side quests and world size 1 million times larger than Skyrim (and incidently 1 million times smaller than the original Arena) but hey, <3 <3 <3 this thing (+ the 18+ mods, of course!)

												This game could be summarized in a single word, good. The mechanics are good, the quests are perfect, and the story lures you in. Now, you might be saying it's just nostalgia, but the thing is, I played skyrim before oblivion and I must say, if you love rpgs, get this game. And to be honest, I must say that this is better than skyrim. I felt like skyrim lacked a lot of spirit, while oblivion has lots of spirit. The characters were amazing in oblivion while skyrim's characters seemed like they want to kill themselves whenever you talk to them. But, the bad thing with oblivion is that the characters all look like 12 year olds. And very ugly ones at best. The voice actors are amazing, but there is no variety. Every single npc sounds the same. Though, Patrick Stewart is an amazing addition. Some say the art style is terrible because it looked like a generic fantasy rpg to them. To that I say you have to get used to it, because when I started playing oblivion I hated the art style, but overtime I started to love it. And best of all, Sean Bean dies.			",56,5,1,14,6,0,3

												I actually played Oblivion back in the day (2008-9?) long before Skyrim was even announced, and this was the king of RPGs in its day much like Morrowind probably was before. Although Skyrim is better in terms of leveling/talents and overall gameplay, Oblivion has some awesome story and gameplay to it. The Shivering Isles will forever be one of my favorite expansions in any game. In fact, I just went back through and beat the game last week.Totally worth it.If you enjoyed Skyrim's story whatsoever you will buy this game right now.			",10,1,0,9,1,0,0

												This game embodies everything I love about RPG gaming. The near endless player choice, the beautiful landscapes, the interesting enemies and enjoyable combat, the campy dialogue and extremely limited voice acting. This game is a high medieval fantasy that stands the tests of time. The leveling system is just complicated enough to actually make character building matter (one of my major complaints with newer Bethesda games is that the character setup doesn't really matter, no matter what stats you choose, you can still be a overpowered killing machine using just about anything... that is not the case for this game. Get the character creation right, or you're in for a bad time). Yes it has come clunky elements and yes it can be glitchy and on modern systems it can be a pain to make it run, but through my extremely rose tinted glasses, that's just part of the gaming experience. I was able to sink hundreds of hours back in the day on this game before I bought it on steam, and since I've bought it again you can see I've played over 100 more. It's just that good.

												Hallo.If you're reading this review you most likely never played Oblivion before and wonder if it's still worth it.Yes.It doesn't feel outdated in any way. Of course the graphics are not as detailed as in current games - but it still looks beautiful and fits the game very well.The gameplay feels good and I actually prefer it to Skyrim.The open world feels big and open and getting from A to B is rarely tedious or annoyingPersonally I don't like the main quest that much but there are dozens of side quests, missions and things to explore that you can literally play hundreds of hours (including 2 very good DLCs and various brilliant fan made) without touching the main story.A lot of fan made mods let you personalize Oblivion and you have as many as you can wish for!In conclusionIf you are even slightly interested in this game and you think it might be for you - you should definitely give it a try!I'm pretty sure you won't regret it.

												The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion PC ReviewThe Elder Scrolls IV might be one of the best open world rpg's of it's time so I decided to pick it up during the Discovery steam sale. This game consumed my life for 2-3 weeks while I was finishing guild quests, exploring this expansive world and getting immersed by the lore of this video game.Story: 9/10The Elder Scrolls IV has a mediocre main story but the Guild quests and side quests really make the story of this game one of the best in all Elder Scrolls games. If I was to do the main story of this game alone it would take me less than 8 hours and bore me to death but the side quests really where the majority of my 50 hours in Oblivion were spent. In some of the quests in the Dark Brotherhood I was having so much fun doing so many different contracts for them. Almost all the guild and side quests were exponentially better than the side quests of many other Rpg's because of their intriguing plots. Overall, The main story is mediocre but the side and guild quests are where oblivion's story shines.Gameplay: 7/10The gameplay of this is mediocre and could get boring at some times.Since I played through the game as a Warrior-Destruction mage most of the game was filled with mashing my mouse and keyboard while occasionally blocking just to get my block skill up. Even though the combat was mediocre the leveling system was horrible in my honest opinion because in this game you get weaker by leveling up. Even though the gameplay and leveling system were not so great all the other systems in the game were refined(Questing, Alchemy,Etc.). Another horrible aspect of Oblivion's gameplay is that the dungeons all look the same and also make you backtrack through them sadly. The only other gripe I have with this game is horrible map system that was really confusing to navigate. The gameplay might not be the best part of this game it isn't unplayable but can sometimes get enjoyable mashing away at hordes of dremora. Graphics-8/10The graphics in this game were awesome for it's time in 2006 however I can say that the graphics look beautiful some times however the character models look completely hideous at times really showing the age of this game. The dungeons also look horrendous as their is no variety in their aesthetics but some times as I'm riding through the world of Oblivion and the sun shines on the world making the game look awesome.Overall-8/10This game may not be the best rpg ever made but it's a must buy for gamers who like rpg's with expansive worlds like Skyrim and are willing to look past some gameplay and graphic issues. So this game gets a 8/10			",189,10,0,25,7,1,4

If I were to boot it up today I could tell you every person's backstory, little tidbits of info into certain city's way of life, etc. Memorable, to say the least. A must.			",103,24,0,27,10,0,16

												This game embodies everything I love about RPG gaming. The near endless player choice, the beautiful landscapes, the interesting enemies and enjoyable combat, the campy dialogue and extremely limited voice acting. This game is a high medieval fantasy that stands the tests of time. The leveling system is just complicated enough to actually make character building matter (one of my major complaints with newer Bethesda games is that the character setup doesn't really matter, no matter what stats you choose, you can still be a overpowered killing machine using just about anything... that is not the case for this game. Get the character creation right, or you're in for a bad time). Yes it has come clunky elements and yes it can be glitchy and on modern systems it can be a pain to make it run, but through my extremely rose tinted glasses, that's just part of the gaming experience. I was able to sink hundreds of hours back in the day on this game before I bought it on steam, and since I've bought it again you can see I've played over 100 more. It's just that good.

												Oblivion.. I love Oblivion so much! I like it more than Skyrim, Morrowind, Arena, and Daggerfall. It was the first TES game I played and I really love it. There is so much to do, just like any TES game, but this one, I just like more. Everything is interesting and it is fun to explore. The leveling system is really odd, so before you buy it, look into it. If you want to see how fun it is, buy it! And I recommend the GOTY edition, or GOTY Edition Deluxe. Have fun!

												have you ever played skyrim and think to yourself that magic isint broken enough. if so then this game is for you. with enchanting you can say i dont need sneak skill and make 100% invisibility armor.in oblivion you can say who needs lockpicking and use a spell to open locks that is 100% effective.did you ever end up overweight in the middle of a cave in skyrim. in this game you can make your own ease burden spell and carry up to 500 extra weight. have you ever thought that alchemy was not broken enough in skyrim. in this game with just a carrot and an apple and a high level you can make over 100 gold potions and you can make them from anywhere.i mentioned it before but i was so sad when they didnt give me the ability to create my own spells in skyrim. i hope they add it again in the next game. and the best part is that you dont even need a free hand to cast spells in oblivion. i love having a two handed weapon out in this game and not even have to take it out of my hand to cast things. i also miss the spell wheel with the D pad instead of the list system they have now in skyrim.dont get me wrong though i loved skyrim i just dont like some of the things they did to magic in the game.also sorry if the english is off. i rate this game 10/10			",139,20,1,20,9,0,15

												Oblivion is a wonderful game for many of the previously stated reasons. It combines decent combat with interesting quest lines and likable npc's. This, however, is not why I would suggest it. Any number of other RPG's have better combat, better fleshed out quests, or more realistic npc's. No, what sets this game apart is it's open world. With many other ""open world"" RPG's you are still pressed to follow the main quest line and, once it's done, you're done and left with little else to do. This adds to how immersive the game is and, above all else, stresses the ""Role-playing"" aspect of ""Role-Playing Game"".  So what the combat isn't as impressive as that of Dragon Age? You don't have to min-max in Oblivion: you just play and enjoy the beautiful vistas of Cyrodill. I would also like to add that there are literally thousands of mods that improve upon every problem present with the game and even improve on the good aspects. (P.S. There's no Workshop support, so you have to use a mod manager and stuff. I personally suggest OBMM (Oblivion Mod Manager) and the use of the Nexus mods webpage.)Just wanted to say, I nominate this game for the ""Stands the Test of Time"" steam award. After more than 10 years, it's still one of my favourite games.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												After playing this game for several hundred hours on console I absolutely loved it. I then did the same on Skyrim, hundreds of hours. I recently bought oblivion again on pc and my god it is a far superior game to Skyrim in most aspects. The lore is extremely rich and feels a lot more meaningful in this game. It feels alot more of an rpg than skyrim does. From the fighter's guild to the arena all of the guilds feel extremely fleshed out and well thought out when compared to skyrim. All in all I personally believe this game is one of the best of all time and easily my favourite game I have ever played through. I adore this game, please purchase it if you get the chance, you won't regret it.			",109,14,2,17,14,1,26

Skyrim was a little too overdone for me but here was this game in the middle of the two that was just perfect, even the graphics still stun me even though they are from back in 2007. As i said skyrim was too easy for me and i grew old of the whole dragonborn thing and killing alduin 8 times. But playing oblivion everytime i do a quest or beat the game it feels different every time. If you want a wonderful experience this is the game for you.			",91,8,0,8,16,0,7

Posted: July 13, 2015
												[Full Review of The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion]Graphics:This game came out in 2006 so the graphics are obviously going to be dated by this point, but if you've played Bethesda RPGs before, you already know that the graphics aren't going to be the strongest aspect of the game anyway. Aside from graphical quality, the landscape is bright and beautiful as well as very detailed, considering it's size. Certain towns and locations obviously got more attention than others though and the characters look . . . not . . . good. However this game is huge and features a tremendous amount of content so it gets a slight pass. - 7/10Audio:Again, if you've played a Bethesda RPG before (specifically an Elder Scrolls game) you already have a pretty good idea of what to expect. The soundtrack is nothing short of amazing - it always is in Elder Scrolls' games. So, no surprises there - Jeremy Soule is a god amongst men and all that. Sound effects are also good but I wasn't too crazy about the voice acting in this one, though maybe that's just me. Extremely strong audio presentation overall. - 9/10Gameplay:It's your standard RPG with a whole mess of choices to make while creating your character including race, class, attributes, ect. There are many options but it ultimately boils down to the basic warrior, mage, and rogue classes - though you can use any style of weapons, armor, and magic regardless of class, which is a mechanic unique to Bethesda I believe. Combat is nothing special but, then again, it hardly ever is in RPGs. Exploration, however, is one of the strongest aspects of Oblivion and what ultimately makes the game as addicting as it is. You will feel like a real adventurer traveling across Cyrodil saving the world, as well as a few NPCs, along the way. - 8/10Story:So, basically, you are the chosen one and it's your destiny to save the world. Super original right? But in all seriousness, the main quest line is pretty interesting and I found myself completely invested in the story by the time it was over. In addition to the main quest line there are also several others (Dark Brotherhood, Thieves Guild, Mages Guild, Fighters Guild, ect.) in addition to TONS of other side quests. All in all, there is a lot of story here, most of which is pretty interesting. - 10/10Replayability:It's an RPG . . . and it's made by Bethesda. Just those two facts alone should tell you that you are not going to be leaving your computer screen for quite a few days, should you choose to pick this game up. I've personally played hundreds of hours of Oblivion across all platforms and still haven't completed all the quests. Also, there's real incentive to play multiple times since there are numerous races (all with special abilities) and some really fun quests that you'll probably want to replay but not a lot of key decisions to make throughout the game, at least for an RPG. So, yeah, there's replayability here. - 9/10Overall:Oblivion wasn't declared GOTY by everyone for no reason. The explorations mechanics, interesting storyline, and immersive universe all come together perfectly to, once again, give us an addicting role-play experience. If you've never played it for some reason, you need to pick up the GOTY edition like, right now. - 8.6/10			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Besides Arena, this is my least favorite Elder Scrolls game, The graphics for the environments are nice but the NPCs are ugly as sin, the attempts at immersion are shoddy at best, and the minigames are annoying and rather idiotic.Despite this, the main quest is excellent and so are many of the main faction quests such as the Dark Brotherhood, and many of the issues I wrote above can be rectified with proper use of mods. One of the best games for getting into pre-Skyrim Elder Scrolls games.			",86,15,3,23,14,1,8

""But Planning odd hour here & there, ""Time permitting of course.""""But what i can say and  assure any body who's looking into getting into the RPG's of Bethesda's, is to go for it, as believe me when i say that you wont be dissapointed by having this game in your collection/library, and i will promise you that you will lose more time to this game than any other you have in your collection, say bar Skyrim.As for recommendingYES DefinatelyOverall Score : 9.0/10.0The reasons that i have given a 9.0 score is for the shear amount of fun and quests that you can do in this game, yeah it might not be the best looking NOW, but back in the day when i first fired up the game and left the cellar/dungeon and into the beauty that is tamriel, i was in complete awstruckness at its size.Plus there is also the DLC's for people intrested in expanding out and extra quests...Cheersmark117h			",69,4,5,7,4,0,1

With many other ""open world"" RPG's you are still pressed to follow the main quest line and, once it's done, you're done and left with little else to do. This adds to how immersive the game is and, above all else, stresses the ""Role-playing"" aspect of ""Role-Playing Game"".  So what the combat isn't as impressive as that of Dragon Age? You don't have to min-max in Oblivion: you just play and enjoy the beautiful vistas of Cyrodill. I would also like to add that there are literally thousands of mods that improve upon every problem present with the game and even improve on the good aspects. (P.S. There's no Workshop support, so you have to use a mod manager and stuff. I personally suggest OBMM (Oblivion Mod Manager) and the use of the Nexus mods webpage.)Just wanted to say, I nominate this game for the ""Stands the Test of Time"" steam award. After more than 10 years, it's still one of my favourite games.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												After playing this game for several hundred hours on console I absolutely loved it. I then did the same on Skyrim, hundreds of hours. I recently bought oblivion again on pc and my god it is a far superior game to Skyrim in most aspects. The lore is extremely rich and feels a lot more meaningful in this game. It feels alot more of an rpg than skyrim does. From the fighter's guild to the arena all of the guilds feel extremely fleshed out and well thought out when compared to skyrim. All in all I personally believe this game is one of the best of all time and easily my favourite game I have ever played through. I adore this game, please purchase it if you get the chance, you won't regret it.			",109,14,2,17,14,1,26

												Oblivion.. I love Oblivion so much! I like it more than Skyrim, Morrowind, Arena, and Daggerfall. It was the first TES game I played and I really love it. There is so much to do, just like any TES game, but this one, I just like more. Everything is interesting and it is fun to explore. The leveling system is really odd, so before you buy it, look into it. If you want to see how fun it is, buy it! And I recommend the GOTY edition, or GOTY Edition Deluxe. Have fun!

												Do yourself a favor - and don't blast through the main questline. If you do, you'll have the game beat in like 8-10 hours. Oblivion is the game before Skyrim and has a great deal of content to offer you. Explore out in the wilderness, steal some stuff, kill a person because ""mother"" told you to. It's all there really. Magic is the most powerful of all things in this game, and made more powerful by the ability to craft your own spells. You can make yourself an unstoppable force with weapon/armor from enchanting.Go back to the days where you can find magical equipment that does it's own special thing like a ""underwater breathing ring"" and explore the vast underwater in search of chests and caves. This game is fun - seriously. The only difficulty I could see with folks, is if they played Skyrim before this - the graphics and such... well... they're worse, which is to be expected. Some find this acceptable, while others run away with eyes bleeding. But really - it was fun, took a good while before I got tired of it.  ",18,2,0,17,1,0,6

												As someone who almost spend 100h on this game, I can seriously say that to the elder scrolls series, this game is the mario 3 to the super mario games. A formula that works and is fun, but it's just better and a more refined game. I certaintly think Skyrim has made even more improvements to the franchise, but it'll still never catch the charm this game delivered. The epicly crafted open world of Cyrodiil is open, cozy, natural and rural, the way I like it. Dungeons and its loot aren't as unique as Skyrim, yet they still offer great fun. Great story, but I think no one can argue about that, in specific with the dark brotherhood. Character creation isn't perfect, but it's more open than SKyrim, music's top notch and for a 2006 game; it's graphics are great and detailed. So buy it and have yourself an immerive journey through one of the best RPG-games of the 21st century, it's worth every single penny!			",10,0,0,5,0,0,1

												The first thing i said half way through Playign Skyrim was ""Oblivion had way more places to go and stuff to do"".  After playing through Oblivion 4 times as different characters back when it came out and now just a few days ago grabbing it here and starting over again i noticed that i was right about Skyrim its just not as big as Oblivion is. Just looking at an online map of Oblivion compared to the online map of Skyrim confirms it, You can't walk 15 seconds in any direction without running into something of interest where as Skyrim had swathes of barren landscape. this isnt to say Skyrim was bad it was just toned down for the lowered attention span of todays Child Gamers AKA console crowd, Oblivion is just less feature creap and more substance to me.

												I loved Fallout 3, and I loved Morrowind, but Oblivion has actually stuck with me more than both. A tour of its most recognisable locations and the early quests would be pretty uninspiring, but if you live in that world for a while, it has an incredible sense of place. And it does feel like living. The total freedom of what to specialise in, what goals to pursue, how to achieve them – none of those things are unique individually, but put them together and you have something that’s more of a world than a game. That will continue to excite me more than anything else in the genre until Skyrim comes along and does it all again.			",695,78,29,62,87,9,129

Posted: November 5, 2015
												I recently wrote a very long review on The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind Game of the Year Edition so this time is the turn of the next chapter in the Elder Scrolls series, Oblivion. I must be honest I had never played Oblivion before I purchased it here. I had played Morrowind for years and ended up jumping straight to Skyrim (both on the Xbox/PS3 depending on which one you are referring too) I don't think this was as much a case of oversight as a little research showed me that Oblivion, despite it being a good game, was just released at a time where RPG games where becoming the norm and the market was flooded with a million sub-par attempts. The same could be said for the precursor to Skyrim, Dragonborn, which suffered a similar fate. Not that it really damaged its' reputation at all as Oblivion is still one of the most highly praised games of the entire Elder Scrolls series. I really settled into this game well. It didn't take long to get going with the first quests of the main storyline which I decided to complete first. It was well laid out and the actual storyline itself was gripping. From semi breaking out of prison to finding the hidden Septim son Martin all the way to the crux of the main storyline where you get one of the most amazing pieces of CGI in a cut scene. I won't go to far into it for those that have not played it yet or have not gotten that far but all I will say is Golden Dragon... (A wimpy girly moment led me to go ""ooooh"" LOL). Now would be a good time to mention the graphics and scenery which are stunning.After all of that though, which takes a fair amount of time but is no-where near as long as the mainline in Morrowind, you can then go on to do the two extra DLC's which come complete with the Game of the Year Edition. The first one was The Shivering Isles which is by far my favourite part of the entire game. I just loved everything about it. From the insane world created by Lord Sheogorath to the way the guy speaks. I literally had moments during this part of the game where I was in fits of laughter at some of the things he would say randomly whilst trying to help you prevent the Graymarch.The icing on the cake of this one is that you get to become Lord Sheogorath, but don't worry you aren't insane and you can come and go into Cyrodill and the Shivering Isles as you please. The last add on is The Knight of the Nine. This is by far the biggest let down of the whole game. All you do is pretty much run around getting blessings from 9 different shrines and then finding old relics of the Divine Crusader all of which together will allow you to kill Umaril the Unfeathered of which at the end leaves you with a rather large and heavy set of armour and that is pretty much the end of the DLC. This, to me, was just not worth the time put in to find everything (it took a while as this one has little prompt) and was just anti-climatic at the end. Of course after all of the mainline and add ons were completed I set about clearing up sidequests and doing things for the Fighters and Mages guilds. I also went to the Imperial City Arena and became Grand Champion because why not. But I felt that all of the side quests and the Fighters/Mages guild stuff was just all very mundane and boring and really lacked the kind of thought that had gone into the mainlines in such a way where it almost felt like the creators had, had enough at this point and just wanted it finished. All of this is good fun though, even if walking around everywhere being called Champion, lord, hero, knight, sister ect does get a little tiresome, but of course once the mainline and the DLCs are done there really isn't all that much left to do and really in my eyes at least I felt that the game had ended for me.My only major complaint though is that it seems that this game suffers from some pretty irking bugs in the quests. I got stuck numerous times where the game just wouldn't progress despite me doing what it asked only to look it up and find that countless others had the same problem. Of course most of the bugs had patches made to fix them but I didn't have time for that so opted for the slight cheat route of using the Console to force the quest along to the next point which works but of course can end up cutting out a huge portion of a quest or leaving you a little confused as to what to do next, in some cases it almost led me to do a quest backwards getting other journal entries about something I had done previously.I must add that there are hundreds of tutorials and tips and cheats online for the game which do help to make a bit of an interesting character or to get you through a rather tough patch but ultimately it is far more fun to run around and try and do as much as you can for yourself.One last thing.... Keep and eye out for the UNICORN. It's the only one in the entire gamePS. Why make riding the horses so complicated. You have to control it with the keys alone unlike the character which you can control with both the mouse and keys... This would have been a little more helpful as I spent a lot of time getting stuck on rocks and with the horse looking the wrong way despite what I was telling it to do. Also I'm pretty sure being on a horse was slower than running. On the plus side I did end up with a series of horses and people following me around all of which would fight/protect/get in the way if I was attacked which made for some interesting moments.

So basically this, I like more than Skyrim.Should I check it out? - If you want to spend $20 for an amazing game with all the DLCWhat mods would you reccomend? - Look up a graphical guide to Oblivion. That helps a ton. What ENB do you use? - I personally use Tweaked ENB. Best reviewed ENB too.This game has so much to offer you just can't refuse it.			",22,1,1,8,2,0,0

												Saved Bruma from being demolished by a Great Oblivion Gate... so I destroyed the gate, Daedra invasion stopped. However... that was not the end as the Empire descended into CIVIL WAR whilst Daedra were attacking them all at once, but they paused for a moment all because someone accidentally hit the Emperor, then everyone started to battle each other, slashing swords and clad at everybody and knocking any and all unconcious (or killed) whilst the Daedra just stand there literally watching, with me included.Thought I'd try to talk to one but I got the ""BE QUICK ABOUT IT MORTAL"" approach. He wasn't very interested in speaking.All I saw was hordes of guards from all the different cities rushing from each end and more and more began joining in the frey, including Imperial Soldiers. In the end, when the Emperor was knocked unconcious, everyone started clapping and celebrating and moved on with their daily lives, while Emperor Martin Septim just laid on the ground, ♥♥♥♥ing comatose. Then, the Daedra and the guards started fighting each other and it started happening again.The Elder Scrolls: Oblivion is just fantastic. lmfao_____So, I have completed the Dark Brotherhood questline. However, I was supposed to wait for someone to assassinate at a certain time in one of the cities. So, I used the waiting option. Ofcourse it wouldn't kill me for just waiting a bit (WROOONNNGGG).So, after waiting, battle music started and I was ontop of one of the houses. I saw someone at the last second, pulling out a bow and firing an arrow straight on my face when I was ontop of a three/four story building. It was such a strong blow that it lifted me off my feet, casted me down to the ground and I died. Bloody hell!Reloaded from the same waiting save, managed to get out the way before it would happen again (lol). Killed the lad, Lucius randomly popped out of thin air when I killed one person and started screaming that I was a traitor I ""shouldn't"" have exactly killed the person I should have. He preached on about how he was going to kill me and then started to say ""Oh, you're confused aren't you. I should be killing you but something tells me I shouldn't be!""So ofcourse, Lucius is blabbering on about a plan to catch a member of the Brotherhood, so I inadvertintly agree, no doubt. So, as I pressed forth, I turn around to see him actually RUNNING OFF into the distance when he's describing his plan. So ofcourse, I wouldn't exactly figure it out because herp-a-derp master of stealthiness just decided to go for a jog.His voice got lower in sound and all I heard was: ""The Dark Brotherhood will rise again! NOW GGGOOOooooooooo-"" and he then leaves the city. So I do too, heading to my next quest location.So, I realized what I had to do eventually, but in the top left of my screen, it then stated that ""Lucius <Insert second name here> is unconcious."" atleast half a dozon times over, just after he stated he needed to go into hiding. He didn't get very far, then.Better than Skyrim. xD			",96,1,0,11,15,0,63

												Arguably the best installment of the Elder Scrolls series (yes, I too love Morrowind dearly but let's be real, many of its systems and all of its visuals are too horrible to endure in this day and age, despite the plot and setting).The most landscape variation in any TES title, great imaginative sidequests, far more interesting NPCs than the mind-numbing bores of Skyrim. Oblivion gates can get a little boring but nobody's forcing you to really go in all of them.If only we could get all of this beauty ported to the Skyrim engine one day...			",546,285,26,69,45,4,63

												Bethesda did an awesome job as usual. Each game gets better and better. The scenery is fantastic. The realism awesome. The open world is the greatest invention to RPG games. Now you don't have to stick to the direct storyline. You can go on many different quests, explore the world and find many treasures. Meet many different people and monsters. Upgrade yourself as you go along, gaining experience along the way. I would really love to see Morrowind and Oblivion get a face lift to meet the quality of the Skyrim game.I did find the character design very bland. It definitely needs to be upgraded. Why must one have an ugly looking hero? lol - I guess we have to rely on the fantastic modders out there that are quick to take up the challenge to enhance the game. Thanks again to Bethesda on an awesome game. A must have in the collection to all RPG gamers out there.			",4,1,0,5,0,0,0

												This game is pretty fun and I am enjoying it so far. However, it's a much better experience if you haven't played Skyrim before it, like I had. There was this nagging voice in my head the whole time i was playing this. ""Where are the dragons? Why does this look so bad? What's with the acting?"" So, this is a great game, but it is completly ruined if you play Skyrim and come back to this game.			",4,0,0,5,0,0,3

												Probably one of the best games I've ever played, kept me entertained for a long time on console, and finally got it on pc to give it a go here. Wonderful, personally find it better than Skyrim, because to me, Skyrim you are paying for graphics, Oblivion you are paying for a game. Oblivion can be very easily modded, but seeming that it doesn't have a steam workshop, it makes the process generally longer, but, as Gaben had once said ; ' Worth the Wait. ' Oblivion will more than likely keep you occupied for easily 200-300 hours, and is very easily replayable, because of the different races, and some perks that some races get. The map of Oblivion is easy to read, when Skyrim's map was rather awkward to read, because of the stupid angle. Oblivion's storyline is rather a small portion of the game, when there is guilds, e.g Fighters Guild, Thieves guild. Some of the quests in Oblivion can be quite lengthy, and some even require you to be a certain level to complete/start a quest. The combat system of Oblivion is rather simple, where Skyrim you couldn't use a spell with a sword and shield for example, where as in Oblivion, you can use a unlocking spell, and you can just rush into a building, loot, and complete a mission for a guild.I highly reccommend Oblivion, and would definately choose it over Skyrim.

												The elder scrolls IV Oblivion is still and will always be one of my all time favourite TES games. This was the first elder scrolls game i ever played and in a instant i fell in love with this game, the massive world, stunning combat, beautiful graphics, and near endless customization options made my jaw drop and instantly dumped hundreds of hours into this game on the ps3 version. I never played a RPG quite like this before, the closest thing was Fable. Now that i have got a gaming PC i bought it from steam along with all the previous DLC that i could not get on the ps3 version. This game is a all time classic and a legend among the RPG genre in my opinion. If you utterly love the RPG genre you cannot afford to pass this game up. 10/10 MASTERPIECE.			",110,11,0,16,19,1,13

												This is a Western RPG essential! though you don't see my over 1000 hours played on xbox you must take my word for it. This game immersed me for hours! I would sit there playing it and then look at the clock and it would be four hors later. That being said it is a mssive time sink. So now I willtell you what you will like and what you will be looking for if you want to play a game like this.Pros: - Massive world- Plenty of quests- A very free and sometimes terrifying character creation system- A huge Modding community, but does not support steam workshop. Quarl's Texture pack is a must! The nexus is great too!- A brillant sense of adventure! I felt like exploring and continuing which is brillant!- A great starter RPG. It's a great RPG to start with!- The emperor is PATRICK STEWART! HE IS THE ONLY UNIQUE VOICE ACTOR AND HE DIES VERY QUICKLY BUT HE'S STILL PATRICK STEWART!Now heres the part where I give you what is not so great about the game, because honestly no game is perfect no matter how much the rosey glasses of nostalgia say they are.Cons- Combat sucks. Theres no two was about it its really drab and boring and redundant it gets the job done though. Luckily there are mods that fix that! They're just a google search and a little research away! - The cities can feel a bit small and under populated. The biggest city in the empire only has about 30 or so people. Though the issue is prominent in most Bethesda games it's still an issue that deserve acknowledgement.- There are only 18 voice actors so it can be a bit imerssion breaking when you here people talking to each other with the same voice. Also the ambiant speech can be very redundant after while but tha might just be because I've played it for so much time.- The system for making people like you is actually rather comical. Just a few presses of a button and you have new best friend!Though there are certianly more little things wrong with this game such as how it is very buggy (Unnoffical oblivion patch fixes this issue and is easily installed on the nexus) It is still a game worth buying UNLESS ANY OF THOSE CONS ARE SO OFF PUTTING YOU DON'T WANT IT! However I have to say this is a brilliant game and is certianly worth buying! The DLC is awesome so if you get the chance and its on sale for oh say 5$ or 7.50$ it is an easy insta-buy. You will get your money's worth I promise, or it will sit in your back log because ya know steam. So all and all a good purchase!			",144,22,3,21,13,0,12

												Ok. I've got over 200 hours on this game, and I'm pretty sure the time reset itself at some point. And I had it on the Xbox as well. I think that serves as an example of how much I like this game.Honestly? The vanilla game is brilliant, but it isn't perfect. But you know why you get this game on the PC? Mods. If there's a problem, grab Wyre Bash, BOSS and go on the Nexus. You're sure to find something to fix it. Or maybe you just want more content, or a companion that is pretty much an artificial person? Mods can do that.Of course, this isn't a review if I'm just gushing about it. I know most recommendations here on Steam are literally that, but I want to give you something to read. Because I love you.The combat is lackluster. Really, it's just clicking a bunch. It takes much, much too long to bring down an oppenent, and too long for them to bring you down. There's of course mods for that - I don't use them anymore myself, but try Duke Patrick's combat mods.The level scaling is... terrible. After you get to, say level 30, /all/ of the rats and wolves are replaced my minotaurs and bears. Bandits won't be wearing leather or fur, but high class glass. Ridiculous. One option to get around this is to choose major skills which will bring you to a specific level. For example, you might have 2 or 3 skills you actively use, and the rest you don't touch. This will keep you around level 20. The other option is, of course, mods. Frans will keep the scaling, but make it /sane/. OOO will remove it and make the world static, so one type of enemy will always be in the same dungeon. TIE is random, and adds a bunch of stealth related features. In the latter two, you will die a lot.The game is poorly optimised. It will run fine without mods, but if you use them, espect some crashes. Don't expect to be able to load up on advanced textures and the like no matter how good your system is - it's only optimised for one core. There's plenty of INI tweaks which can help. It's recommended to Pyffi the meshes located in the game's BSAs. Don't ask me how to do this, I've forgotten and I just keep the BSAs I've made, but look it up. It sounds more intimidating than it is. There's also a few mods which help for stability, including unofficial patches, Streamline, Quiet Feet and several optimised meshes and textures. All in all, expect it to run worse than Skyrim, but it's not going to be nearly as bad as the PC port of Saints Row 2.So, what's good about the game? Well, I can't say. I can't tell you why I love it so much. Maybe it's the freedom to do whatever you want and to explore? Maybe it's the almost humourous nature of the game, apparent whenever you see or hear an NPC? Maybe it's the world building, which isn't readily apparent to those who don't care to look, but read the books, or listening to the people, and you will know it.I much prefer this over Morrowind, which has an interesting setting, and Skyrim, which has much better combat and perks. Oblivion has a kind of spirit to it, and with mods, you can change that spirit to whatever you choose. Everyone's game will be different.The main shame, which I havn't seen fixed by any mods, is that Cyrodiil isn't the jungle setting described by previous games, and that the main quest is, unless you look into the lore, very black and white. I suppose a lot of people like clear morality, but not me. I find myself having to remind myself that deadra don't actually have a mortal's perception of morality at all.But, perhaps I've dwelled on the downsides of this game too much? I hope that the amount of joy I get from playing it shows that the positives, whatever they might be, outweigh the negatives. ;)			",43,14,0,20,1,0,2

												This game is easily my favorite game in existance to this day. I am not a huge fan of the elder scrolls series (well at least not before I played this) but I have clocked in more hours to this game then any other I can think of (I owned this game before I bought it though steam). the open ended-ness of this game is a big draw in for me, though it is far from perfect I can proudly call this game a 9/10.

												Talk about one of the best game ever. Oblivion was the first elder scrolls game I played. Had it way before steam ever did. I probably put it in over 200 hours playing this game and modding the crap outof it. Modding is where this game excelled the most. I've never played a game with a better modding community.

												It's better than Skyrim in my opinion. It was one of the first RPG i've ever played, and if i go back into one of these citys, it just makes me feel good for a moment.I already finished it a several times; i got it on Steam, Xbox360 and as a CD. It's just an awesome game.We've seen better graphics, .. but it's ( even in 2013/2014 ) a wonderful game, with hilarious bugs and an awesome questline.I'll not rate it, because it's something different. It's a part of my childhood, lol.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion was my first introduction to the Elder Scrolls franchise back when it first came out on the Xbox 360. I had more time on this game across the 3 Xbox 360's than almost anything else, and there's a reason for that: this game is fantastic.I'm a guy that is most at home with RPGs, be it on PC or console and this is truly what I would consider a solid RPG. While it's true the graphics and many of the features are outdated, clunky, and annoying at times, many of these problems have been solved by the Steam and Nexus communities, and even some mods with features you didn't even know you wanted. I bought this with The Elder Scrolls Anthology and didn't play it off of Steam, hence the miniscule playtime, but I assure you, I've played this extensively. The graphics are old, but they look better on PC than they ever did on console, and with the game's low load on your computer, even mid-tier computers can play it on high settings, and even include mods for more beautiful scenery. While there's not as much ""realism"" and ""grit"" put into this game like Skyrim did, I feel that adds to it. Skyrim's aesthetic was simply to look realistic, which seems to take away from how utterly unrealistic the premises of Elder Scrolls games really are. Dwemer Ruins shouldn't look like something out of a hyper-realistic Steampunk gallery, they should look grandiose, colorful, and awe-inspiring for the work that went into them. There's no real aesthetic in Skyrim, but there is in Oblivion. A game has much more lasting power for me if there's a style to it, rather than realism, because realism fades quickly as graphics excel. Oblivion, despite having a very dark storyline and subject matter, was bright, colorful, and vibrant. The faces were much more realistic than most games that followed it for a few years, and even though there was never perfect anything with the graphics, the colors made up for it. Skyrim is so bland and has no real diversity in its fauna and flora. Oblivion's grasses were never the same across every region. The climate changed quickly and realistically when you fast traveled, but it was gradual when you walked through the lands, and you really felt like you were exploring. The map for Cyrodil felt so much larger than Skyrim because there were just so many things to do, places to explore, and quests to do. Sure, there weren't as many mini-quest dungeons and secrets, but I'll be damned if I didn't feel more rewarded when I did finished a Thieves' Guild Quest, or more powerful when I became Arch Mage. They gave you ranks and made you feel important, and the main questline was much more satisfying than Skyrim's. Destroying that last Oblivion Gate made me feel like a God damn champion of Tamriel. I'll admit I felt more important in Skyrim's quest, but it had such an anti-climactic ending, the whole thing just seemed silly. In Oblivion, people would refer to you as the Hero Of Kvatch or any various title you held in relation to them just in casual conversation, when you walked by, or when you interacted with them. It felt like you were recognized for your deeds and not just being some person with special powers. I could keep going about various other things, but for the sake of time, I'll leave it for you to compare and decide.In short, if you're looking for a true RPG that's both fun and satisfying, and you're willing to sacrifce graphical quality (or if your rig can handle intensive HD graphics and texture mods) then this game is totally up your alley. I'd give the game a solid 8.5/10, so it's definitely worth your time and money. Personally, I'd advise you to go buy The Elder Scrolls Anthology either online or at a local video game store, because you get Morrowind, Oblivion, and Skyrim Steam Codes & data discs, with all the DLC, along with the first 2 Elder Scrolls (Arena and Daggerfall), all for $80. It's totally worth the money in the end, because you can have literally thousands of hours of content to play for $20 more than a brand new game. Or you can pick this up on a Steam Sale, it's up to you. Anyway, have fun with this awesome game!			",86,10,0,9,7,1,13

												This was the first Elder Scrolls and first open world game I ever played. I was awe struct by its beauty (back in 2006) and ability to go to the very mountains in the distance. I recomend this game over skyrim if you want to get into the genre. It has a great storyline and the gameplay (arguably) is better than The Elder Scrolls 3 Morrowind. There is so much to be said about this game but i wont bore you. Buy the game, beat it, and then install a few mods to make the game even more immersive. Happy Gaming			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Being a prisoner in the Elder Scrolls series is a favorable thing. Again, you start as a prisoner rotting in a jail cell, are freed by random chance, and become a renowned hero and leader of multiple guilds, if you so choose. The main quest chain is exceptionally short, but the real fun is found in the many, many side quests and player-made content and mods. Everyone in Cyrodiil has a chubby face and the khajiit and argonians were given plantigrade legs as opposed to the digitigrade legs they had before. PCs and NPCs aside, the environments, dungeons and cities in this game look fantastic. The soundtrack for the game does well in drawing you into the world and was done by Jeremy Soule, who also made the soundtrack for Morrowind and one of my favorite RPGs, Secret of Evermore. Just because you own Skyrim doesn't mean you shouldn't also own and play Oblivion!			",184,32,0,43,4,1,7

												If your a fan of RPGS and Love skyrim, This is for you! This game Is ( even though it was a previous game) 10x Better than skyrim . They screwed everyone over by taking away tons of Really lovable features out of the TES series, namely spell crafting and moddability. Sure skyrim can be modded BUT skyrim doesnt allow their mods to  be very script heavy, making the mods for skyrim very small and stupid in comparison as the mods for oblivion are the best of any game I have ever seen. Some adding in morrowind and valenwood and elswyer and some adding in quests that simply go beyond modding and add full deep enthralling quest lines that make you want more. Other than that skyrim got SCREWED over by dlcs not adding NEARLY as much since the elderscrolls Oblivion dlcs added a HUGE continent compared to skyrims weak and pathetic island( dragonborn DLC). Though many of the dlcs in oblivion were very stupid and added little it still has way more content than skyrim could ever have.			",164,21,2,35,17,3,28

												Ok. I've got over 200 hours on this game, and I'm pretty sure the time reset itself at some point. And I had it on the Xbox as well. I think that serves as an example of how much I like this game.Honestly? The vanilla game is brilliant, but it isn't perfect. But you know why you get this game on the PC? Mods. If there's a problem, grab Wyre Bash, BOSS and go on the Nexus. You're sure to find something to fix it. Or maybe you just want more content, or a companion that is pretty much an artificial person? Mods can do that.Of course, this isn't a review if I'm just gushing about it. I know most recommendations here on Steam are literally that, but I want to give you something to read. Because I love you.The combat is lackluster. Really, it's just clicking a bunch. It takes much, much too long to bring down an oppenent, and too long for them to bring you down. There's of course mods for that - I don't use them anymore myself, but try Duke Patrick's combat mods.The level scaling is... terrible. After you get to, say level 30, /all/ of the rats and wolves are replaced my minotaurs and bears. Bandits won't be wearing leather or fur, but high class glass. Ridiculous. One option to get around this is to choose major skills which will bring you to a specific level. For example, you might have 2 or 3 skills you actively use, and the rest you don't touch. This will keep you around level 20. The other option is, of course, mods. Frans will keep the scaling, but make it /sane/. OOO will remove it and make the world static, so one type of enemy will always be in the same dungeon. TIE is random, and adds a bunch of stealth related features. In the latter two, you will die a lot.The game is poorly optimised. It will run fine without mods, but if you use them, espect some crashes. Don't expect to be able to load up on advanced textures and the like no matter how good your system is - it's only optimised for one core. There's plenty of INI tweaks which can help. It's recommended to Pyffi the meshes located in the game's BSAs. Don't ask me how to do this, I've forgotten and I just keep the BSAs I've made, but look it up. It sounds more intimidating than it is. There's also a few mods which help for stability, including unofficial patches, Streamline, Quiet Feet and several optimised meshes and textures. All in all, expect it to run worse than Skyrim, but it's not going to be nearly as bad as the PC port of Saints Row 2.So, what's good about the game? Well, I can't say. I can't tell you why I love it so much. Maybe it's the freedom to do whatever you want and to explore? Maybe it's the almost humourous nature of the game, apparent whenever you see or hear an NPC? Maybe it's the world building, which isn't readily apparent to those who don't care to look, but read the books, or listening to the people, and you will know it.I much prefer this over Morrowind, which has an interesting setting, and Skyrim, which has much better combat and perks. Oblivion has a kind of spirit to it, and with mods, you can change that spirit to whatever you choose. Everyone's game will be different.The main shame, which I havn't seen fixed by any mods, is that Cyrodiil isn't the jungle setting described by previous games, and that the main quest is, unless you look into the lore, very black and white. I suppose a lot of people like clear morality, but not me. I find myself having to remind myself that deadra don't actually have a mortal's perception of morality at all.But, perhaps I've dwelled on the downsides of this game too much? I hope that the amount of joy I get from playing it shows that the positives, whatever they might be, outweigh the negatives. ;)			",43,14,0,20,1,0,2

												Hello, Bonsoir, Buenas Tardes, ect.  Today, I will be reviewing the still-popular Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion.First of all, I'd like to say how well the Elder Scrolls series have progressed, take Skyrim for example.  It's been active for 4 Years, and there are thousands, and thousands of mods, those still coming.  I'd also like to say I did play Skyrim before Oblivion, and I'm not really sure why there's so much hate between the two games.  I rather fell in love (figure of speech) with Oblivion, and I almost play Oblivion more than Skyrim.Now there's many great things about Oblivion, Skyrim, Online, Morrowind, Daggerfall and Arena, but of course there will be bad things.  Okay, this is starting to sound like a review for all of them, and a discussion rather, moving on!The Graphics:The graphics are actually pretty well done considering how long ago this was made.  I was very surprised by how well done it was.  Now, I'm sure this will be a very considered factor in many gamers, how well it looks.  But, unlike most Skyrim Fanboys, I actually kept an open mind and remembered this game was made in 2006.  Take a look at my profile picture, which is a shot of my character in Oblivion.The Voice Actors:Yes, yes, yes this is a minor factor, but yes, I will include it anyway.  The voice actors in the game are very limited, so you will find perhaps a couple dozen of characters that sound exactly the same (but the Emperor is special, he's Cpt. Picard in Star Trek: The Next Generation!) But, given that there are a plentiful amount of characters in both Oblivion and Skyrim, you are bound to find some characters with the same voice actor.The Story:It may not be the best story in history, but it is really good, except for the later ones.  You're basically the new Emperor's delivery boy in those.  You may also find similarity with Oblivion's and Online's, as Tamriel is in danger in both (again), a Daedric Prince is trying to bring the realms together, and in both there are...gates...everywhere.The Combat System:This was an amazing improvement than the previous Elder Scrolls game's.  It's not based on the roll of dice, there's actually some stratedgy to it, such as if you're actually hitting it, how much power you're hitting, if you're decently skilled at it, ect.  This is starting to sound like a rage to Morrowind, moving on(!).Other content:You could easily spend 20 hours in Oblivion, and STILL not have everything done.  Especially with the Shivering Isles DLC, which probably adds another ~8 hours.  There's the Dark Brotherhood questline, Thieves, Fighter's, and Mage's guild, Arena Questline, only could take about an hour or so.Well, I'm outta time, so have a bonne jour.			",30,9,0,20,9,0,8

												oblivion is the best elder scrolls game by far. With the big land of tamriel u will never stop exploring, with the wide range of magic and weapons that are awesome you'll be wanting to kill more goblins.

												Still, even after playing it for hundreds of hours, both on my Steam account, on the Xbox, and at friend's houses, this is the best game I've ever played. It is extremely fun, and even now has beautiful graphics (better than a lot of current games). The ambiance of the game makes, and the very well written quests, makes up for the small amount of glitches and flawed leveling system. Besides all that, anyone that has played the game will tell you that Shivering Isles is a crazy cool expansion pack, and is the best thing ever. Buy this game! :D			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												If your a fan of rpg games in general you will get sucked into this game. for a 2007 game it has amazing graphics, not to mention all the exploration you can do! Yes skyrim is out and it has more stuff to do but when you want to go back in the past and enjoy some of the greatest games of the decades your at the right place. the story is a little short but the game has many side quests to keep you busy. There are no dragons but there are minators and unicorns that will give you quite the challenge on any difficulty that you are on.			",247,37,8,36,20,4,42

												Buggy, Ugly, and Deeply Flawed.Yet when using my playtime as a rubric, I've enjoyed this game more than 90% of my game library.So what keeps whales like me coming back to this title?  Let me go through the pros first.  These largely compare the game to others in the series, but can be taken on their own.- Great bombastic musical score.- Incredible Mod List (although it takes some dedication to getting everything to work.  If you don't want to download from third party sites, you can discount this point.)- Customization of characters, from their bone structure (though a character's height is race locked) , to their hair cut, to the spells they cast, and the skills they employ.  Patrick Stewart will even ask your birth sign, which isn't entirely out of the ordinary for those in regular contact with him, but I digress.- Big world.  Contrary to what many Morrowind fans say (and I'm one of them), the main cities, while sharing some characteristics do tend to stand out with their own architecture and style.- There's no radiant ai or refilling quests (without mods that is...) but you probably won't be able to complete all of them anyway in under a hundred hours of playtime.  One quest or one dungeon crawl can take over an hour.  Quests are largely self-defined as in Morrowind.- Elder Scrolls lore, but that's largely subjective and a matter of personal taste.- Bigger, less stupidly easy-to-navigate dungeons than Skyrim.- Combat feels more fluid than Skyrim.  But there's no way natively to unnock your arrows after you've taken aim.- Spells can be used while using two handed weapons and shields.- No dual weilding.Cons:- No dual weilding.- A quest system that gives less in the way of directions than morrowind, and as a result relies heavily on quest markers.- Ugly, potato-faced npcs and pcs if you aren't good at character customization.- Spell creation is less complex than morrowind or daggerfall, but still better than the abortion of magic in Skyrim.  And better balanced into the bargain.  So again, not really a con as much as a comparison.- DLC that if checked when you play the game, will inundate you with messages as soon as you're free of the tutoria... er, beginning sequence.-  A game that almost requires mods to be playable for most isn't what most would call a good game.  Yet I've rarely enjoyed a game for long that didn't allow for modding of vanilla.  Subjective.- Mods aren't always professional quality, and can destroy either your game or your computer if you load too many or the wrong ones.- No proper beards.It's a long list, but in the end, I've enjoyed the game enough to give it a reluctant recommendation.

												Let me get the bad out of the way. This game has serious mechanical issues regarding levelling, scaling and how stat advancement is handled. I has some minor performance issues, and it is in dire need of a heap of mods to improve facial appearance of characters, textures etc. I recommend Oblivion Character Overhaul, natural environments, qarl's textures, and the unofficial patch. Enjoy the game, and in particular, the quests, best part of the game overall, since combat is nothing to write home about. Unless you like Diablo level mindless clicking and swinging your arms like a madman.			",97,4,4,5,2,0,11

												I remember learning about the Elder Scrolls series from my older brother, who purchased Morrowind on the original Xbox. I was never really interested in playing it because I was 7 years old at the time, but I always liked watching him play. About 3 years later, a friend of my brothers brought over another Elder Scrolls game, this one called ""Oblivion"". We all played it together, and I participated this time. And I fell in love with it. I still remember times from when I was 11 years old, all the lights turned off in my house, nothin' but me and my Xbox in my living room, playing Oblivion for 6 straight hours. Time well spent...Elder Scrolls, for those who are unaware, is an Action RPG. Imagine Fallout set back in Medieval times, but way better because there's swords and magic! There's not a single complaint I have about Oblivion; it's damn near flawless, at least in my opinion. There's a bit of bugginess here and there, such as getting stuck on mountains, disappearing items/NPC's, etc. But that's a Bethesda game for you! Jokes aside though, the number of times those kinds of glitches have happened to me are few and far between over 7 years of playing this game. The level-up system is fantastic, combat is so good, great set of sidequests, and you can even go to literally HELL.The one Elder Scrolls game everyone knows is Skyrim. But for those who have only played Skyrim and no other Elder Scrolls game, I strongly encourage you to give Oblivion a fair try. You will not be disappointed.9.5/10			",119,12,0,24,8,1,21

This game is a masterpiece. Many may say Skyrim is the best RPG out there, but I can assure you that the world that Oblivion has you enter is far more gripping and immersive.

												This is an amazing gmae, one of the best I've ever played, nice graphics but not too over the top, although character customization could use some work, this game embodies everything you would want in a fantasy open world RPG. I would recommend this game to any fantasy fans who love open world games. In a way this is my favourite game in the Elder Scrolls Series, but in other ways not, it had lots of features i wouldv'e hoped to see in Skyrim that they didnt put in, such as a combat arena, but in other ways Skyrim is better. Although I think skyrim has more of a nordic feel to it instead of a fantasy feel, like when i play Skyrim I often think it's a history lesson about nordic myths, but when I play Oblivion you get a true fantasy feel. I may not have played this game to much on the PC as I find it works a bit better on a console, which is what I mainly play it on, as I have had numerous glitches while playing on the PC.

It isnt the best game ever but, it is so worth it to buy and experience.THE FINAL VERDICT IS 9/10 Almost flawless for its time and even now is still great.Would strongly recommend to anyone in the mood for a deep story filled with magic and demons to find and fought to a sweet sweet end.

												I bought this game because it is the best in the franchise, I've bought the GOTY thrice, 360, PC(retail), and Steam, and played over a thousand hours on PC alone.  This is the most moddable game I've ever seen. More so than any GTA, hands down. I really bought it because back in the day when it came out, I didn't have a quater of the power in my PC as I do now. Now, oh NOW? I have maxed all settings, the largest Quarls texture packs, Kvatch Rebuilt, all the unofficial patches (over 1800 bugs Bethesda never fixed), all the official DLC (always have had that), all of the unique landscapes mods, Morrowblivion, Mart's Monster Mod, Ren's Beauty Pack, Signs retextured, Animated windows and chimneys, and that's before you consider that this game has overhaul mods that take everything to a new level. I'm talking new leveling systems, new spells, new monsters and giant monsters, new races, new weapons by the hundreds, new fauna and flora, better crafting and alchemy, more mounts, new quests and clans, new houses, new stores and merchants, enhanced UI for first and third person, attacking on horseback,  all on top of the original. Use Oblivion Mod Manager (OBMM) or Nexus Mod Manager (NMM) for best results. I have a modded version of this game on my PS3, and hand packing the mods into the game is worth it still. No Oblivion Script Extender support on PS3 though, so it really can only take mild texture enhancements like Ren's and simply scripted mods like better spells and additional merchants. Well if you've ever wanted a game that you would run more modded as The Sims here is your♥♥♥♥♥♥			",225,47,9,21,11,2,25

												oblivion is the best elder scrolls game by far. With the big land of tamriel u will never stop exploring, with the wide range of magic and weapons that are awesome you'll be wanting to kill more goblins.

												No, it isn't Morrowind, sorry. And in my opinion, it isn't broken without mods. If you want to, you can mod it to hell and back, but I played the entire game (all guilds, and main quest) for the first time just last year, unmodded, and it was excellent. Just let go of all the misconceptions and crap people talk about it, and just try and get into it and enjoy it for what it is. It's a good game. I had to play differently than I normally would, to really enjoy myself. Played a brawler sort, with a two handed sword, who would rush people. Also used Nighteye pretty much constantly, when in dungeons. Maybe some people like the creepiness. I, however, prefer to see, so I can rush my enemies easier, before they can get their spells off, or arrows fired, etc. Great game. Give it a real chance, and you just might like it.

												I remember when I first popped Oblivion into my Xbox 360 so many years ago. It truly was an amazing experience to be immersed into the wonderous land of Cyrodiil, which embodied a landscape all fantasy lovers have wished to explore in some fashion. This game is a masterpiece. Many may say Skyrim is the best RPG out there, but I can assure you that the world that Oblivion has you enter is far more gripping and immersive. This game was literally my 2011 summer life. Play it if you have not before. You won't regret it.			",134,17,1,21,16,1,27

												I played Skyrim prior to Oblivion, so naturally I was iffy on everything, going back in quality and whatnot. I was surprised to see I was not let down when I started Oblivion. I highly recommend getting Game of the Year editon, mainly for the dlc, which add more flavor and fun to the game. The plot is great, the side quests are amazing, and the characters are memorable. My only issue was combat. It was old-school whack-a-mole, but like I said at the beginning, I was spoiled by Skyrim finishers.			",6,3,0,1,1,0,0

												This is, in my own humble opinion, one of the best RPGs of all time. From lush grass lands, to swampy wetlands, to snow covered tundra this game has all of the terrestrial elements a gamer could ask for. It shows its age, of course. Nonetheless, it is a graphically beautiful as well as beautiful  in its story line. This game has some of the best lore I have ever experienced. The characters are surprisingly immersive, the music is great. The comabt is somewhat dated, but is perfectly functional, effective, and somewhat challenging to master. There are a myriad of different kinds of quests, which sets this game apart from its younger brother: Skyrim. There are so many places to be, so many things to explore, one will never get bored with this game. I promise 200+ hours of gameplay including main quests. I seriously recoomend this game to really any kind of gamer. For some it may be boring and slow. But for those that like to take there time sometimes, this can be the game for you.

												Nominated this game for the ""WHOOOAAAAAAA, DUDE!"" award.Now don't get me wrong, I absolutely LOVE Skyrim and Morowind, but out of all the PC games I've played in my life I have never been as blown away by any of them like I was with Oblivion.To be fair, this was also the first ES game I ever played. I didn't get into Morrowing until afterwards, and then of course Skyrim years later. I got this on the day it was released for PC, so yes my game box has the ""T"" rating on it. The graphics were amazing for that time and the game was beyond anything I imagined could be possible in a game. The Main quest was epic and all the factions and side quests were great and never felt like they didn't belong in that world. This was also the first completely vioce acted game I ever played.... if you don't count FFX; and the voice acting, though only done by like 4 people, was superb. The sky, the landscapes, the lore, the rediculous number of items I could interact with; it was just so much. There is a place in my heart that hopes Bethesda revisits this title like they did with Skyrim. I would love to play this in updated HD and a few cheevos would not go unappreciated.

												Although I must admit Bethesda never made it up to their ladder since Morrowind, I cannot deny my endless weeks and years of holidays spend on this (smaller than morrowind but still) pretty gem. Oblivion is just like the rest of the Elder Scrolls games a game that relies on the core mechanics and principles of an RPG Sandbox. Which means easy to use and familiar gameplay, a big open world to mess around in and lots of magic and clashing swords. The things I like about Bethesda's Elder Scrolls is that each game has his own look and feel. You want to be inside that game, you want to be able to see and do even more than you already can. Oblivion also succeeded in this, making this game a true childhood piece of awesomeness.I still like it now I look at it from a different perspecive though, simply because of the (still familiar) easy to understand basics and smoothness of the gameplay itself. It's not hard, nor is it too easy. All the way in completing the quests you'll find easier and more challenging creatures. It's just so easy to pick up from where you left! And that is one thing that is very important. The game has some bugs and glitches, and the leveling system isn't that ideal, but it still doesn't fail to entertain even now I'm grown up and reaching for the Game Industry myself.The expansions and add-ons are sometimes a little unnecessary, though fun when you've completed the main quests.Oh, and the main reason for it being less awesome as Morrowind is simply because morrowind had everything. No really; it had EVERYTHING!Again, never get's boring, easy to lose yourself in, great setting, 8/10.			",100,13,2,7,6,0,2

												10/10I played probably over 1,000 hours of Oblivion on ps3. That's a testament to the sheer size and enjoyability this game has to offer. I consider it to be a masterpiece of western role playing design.That doesn't mean it is flawless though... far from it. It has buggy gameplay and this weird fascination with every npc staring at you when you converse with them.It's also in the painful position of inevitably being compared to Skyrim. A much easier recommendation because of Skyrim's ease of use for newcomers to the series.Oblivion was a masterpiece when it came out but has shown a lot of ware and tare over the years.If your interested in playing this game and have never played a western rpg or elder scrolls game. Play Skyrim first. It's easier to recommend. Even if in my humble opinion is the lesser of the two.			",90,21,1,29,11,0,14

												Simply the best elder scrolls game (My Opinion). It has a massive open world for you to explore full of caves, dungeons, ruins, cities, forests and more to explore. The main plot is about mehrunes dagon trying to get into tamriel to start a reign of destruction. You start off in prison but the emperor and his bodyguards come into your cell to escape in a secret escape route out of the city so you get to come along on the condition of helping protect the emperor. After the main storyline there's lots more storylines/quests to do like the mages guild, the fighters guild and the rumored thieves guild and dark brotherhood.			",68,6,5,8,12,2,6

												As a long-time Elder Scrolls fan, I must say that this game is truly a masterpiece. I remember when Morrowind came out, how fascinated I was by all of its intricacies. I couldn't believe that a game could feel so alive, that I could be so immersed in a plethora of cultures, ideologies, races and factions all while exploring a beautiful, detailed world and the history that shaped it into what you see it now. It was the stuff epic adventures are made out of.Oblivion takes that core gameplay and expands quite a great deal upon it. The first thing you might notice is the graphical upgrade. Oblivion's graphics were so cutting edge at the time that they still hold up very nicely today. The main story arch is solid, with a well paced build up and a gripping finale. Sidequests, however, are where this game (much like its predecessor) truly shines. There are a lot of side quests, guild quests, artifacts to discover, spells/gear to craft. You will always have something to do, and I find it best to micromanage by assigning priority to your tasks rather than completing quests as you receive them. Thankfully, this game has a much better fast-travel system than Morrowind's, you can click on visited locations on your map to instantly travel there (does take in-game time, so vampires beware!) so back-tracking is manageable. This is a welcome upgrade, as Cyrodiil is a VERY big place. You will also find yourself trekking through the ""instanced"" dungeons and planes of Oblivion quite often. Your adventures through these creature-laden locales will be aided by a very good quest compass, use it!The expansions are quite good too, Shivering Isles adds Sheogorath's realm to the fold, which is a very interesting place- albeit a bit bi-polar. You'll know what I mean when you get there. A lot of extra treasure is also added in both expansions. An interesting thing to note: there is no linearity in this game, that is to say you do not need to do the main quest first, or keep doing it after you start it. You can just as easily do every other quest in the game, have a monstrous beast of a character and then embark on the main story. The possibilities are seemingly limitless, which is why I've played through this game multiple times with different characters- the ""feel"" of a Dark Elf heavy armor melee with destruction and marksman is fundamentally different than a High Elf deep magic caster with no armor but buffs/disrupts/nukes galore. Assassin-like characters are also great fun and very rewarding in this game thanks to a much better stealth system and huge damage bonuses in stealth. Pretty much every and any playstyle you can imagine is viable to play, and the ability to design your own classes is rewarding and in fact vital if you want maximum stat gains. My parting advice: Read up on how to properly design your characters in a general sense to have maximum stat gains (+5 in 3 stats at every level up or close to it) ESPECIALLY FOR ENDURANCE. Get your endurance to 100 ASAP, the earlier you do it the higher your character's max health will be for the rest of the game. Conversely, if you leave it low then as you level up the NPCs will outpace your health growth and become much more difficult to face. 5/5- Highly recommend to fans and newcomers alike.

												Ever since I was nine years of age, I have played 'The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion', I got it for my Birthday for XBOX 360;At first, I thought it was okay, because I knew nothing about it, but as time went on I started to love it, treasure it, by the time I was ten years of age I had gotten to level 50 on my Breton character, Level 50 for a Ten year old is quite an accomplishment... But at this time I was just running around killing people and getting loot from Caves, this was until I was eleven. At the age of eleven I started to open my eyes more, and appreciate the Game's beauty, I finally started to realise the realism of this game, the forests are beautiful, and the Oblivion gates to be feared, the detail of the enemy's and people is INSANE, for a game that started production in 2005 and oficially released in 2006, this game is a winner!                                                                      ""E3 Game of The Year 2006""at the end of the day, if you are a guy for graphics, you'll find this game eight years later still HIGHLY PLAYABLE! But I just respect what The Elder Scrolls has done for me, even now in my teenage years, I play Oblivion, even Morrowind, or sometimes Skyrim. You'll find this game enjoyable, or even amazing, or partial on the fact that it is good, or maybe it just isn't your cup of tea, but I promise you, there is enough content in this game to last you a whole year! So you should purchase it on Steam, or hard copy, whatever suits you, and when you get bored of Vanilla Oblivion, go to TESNexus and get yourself Mods for things such as Quests, armor, weapons, or guilds!10/10			",14,1,0,3,3,0,2

												This game is one of the best games I have ever played. While I do not have many hours on PC, I can not count the amount I have put into it over other consoles. Whenever I start this game up a wave of nostalgia hits me. The storyline for once doesn't have you as the main character, but instead has you helping the only person who can save the world. Side missions are everywhere, so you will never get bored, and the characters have been done amazingly (except for their lumpy cheese faces).			",139,12,1,10,18,0,5

I recomend this game over skyrim if you want to get into the genre. It has a great storyline and the gameplay (arguably) is better than The Elder Scrolls 3 Morrowind. There is so much to be said about this game but i wont bore you. Buy the game, beat it, and then install a few mods to make the game even more immersive. Happy Gaming			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												The first time I loaded this up, I had a chat with Patrick Stewart, got my head around the first quest, and sidestepped out of prison. Outside, I had a quick first peak at the world map. I turned it off and didn't go back for a year. I'll be honest, I was a little bit scared. Starting Oblivion is like discovering that your garage is packed to the roof with heroin, and then saying, ""I'll just have a little taste. Just one little go."" The game is so huge, it's ridiculous. And the content is all so brilliant! That's why I've nominated Oblivion for my very own Award. The 'This game works out at 3p an hour to play' Award. Go play, if you have a few hundred hours spare.

Starting with Elder Scrolls: Morrowind, Bethesda had saught to not only utilize consoles, but return home to its original platform the PC. This game is the epitome of the return home, beautifully designed, with a sandbox for players to follow their own paths, Elder Scrolls: Oblivion GOTY edition is a must. I recommend this game to anybody that doesn't want to be bound by the rules of regular RPGs but rather takes the story and places it in your hand.			",6,1,0,5,0,0,0

Posted: July 19, 2014
												The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion was my first introduction to the Elder Scrolls franchise back when it first came out on the Xbox 360. I had more time on this game across the 3 Xbox 360's than almost anything else, and there's a reason for that: this game is fantastic.I'm a guy that is most at home with RPGs, be it on PC or console and this is truly what I would consider a solid RPG. While it's true the graphics and many of the features are outdated, clunky, and annoying at times, many of these problems have been solved by the Steam and Nexus communities, and even some mods with features you didn't even know you wanted. I bought this with The Elder Scrolls Anthology and didn't play it off of Steam, hence the miniscule playtime, but I assure you, I've played this extensively. The graphics are old, but they look better on PC than they ever did on console, and with the game's low load on your computer, even mid-tier computers can play it on high settings, and even include mods for more beautiful scenery. While there's not as much ""realism"" and ""grit"" put into this game like Skyrim did, I feel that adds to it. Skyrim's aesthetic was simply to look realistic, which seems to take away from how utterly unrealistic the premises of Elder Scrolls games really are. Dwemer Ruins shouldn't look like something out of a hyper-realistic Steampunk gallery, they should look grandiose, colorful, and awe-inspiring for the work that went into them. There's no real aesthetic in Skyrim, but there is in Oblivion. A game has much more lasting power for me if there's a style to it, rather than realism, because realism fades quickly as graphics excel. Oblivion, despite having a very dark storyline and subject matter, was bright, colorful, and vibrant. The faces were much more realistic than most games that followed it for a few years, and even though there was never perfect anything with the graphics, the colors made up for it. Skyrim is so bland and has no real diversity in its fauna and flora. Oblivion's grasses were never the same across every region. The climate changed quickly and realistically when you fast traveled, but it was gradual when you walked through the lands, and you really felt like you were exploring. The map for Cyrodil felt so much larger than Skyrim because there were just so many things to do, places to explore, and quests to do. Sure, there weren't as many mini-quest dungeons and secrets, but I'll be damned if I didn't feel more rewarded when I did finished a Thieves' Guild Quest, or more powerful when I became Arch Mage. They gave you ranks and made you feel important, and the main questline was much more satisfying than Skyrim's. Destroying that last Oblivion Gate made me feel like a God damn champion of Tamriel. I'll admit I felt more important in Skyrim's quest, but it had such an anti-climactic ending, the whole thing just seemed silly. In Oblivion, people would refer to you as the Hero Of Kvatch or any various title you held in relation to them just in casual conversation, when you walked by, or when you interacted with them. It felt like you were recognized for your deeds and not just being some person with special powers. I could keep going about various other things, but for the sake of time, I'll leave it for you to compare and decide.In short, if you're looking for a true RPG that's both fun and satisfying, and you're willing to sacrifce graphical quality (or if your rig can handle intensive HD graphics and texture mods) then this game is totally up your alley. I'd give the game a solid 8.5/10, so it's definitely worth your time and money. Personally, I'd advise you to go buy The Elder Scrolls Anthology either online or at a local video game store, because you get Morrowind, Oblivion, and Skyrim Steam Codes & data discs, with all the DLC, along with the first 2 Elder Scrolls (Arena and Daggerfall), all for $80. It's totally worth the money in the end, because you can have literally thousands of hours of content to play for $20 more than a brand new game. Or you can pick this up on a Steam Sale, it's up to you. Anyway, have fun with this awesome game!			",86,10,0,9,7,1,13

While the graphic aren't amazing (this game is from 2006), they still looks pretty good when bumped up to Ultra on 1080P. The combat is a bit floaty, but the story, characters, and interesting quests will keep you coming back for more. Again, I can not recommend this game enough. Buy it. ",156,10,3,14,14,2,31

GUYS ITS SEAN BEAN AKA BOROMIR WHOSE MARTIN SEPTIM HOW COULD ANYONE NOT LIKE HIM!!PLUS - i believe that this game's theives, mages, fighters and dark brotherhood was far better than skyrim.

I highly recommend this game to any fan of the Elder Scrolls series, and to any fans of fantasy RPGs. While the graphic aren't amazing (this game is from 2006), they still looks pretty good when bumped up to Ultra on 1080P. The combat is a bit floaty, but the story, characters, and interesting quests will keep you coming back for more. Again, I can not recommend this game enough. Buy it. ",156,10,3,14,14,2,31

												if i was asked what was your favourite elder scrolls game? it would be oblivion no doubt. this game was awesome when i first played it in 2010 on the PS3. I was a bit skeptical about it at first, but then i realised that this game provides open world, interactive characters and brilliant story telling. GUYS ITS SEAN BEAN AKA BOROMIR WHOSE MARTIN SEPTIM HOW COULD ANYONE NOT LIKE HIM!!PLUS - i believe that this game's theives, mages, fighters and dark brotherhood was far better than skyrim. I liked skyrim's story, but oblivions world was more nostalgic to me than any other elder scrolls game.			",43,0,0,9,2,0,2

												The quality of this game can be answered with these simple questions!1. Do you like Skyrim but thought it was too easy and casual compared to other rpgs?2. Do you like a more diverse enviroment in your games?3. Do you think that Skyrims story was boring and didn't have enough excitement?Well, if you said yes to any of these questions then you'll probably like Oblivion!IF YOU WANT ALL THE DLC GET THE DELUXE PACKAGE!

												I absolutely love this game.  The world is massive and dynamic.  The main quest is plenty of fun, but there are so many excellent sidequests and places to explore, I totally forgot about it on my first playthrough.  Every thing that Skyrim is lacking is in this game.  Sure the graphics aren't great, and the combat is a bit clunky, but I think this adds to it's charm.  Buy this game.  You won't be disappointed.(Also, the reason I have so few hours logged is because I mostly played this game on Xbox 360 back in the day.)			",45,3,0,9,2,0,6

												Oblivion is a game that is now considered to be the awkward teen years of the Elder Scrolls franchise. People are either diehard fans of Morrowind or diehard fans of Skyrim, but I think that Oblivion has quite a lot of merit. It's world is very richly detailed, with cities actually feeling like cities instead of small clusters of buildings. The quests are the best in the series, progressing away from the classic ""crawl through dungeon to grab thing at the end"" trap that so many RPGs fall into. However, I think what Oblivion does best is something that no other TES game has ever really been able to do well; it lets you get lost. Nothing is quite as enjoyable as wandering through dense forests, taking in the game's atmosphere, and uncovering something new.My only real problems with Oblivion are it's leveling system and that it breaks lore by having Cyrodiil as a temperate forest, rather than a hot steamy jungle. Luckily, there are many mods that remedy these problems, and I'd recommend you find one that works for you. All in all, a good entry into the Elder Scrolls series and a classic example of a well made RPG. 9/10			",228,57,1,24,37,1,20

												There is quiet a lot to say about this game, but to be short and concise, if you are looking for an addictive rpg you can stop right here becasue you have find one. I have probably sunken around 500+ hours on the xbox 360 version and it was well worth it. There is just so much to do and see and the environment of cyrodil is amazing and one of the best in all gaming history. Also this game contains the most additive dlc in my opion known as ""The Shivering Isles"". This game is a must buy if you have never played it before, hell it is a must buy even if you've played it 100 times.			",96,4,2,14,4,0,1

												I've played all the Elder Scrolls games since Morrowind was released and I can honestly say that Oblivion was my favorite. Morrowind was by far the most advanced and in depth in the RPG genre and was more story driven, but Oblivion was the elder scroll game which I devoted the most playtime.It's graphics don't compare to Skyrim, but what do you expect for just short of a decade gap in technology. The graphics Oblivion has on max rendering and max settings (which can EASILY be run by modern graphics cards) is not cringeworthly to say the least. I still to this day prefer Oblivion to Skyrim for story content, modability, and GUI and skill advancement. It's truly a beautiful RPG game and is worth picking up when you're bored or looking for an RPG to play.10/10 would waste my childhood on this game again.			",66,1,1,8,3,0,1

												If you haven't played Oblivion yet, then now's the time.  Although it has been recently eclipsed by Skyrim (it's sequel), this game has a lot to offer, from a very dedicated and active modding community to 100+ of gameplay.  If you happen to own the previous Elder Scrolls game, Morrowind, you can also mod Oblivion to include a ""Oblivionized"" version of Morrowind (lovingly called ""Morrowbliviion"") that essentially lets you play through Morrowind with the Oblivion engine and interface.If you scratching your head still, maybe you need an overall idea of the game.  Basically, you are a nameless person who starts with nothing.  You have before you a plethora of options, not just following the main quest.  You can explore, fight, and interact with 100s of locations and characters in virtually any order you want.The only real drawback is that Oblivion has a leveling system that adjusts monsters to your level.  Overall, though, this game is a great deal and provides hours of fun.			",128,64,0,13,13,1,17

												Oblivion has a beautiful soundtrack, as the other Elder Scrolls games do. And Cyrodiil is itself beautiful.Oblivion is a work of art, each quest is interesting (excluding fetch quests, or escort missions... nobody really likes those) and the province of Cyrodiil is huge and can be explored to your hearts content.The lore with each and every Elder Scrolls game is deep and detailed, it is practically as if it were real. And Oblivion is no exception to this. Learning about the daedric princes, gods and different characters in the game is interesting and fun, and living a life in this fantasy world is so much better than real life. I would chose Nirn over Earth any day.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Oblivion offers a massive world with tons of places to explore and lots of freedom to play as you like.Unfortunately, the vanilla game is incredibly buggy and unstable, and the leveling system is quite possibly the worst I've ever seen in a game--if you want to be a mighty warrior that uses warhammers and heavy armor, you'd better be ready to spend most of your time using swords and shields, light armor, and spells because if you don't your stats will stagnate as your level (and difficulty of opponents) skyrockets.  You can also expect to reach a point where every run-of-the-mill bandit you meet is decked out in end-game gear, making acquiring massive riches as simple as a quick walk down the road.Fortunately, the game has a modding community with a rich and ongoing history that has managed to create mods to fix everything wrong and add things you never knew you were missing.  The huge selection of mods for this game let you replace the leveling system, overhaul enemies, add much greater variety in equipment, improve battle mechanics, greatly enhance graphics and sound, stabilize the game, fix literally thousands of bugs, add new quests and areas, modify the game economy, bash open locks, replace the GUI, and so much more.In short, this game is certainly capable of giving countless hours of entertainment, provided you're willing to go to the trouble of finding and (correctly) installing a number of mods, depending on one's tastes.  Otherwise, you should probably just go for Skyrim.			",349,151,5,48,40,3,38

												I originally brought this game in disk form years ago and have racked up hundreds of hours on it, there are plenty of mods out there for this game and there is even a unofficial patch that improves stuff in the world. The story is really rather good, and there are also plenty of side quests that can be done aswell. The game gives you the freedome of choosing what to do and when, which it does pretty well without making you fail a quest for picking it up and not doing it right away which is useful at times. The only thing I did find annoying sometimes, is the Daedra gates that seem to open everywhere. But I also like going into them to get the stones and to use the stones to enchant my gear with. I find it funny to give my enchanted gear wacky names sometimes which also add's to the freedome of choice too.Also the difficulty can be adjusted really rather well, with no ""Easy-medium-hard"" preset just moving the difficulty bar from left to right (Left being easier-right being harder) it really does give you full control over the game! Overall I would say this game is a good buy and the expansions that come with the game of the year version make it a pretty nice and complete set. I think this game is deffonately worth a look, especially considering the mods it has to offer!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I dont know what else to say to The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion, other than it's an amazing game. I owned it on Xbox 360 and probably have about 800-1000 hours on the game, then I decided to get it for the PC. I DO NOT REGRET IT. This game will always be one of my favorite games ever. I simply just love the feel you get from playing it, and the music is great as well. Skyrim may have better graphics, but that's because its 4 years older than Oblivion anyway. Don't get me wrong, Skyrim is great in its own way, but Oblivion really hit home for me. If you are considering to buy this game, My opinion would be to say yes to it, but seriously give it a chance. This game truly is a masterpiece for its time.			",194,24,0,16,20,3,5

												I'm not going to actually make a list of my top 5 PC singleplayer RPG games, but if I did, this would definately be somewhere in that top 5.Oblivion is amazing beacuse of it's ""sandbox"" gameplay. What's that? Getting bored of all the exploring, dungeons, monsters, loot, skills, etc.? Well, it also has it's main quest story line (optional), and a number of optional side stories.Oblivion is, in essence, the entire scope of an MMORPG, but without all the other people. As a singleplayer game, it's great since you can play it offline when your WoW/EQ/etc. server is down, or when your internet is on the fritz, etc.  On top of that, you can expect all sorts of awesome things you can't do in normal MMORPGs because of the problems that arise.For instance, you can steal from nearly any character, but beware the repurcussions if you're caught!With Oblivion you are the master of your own adventure. Oblivion is just the location where that adventure takes place.			",146,37,0,27,18,0,13

												One of the rare few games I truly never grow tired of. Despite playing countless hours of Oblivion on the ps3, I found myself entrhalled with the brand new possibilities offered on the PC. With an immense library of mods, ranging from game-changing to simply aesthetic in nature, there's a nigh infinite amount of creative content to discover. Though Oblivion may now be dwarfed by the success and popularity of its sequel, Skyrim, it remains uniquely captivating and highly immersive in its own right. Sure, you'll hear the same voice actors again and again, bear witness to the same awkward conversations and interactions between NPCs, cringe at the optional third person perspective (try to jump around in third person with a straight face), and find fault with some of the outdated game mechanics. But you'll also be treated to a lush, pure fantasy experience, an immensely memorable soundtrack, the thrill of exploring the vibrant province of Cyrodiil, and the freedom to play however you play. In my humble opinion, Oblivion is an essential gaming experience. Not perfect, but uniquely timeless. There's just something magic about it that's hard to put into words. Simultaneously encompassing and intimate, Oblivion is a must-buy.			",93,50,1,37,4,1,2

And there is also the awesome Mage  but it is a tough class. There are TONS of caves, dungeons, settlements, and cities, and lots of side quests. The main quest is probably roughly 4 hours for those who just want to beat the game fast. Id suggest getting all the expansions including DLCs (Downloadable Content) and 3 mods for it including: Darker Dungeons, Harvest Flora, and the most important; Martigen Monster Mod. My rating to this is probably a 9 / 10. Thanks for reading my recommendation :D			",238,44,5,33,25,2,43

												I originally brought this game in disk form years ago and have racked up hundreds of hours on it, there are plenty of mods out there for this game and there is even a unofficial patch that improves stuff in the world. The story is really rather good, and there are also plenty of side quests that can be done aswell. The game gives you the freedome of choosing what to do and when, which it does pretty well without making you fail a quest for picking it up and not doing it right away which is useful at times. The only thing I did find annoying sometimes, is the Daedra gates that seem to open everywhere. But I also like going into them to get the stones and to use the stones to enchant my gear with. I find it funny to give my enchanted gear wacky names sometimes which also add's to the freedome of choice too.Also the difficulty can be adjusted really rather well, with no ""Easy-medium-hard"" preset just moving the difficulty bar from left to right (Left being easier-right being harder) it really does give you full control over the game! Overall I would say this game is a good buy and the expansions that come with the game of the year version make it a pretty nice and complete set. I think this game is deffonately worth a look, especially considering the mods it has to offer!			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Oblivion offers a massive world with tons of places to explore and lots of freedom to play as you like.Unfortunately, the vanilla game is incredibly buggy and unstable, and the leveling system is quite possibly the worst I've ever seen in a game--if you want to be a mighty warrior that uses warhammers and heavy armor, you'd better be ready to spend most of your time using swords and shields, light armor, and spells because if you don't your stats will stagnate as your level (and difficulty of opponents) skyrockets.  You can also expect to reach a point where every run-of-the-mill bandit you meet is decked out in end-game gear, making acquiring massive riches as simple as a quick walk down the road.Fortunately, the game has a modding community with a rich and ongoing history that has managed to create mods to fix everything wrong and add things you never knew you were missing.  The huge selection of mods for this game let you replace the leveling system, overhaul enemies, add much greater variety in equipment, improve battle mechanics, greatly enhance graphics and sound, stabilize the game, fix literally thousands of bugs, add new quests and areas, modify the game economy, bash open locks, replace the GUI, and so much more.In short, this game is certainly capable of giving countless hours of entertainment, provided you're willing to go to the trouble of finding and (correctly) installing a number of mods, depending on one's tastes.  Otherwise, you should probably just go for Skyrim.			",349,151,5,48,40,3,38

												I destroyed this game on my xbox.No honestly, like I did absolutely everything you can do in that game.Now I only have 20 or so hours on the PC version, but I can already tell that it is soo much better than the console version. Why's that? Mods my friend, mods.Mods are a total pain to install in this game if I'm being honest, but the payoff is incredible. I have mods that improve performance, and make the characters and landscapes look stunning again, even though this game is ancient at this point. Add on the fact that there are hundreds of content mods, and I'm sold.Now the gameplay is the only thing that really shows its age. Having played Skyrim and loving it, I couldn't help but miss the warm rolling hills of Cyrodil, but the combat in Skyrim is just so much better. There are a few mods to help, but it still isn't close to the other's intensity.Also magic casting in this game is straight up horrid.If you like having a neverending list of things to do, you really can't go wrong here. Like I said, the game is old, but mods really make it shine again.Pick it up for a low price during a sale.Also I might add a list of mods that you should download to really make this game feel new again.

												Oh boy where to begin, I have only been playing the Elder Scrolls series for 3 years, but at this point I am sure that these games are considered amoung the best RPGs out there. The sheer amount of lore and story put into every quest, character, and location is overwhelmingly in depth and greatly thought out. RPGs have alway been my favortie, but games like Oblivion are doing it right. It succedes in every way an RPG should.			",33,1,0,10,1,0,0

												The elder scrolls IV Oblivion is still and will always be one of my all time favourite TES games. This was the first elder scrolls game i ever played and in a instant i fell in love with this game, the massive world, stunning combat, beautiful graphics, and near endless customization options made my jaw drop and instantly dumped hundreds of hours into this game on the ps3 version. I never played a RPG quite like this before, the closest thing was Fable. Now that i have got a gaming PC i bought it from steam along with all the previous DLC that i could not get on the ps3 version. This game is a all time classic and a legend among the RPG genre in my opinion. If you utterly love the RPG genre you cannot afford to pass this game up. 10/10 MASTERPIECE.			",110,11,0,16,19,1,13

												This is a Western RPG essential! though you don't see my over 1000 hours played on xbox you must take my word for it. This game immersed me for hours! I would sit there playing it and then look at the clock and it would be four hors later. That being said it is a mssive time sink. So now I willtell you what you will like and what you will be looking for if you want to play a game like this.Pros: - Massive world- Plenty of quests- A very free and sometimes terrifying character creation system- A huge Modding community, but does not support steam workshop. Quarl's Texture pack is a must! The nexus is great too!- A brillant sense of adventure! I felt like exploring and continuing which is brillant!- A great starter RPG. It's a great RPG to start with!- The emperor is PATRICK STEWART! HE IS THE ONLY UNIQUE VOICE ACTOR AND HE DIES VERY QUICKLY BUT HE'S STILL PATRICK STEWART!Now heres the part where I give you what is not so great about the game, because honestly no game is perfect no matter how much the rosey glasses of nostalgia say they are.Cons- Combat sucks. Theres no two was about it its really drab and boring and redundant it gets the job done though. Luckily there are mods that fix that! They're just a google search and a little research away! - The cities can feel a bit small and under populated. The biggest city in the empire only has about 30 or so people. Though the issue is prominent in most Bethesda games it's still an issue that deserve acknowledgement.- There are only 18 voice actors so it can be a bit imerssion breaking when you here people talking to each other with the same voice. Also the ambiant speech can be very redundant after while but tha might just be because I've played it for so much time.- The system for making people like you is actually rather comical. Just a few presses of a button and you have new best friend!Though there are certianly more little things wrong with this game such as how it is very buggy (Unnoffical oblivion patch fixes this issue and is easily installed on the nexus) It is still a game worth buying UNLESS ANY OF THOSE CONS ARE SO OFF PUTTING YOU DON'T WANT IT! However I have to say this is a brilliant game and is certianly worth buying! The DLC is awesome so if you get the chance and its on sale for oh say 5$ or 7.50$ it is an easy insta-buy. You will get your money's worth I promise, or it will sit in your back log because ya know steam. So all and all a good purchase!			",144,22,3,21,13,0,12

												Id like to first start off this bye saying The elder scrolls IV is indeed my favorite elder scrolls. Im not exactly sure how long its been out , but i have been playing it for a very long time. I remember sitting in my grandmas back room playing it on xbox 360 for countless hours. And then about two years ago when i joined the pc gaming master race, i got for pc . i only have about 54  hours into the game on pc, but ive played it alot more than 54 hours. I have heard many say that the graphics are terrible , and the voice actors are too limited, but this is kind of expexted with a game as old as this. But for voice acting , at the time, i think bethesda could have deffinately done much better. The story however is amazing. I think the game over all is a 9/10 for me. I love this game :]			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												When I first played Skyrim, I wondered, ""What are the other Elder Scrolls games like?"". My brother told me about this game, and I wanted to play it. When I first started playing, I expected inferior graphics but that would not deter me. What I found was great story, interest mechanics, and it truly felt like an RPG. Skyrim was indeed good, but it lacked some great RPG elements that Oblivion had. I felt that Oblivion had more choices, which is a staple of TES series. The DLCs were great, so interesting, it made me love the game more. Skyrim had rushed DLCs. I finished Dragonborn in about an hour. I wouldn't say this game is a masterpiece, but it is definitely worth adding to your collection.			",30,2,0,10,9,0,3

												This game, in my opinion, launched The Elder Scrolls series into the new era of gaming. Starting with Elder Scrolls: Morrowind, Bethesda had saught to not only utilize consoles, but return home to its original platform the PC. This game is the epitome of the return home, beautifully designed, with a sandbox for players to follow their own paths, Elder Scrolls: Oblivion GOTY edition is a must. I recommend this game to anybody that doesn't want to be bound by the rules of regular RPGs but rather takes the story and places it in your hand.			",6,1,0,5,0,0,0

												I absolutely love this game.  The world is massive and dynamic.  The main quest is plenty of fun, but there are so many excellent sidequests and places to explore, I totally forgot about it on my first playthrough.  Every thing that Skyrim is lacking is in this game.  Sure the graphics aren't great, and the combat is a bit clunky, but I think this adds to it's charm.  Buy this game.  You won't be disappointed.(Also, the reason I have so few hours logged is because I mostly played this game on Xbox 360 back in the day.)			",45,3,0,9,2,0,6

												Don't let my hours on Steam fool you, I have played this game for thousands of hours on various platforms, (PS3, 360, PC). I started out on PS3 and I absolutely adored it, at the time it was revolutionary and amazing. I have 1,200 hours on just my first character on PS3, and that was without doing some questlines. The game features such amazing quests, characters, locations, roleplaying elements, dungeons, loot, guilds, etc. And it feels like a vibrant, breathing, real world. (Although a little bit on the derpy side.) No other game I have played have I felt like I can live inside of a city inside the game, (except maybe the Witcher 3, just because of the sheer size and realism of cities like Novigrad). This is my favorite Elder Scrolls game (although I still love all of them, Daggerfall is among one of my favorites as well as Morrowind), and one of my favorite games ever. The graphics are slightly dated but have a charm to them, the faces are ugly and the landscapes look a bit like a painting more than a game, but in my honest opinion the landscapes in this game hold up better than Skyrims. It looks gorgeous, (save for the characters and some dated textures). The humongous modding community Bethesda games is now known for started becoming huge with this game, there is an abundance of great mods. From new weapons, armor, quests, cities, and even entirely new guilds and dozens of hours long quests. The modding community isn't as big as it is for Skyrim, but it still has an overwhelming amount of mods. The dynamic AI is both amazing (at the time it came out), and absolutely hilarious. Every NPC in the game can have a conversation with every other NPC in the game, and this can result in some hilariously stupid conversations. Although it is funny and stupid and doesn't work how the Devs intended it, I still think it adds to the world. Hearing people have dynamic conversations as you walk through a city going on a quest or to the inn is very immsersive and adds so much more. The guilds and questlines in this game are insanely good. If you were impressed by Skyrim's guilds they don't hold anything on Oblivion's. I was frankly disappointed by Skyrim's guilds (and NPCs) compared to Oblivions. The Mage's Guild, Dark Brotherhood, and Thieve's Guild especially are really good. And Oblivion even has minor (guilds) you can join such as the Knights of the Thorn or the Order of The Virtuous Blood. Every thing I've mentioned so far you can avoid and not play, most people won't even come across all of the guilds in their first or second or even third playthrough, and they are all optional. Now then, onto the main quest. Oblivion (in my opinion) features the best Main Story besides Morrowind in the Elder Scrolls franchise. You are a prisoner (big surprise) and you are in the wrong cell at the wrong time and adventure ensues. That is all I will tell you, because I enjoyed Oblivion's main quest a lot and wish you to experience it on your own. This game's story progession works somewhat similar to Skyrim's. In terms of in Skyrim the Dragons don't show up until you do a certain quest and kill one, the same thing happens in Oblivion. When you destroy the first Oblivion gate, that is when they start showing up around the map. The great thing about Oblivion though is that you can easily avoid the main quest much more so than Skyrim's. In Oblivion you can leave the sewers and go anywhere and do anything you want without someone going, ""You have to go here and do this!"" Like Skyrim does, in Skyrim if you go to Whiterun you are basically thrusted to Dragonsreach to advance the plot, if you do the starter Civil War quest you are thrusted to Whiterun to do the main quest. Oblivion never does this to you, you hear about the events happening and it might remind you to do the main quest, but it never thrusts you to the main quest without your approval. Oblivion's expansions add a lot as well, Shivering Isles is known as one of the best expansion packs ever, and I can't deny that. Knights of the Nine is also really good. Now onto the gameplay, Oblivion features the standard mediocre combat with hits that feel like you're using a nerf sword, except for one exception. The magic in Oblivion is extremely fun and diverse, unlike Skyrim it doesn't take up a hand. You can be a battleaxe using, fireball casting, robe wearing assassin. You can also make your own spells in Oblivion, (after a certain Mages Guild quest). The character creation is what to expect from Elder Scrolls, various facial customization, (except beards. . . C'mon Bethesda really?) and all the races. And let's not forget what Skyrim left out, classes. There are preset classes and custom classes you yourself can make and name. They don't restrict what you can do or use. They just enhance your starting attributes and skills, and make certain attributes and skills easier to level up in. Overall Oblivion is an amazing RPG and an amazing game in general. I would recommend it to almost anyone.			",41,21,0,51,3,0,19

												You'll find this hard to believe but I found this game better then Skyrim, you might ask are you mad how can oblivion be better then skyrim? well theres multiple things why. In skyrim it was all gray and the color scheme was mostly the same very dark but i do understand why of course, i enjoyed oblivion for its very epic color scheme. all the eye popping colors really added to the experiance. I enjoyed the story a lot since you went in hell practically and it provided challenge where Skyrim didnt even when my difficulty was high I was able to breeze past everything like no problem. The story of course was very good but so was Skyrim's so i cant exactly say whats better, skyrim did have better graphics and voice acting and exploration. but oblivion had better guild story lines, better enemies( more of a challenge) better expansions, and better mods. so both games has its pros and cons but for a challenging, fun, eyepopping adventure I suggest Oblivion.

												It has Patrick Stewart in it. What more could you want? Seriously, buy this game if you're even remotely into PC gaming. It's an epic RPG about an escaped convict who loves to roam around the countryside, collecting followers, and punching the holy canoli out of anything and everything that moves, speaks, or looks remotely interesting.

												The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion was my first game into the world of Bethesda's Legendary World of RPG gaming. The stories of the Main Quest, Mages Guild, Fighters Guild are my favorites as the Thieves Guild and Dark Brotherhood are exciting.My first experience with this game goes back to the PS3 Game of the Year edition and I would play it non-stop and I still do on both PS3 and PC. I hope all of you find this game as exciting as I do. Of course, I pay more attention to the story than that of the gameplay mechanics.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Every time I load this game up, and the beautiful Cryodill atmosphere renders and the music starts to play, I lose track of everything around me. My girlfriend ceases to matter, stopping to eat becomes a torturous experience, and yesterday I found out that Osama Bin Laden had been killed (not really but you get the point). This game and it's sequel, Skyrim, are a momentous step forward in humanity's quest to become couch-dwelling creatures. The gameplay is nothing exactly new or innovative, just standard hack-and-slash-and-cast spells, but it is made tolerable and enjoyable when added with the overall package that is Oblivion.The atmosphere is where this game shines. Set in a medieval European setting with valleys, forests, mountains, swamps, and gates to Hell, this game succeeds at pulling you in completely, with an epic soundtrack to complete it all.The storyline is adequate and does give you a sense of purspo as you are playing.All in all a very good game			",16,1,0,5,3,0,5

												This is, in my own humble opinion, one of the best RPGs of all time. From lush grass lands, to swampy wetlands, to snow covered tundra this game has all of the terrestrial elements a gamer could ask for. It shows its age, of course. Nonetheless, it is a graphically beautiful as well as beautiful  in its story line. This game has some of the best lore I have ever experienced. The characters are surprisingly immersive, the music is great. The comabt is somewhat dated, but is perfectly functional, effective, and somewhat challenging to master. There are a myriad of different kinds of quests, which sets this game apart from its younger brother: Skyrim. There are so many places to be, so many things to explore, one will never get bored with this game. I promise 200+ hours of gameplay including main quests. I seriously recoomend this game to really any kind of gamer. For some it may be boring and slow. But for those that like to take there time sometimes, this can be the game for you.

												Oblivion is easily in the top five games for me in terms of TIME INVESTED. I have played and modded the hell out of it over countless avatars and playthroughs. Morrowind had the best gameplay, Skyrim was the prettiest and most immersive, but the WORLD of Oblivion is still my favorite hands down. Where Skyrim feels detached and lacking life (especially in it's city design, Oblivion's Cyrodiil felt lush and alive and worth fighting for. If you enjoy Bethesda RPGs (Fallout 3/NV, Skyrim, etc), I suggest you pick this title up and apply some of the mild graphical improvement mods out there. Cyrodiil is the world I most love in the Elder Scrolls universe, even if Skyrim is a more polished and entertaining title.			",376,71,8,65,59,0,103

												Being a prisoner in the Elder Scrolls series is a favorable thing. Again, you start as a prisoner rotting in a jail cell, are freed by random chance, and become a renowned hero and leader of multiple guilds, if you so choose. The main quest chain is exceptionally short, but the real fun is found in the many, many side quests and player-made content and mods. Everyone in Cyrodiil has a chubby face and the khajiit and argonians were given plantigrade legs as opposed to the digitigrade legs they had before. PCs and NPCs aside, the environments, dungeons and cities in this game look fantastic. The soundtrack for the game does well in drawing you into the world and was done by Jeremy Soule, who also made the soundtrack for Morrowind and one of my favorite RPGs, Secret of Evermore. Just because you own Skyrim doesn't mean you shouldn't also own and play Oblivion!			",184,32,0,43,4,1,7

												If your a fan of RPGS and Love skyrim, This is for you! This game Is ( even though it was a previous game) 10x Better than skyrim . They screwed everyone over by taking away tons of Really lovable features out of the TES series, namely spell crafting and moddability. Sure skyrim can be modded BUT skyrim doesnt allow their mods to  be very script heavy, making the mods for skyrim very small and stupid in comparison as the mods for oblivion are the best of any game I have ever seen. Some adding in morrowind and valenwood and elswyer and some adding in quests that simply go beyond modding and add full deep enthralling quest lines that make you want more. Other than that skyrim got SCREWED over by dlcs not adding NEARLY as much since the elderscrolls Oblivion dlcs added a HUGE continent compared to skyrims weak and pathetic island( dragonborn DLC). Though many of the dlcs in oblivion were very stupid and added little it still has way more content than skyrim could ever have.			",164,21,2,35,17,3,28

												When I first played Skyrim, I wondered, ""What are the other Elder Scrolls games like?"". My brother told me about this game, and I wanted to play it. When I first started playing, I expected inferior graphics but that would not deter me. What I found was great story, interest mechanics, and it truly felt like an RPG. Skyrim was indeed good, but it lacked some great RPG elements that Oblivion had. I felt that Oblivion had more choices, which is a staple of TES series. The DLCs were great, so interesting, it made me love the game more. Skyrim had rushed DLCs. I finished Dragonborn in about an hour. I wouldn't say this game is a masterpiece, but it is definitely worth adding to your collection.			",30,2,0,10,9,0,3

I recomend this game over skyrim if you want to get into the genre. It has a great storyline and the gameplay (arguably) is better than The Elder Scrolls 3 Morrowind. There is so much to be said about this game but i wont bore you. Buy the game, beat it, and then install a few mods to make the game even more immersive. Happy Gaming			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Well, where to begin? Oh, I know! Let´s begin at the beginning....Back when the only true games I played were LEGO games, I heard of a game where you can play as cats, lizards, orcs, elves and humans, of course. My curiosity made me ask so many questions and I imagined how I am already playing it and bowing at its glory... Well, I expected something bigger and I was dissapointed at first. Perhaps it was because the only thing I could do was running, attacking and jumping.After I learned some info, I revisited this game... Now I knew how to interract, I knew how certain things work and I had great time. After more than year, I revisited it and BOOM! I bought it!So let´s talk ´bout some cons and pros...Graphics, environment, atmosphere and musicSpeaking of graphics, Oblivion is from 2006 which is a fact you can´t ignore. Game looks OK and some parts of it look great. Textures are kinda bad but when you play RPG you should focus on other things than looks. Reason why many people make fun of this masterpiece is NPC models. Some look atrocious. I am used to them but I can imagine it can turn some people away, although these people should expect worse graphics and models from 2006 game. Environment and atmosphere are made nearly perfectly. The game has a fantasy feel, dungeons are creepy and frustrating, cities are living and beautiful, and all these are so great mainly thanks to wonderful music. Check out some of them and you´ll see.Verdict: game looks amazing and runs OK on medium details. Despite being old, system requirements are quite high.Combat, controls, mechanics and difficultyNo matter how much I love this game, combat is horrific. One of few things made better in its successor is combat.Combat oriented character has very little chance on medium and higher. Even as an experienced player, I still struggle.Magic is super OP. Example : you start off with about 100 magicka. You start with spell that deals 5. Early, you can get a weapon that does 2 damage. Yep. It has limited durability and needs you to be up close. The highest damage weapon is Amber Hammer with max Blunt skill. It will do 33. At level 10, 30 damage is a crappy spell for you. At level 50, 33 weapon is a dream. Combat is dumb because when you encounter combat NPC and fight it, it is going to look like this: Hit, stagger, hit, stagger, heal, hit, stagger, block, enemy staggered, hit, heal, he dead. You´ll get the grip eventually but it is dumb and unfair IMO. Stealth characters will have the most fun. Guilds will be reviewed later. Stealth is really enjoyable and satisfying. Controls are good but if you are used to Skyrim, you might be confused- no sprint, dual-wield or shield bash...Alchemy and enchanting and spellcrafting are fun but bit complicated. Difficulty is really high and needs you to think. Sometimes it is too much and just as every Bethesda RPG, it has this stupid scaling system : The higher level you are, the harder game is, which in fact makes no sense...Quests, main story, guilds, charactersOh yeah! If there is a game with great and diverse quests, it is Oblivion. Quests may seem like dungeon raiding but they usually turn into discovering a cult of necromancers or finding a powerful artifact... Or just haunted ship with ghosts. People in this game are quite weird so they make you do crazy random sh*t like taking staff that constantly summons imps and return it to shrine of a Daedra... Or jsut go into a dream and complete four difficult tasks... Or... Ah play it yourself. Main story by writing is not worst in the series... But by quests and by the fact it is annoying, it is the worst gameplay wise. A big flaw on a beautiful diamond... My recommendation: don´t play it. It doesn´t give you many important items and is annoying, difficult and spawns Gates of Oblivion (if you believe dragons are the most annoying enemies in this series, play oblivion) (and if you believe Daedra are the most annoying enemies in this series, play Morrowind, these Cliff Racers are gonna drive you mad!) Guilds are best in series, just like quests! Be it Mage or Thieves Guild, they are all pretty good with Warriors being the worst one. Dark Brotherhood is a masterpiece. I won´t talk long about NPCs. Some are annoying and dull, some are memorable and great- Lucien Lachance, Sheogorath, Martin Spetim himself, Gray Fox and many others. Voice acting is often criticized but I like it. Wes Johnson is absolutely unmatched. Others are good but get annoying...The last thing-DLCsLittle ones are short and almost unnoticable. Knight of the Nine give you the best heavy set in the game and look great.Shivering Isles is a different story though. It is like a full, separate game. Since Sheogorath is most-likely the best daedric prince, this is a fairly unique experience. Flesh golems, people asking you for carrots and then yelling : Ni-Ni-Ni are quite normal in this DLC. Story is greta, Sheogorath and Jyggalag are good too and quests are better than base game. Items here are also pretty great. Would recommend playing this DLC after everything else.Verdict : buy the deluxe edition, tiny DLCs don´t matter but they are fun and give you some items. Knights of the Nine are OK. Shivering Isles is a masterpiece. Base game as well.Tiny DLCs-6/10KotN-7/10Shivering Isles-10/10-must playBase game-9/10- must playOverall you must buy this masterpiece. One of the best games ever made. Worth every dollar. Or Euro. Or whatever. And I think I don´t have to mention how amazing Elder Scrolls lore is, so if you enjoy good lore, chceck it out.PS: If you happen to find any grammar mistakes, please let me know.			",55,6,0,5,2,0,0

												I remember learning about the Elder Scrolls series from my older brother, who purchased Morrowind on the original Xbox. I was never really interested in playing it because I was 7 years old at the time, but I always liked watching him play. About 3 years later, a friend of my brothers brought over another Elder Scrolls game, this one called ""Oblivion"". We all played it together, and I participated this time. And I fell in love with it. I still remember times from when I was 11 years old, all the lights turned off in my house, nothin' but me and my Xbox in my living room, playing Oblivion for 6 straight hours. Time well spent...Elder Scrolls, for those who are unaware, is an Action RPG. Imagine Fallout set back in Medieval times, but way better because there's swords and magic! There's not a single complaint I have about Oblivion; it's damn near flawless, at least in my opinion. There's a bit of bugginess here and there, such as getting stuck on mountains, disappearing items/NPC's, etc. But that's a Bethesda game for you! Jokes aside though, the number of times those kinds of glitches have happened to me are few and far between over 7 years of playing this game. The level-up system is fantastic, combat is so good, great set of sidequests, and you can even go to literally HELL.The one Elder Scrolls game everyone knows is Skyrim. But for those who have only played Skyrim and no other Elder Scrolls game, I strongly encourage you to give Oblivion a fair try. You will not be disappointed.9.5/10			",119,12,0,24,8,1,21

												Ah! The Nostalga Demons. This game is one of the First Elder Scrolls games that I ever played and no less on the original X-Box. It's amazingly diverse and smart with the choices in game play, with the DLC's every thing down to Spells is customizable.  Silver Isles is BY far my favorite Elder Scrolls expansion. WHY? Because you become friggen Sheogorath and you literally SAVE a relm of Oblivion.			",183,25,0,57,3,0,9

I would Definetly reccomend this to someone looking for a memorable experience and an easy way into the ELDER SCROLLS.If you like discovering hidden places and loot in a beautiful world filled with fantasy and love. The sounds the music the ambiance, is to die for. I COULD LOSE MYSELF IN THIS WORLD FOR HOURS. Just wanting to see the vibrant colors and wildlife. It isnt the best game ever but, it is so worth it to buy and experience.THE FINAL VERDICT IS 9/10 Almost flawless for its time and even now is still great.Would strongly recommend to anyone in the mood for a deep story filled with magic and demons to find and fought to a sweet sweet end.

												Buggy, Ugly, and Deeply Flawed.Yet when using my playtime as a rubric, I've enjoyed this game more than 90% of my game library.So what keeps whales like me coming back to this title?  Let me go through the pros first.  These largely compare the game to others in the series, but can be taken on their own.- Great bombastic musical score.- Incredible Mod List (although it takes some dedication to getting everything to work.  If you don't want to download from third party sites, you can discount this point.)- Customization of characters, from their bone structure (though a character's height is race locked) , to their hair cut, to the spells they cast, and the skills they employ.  Patrick Stewart will even ask your birth sign, which isn't entirely out of the ordinary for those in regular contact with him, but I digress.- Big world.  Contrary to what many Morrowind fans say (and I'm one of them), the main cities, while sharing some characteristics do tend to stand out with their own architecture and style.- There's no radiant ai or refilling quests (without mods that is...) but you probably won't be able to complete all of them anyway in under a hundred hours of playtime.  One quest or one dungeon crawl can take over an hour.  Quests are largely self-defined as in Morrowind.- Elder Scrolls lore, but that's largely subjective and a matter of personal taste.- Bigger, less stupidly easy-to-navigate dungeons than Skyrim.- Combat feels more fluid than Skyrim.  But there's no way natively to unnock your arrows after you've taken aim.- Spells can be used while using two handed weapons and shields.- No dual weilding.Cons:- No dual weilding.- A quest system that gives less in the way of directions than morrowind, and as a result relies heavily on quest markers.- Ugly, potato-faced npcs and pcs if you aren't good at character customization.- Spell creation is less complex than morrowind or daggerfall, but still better than the abortion of magic in Skyrim.  And better balanced into the bargain.  So again, not really a con as much as a comparison.- DLC that if checked when you play the game, will inundate you with messages as soon as you're free of the tutoria... er, beginning sequence.-  A game that almost requires mods to be playable for most isn't what most would call a good game.  Yet I've rarely enjoyed a game for long that didn't allow for modding of vanilla.  Subjective.- Mods aren't always professional quality, and can destroy either your game or your computer if you load too many or the wrong ones.- No proper beards.It's a long list, but in the end, I've enjoyed the game enough to give it a reluctant recommendation.

												One of my favorite games, and one of the greatest games ever. Buy the Deluxe Game of the Year Edition as well, the extra DLC is pretty cool. I highly recommend this game to any fan of the Elder Scrolls series, and to any fans of fantasy RPGs. While the graphic aren't amazing (this game is from 2006), they still looks pretty good when bumped up to Ultra on 1080P. The combat is a bit floaty, but the story, characters, and interesting quests will keep you coming back for more. Again, I can not recommend this game enough. Buy it. ",156,10,3,14,14,2,31

												Oblivion is worth every penny, i wasted my hole childe hood on this game. It has the best storys for the dark brotherhood,thieves giuld and mages giuld. the level system is slower then skyrim.but it made you feel at first weak, but after a while you start to feel stronger and stronger. And that gose for the enemys as well. In skyrim the bandits have a level cap, and if you want a challeng from them. you would need to get a mod to fix that one thing. but you will not see that in oblivion for a vary long time. bandits in oblivion will gain better weapons and armor, such as orcish to deadric armor and weapons. the same gose for the deadra, as you level you will encounter harder and cooler looking ones such as Spider Daedra,atronachs,daedroths and the most badass looking one in the gang the Xivilai. the game has a old school mmo rpg feeling to it. and it onley adds to it,because once you start the game you will never come back.11/24/16still playing the game and i cant rate this more then i can, just go and play it			",49,3,0,9,1,1,2

												Never fails to satisfy.  Beautiful and immersive.  Best game soundtrack I have ever heard.  Clocked in many hours of it on Xbox360 and my old PC.  There were literally times when I would just walk around and look at stuff.  The game is massive with so much to do.  I honestly can't remember if I even completed the main quest.  All the Oblivion gates that just pop up and you think ""not in my land!' and you just have to go and close it.  I know, I am rambling without explaining anything.  Whatever.  Jeremy Soule did a great job with the soundtrack.  So good, I downloaded it and I listen to it periodically when I go on walks.

												This is an amazing gmae, one of the best I've ever played, nice graphics but not too over the top, although character customization could use some work, this game embodies everything you would want in a fantasy open world RPG. I would recommend this game to any fantasy fans who love open world games. In a way this is my favourite game in the Elder Scrolls Series, but in other ways not, it had lots of features i wouldv'e hoped to see in Skyrim that they didnt put in, such as a combat arena, but in other ways Skyrim is better. Although I think skyrim has more of a nordic feel to it instead of a fantasy feel, like when i play Skyrim I often think it's a history lesson about nordic myths, but when I play Oblivion you get a true fantasy feel. I may not have played this game to much on the PC as I find it works a bit better on a console, which is what I mainly play it on, as I have had numerous glitches while playing on the PC.

												The first time I loaded this up, I had a chat with Patrick Stewart, got my head around the first quest, and sidestepped out of prison. Outside, I had a quick first peak at the world map. I turned it off and didn't go back for a year. I'll be honest, I was a little bit scared. Starting Oblivion is like discovering that your garage is packed to the roof with heroin, and then saying, ""I'll just have a little taste. Just one little go."" The game is so huge, it's ridiculous. And the content is all so brilliant! That's why I've nominated Oblivion for my very own Award. The 'This game works out at 3p an hour to play' Award. Go play, if you have a few hundred hours spare.

It is extremely fun, and even now has beautiful graphics (better than a lot of current games). The ambiance of the game makes, and the very well written quests, makes up for the small amount of glitches and flawed leveling system. Besides all that, anyone that has played the game will tell you that Shivering Isles is a crazy cool expansion pack, and is the best thing ever. Buy this game! :D			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												If you haven't played Oblivion yet, then now's the time.  Although it has been recently eclipsed by Skyrim (it's sequel), this game has a lot to offer, from a very dedicated and active modding community to 100+ of gameplay.  If you happen to own the previous Elder Scrolls game, Morrowind, you can also mod Oblivion to include a ""Oblivionized"" version of Morrowind (lovingly called ""Morrowbliviion"") that essentially lets you play through Morrowind with the Oblivion engine and interface.If you scratching your head still, maybe you need an overall idea of the game.  Basically, you are a nameless person who starts with nothing.  You have before you a plethora of options, not just following the main quest.  You can explore, fight, and interact with 100s of locations and characters in virtually any order you want.The only real drawback is that Oblivion has a leveling system that adjusts monsters to your level.  Overall, though, this game is a great deal and provides hours of fun.			",128,64,0,13,13,1,17

												Oblivion has a beautiful soundtrack, as the other Elder Scrolls games do. And Cyrodiil is itself beautiful.Oblivion is a work of art, each quest is interesting (excluding fetch quests, or escort missions... nobody really likes those) and the province of Cyrodiil is huge and can be explored to your hearts content.The lore with each and every Elder Scrolls game is deep and detailed, it is practically as if it were real. And Oblivion is no exception to this. Learning about the daedric princes, gods and different characters in the game is interesting and fun, and living a life in this fantasy world is so much better than real life. I would chose Nirn over Earth any day.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I've played all the Elder Scrolls games since Morrowind was released and I can honestly say that Oblivion was my favorite. Morrowind was by far the most advanced and in depth in the RPG genre and was more story driven, but Oblivion was the elder scroll game which I devoted the most playtime.It's graphics don't compare to Skyrim, but what do you expect for just short of a decade gap in technology. The graphics Oblivion has on max rendering and max settings (which can EASILY be run by modern graphics cards) is not cringeworthly to say the least. I still to this day prefer Oblivion to Skyrim for story content, modability, and GUI and skill advancement. It's truly a beautiful RPG game and is worth picking up when you're bored or looking for an RPG to play.10/10 would waste my childhood on this game again.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Otherwise a great, classic RPG and a must-have for all fans of The Elder Scrolls games and lore. The only bad things I have to say about this game are that it was still really buggy, even after the final official patch, and that it has a funny way of scaling up the main quest difficulty way too fast if you plan on leveling your non-combat skills, like i did. Both of these can, of course, be remedied with fan-made mods and unofficial patches, but still you'd expect more effort from a giant like Bethesda. The DLC is a joke, though, but as a fan I still wanted to get everything Oblivion so I opted in for the GOTY edition. If you don't fancy the game or the dilly dally wonka doodles that much, you're better off with the regular edition of this game, if that helps you save a few bucks.			",42,9,0,16,1,0,1

												I remember when I first popped Oblivion into my Xbox 360 so many years ago. It truly was an amazing experience to be immersed into the wonderous land of Cyrodiil, which embodied a landscape all fantasy lovers have wished to explore in some fashion. This game is a masterpiece. Many may say Skyrim is the best RPG out there, but I can assure you that the world that Oblivion has you enter is far more gripping and immersive. This game was literally my 2011 summer life. Play it if you have not before. You won't regret it.			",134,17,1,21,16,1,27

												Oblivion is easily in the top five games for me in terms of TIME INVESTED. I have played and modded the hell out of it over countless avatars and playthroughs. Morrowind had the best gameplay, Skyrim was the prettiest and most immersive, but the WORLD of Oblivion is still my favorite hands down. Where Skyrim feels detached and lacking life (especially in it's city design, Oblivion's Cyrodiil felt lush and alive and worth fighting for. If you enjoy Bethesda RPGs (Fallout 3/NV, Skyrim, etc), I suggest you pick this title up and apply some of the mild graphical improvement mods out there. Cyrodiil is the world I most love in the Elder Scrolls universe, even if Skyrim is a more polished and entertaining title.			",376,71,8,65,59,0,103

												No, it isn't Morrowind, sorry. And in my opinion, it isn't broken without mods. If you want to, you can mod it to hell and back, but I played the entire game (all guilds, and main quest) for the first time just last year, unmodded, and it was excellent. Just let go of all the misconceptions and crap people talk about it, and just try and get into it and enjoy it for what it is. It's a good game. I had to play differently than I normally would, to really enjoy myself. Played a brawler sort, with a two handed sword, who would rush people. Also used Nighteye pretty much constantly, when in dungeons. Maybe some people like the creepiness. I, however, prefer to see, so I can rush my enemies easier, before they can get their spells off, or arrows fired, etc. Great game. Give it a real chance, and you just might like it.

												Let me get the bad out of the way. This game has serious mechanical issues regarding levelling, scaling and how stat advancement is handled. I has some minor performance issues, and it is in dire need of a heap of mods to improve facial appearance of characters, textures etc. I recommend Oblivion Character Overhaul, natural environments, qarl's textures, and the unofficial patch. Enjoy the game, and in particular, the quests, best part of the game overall, since combat is nothing to write home about.

It has to be experienced to be understood. Or maybe it's just nostalgia talking. Either way, I recommend this game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												I started playing skyrim on x-box a few years ago.  I didnt fully know that it was part of a series until about 3 months of playing.  I then bought skyrim on steam and unlocked the majestic world of pc gaming. I actually only really decided to play the other games the series at this point.  After a few hours of fiddling around with DOS emulators I got arena and daggerfall up and running.  I played through these games and still didnt have my appetite for elder scrolls satisfied.  Morrowing proved to be extremely fun, but nowhere near as amazing as oblivion.  of course ive played skyrim.  ESO appeared awesome but let me tell you its not good. Ive played through the entire elder scrolls series (I forgot to mention playing redguard and battlespire, which where fun but tiny compared to all of the others) so you can trust me when i say that oblivion is a must play.  second in the series only to skyrim			",16,0,1,7,0,0,0

												I remember learning about the Elder Scrolls series from my older brother, who purchased Morrowind on the original Xbox. I was never really interested in playing it because I was 7 years old at the time, but I always liked watching him play. About 3 years later, a friend of my brothers brought over another Elder Scrolls game, this one called ""Oblivion"". We all played it together, and I participated this time. And I fell in love with it. I still remember times from when I was 11 years old, all the lights turned off in my house, nothin' but me and my Xbox in my living room, playing Oblivion for 6 straight hours. Time well spent...Elder Scrolls, for those who are unaware, is an Action RPG. Imagine Fallout set back in Medieval times, but way better because there's swords and magic! There's not a single complaint I have about Oblivion; it's damn near flawless, at least in my opinion. There's a bit of bugginess here and there, such as getting stuck on mountains, disappearing items/NPC's, etc. But that's a Bethesda game for you! Jokes aside though, the number of times those kinds of glitches have happened to me are few and far between over 7 years of playing this game. The level-up system is fantastic, combat is so good, great set of sidequests, and you can even go to literally HELL.The one Elder Scrolls game everyone knows is Skyrim. But for those who have only played Skyrim and no other Elder Scrolls game, I strongly encourage you to give Oblivion a fair try. You will not be disappointed.9.5/10			",119,12,0,24,8,1,21

												The Elder Scrolls is one of the most entertaining games possible. It boasts such open-world diversity and contains such packed amounts of Story. Being that many people tend to play a game for completion, this game makes it so that it's basically impossible because of how much there is to complete, and even if you finish the quests involved, there are recurring quests and constant items to collect again, and even new enemies and more are formed over time letting you have just an infinite source of fun. This game may not have everything there is to offer, but it has so much into it that it feels like it does. Mentioning skills that you can use to make things easier to fight, barter, create, or if you want to, you could even steal from other people. This being one of the most major transitions from the Elder Scrolls games, from Morrowind to Oblivion, this in comparisan to any of the Elder Scrolls games is by far the best one. I recommend this to everyone. This game deserves so much more credit than it already has.			",60,7,0,13,6,1,5

												All i can say for this game is it is truly a work of art for being sooo old.  I have put many hours into this game before it was released onto Steam.  And since the creation of mods for Oblivion you can practically fix anything you didn't like about the game such as character customization or add new weapons and armor.			",39,4,0,7,6,0,8

												I like all the Elder Scrolls games, but there is something special about Oblivion. Many say it's the weakest of the games, I don't agree. There's something to the warm, vibrant atmosphere and the lovable potato faces, the daily banter about mudcrabs and the guards yelling for the criminal scum to stop. It has to be experienced to be understood. Or maybe it's just nostalgia talking. Either way, I recommend this game.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0

												Let's be honest, this game doesn't need a review, all the positive user reviews speak for themselves. The game is so atmospheric and colorful, so many things you can possibly do, even the main quest isn't half bad. But for anyone looking to buy this game: JUST DO IT! It's a great game and even better with mods. So if you plan on getting this game please do look up how to download and install mods, because the game is literally 10x as good with them. Make sure to get the deluxe edition! This is a game you can literally spend thousands of hours on, exploring Tamriel. So what are you waiting for?			",9,0,0,3,0,0,0

												Let me get the bad out of the way. This game has serious mechanical issues regarding levelling, scaling and how stat advancement is handled. I has some minor performance issues, and it is in dire need of a heap of mods to improve facial appearance of characters, textures etc. I recommend Oblivion Character Overhaul, natural environments, qarl's textures, and the unofficial patch. Enjoy the game, and in particular, the quests, best part of the game overall, since combat is nothing to write home about. Unless you like Diablo level mindless clicking and swinging your arms like a madman.			",97,4,4,5,2,0,11

												Well, where to begin? Oh, I know! Let´s begin at the beginning....Back when the only true games I played were LEGO games, I heard of a game where you can play as cats, lizards, orcs, elves and humans, of course. My curiosity made me ask so many questions and I imagined how I am already playing it and bowing at its glory... Well, I expected something bigger and I was dissapointed at first. Perhaps it was because the only thing I could do was running, attacking and jumping.After I learned some info, I revisited this game... Now I knew how to interract, I knew how certain things work and I had great time. After more than year, I revisited it and BOOM! I bought it!So let´s talk ´bout some cons and pros...Graphics, environment, atmosphere and musicSpeaking of graphics, Oblivion is from 2006 which is a fact you can´t ignore. Game looks OK and some parts of it look great. Textures are kinda bad but when you play RPG you should focus on other things than looks. Reason why many people make fun of this masterpiece is NPC models. Some look atrocious. I am used to them but I can imagine it can turn some people away, although these people should expect worse graphics and models from 2006 game. Environment and atmosphere are made nearly perfectly. The game has a fantasy feel, dungeons are creepy and frustrating, cities are living and beautiful, and all these are so great mainly thanks to wonderful music. Check out some of them and you´ll see.Verdict: game looks amazing and runs OK on medium details. Despite being old, system requirements are quite high.Combat, controls, mechanics and difficultyNo matter how much I love this game, combat is horrific. One of few things made better in its successor is combat.Combat oriented character has very little chance on medium and higher. Even as an experienced player, I still struggle.Magic is super OP. Example : you start off with about 100 magicka. You start with spell that deals 5. Early, you can get a weapon that does 2 damage. Yep. It has limited durability and needs you to be up close. The highest damage weapon is Amber Hammer with max Blunt skill. It will do 33. At level 10, 30 damage is a crappy spell for you. At level 50, 33 weapon is a dream. Combat is dumb because when you encounter combat NPC and fight it, it is going to look like this: Hit, stagger, hit, stagger, heal, hit, stagger, block, enemy staggered, hit, heal, he dead. You´ll get the grip eventually but it is dumb and unfair IMO. Stealth characters will have the most fun. Guilds will be reviewed later. Stealth is really enjoyable and satisfying. Controls are good but if you are used to Skyrim, you might be confused- no sprint, dual-wield or shield bash...Alchemy and enchanting and spellcrafting are fun but bit complicated. Difficulty is really high and needs you to think. Sometimes it is too much and just as every Bethesda RPG, it has this stupid scaling system : The higher level you are, the harder game is, which in fact makes no sense...Quests, main story, guilds, charactersOh yeah! If there is a game with great and diverse quests, it is Oblivion. Quests may seem like dungeon raiding but they usually turn into discovering a cult of necromancers or finding a powerful artifact... Or just haunted ship with ghosts. People in this game are quite weird so they make you do crazy random sh*t like taking staff that constantly summons imps and return it to shrine of a Daedra... Or jsut go into a dream and complete four difficult tasks... Or... Ah play it yourself. Main story by writing is not worst in the series... But by quests and by the fact it is annoying, it is the worst gameplay wise. A big flaw on a beautiful diamond... My recommendation: don´t play it. It doesn´t give you many important items and is annoying, difficult and spawns Gates of Oblivion (if you believe dragons are the most annoying enemies in this series, play oblivion) (and if you believe Daedra are the most annoying enemies in this series, play Morrowind, these Cliff Racers are gonna drive you mad!) Guilds are best in series, just like quests! Be it Mage or Thieves Guild, they are all pretty good with Warriors being the worst one. Dark Brotherhood is a masterpiece. I won´t talk long about NPCs. Some are annoying and dull, some are memorable and great- Lucien Lachance, Sheogorath, Martin Spetim himself, Gray Fox and many others. Voice acting is often criticized but I like it. Wes Johnson is absolutely unmatched. Others are good but get annoying...The last thing-DLCsLittle ones are short and almost unnoticable. Knight of the Nine give you the best heavy set in the game and look great.Shivering Isles is a different story though. It is like a full, separate game. Since Sheogorath is most-likely the best daedric prince, this is a fairly unique experience. Flesh golems, people asking you for carrots and then yelling : Ni-Ni-Ni are quite normal in this DLC. Story is greta, Sheogorath and Jyggalag are good too and quests are better than base game. Items here are also pretty great. Would recommend playing this DLC after everything else.Verdict : buy the deluxe edition, tiny DLCs don´t matter but they are fun and give you some items. Knights of the Nine are OK. Shivering Isles is a masterpiece. Base game as well.Tiny DLCs-6/10KotN-7/10Shivering Isles-10/10-must playBase game-9/10- must playOverall you must buy this masterpiece. One of the best games ever made. Worth every dollar. Or Euro. Or whatever. And I think I don´t have to mention how amazing Elder Scrolls lore is, so if you enjoy good lore, chceck it out.PS: If you happen to find any grammar mistakes, please let me know.			",55,6,0,5,2,0,0

												I've recently began playing this game again, and skyrim being one of my favorite games of all time really pushed me into trying the rest of the titles in the elder scrolls series. To this day I say this game still stands up against other triple a titles. I would say to anyone that enjoyed skyrim that this is a similar experience, lacking in graphics, but is outstanding in storytelling and immersion.			",384,89,15,61,31,2,46

												I'm not much of a hardcore gamer but this game is a really good rpg. If you played skyrim before this like me, it'll be a little difficult to get used to the gameplay mechanics. This is the only comparison I'll made between these games.Main quest storyline is good and not so short. You'll get to fight hordes of oblivion!!!Side quests was fun overall, some of them have interesting stories behind them. Someone will ask you to get her jumbo potatoes back!!Guilds/factions' questlines were also good. Especially thieves guild and dark brotherhood were awesome, I highly recommend those two. TONS OF QUESTS MATE!!!!Apart from quests you'll get to explore cyrodiil, the heart of the empire. There are many dungeons to explore, cities to walk around and monsters to kill. or people.Skill system is good but leveling is difficult in my opinion. There are tons of different skills that affect your gameplay and class options also affect the gameplay immensely. Oh yes the class options are fun.Despite having random crashes (SAVE OFTEN) i enjoyed the game.LONG LIVE THE EMPEROR!And don't forget to kill dreughs and spider daedras with fire. They don't like fire but doesn't matter.ps: I've never managed to learn lockpicking.			",41,10,0,16,6,0,15

												Keep in mind that I played Skyrim first while your reading this. I like Oblivion a lot despite how poorly the faces have aged the writting is still good and it has a great deal of freedom when choosing what kind of character you want to play as. Combat is a little akward because of the pyshics engine and the sound effects aren't convincing me I'm really hurting anyone. But the quests and the beatiful landscape always make me want to boot up Oblivion again just for some really fun storytelling.If you have Skyrim but haven't played this I'd suggest giving it a try. Its not as complex or akward as Morrowind but it still has more depth to magic and skills then Skyrim does. Its a nice middle ground if you want to try playing some of the older scrolls games.

												When I first played Skyrim, I wondered, ""What are the other Elder Scrolls games like?"". My brother told me about this game, and I wanted to play it. When I first started playing, I expected inferior graphics but that would not deter me. What I found was great story, interest mechanics, and it truly felt like an RPG. Skyrim was indeed good, but it lacked some great RPG elements that Oblivion had. I felt that Oblivion had more choices, which is a staple of TES series. The DLCs were great, so interesting, it made me love the game more. Skyrim had rushed DLCs. I finished Dragonborn in about an hour. I wouldn't say this game is a masterpiece, but it is definitely worth adding to your collection.			",30,2,0,10,9,0,3

												So my last review was made when I was fishing for attention so Im actually gonna review this game.I've played more than 14 hours on Steam, I've played about 300 hours on the 360 version alone and I've had a blast every single moment.I've beat the game multiple times and got so much enjoyment out of it, and that's without mods and just playing vanilla.So many books to read and steal, and so many tomes and stuff to learn. Guild quests and Arena challenges in the imperial colosseum.Some quests are actually time dependent, unlike Skyrim where you just meet them whenever and it doesn't matter. The dark humor, which Skyrim doesn't have, will keep you entertained for weeks, the weird robo animations and weird voice acting just add to the charm of this game. Which reminds me, if you liked Skyrim, play this game.If you haven't played either yet, play this game first, then play Skyrim.I'm kidding, but for real Skyrim is really just dumbed down Oblivion, nothing other than Morrowind really compares to this game.The amount of equipment and quests that you initially find to undertake is minimal compared to most games, but exploring the land and just experiencing the game is really the greatest part of Oblivion. Like accidentally contracting Vapirism and having to do this really hard quest to get rid of it, but in Skyrim you literally just talk to a guy and he cures you.There are so many mods out there for this game, I don't think it beats Skyrim but it's up there. You will have fun with this game.You do have to talk to civilians and get the lay of new towns and areas before you find hints where new quests might be, but they are all worth it.Enjoy breaking the law, and getting those stolen goods.

												The Elder Scrolls series never seems to disappoint and Oblivion is not about to break that chain. you awake in a cell awaiting execution for an unkown crime when suddenly you're confronted by the emperor and told you have a great fate coming. from the get-go you're already told you're special and you must prove this by saving the world with the help of a certain heir to the septim line. you can be whoever you want to be, dark elf, orc, human, and even argonians. you'll quest through sewers, caves, and even through the gates of hell itself as you try to save the world from the coming of a daedric prince. and if that's not enough to make you want to play this great game you can also install mods to further enhance your gameplay. so what are you waiting for?! get out there and be SOMEBODY!

												No, I mean. No. A game literally can not be this damn good. There's a bias in my opinion of course, having played this game before I played Morrowind and Skyrim, but all things considered, Oblivion is the highlight of the series. With Morrowind you had great variation in the environment and a truly wonderful game. And then came Oblivion, offering many, many, many hours of gameplay [I have 2500+ on PS3] and an incredible replay value. A game is all about how it makes you feel. Oblivion, with it's bright and vivid colours, compelling story, and amazing design makes you feel like you're in the game. I don't want to sound completely biased, so I want to say some negative things about it, which is hard for me. There are [it being a Bethesda game, after all] a fair share of its bugs and glitches. A few quests in the game were scrapped halfway through, and hearing people reference these quests which can't be completed, initaded, or even alluded to more than once are bothersome. The design of caves, forts, and dungeons can get repetitve. Many people complain about the NPC's faces, which, in the reality of things, aren't bad. Some are absolutely revolting [Bruma guards, specifically. And this one guard in Anvil], but the majority are well done. The soundtrack is the best I've ever heard. The music is cheerful, and fits the environment perfectly. [Jeremy Soule has a talent for that, look at KotOR]. The variation in the wilderness and in the cities is delightful. Each city has its own style of architecture, influenced by various cultures from The Elder Scrolls series. Easily my favorite game of all time, no matter what genre you're interested in, give it a try. Put away any preconceived notions of the game's quality based on graphics [which aren't even that bad, especially for 2006] and experience that which is Oblivion.			",157,11,0,25,18,2,13

												Oblivion is one Hell of a game. Literally an entire world is at your finger tips and you can play the game in whatever way you wish. With thousands of mods you can almost custom the game however you choose. Be warned; it is a beast of a game and needs a beast of a system to run it. And it can be rather unstable due to the sheer size of the gaming world. Other then that, it's a fun fire person RPG.			",0,0,0,0,0,0,0
