Do you like some fast-paced ARPG Action with unique mechanics and competitive ladder with incentives? Then look no further. FORCED Showdown has it all! Game OverviewFORCED Showdown is a fast-paced, top down action role-playing game with the elements of a card game combined through the gameplay. The setting of the game goes with the player participating as a gladiator on a galactice game show that is hosted by an AI called ""C-SAR"" (which means Computer Simulated Arena Referee).Initially, the only character that is available for play is ""Squire of Light"" and the first companion, ""Xiao Long"". As you progress through the game by clearing quests, you will be able to unlock other characters like ""Volco"" who is a heavy-hitting melee character, ""Stormbringer"" who specializes in long-ranged combat, and ""Ravager"" who is an agile close-combat fighter.The game currently has three ""Programs"" for you to play in which serves as the campaign modes available for the game. There are also daily contents for you to participate which is a seeded mode for players worldwide to compete in the ladder. In every ""battle"", you will start with four cards and one mana (though it might vary depending on the rules), you gain one of each after every arena you clear, but the effect of the cards will not persist after the battle. Defeating enemies can also drop specific trinkets which can heal you or give you points or gold. Also, upgrades or ""boons"" are received if you have accumulated enough ""points"" after every battle, and unlike the card effects, these effects persist for the whole program. After every program, which could end in either victory or defeat, you can earn gold that can be used in the Wheel of fortune which can either give you cards (which is separated in three different tiers: common, rare, and supreme), gold or shards that you can use to make cards yourself.The Pros High Replay Value - In my opinion, the game's perfect timbre in terms of replayability roots in two aspects. The first one is interesting nature of the game being complex (due to the card game element added) despite having a straight-forward fast-paced action gameplay which lures you into playing more and more. The second one is the interactiveness of the game's community. Freebies, leaderboard and ranking incentives, and frequent updates by the developers contribute hugely to this. Perfect Difficulty Balance - How do you know that the game has a good balance in terms of difficulty? It's quite simple. If you push through the game and still enjoy it after hours of failing to complete a single session, then that is what a perfect difficulty setting is like. And this game will make you feel that way. Beautiful Visuals - The game is pretty (and somewhat flashy), which is pretty much visible with the contents posted for it. Not much that I can really say more to this one, except that the game really loves explosion effects. Great Audio - Brilliant voice acting is present throughout the game and fits the comedic setting of it. Even the background music and the sound effects used are on point to each part which sets an awkward-free experience to the gameplay as a whole. Season Ranking Incentives - This factor's importance might vary depending on how devoted you are to the game, but nevertheless it is an incentive for you to play more and more whichever way you take it. Honestly, this is a great move from the developers to make its community more involved into the game. For more information, visit the game's site here: http://forcedshowdown.com/watch/ The Cons Minor Game Bugs - Upon playing the game, I have encountered a few minor bugs within the arena gameplay and even in the menu. An example of a bug that I encountered from the arena is when my character was knock-backed out of bounds for a second, though there wasn't any negative impact after that. Another bug that I got from the menu was when I was using the wheel of fortune. Since you can only get two copies of the same card, the next one you get will automatically become shards. Though unfortunately, the shards weren't added to my total amount.  Limited Variation in Characters - Right now, the game has a total of four (4) playable characters, three (3) companions (with some additional ones that you can have through certain rules and cards) and about less than ten (10) variations of bosses. While the variations that the playable characters and the companions give more than enough complexity and versatility for the community to play with and adapt to, the case of repetitiveness will still be present in the game and this factor will affect the game's longevity. And also, since it looks like the developers are aiming to make this game a mainstream contender, additional options is a must. The VerdictI'll make my statement short: GET IT NOW! and I'm sure you won't regret it. Frequent updates is surely a big plus, as well as the promoted incentives for their top players.If you like to see more recommended games that is worth the value you are paying, please visit my other reviews, or follow our curator group at Good Games Giveaways & Reviews.

												Forced showdown is a twinstick shooter rogue-like card game. Thats obviously a lot of descriptors, so the worry would be does it handle those things well. I would say yes, but it does have its problems. The core gameplay is very fun, at least with the 'main' character and the bow and arrow guy. The other two characters, in my opinion, aren't as fun to play with. They are, at least early on, difficult to play as because the game rewards a conservative playstyle and the two melee characters aren't really conservative at all. So, the game is like an arena TV show. Your working towards the final boss and you have cameras following you around during every arena. You fight enemies, then you reach a boss. Two bosses, you fight a boss that opens a door. Do that a few times and you beat a show. Sounds like a lot, and it is. You'll probably die. Winning a run isn't easy. You have to be good/lucky, and just hope you survive and get the right cards. Cards. So, you have a pre built deck and you can also build a deck out of cards you earn by earning gold, and spinning for them. The card building has a super Hearthstone vibe, but there are very few cards that reach that level of complexity, most cards are very very simple. +80 health, +45% damage. There are more interesting cards but these passive upgrades are what I usually build my deck around, because its a guarenteed upgrade unlike spells and consumables which usually have some condition. This game, at least in the beta build I played, has some issues. It runs kinda like crap, it lags frequently at the end of battles and I had it crash on me once. Luckily, it doesn't often lag during a big fight, although it can happen. I hope there is a day one patch that fixes this, and if there is I will update. I also have an issue, but its probably just preference, where the games kinda last a long time. It can take 90 minutes to get to the end of a run, and then you just lose. Luckily there are quests and you get gold for cards so its not like you just got nothing, but doing a 90 minute run and losing can be upsetting. I would have preferred if a run was a bit shorter and not as drawn out. I discovered this game on twitch, and because of twitch the game will launch with a 12% discount(I'll get a higher one for getting a beta key). I would definitely recommend it at its base price if the idea of a twin-stick roguelite card game appeals to you. It definitely appeals to me. The game handles deck building, twin-stick shooting and its rogue-like elements very well.  Buy At Full Price   "

												TLDR: An arena brawler rogue-like with a tight, difficult-yet-fair combat system with collectible cards replacing typical rogue-like progression in a very well-executed and interesting way.The game plays and feels like a roguelike where you progress through randomly generated arenas. Character progression though is done by collectible cards. You build your deck and play upgrade cards from it in between levels. Works great! What I love most though is how the combat is done - very challenging, and yet so very fair! Every attack is properly telegraphed, there's no bool♥♥♥♥♥♥ no unavoidable hits. And yet the best players in the world still die to endgame daily content :-)Each of the 4 chars plays COMPLETELY different, with multiple unique attacks and upgrades. Dailies are very well designed and will keep you engaged for MONTHS!One of the best games I ever played.			"

												The game, for some reason, doesn't have the ultra-widescreen resolutions available in the dropdown list by default, so when it came time to pick a perk for my character, I essentially hit a brick wall and couldn't play. it kept demanding my attention but there was no confirm button after selecting a perk. I fixed the issue using a hex editor to change the forced.exe file, changing 39 8e e3 3f to cd 90 18 40. Naturally. I mean, who doesn't know to do that. Anyways, the game is quite entertaining and simple to play, I think I'll enjoy this one.I'm only posting this incomplete review in case someone else out there needs this info to continue playing the game like I did.

												Alright then. 4 hours in, and I can already tell you that this game is amazing. Not good, not great, but amazing!And here's why:1. The combat is enjoyable the way you would expect from an action rpg like torchlight. It is fast paced, but you have the time to think about your actions at the same time. It is simple, yet skillbased. 2. 4 heroes, who feel different. They are different enough to make sure, that there is a character for every type of player. And on top of that, you can customize each one of them with a unique deck.3. Speaking of decks! This is not just a gimmick. Fans of deckbuilding games will have an incredibly enjoyable time with this part of the game. You can play each character in an unlimited number of ways depending on the deck you choose to take into the arena. 4. Random stuff. If you like the randomness of Binding of Isaac, you will love this too. There are random arenas with random enemies with random buffs. The boss has a random effect on the arena, and you will get random boons along the way. There are so much random stuff that I couldn't write all of it here. The great thing is - You never feel helpless in the same way, Isaac makes you feel. The random stuff is there to help you (mostly), and it feels great.5. Cards... Come on - you get to spend ingame gold to buy a ticket for the  card-lottery machine. I imagine spending 100s of hours earning gold and spending it on more rolls in the lottery. Its like opening boosters, but with INGAME GOLD!!!! 6. Cute pets. I don't need to say more about this... but I will - Some of them are called puffs, who give you a bonus if you make it through an arena without it getting killed. 7. Interesting bosses. These guys are like vanilla WOW bosses. They are challenging and rewarding at the same time.8. Difficulty. The first hour of the game, I was like ""Man, this game is too easy"". Boy, was I wrong. At the second level of difficulty, the bosses also start drawing random cards against you. I got curbstomped haaard. And I loved it.There are a few cons to the game though. The servers aren't very responsive. I got kicked out in the middle of doing a daily, and couldn't connect back up to the server again :( This will no doubt get fixed, but its still annoying.There seems to be a slight issue where the game almost crashes. Sometimes the game freezes in a loading screen and windows tells me that the program has stopped responding. It comes right back up a few moments later, but apparently windows detects a freeze which isn't good. As you can probably read, I am already a fan. I will keep playing this for a long time to come (hopefully), and if I find more stuff worth mentioning, I will update this.BUY IT NOW!			"

												*What is Forced Showdown?*Forced Showdown is a strategic top down, twin stick, rouge-like shooter with card elements. Gameplay closely resembles Gauntlet, or a much differently themed Binding of Isaac. It feels fluid and fast paced. The rouge-like strategy comes in the form of the in game card system. You will feel right at home if you ever played Hearthstone or Magic the Gathering. If you haven't its not incredibly complicated, but provides many options and strategies. Now, BetaDwarf delivers a game which blends a in-depth card game and an easy to pick up but difficult to master rouge-like twin stick shooter. *What do I think of Forced Showdown?*I love this game! I have played many hours of The Binding of Isaac, Terraria, Ziggarut, Rouge Legacy, RIsk of Rain and other rouge-likes you probably havent heard of. I have to say this game is among my favorites and its brand new. If the in-game season mode is implemented correctly I have no doubts this will be my favorite!*Why do you like this game?*Mainly, the card deck customization is so great because it makes this rouge-like feel more like its in my control instead of ""I hope I grab the right items so I can play the way I want"". Getting new cards is not as grindy as Hearthstone and is paced excellently. This way, the replayablility, theory crafing and experiences are all fresh every time. Next, this game is challenging, but not unfair. This is a very hard thing to get right in a game and Forced Showdown delivers. Most rougelikes become very easy for me once I learn the mechanics, this game tests me at every step. Of course, none of this would matter if the gameplay wasnt fun or interesting, its great.*Any problems with the game?*I havent had any issues at all with this game since I bought it and put about 15 hours into so far (very strong by todays releases). The game has some slowdown in between rounds (1-2 seconds), but it never effects the actual gameplay. *Other thoughts?*If you like any of these games I would seriously consider at least trying this game: The Binding of IsaacHearthstoneMagic the GatheringThe Diablo FranchisePath of ExileGauntletRouge Legacy*Overall*Fun: 9/10 - I have a great time playing through, learning, and playing different styles. Presentation 9/10 - Hits the game show theme, graphics are servicable.Mechanics 9/10 - Game flat out nails combat and the card system. Game isnt bare but would love more content.Replayability 9.5/10 - With the new cards you earn, new ways to play. Keeps me coming back.Reliabilty 9/10 - Game doesn't crash, haven't seen any bugs. Though, I have a monster computer and it stutters when rounds are over. "

FORCED SHOWDOWN is an action indie RPG game, a successor to FORCED: Slightly Better Edition, a well-known co-op RPG game.If this review is too long for you, I suggest you to only read the first paragraph about the game's content and the final verdict at the end.What is happening in the game:You are in some kind of a game show, where you are FORCED (see what I did there?) to fight enemies that are placed across the level. They get tougher after each stage, but you do as well.Pros: Graphics | The game truly looks amazing! Levels look great, they have a lot of little details that fill the screen and make everything look good. I'm talking about torches, flowers, barrels and so on. Variety is also a big advantage, as levels look different from one another. If you're interested about graphic settings, there is plenty of them. Amount of Gameplay | There is a lot of gameplay included in this game. You have different campaigns, but you also have many quests to complete. Since campaigns are very full of content, there is also a great replayability value in this game.  Cards | This is (to some degree) also a card game. Let me explain this. You get a card every level and you can choose whether you want to use it or not. Every level, you also get some mana, which you need for activating the chosen card. If you want to activate a card that is really good, you will probably have to wait a few levels to save up enough mana to be able to use that card. I think that cards are a nice addition to the gameplay and it's great that's the game's focus is not completely on the cards, but just uses them as powerups and bonuses. If you want, you can also build your own decks. And if you don't want certain cards at the beginning, you can choose to change some of them to different ones (you don't know which new ones you will get, though). Weapons and Abilities | You can have different weapons and also different abilities, depending on what character you choose. Abilities do help a lot, unless you forget to use them like me :P Weapons are kind of cool, since they behave a bit differently than they do in other games. For example, continuously firing a laser gun for a few seconds will result in a huge blast at the end of that period, which will deal a great amount of damage. This also makes sure that you time your shots right and aim at the strongest enemy just when the blast is about to occur. Cutscenes and Voice Acting | The cutscenes are well-made and are also voice acted by an announcer/referee called C-SAR. He acts with a really exciting voice and together with sound effects and music, he really makes cutscenes great. Menu Appearance | I know that this is not affecting the gameplay, but a game also needs to take care of how it appears when a person first launches it. The mix of purple colours and just the right lightning definitely leaves a great first impression. The menu is also intuitive and easy to navigate. Achievements | There are more than 60 achievements in this game, which is great for some people who like to be complimented by the game for their marvelous actions and advanced skills. The achievements are also equally divided between different difficulties. By that I mean that some games have all achievements fairly hard to achieve or the exact opposite, but Showdown is not one of those games. Controller Support | I don't play with my controller very often, but this seemed like a good game to try playing it with my Steam Controller. I tried it and, to my surprise, the game played better than with a keyboard. I like the control layouts Regular Updates | Updates are coming very often, approximately one every week. And they're not just some small updates! They all have tons of added content, tweaks, fixes, balanced enemies and weapons, performance improvements and more. The gaming community certainly needs more active developers like this one.Cons: Performance Issues | Even though there were many fixes and the situation definitely did get better, I still experience some frame drops and lags. My computer also struggles a bit when I launch the game. But, as I said, the situation keeps getting better with almost every update, so I'm looking forward to seeing this game issue-free in near future. Loading Times | Not a big issue, since there are not many loading screens, but the ones that are present take a long time to do their job. Enemy Variety | Sometimes I feel like there are not enough different enemies. You rarely have to take different approaches in order to beat them. You don't have to adapt too much, they just get a bit stronger and maybe a bit more aggressive. Lack of Minimap | In certain arenas, you could use a minimap to see the stage layout and maybe even enemy positions. This is not a major problem, though. Trading Cards | Sadly, they are not present. The developers have this one their list of planned stuff, but apparently, they're more busy with other things. Windows Only | There is no Linux and Mac support right now, but this is supposedly planned as well. We'll see how that goes.The final verdict:Overall, this game is really good. There are a lot of good things and some bad things, but there is really no doubt about this game's quality. In case you haven't read the whole thing: the quality is high above average. I really like how this game looks and how it plays. I'm not the biggest fan of card games, but Showdown has them integrated in an unusual way that is, in my opinion, much better than in most games.There are some issues in terms of performance and a lack of some features, but the updates are so frequent that I don't have any fear that everything is going to be fixed sooner or later.If you like RPGs and if you liked the original Forced, definitely give this game a try. It's worth it.Greetings,BirdCuteNote that my copy of this game was obtained for free for reviewing purposes. However, this did not affect the quality and objectivity of this review. "

												FOREWORD: If you hate reading, just watch then: 


YouTube™ Video: FORCED SHOWDOWN Well worth the buy! 

			Views: 374		

			In this video we take a look at the amazing Forced Showdown, an arena-style rogue-like game with good progression and replayability, which is awesomely presented to boot.		

FORCED SHOWDOWN is a rogue-like arena-based combat game with lots of diversity, extremely engaging gameplay and tons or replayability. In many aspects, it looks like what DOTA would have looked if it was played by one character, on a small arena, and with WASD instead. The gameplay is very fast-paced and intense, it always keeps you on your toes, and winning a level is extremely rewarding.And before someone starts bashing the game for not launching, the devs are hard at work at it. I can tell - untill yesterday's beta patch launched, I could not start the game myself, and now it runs flawlessly.Allrighty, let's take a look at the good and at the bad.THE GOOD:1. Extremely engaging gameplay - as I pointed out in other reviews, to me, this outweighs everything else. You will be glued to your seat and will readily want to beat the current level just to see what the game has in store for you next. I haven't felt such an urge in a PC game for a good while.2. Extremely responsive controls, be it whether you play with the mouse and keyboard, or with a controller. I love it when a game transcends the twin stick controls and allows the player to feel just as comfortable when using a keyboard and mouse, like I usually play my games.3. Arena-style combat: every level is comprised of a number of small arenas that can be beaten in a few minutes, or even less than a minute. At first I thought I would hate this, but it actually ends up working for the better. This is the way to do it - fast paced, quick and engaging fights that never let up. It wants you to get to the final battle that features a boss toon that much more!4. Selectable levels - it is entirely up to you to decide what kind of boons or setbacks are you going to have on a level, which is a great touch and furthers the replayability by a whole lot.5. A deck of cards for skills - another very interesting design decision, that furthers the replayability even more. For each of the 4 heroes you can build up to 5 decks of 30 cards. At the start of the battle, you get 4 random cards from your deck of various magnitudes of 1 to 7 (or more under special conditions), from which you can discard, or keep as is. Throughout the levels, you get to play the cards from your hand as skills or consumable items (items with number of charges for the whole battle). On arenas 1-8 you get respective 1-8 mana points that you can use to play cards with, with each card having a mana requirement. This can be further influenced by boons (e.g. extra mana point on arena 1) and cards. There is a plethora of possible combinations that you can set for yourself - which lets you get very creative.6. The game is very atmospheric - you really feel like a part of the show, with an announcer, small flying drones that take pictures of you, and even spectators around the arena who cheer.7. Amazing musical score - the main theme of the game will finally succeed XCOM2's ready for battle as my pump-up song. It is so cool. It even made me buy the deluxe edition as to keep the OST and listen to it during my daily routines as well.8. Unlockable heroes, quests, dailies,  achievements and all that good jazz that make you come back to the game over and over.9. There is real progression in this game, even when you lose. You get to keep your coins and spend them unlocking cards of various rarities, which makes losses feel less impactful. You still feel as you are progressing, unlike other rogue-likes that simply wipe your progress and say ""now play me for another 5 hours to get to where you were"" - like the grindy WASTED, for example.10. And last but not least - the replayability. You will never get bored even if you played the same Hero for 5 or 50 hours, and no two games are ever the same. At present, I have unlocked all of them, and I can sure as hell say that they all play completely differently, which is always a great thing to see. You get a max range, mid-range, close AOE and a very fast attacker. Take your pick, or master tham all.And now the ba... Wait, wait. Let's just add the OK first.1. DOTA style graphics. While this is not necessarily a bad thing and it is more than serviceable, I can't help but wonder what would such a game look on a better engine... That would have been totally epic.2. The game tells (and expects) you to ""git gud"" before you can enjoy a huge part of its content. Yeah, you need to beat the Crucible before you can do pretty much anything else. While this is not necessarily bad, it does lock you out of content that you might enjoy right from the start.And now, the BAD:1. Having a deck also means you are playing an RNG game. You may get cards that will easily win you the level, but more often than not, you won't and be forced to play with what you are given. This can be off-putting to some players, and for a good reason.2. Having a number of mana points per round can also be a problem. You can have a hand that is completely unplayable for a few rounds, which is always bad for your hero. You may still win, of course, that doesn't mean that luck will lose you the game.The conclusion:Yesterday I was this close to refund the game because it never launched for me, and after reading up the forums and patching it, I am so glad I didn't. You owe it to yourself to experience what this game has to offer. Every concept of it ties together perfectly to allow for hours of enjoyment. It is not the type of game to say ""hey, sit down now, and spend 10 hours playing me or you won't have fun at all"". NO! It is quite the opposite - it says ""look, I know your time is precious, so how about you play me for a while, have a real blast and go back to your life"". When such type of game shows up and is executed as well as FORCED SHOWDOWN is, it deserves a thumbs up and you owe it to yourself to try it.P.S. And it still rocks :)			"

FULL VIDEO REVIEW: 


YouTube™ Video: Play Wait or Avoid? Review of Forced Showdown 

			Views: 2,315		

			Play Wait or Avoid reviews cover the latest indie games, early access games, and AAA titles in a way that doesn't rely on scores.		

PROS:Satisfying twin-stick gameplay that improves upon the mechanics from the original FORCED.Hearthstone-style card system creates a whole new hybrid style balancing deck building skill and RNG effectively.Great looking aesthetic and amazing art direction accentuates the “game show” feel.Daily events give the game more replayability by allowing you to compete on leaderboards in monthly tournaments. CONS:  Game has some problems with low replayability if you do not enjoy the daily events as there are only 3 campaigns. A bit buggy at times, ESPECIALLY if you play Ravager there are some strange interactions with his dash.Only 4 characters feels a bit lacking.NO multiplayer, which is odd considering one of the selling points of the original FORCED was the co-op. SUMMARY:FORCED SHOWDOWN is a twin-stick shooter that introduces a unique card system into the traditional formula. Instead of relying on traditional itemization your upgrades are based on the cards that you put in your deck. What this does is allow you to customize how you want to play your champion while still keeping some of the random nature of a rogue-lite style game. While I don’t think the card system is going to be redefining any genres, it works well and the game represents one of the most polished twin stick shooters in recent times. The solid gameplay and well developed aesthetic gives the game a feeling of quality, much more so than the original FORCED. The game is good, very good but it’s also a game that I believe needs additional content in the future to keep players around. So far following this game I’ve come to trust the developers are planning on supporting this game to a great degree, and hopefully more campaigns and characters help flesh out an already great addition to the twin-stick genre.

												I was very pleasently surprised when I gave this game a spin! It's not a mindless grindy action RPG in the vein of Diablo 3 and the likes. Instead combat is challenging, tense and requires intelligent positioning and a well-planned use of your special abilities.There are tons of cards to collect that, besides all the different characters, companions, monsters, arenas, modifiers and whatnot, add to the enormous variety that makes every playthrough feel completely fresh.Besides the single-player roguelike-ish gameplay, there are also daily competitions and leaderboards for those into multiplayer competitiveness.And last but not least, one of the most amazing things about this game is the dedication of the developers. They keep pumping out one great update after another, really caring deeply about balancing, polish and general improvements, while being directly fueled by their community's feedback. This is the kind of passion we need to reward in video games. Help create a future of good games by supporting this game!			"

												At first I wasn't sure whether I'd enjoy the game in the long-run because it's pretty frustrating. I didn't realize at first it was a rogue-lite and mostly bought it because it looked fun from what I saw on twitch. If you can figure out the game enough to make it not as frustrating it becomes a much more fun experience.Basically you collect cards to give your hero different abilities and use those to beat shows which consist of battles containing generally 8 arenas. You gain xp for each show which resets if you win or lose. Each level you gain grants a boon which does different things for you in the arenas. Boons are one of the most important parts to being successful in finishing each show.The game will get repetitive, but if you like challenging yourself and enjoy rogue-like/TCGs and gameplay similar to Gauntlet you may want to consider this game.

												Honestly, I wasn't expecting to get hooked on this game from the get go.It reminds me in some way of Hand of Fate, another brilliant rogue-lite with cards and lots of fighting, but less mean to the player. HoF could really mess you up with one or two bad draws, while FS allows you to overcome even the toughest challenges by your own skills. Mind you, this game gets difficult very fast, as even the first major boss can really kick your behind if you don't pack some good cards. You'll die a lot, but that is expected with games like this one.As for the deckbuilding part, it borrows some bits from Hearthstone. Your deck can contain 30 cards, up to 2 copies of each are allowed and mana curve goes up to 8 because that's how many arenas are in each ''dungeon''. The cards and heroes allow for varied play styles, so you can go full tank or DPS, or even play the rare cards that grant bonuses when your HP is low if you're in mood for risk with high rewards. The gameplay is very solid and you can really feel the weight of the punches and big spells, especially when lots of explosions happen and the screen ''thumps''.All in all, a great game, that only lacks some sort of multiplayer and more character variety to become amazing. I see myself playing this for months to come. Well done, BetaDwarf!			"

Disclaimer - Backed at low tier, however, that's not going to influence my opinion, the game really is greatSmash TV finally has a spiritual successor that's actually worthy of the name, step into the light FORCED SHOWDOWN!FORCED, as some of you may recall was a bit of a mixed bag, there were some good ideas in it, but it was hampered by a lack of clear direction and in some senses was more of a testbed for what was to come. There was a game lurking in FORCED, a game that was just itching to get out. One where Betadwarf just cut loose with the crazy, went ""You know what? Stuff all that stuff which says games need to be normal and based around the usual cliched tropes, let's go all out nutty and take what made Smash TV a hit, and go from there""In comes FORCED SHOWDOWN. A game that pretty much has the Smash TV format combined with the quick levelling and rapid power gain of a MOBA and the moment to moment quick decisions required from a top down shooter. In short, it's -brilliant-. It's also pants on head crazy in places, which is something that for a Smash TV game is a near requirement, but we'll get to that in a moment.It should be pointed out that this game very nearly didn't make it out of the blocks as the game it could have been, initially it went through Early Access, and it showed a lot of promise there, then it went to Kickstarter (which is a bit backwards, but bear with me) in order to raise the remaining funds to get the game polished and up to spec to get over the finish line. I actually backed the game at the thirty buck tier having decided that yes, this is a developer I feel is worth supporting and is worth my moneys. People who bought into this game at various stages took a risk, that risk has been rewarded, for all the Early Access disasters, this one shows that just occasionally, you get a diamond from the coal.So that's the context, how do you end up in a TV show then?The premise is simple enough, you are a contestant in a far future TV show - Forced: Showdown, your aim, win fame and fortune by murdering everything that isn't you for the benefit of studio audiences across the galaxy. You'll do this across a broad range of randomly generated arenas fighting things ranging from aliens to mideval blokes with swords, you'll also cross swords with ""minor celebrities"" such as Ratbo, who form the minor bosses of the game, and work your way up to the named finales of each season, gaining boons, earning coins and so on.The moment to moment gameplay is going to be very familiar for anyone who has played a MOBA in the last five years, as it broadly takes the MOBA formula and then puts a ""lite"" CCG element on the top, before you begin, you build a character deck out of cards that you feel will give you the best shot at beating the challenges ahead (a bit like hand of fate), as you enter each arena, cards will be drawn from that deck, and presuming you have the mana, you can then play them to gain MOBA style upgrades such as damage, crit chance, attack speed, consumable use items, proc chance effects and so on. This gives you a very rapid power curve over the course of the arena, and in the space of a short time, say fifteen minutes you'll go from basic to powerful and ready to fight the boss. Once the boss is nailed, you'll be placed in the crucible, and you'll select another arena, and potentially a boon, a meta upgrade that applies to all subsequent runs for that particular ""season"" and you repeat the process. The moment to moment gameplay is very fast, very fluid, and for anyone familiar with MOBAs, will be intimately familar, however, as it's a singleplayer game, you won't have to deal with other people getting in the way, this is you versus the computer, and the computer gets cards and spells too, just to make your life interesting.When each season is resolved, win or lose, you'll gain gold that allows you to purchase cards to expand your deck, you'll also complete ""quests"" (or achievements) that unlock new bonuses such as persistent upgrades that apply to -everything-, or unlock entire new characters or companions, this keeps you coming back even if you lose, because no matter what, you're always generally unlocking something, or working towards something.Getting that mad atmosphere just right.Thankfully the game doesn't take itself at all seriously, with a robotic announcer called C-SAR and posters telling you what to expect in each season, holographic ads around the playfield and little camera drones filming the action, it really sells the concept that you're a contestant in the arena, performing for the crowd. Good sound design and solid, if somewhat silly voice acting ensure that you'll always be suitably entertained, and whilst the graphics aren't going to blow you away, on a good rig they're decently pretty and they run at a smooth rate. There -are- reports of stutter on release, so Betadwarf are currently patching, but expect that to be resolved sooner rather than later.Closing thoughtsAt the price point they've pitched it at, and for the love they've poured in, if you've any love for this style of game, and fancy a revisit to silly, Smash TV styled brawlers, this one is an easy sell. The game is well put together, highly polished, and has plenty of longevity, you'll easily rack 20-40 hours trying to unlock everything, and the CCG element can be mercilessly addictive for those who want to complete the card collection. For me, this is one Kickstarter I genuinely don't regret putting money into, and I wish Betadwarf all the best now that FORCED:SHOWDOWN is out.Verdict : Highly Recommended "

												So, this is going to be a bit of an ""early impressions"" review, which I dont normally do, but... this game has impressed me so much that I feel like adding to the thumbs-upness that it already has.  Not to mention that while complex, the mechanics are easy enough to grasp that I feel I've got a good handle on things here.   And to explain a bit about myself, I'm a huge fan of three things:  1, bullet hell games, 2, roguelikes/rogue-lites, and 3, CCGs (or TCGs, whatever you want to call them; games played with collectible cards).  Very, very familiar with and fond of all three.Imagine my surprise when I found a game that smashes all of those three things together.Imagine even more surprise when I found out that said game actually does it RIGHT.That's the really interesting thing about this game:  It takes all of these different ideas and squashes them together, but locks them into place alongside one another that it all just works.In this game, you start out by choosing one of four hero characters (five if you have the expansion).  That doesnt sound like many?  There's a good reason for that, which I'll get to in a bit.  You can also choose a ""pet"" to accompany you into battle, each having it's own abilities/stats and unique ways of helping you out.  When you're in battle, you have a few abilities you can activate, each crucial to your success, and each having a cooldown; there's no mana costs here, just the cooldown.  Mastery of your abilities is key, and learning enemy behaviors and patterns is another key.  While this game may look a bit like a Diablo clone when just viewed by those that have never really seen it, it definitely isnt.  This game is not just about attacking your enemies as Diablo is (where you often just stand in one spot and fire spells and such), instead it's about fighting and actually DODGING things; every attack is fully dodgable, and you MUST do this if you are to win.  This is where the ""bullet hell"" label comes from, as enemies are going to fling dangerous explody death balls or whatever all over the place.  Many things to dodge.Each ""battle"" VS a particular boss consists of 8 arenas, with you teleporting to the next one after clearing the current one of non-summoned enemies. These get harder and harder up until you hit number 8, at which point you'll fight the boss itself (pretty much always with some of his minions tagging along).  Enemies have all sorts of varied and dangerous attacks, bosses can be very dangerous with their own ability to fill the screen with pain, and what's worse, there are traps, and throughout all of those arenas (including the 7 where the boss isnt physically present) the boss has an ability that they can trigger (on a cooldown, like yours) that just makes your job harder.  Each run through the game consists of a series of many different battles, so you have much to overcome before you can win a run.Fortunately, you arent going into this lunacy unprepared.  This is where the CCG aspect comes into play.  When you select a hero, you also select a deck of cards to bring into battle.  You assemble these decks in a seperate interface; once you've actually started a run with a hero, you cannot alter your deck in any way (which is as you'd expect, right?).  But the point is, you build a deck filled with various types of cards; spells (one-shot effects), consumables (which when activated give you consumable items of some sort that can be activated during combat) and upgrades (permanent effects, lasting until the end of the battle, through all arenas up till the boss is beaten).  There's all sorts of fun and crazy cards here, and they're just as complicated and varied as you might expect from something like this.  Assembling a good deck is not easy, either, which is good.   When you're in a battle, at the start of each arena you're given the chance to play cards from your current hand.  You have a mana pool, which works similarly to Hearthstone in that you start with 1 max mana, and at each new arena, this goes up by 1.  As you might expect there's ways to manipulate this or do things like change the costs on cards or... well, you'll see for yourself the things you can do.  Card synergies are important, of course, but it's up to you to figure out what to use, and what fits the deck idea you're going for and your playstyle.But dont think that these cards are an almighty advantage for you.  Bosses have their own decks, and a steadily increasing mana max like you do, and will play their own cards just before you play yours (meaning you can see what they do, and respond to them).  Their cards can do all sorts of really loopy things, which really add alot to each fight, yet never really feel unfair or anything.  They'll do their best to put an end to your run, but if you use your own tools right, and keep dodging all that chaos... you can win.  That's not all though!  There's a long list of modifiers that can be applied to each battle, and during a run, you select from different possible battles that have their own small list of modifiers.  Modifiers can be beneficial (though this also increases the enemy count in each arena) or negative (which also lowers the enemy count).  Learning what these are and selecting the right battles is tough, but something you'll need to do.  Choose the wrong battle with modifiers that go against your deck, and you're putting yourself at a disadvantage.Between battles you also level-up and select ""boons"", or perks.  None of this is carried over between runs, naturally.  This game is stuffed full of roguelike elements, after all.  There's plenty of RNG here to keep things interesting, but without ever feeling like a total mess.As for the heroes?  There's only a few of them because of the card mechanic; some cards are geared towards a specific hero only, affecting their abilities in various interesting ways.  These are important, as you'd expect, and using them properly is important.  If there were too many heroes, the total card count would be stupidly high.  The really good thing though is that because of the card system, you get a ton of variance in how you can play each hero and how they'll work.  They're not always going to feel/play exactly the same.  They all work out well and are great fun to use, and you'll make individual decks for each hero.All in all, these many mechanics combine to form a very deep, satisfying, and very challenging game that can keep you coming back just as often as many roguelikes do.  And keep in mind, I only discussed the game's main mode here... there's more modes than just that.  There's a LOT to do here.  And even more if you get the expansion, which I can already recommend.Overall, this is a fantastic game with great execution, mechanics, and tons of difficulty that's going to keep me coming back over and over.  I'm loving it, and I highly recommend it.  Just be aware of how hard it is.  It WILL beat you over the head with your own face.  It'll laugh while it does this.			"

												FORCED SHOWDOWN is the second game out of the BetaDwarf studio and is the second installment in their arena-brawler genre. In broad strokes the game is built on the mechanics introduced in their first game, but adds a ton of replayability and overall gameplay as the genre  shifts to a single-player focussed game.The gameplay is fast and exciting with tons of customizability you know from creating your own card decks in magic or hearthstone.You get rewarded for completing arenas even though you don't complete the full run, giving you the feel that you are always progressing and creating better decks for the challenges at hand. The artistic theme does not shy away from making a couple of jokes; like Ratbo, a minigun-wielding rat, or a pirate rat in a rocket spaceship. Which at first can appear out of sync, however reveals itself as an approach to keep the focus on the gameplay. I thouroughly enjoyed this game and it addresses some of the elements that was lacking in their first installment. (Replayability and customizability) I will definitely kick in more time in this game.The relatable title is obviously FORCED, but if you are looking into game-mechanics you should also look to a combination of Hearthstone, Magicka, Diablo and the roguelike element.Features:- Fast-paced non-stop combat- Deep customizability and strategic approach to fight within the arenas- Card-game-like pre-game customization- 'Perma death' or 'Progression reset' - Roguelike element- Oh and treasure goblins. Sweet, sweet, treasure goblins.			"

												FORCED SHOWDOWN is a rogue-like action RPG mixed with strategical gameplay elements.When you start a game for a first time you should a pass a tutorial campaign and only after this you will get the access to the ""real"" game. Here you will find a three campaign , all have a different difficulty levels, so to the unlock a next one you should beat a previous. Here you will find four playable characters with different game style and skills, but at the start you can use only one, others you will unlock later. All leves in a game have 8 different arenas, in first seven you should kill only minions and at the last you should defeat a boss. All levels has his own rule, also arenas always are random generated, so every time when you start play that again you will find a different environment, traps and monsters. Also you have a companion, what help for you in a battle with enemies. One thing maybe can be annoying for you, and this is that: if you die you should star all from the beginning. Only two things you will not lost after death. The coins what you can spend in a market to get random new card to our decks and the ""quest"" progress. The quests just just some tasks as kill 6 monsters in a 6 second , kill 200 monsters, etc. The tactical part of this game: cards. You start a level at the first arena with 4 cards what you can use before start a battle if you have enough points to the chosen card. At the first arena you have one point, at second two, and this amount grow till eight point when you reach a boss battle arena, so you should think before use the cards, because sometimes maybe better to use two or three cheaper cards than one expensive. Also a cards has more types, some do instant action, some add a buff for little time and some are upgrades to your stats.The game graphic looks nice, well fit to the game style. This can say also for the music, this well fit to the action-packed gameplay.So my verdict+ nice graphic style+ addictive gameplay + random generated levels+ good music what well fit to the game action+ great atmosphere+ interesting mix of RPG, rouge-like and strategy + steam achivements- optimization problem- bugs and crashes- long loading time- the companions AI can be better- not to much various bosses- when you die you should start all from beginning - no trading cardsWell this game is an interesting mix of RPG, action, rogue-like and strategy, but all of this well balanced here and well complement each other. If you like any of this genre, i think you should try out this game, its will not disappoint you. However this is not an easy game, at first time can bring some difficulty for you and maybe can be annoying that fact, you should start everything from the beginning if you die. But besides a dark sides, a game have enough much good things and can bring for you hours of fun, so i easily can recommend it for you.			"

												Well polished underated game. Good amount of cards and heroes allowing for various and personnal experiences.Good balance of difficulty allowing to have fun without removing the challenge aspect of a video game.Collecting all the cards is pretty addictive, keeping the interest in doing Quests, and Online Dailys.The recent addition of a badge system allows for replaying the campaigns with harder difficulty but better rewards.Really solid game, something very rare nowadays in our era of Early Access and mainstream gameplay.I'm pumped for some possible new cards and heroes, and I'm happy to have purchased this game, a low price for a really good content.

												I bought and downloaded this game because it sounded interesting and because the reviews were good - but I didn't play it for a month or so.While the grpahics are decent, the models were a bit cartoony, and it turned me off initially.  After my third match, though, I was seriously hooked.  The games has TONS of replayability, and the blend of deck-building strategy coupled with twitch reflexes keeps me playing long after I should stop.There are tons of achievments, tons of ""quests"" (both roughly the same in concept).  You cna customize the difficulty of the gameplay (thus impacting the rewards) in a number of ways.  The game has a knack of letting you feel indestructable, and then putting you in your proper place (re. smear on the floor).Anyhoo, I REALLY like the combination of strategy, reflex skills and randomness this game mixes together.

												First impressions:FORCED SHOWDOWN combines everything I like in video games.The combat is skill based and offers on the fly strategy solving skills. It has a great difficulty curve that makes me want to hone my skills to become better as time goes.The card system takes some beats from Hearthstone in how decks are created. Playing cards and combos at the start of each round offers a great way to shake up the rounds.The few things I don't like really boil down to there being less boss characters than I would like, but the levels vary enough that each time you fight a boss it will feel a bit different.View my full first impressions here:

												FORCED SHOWDOWN is, as many have stated, a combination of League of Legends, Diablo and Hearthstone with some rogue-like elements thrown in the mix. It's also a continuation of Forced, which was a 2013 co-op action RPG with decent reviews (currently at 75% on steam).You control one of the four champions and take part in a competition, whereyour goal is to successfully beat all of the battles, each consisting of eight arenas and ending with a boss battle. The principle is quite simple and there is no real story included. Instead, the focus lies on action and building your deck. The game also containts a certain type of humor that I found amusing, the first boss you encounter is a giant rat called Ratbo which spews out oneliners from Rambo. There are a lot of other references and they can be really funny at times.The combat is based on twin-stick shooters, you have (usualy) two abilities and a basic attack which can also be charged up. There is a decent enemy variety however after about 4 hours, you'll start seeing the same enemies over and over again. I mean, it's not really that big a deal and you don't have to have hundreds of different enemies to make a game enjoyable, but as I've discovered with Binding of Isaac, it certainly helps. This is expecialy true for rogue-like games, where you'll be doing the same maps a lot.Deck building works simmiliar to Hearthstone, you buy new cards with gold you get from runs and then make a deck of 30 cards, consisting of neutral and class cards. Each card has a mana cost and the whole mana mechanic is idential to Hearthstone. Something I really would have liked is the adition of minion cards, which would summon minions to help you in a battle. There are already a couple of arena modifiers and a couple of boss cards that work like that, I think it would fit really well into the game, at least if the AI of the summoned minions would be improved.That is also one of the things that were bothering me quite a lot, you have a companion and their AI can sometimes make them do stupid things. They sometimes simply walk into traps and enemy fire or get stuck, resulting in their deaths. Not a problem most of the time, since you can't really rely on them to much anyway, however one of the arena modifiers deals 30 damage to you when your companion dies. This brings us to the graphics, FORCED SHOWDOWN looks quite simmiliar to the original FORCED, however a lot of things were improved. I really liked the overall look and feel. Abilities pack quite a punch, making them very enjoyable to use. The sound quality is quite nice too (however the announcer can get annoying after a few hours). ConclusionRecently, more and more games have started to implement card mechanics, however most of them don't do a very good job. FORCED SHOWDOWN, however, implemented them really well. Deck building is certainly the most enjoyable thing and it helps to keep up the variety, because you will be doing the same things over and over and in that regard, the game can get really repetitive. I would certainly like to see more bosses, enemies and heroes, but that might just be me. It's still one of the better games I've played recently and I would recommend it to both card game fans and rogue-like fans alike.EDIT: I've noticed there is a DLC coming out at the end of june which will increase the variety.

												Forced Showdown is not your regular twin stick shooter.It combines the best elements of twin-sticks, hero-abilities and collectible card game into one cohesive game.You can pick between different heroes each with their vastly different skillset and a companion that helps you. You progress through multiple arenas which consist of 2 phases.The first phase is the card phase where you can play cards from your hand that either improve your character, or give you short time benefits.After that you play the arena where the shooting happens. Each arena takes ~1-2minutes after which you transfer into a new arena and start the process anew.After 7 arenas you will meet a boss that has a high health pool and multiple unique abilities to defeat. If you defeat it you will end this arena set(called battle) and pick from a set of new battles.Each Battle has up to 5 permanent modifiers that change the flow of the battle and your strategy. They range from simple ones like “meteors fly around the place” to crazy ones like “when your companion gets hit, it attacks you until you kill another dude”.The combination of those modifiers can lead to depending on your specific deck very difficult scenarios or make you incredibly powerful. To offset a bit of the beneficial modifiers, the arenas in the battle will have more enemies.When you die or are victorious after several battles you get awarded Gold depending on how far you got for your efforts which you can spend to get more cards. Important to know: unlike many card-games in Forced Showdown there are no microtransactions and thus the frequency of getting new cards is pretty high. ( iirc i completed my collection after 30 hours of play).Most of the obtainable cards are very creative mixed with good staple cards. There are not many cards that feel uninspired. They drastically change your abilities without being the boring “5% dmg yay”. They are more along the lines of “when you take dmg, you deal more dmg for a while”. Of course there are some plain stat upgrades in there, but not as much. They inspire you to build a wide variety of decks to try them all out.Last but not least there are Daily challenges which are very hard, but lets you compare yourself with your friends and requires specific deckbuilding depending on the modifiers present.With all these switching variables the game always feels fresh and i still log on pretty much every day to play a few rounds.ProsDistinct heroeshigh replayability!!!!Looks goodFrequent free patchesGood mix of strategy and actionFun humourCons Sometimes connection issues with daily server (prevents online play, but progressing still possible)No Co-Op ( i didn't expect coop but some people might think it had like the previous title)this review has been edited to reflect that the issues have been resolvedthe DLC is well worth it aswell with a new unique and powerful character aswell as new cards and modifiers. just plain solid!

												Forced by Betadwarf was an interesting attempt at co-op-based game design from the new studio. Following that game, the team went to work on a completely different game design and the results are Forced: Showdown. Featuring a combination of ARPG and CCG design, this is an impressive idea from the studio.On with the Show:Forced: Showdown only has the word, ""Forced"" as the only relation to the previous game. Taking place in the far future, Forced: Showdown is a popular TV show where contestants fight for glory and prizes against insane odds. You'll start as one hero with the ability to unlock three more as the game goes on; the heroes have different abilities and card possibilities (more on those in a minute.)Playing the game is built around the following structure. You select a campaign to play, along with a champion and deck. Each campaign is broken up into several sections where you must play battles to unlock the boss fight to move on.Each battle is made up of seven arenas that you have to fight through with different conditions. Play through two battles and then fight and win against the boss to complete the section and move on to the next.While there isn't much of a story, Betadwarf has implemented a lot of ways to keep you playing and coming back for more, thanks to meta-game design and the CCG play.Decked Out:Forced: Showdown is a great example of meta-game design used to elevate a game's design.  Beyond the four different characters, there are multiple ways of improving your characters and chances at survival. Let's start with the biggest one: your deck.You can design a deck out of all the cards you have unlocked from the main menu. The cards you find are broken down by rarity, their type and if they are character exclusive. You can have a total of 30 cards in one deck, and as with any good CCG, you'll quickly have to make tough choices as to what to include.The cards themselves don't change the characters in the sense of giving them new abilities, but they are used to modify them and the conditions of the arena fight. For instance, you can get a card for the squire of light that gives him an extra AOE attack when he uses his power. That card can also be stacked, allowing you to then triple the AOE blast if you get them both on at a time.Cards are rated by their mana cost, and by default, you'll gain one additional mana point per arena over the set of levels. This prevents you from using your best stuff at the start and makes it so that you need to properly balance your deck costs. Unlocking new cards requires an in-game resource of gold.With gold, you can spin the wheel of fortune to unlock new cards, or get shards that can be used to construct a random card of a given rarity. It's important to note that there are no microtransactions in the game; to get you more gold, you can only get it by playing.You'll also find quests to do that are broken down by sets. Complete the set of quests and you'll get a permanent reward unlocked for your characters; usually in the form of stat increases and gold. In the campaign, you can pick up points that will be used to unlock boons which are another passive buff for your characters. These boons remain active for the length of the campaign, while the quest rewards stay active forever.Besides the campaign, you can also run daily challenges with different conditions and get ranked on the Forced: Showdown leader board.Forced: Showdown's embrace of CCG mechanics does a lot to elevate the gameplay, which is very important, because the base gameplay doesn't have long legs in my opinion.Mid Season Finale:Forced: Showdown shows both the benefits and limitations of a CCG-based system. While the game offers a lot of flexibility and personalization on the player's part, the actual gameplay is pretty limited. The game at the moment has four heroes with four unique moves each. The actual controlling of them is very simple; you can't perform any advanced moves like dodging out of the way or unlock new abilities to slot in.Because of the limitations in the characters, the game becomes very repetitive from the player's standpoint. The developers were smart to randomly select what battle conditions and even the enemy cards that can get played in a campaign, but it's not enough to avoid the feeling of repetition or change the goal of each arena. As with other CCG-based games, it's going to take a very long time before you can unlock a wide variety of cards and quest bonuses, and I'm just not sure at this point if there is enough here to keep someone playing for the long run.One suggestion would be to give the player control of the campaign structure with cards that could increase or decrease the difficulty while impacting the rewards.Something to mix things up after someone has down a campaign for the umpteenth time grinding for gold.An issue that I ran into was how the game was skewed against melee heroes. Since there are no ways to actively dodge attacks, going melee puts you in range of enemies who can quickly attack you between swings, or bosses with strong attacks at close range.Also, because of the random cards from the enemies and the modifiers chosen, the difficulty of a campaign can swing at the drop of a hat.For instance, I lost an entire campaign run literally because of one modifier that completely went against my character. I would like to be able to see what the modifiers do ahead of time, instead of having to remember them.Renewal:Forced: Showdown may be a complete departure from the first game, but it's an amazing foot forward and a much stronger foundation for the series. There are many ways for Betadwarf to continue growing things if the game does well.

												I purchased FORCED Showdown in December 2014 and have been monitoring the game's progress throughout. It's changed dramatically in early access and am very impressed at how they've innovated within the genre. I couldn't be more pleased with my purchase and am looking forward to experimenting with different deck types and strategies.Features:4 characters, each with their own hero-specific cards.3 companion petsHundreds of cards to unlockPros:Great longevity. I would estimate there's at least 40 hours of content in this game, depending on how much you love roguelites and deckbuilding. Diverse playstylesAttentive devs-- this can't be understated.Neutral:Balance is still actively being tweaked. Just yesterday, there was an update that made some of my key cards less powerful but also less costly to play. Cons:Some more direct way to challenge other players aside from leaderboards would be cool. Like queueing up for bracketed PvE tournaments.			"

												This is like many roguelikes you're used to, where you pick a bonus between stages. However, you're picking bonuses from a card deck that you built, and you unlock cards through playing--no microtransactions! This mechanic is cleverly developed and well thought-out, and adds an immense amount of depth to the four-character game.Of course, the enemy boss for each battle also plays its own card deck, throwing potentially lethal combinations of modifiers at you, which keeps the combat interesting and challenging.I enjoyed the first FORCED despite it being rather one-note. This game is excellent and I would recommend picking it up.			"

												It plays like I always felt ARPGs and MOBAs should - skillshots, accuracy, timing and evasion; button mashing and brute-force will get you nowhere in this game. The deckbuilding is fun and meaningful, the bosses have a lite-MMO raid boss feel to them, the heroes each have their own weapons, skills and playstyle, and the modifiers placed on arenas are interesting and keep the gameplay fresh. Overall, this is a unique, fun and incredibly satisfying experience. My only gripe 11 hours in is the performance - I have trouble keep a stable 60 on anything above the lowest graphics setting though my PC meets and beats the recommended specs.

												Easily one of my favorite games of 2016. Forced Showdown has near endless replay value and very fun gameplay. The heroes have their own feel and playstyle which all feel viable/strong. The cards are also more diverse than one would think from this sort of game. There are a ton of different deck types and strategies you could use between all the heroes. And it's all wrapped into a fun progression system that makes getting further into the ""shows"" even more exciting.Get it. It's fun.			"

YouTube™ Video: Forced Showdown (Review):  Hammer Time 

			Views: 1,454		

			In the heat of battle, do you have what it takes to survive? This key was obtained from the developer for review purposes.		

  Summary: Games have been using Twitch well to promote themselves before launch, and Forced Showdown did well in tying the launch discount with Twitch minutes watched. But don't let that gimmick make you overlook a game that's solid in the Action RPG genre. It's roguelite elements in the card deck building genre are pretty good: as there's good card variety here and a nice selection of heroes. Combat does strong at first, in particular in the challenge area, and yet the game is still fair. Now over time, the variety does start to get hurt if you don't keep unlocking new content, which can be a challenge with some of the stuff that the game throws at you at times. But that takes a lot longer then other games in this specific combination of genre elements, and I was still having fun at 10+ hours with no problems. The game delivers in a bang from buck perspective, even without the discount. Just be ready to deal with some performance issues (especially on the end of waves), that never hit game breaking, but are very annoying.  Lists: Positives: Good Series of Heroes with different play styles that hit a good spectrum of typical Action RPG basics (melee, ranged, etc.) Good set of cards that don't hit just the typical stat boosts, but have significant boosts to abilities and some interesting side effects.  Enemies present aren't cookie cutter, like the buggy that swing around a laser over and over again, or an enemy specifically designed for you to not kill. Difficulty is good with its roguelite elements. You have to pay attention to what the opponent is playing, or you'll find yourself dead as you charged in recklessly to take a ton of damage. Like the Twitch formula and taking the game show/spectacle format to a meta level. Controls are where they need to be for a game like this. In particular with mouse/keyboard and the archer, which gives the precision you need to fire around corners.  The puns are strong with this game. And as a pun lover, I have absolutely no problem with that. In game models do have some significant detail on them.Negatives: Performance can be an issue, in particular with ending the round and the loading associated with it. Frame drops now and again.  Lacks any sort of strong narrative or story. While the presentation elements do work in terms of a game show, you have no real idea who these characters are. If this is important to you, this game may not be for you. Explosions/Lasers lack an oompf. This was tested by turning off the sounds and seeing their impact/hearing the lack of impact. Seems to me that it's mostly visual, and they really didn't feel different otherwise. Over time, the game loses Variety. Usually this is high on my negatives list, but Forced Showdown does a reasonable job of keeping that from happening soon, as after 10+ hours, you were unlocking new content and finding new stuff still. It's just as a rate smaller then I would like for a game like this.  Very Minor: The game does at times lose a bit of its spectacle thanks to its isometric view. This is sorta unavoidable due to the genre.  "

												Somewhere between FORCED's arbitrary puzzles and Gauntlet's monotony stands FORCED SHOWDOWN... and it's GLORIOUS! The graphics and animation are beautiful and smooth without slowdown or long load times, the gameplay and abilities are easy to execute but far from overwhelming, and the feature of gaining random buffs and obstacles as you climb through the gauntlet reminds me of well... a real gladitorial gauntlet. And I LOVE IT! If FORCED SHOWDOWN came with an online multiplayer mode, I'd recommend buying it in a 4-pack. Even as a solo game, this may easily be one of my favorite games of 2016. Nice work, guys! Now if only I'd remember to try out FORCED now that it's finished.Also, Caesar really found his role in this after FORCED, as an announcer with singsong moments. No longer campy, now he's just peppy!			"

												This game is great. Simply great. Simple as in simple to pick up and you learn it SOOO fast. It's learning curve is excellent as well, and the game is so addicting already. I have watched and played with great interrest, and I can say, they have made some very good choices from the start (The rush) later to Eternal Arenas(The Showdown).The game itself i really simple. It's like forced 1, but without multiplayer, and is now less puzzle and more rougelike. It works perfectly, and with the incorporation of the Card mechanic, which is executed really well, adds a lot of fun to this. The game also looks really good. The aesthetics are amazing in the game. It's interresting and unique. Now, since it's a showdown, you are in a television program, fighting through hordes to end up as the winner of the show, 3 in total. There will be dailies, or seasons, which will bring even more value once you've done all the shows. Even then, I played them over just to try another champion. There is much more than I wrote, but it's purely singleplayer as of right now, except when the daily leaderbord is up. Well done, BetaDwarf, truly. Now go and buy this game, and...prepare to die.. A lot!			"

												Games it reminds me off:Hands of FateNuclear ThroneGalak-ZPlayed it with both X-Box 360 controller and Mouse+Keyboard. Both with good results. M+K is obviously more precise, but the movement is somewhat more accurate on controller (and it's more relaxing).Positives:The deck-building works well. I was a bit worried it would just be another tagged-on deckbuilding mechanic, but it never seems constrictive, there's enough variety to test out several combinations with obvious benefits, and the progress of getting new cards doesn't seem stiffling.The different characters you can play have very distinct playing styles, further expanded by specialization through cards, which makes playing the game as a different character an almost new experience - sometimes lending an entirely new perspective to enemy-types you had previously considered pushovers or menaces.Really feels like it rewards deliberate and exact play.Negative:I am not sure I will get all the cards before I feel like I got what I could out of the game, which is a shame, because sometimes you feel like you are just a few cards off before making a certain deck work.

												High tempo rogue-like with an awesome amount of replay value. The deck-building aspect gives it a neat twist allowing you to specialize in several play-styles for each champion, some global and some character-specific. The gameplay is very rewarding once you start recognizing the different pattern each enemy has - and you are able to bind that together with the randomized buffs and debuffs is battle is featuring - though some initial frustration is be expected at that sweet spot where you think you have it under control and then try something flashy. Though very different from the first forced game (no more puzzle solving, but a lot more fighting) the universe has stayed consistent and the setting is awesome to play in.			"

												I did not really knbow what to expect when I heard about this game, but it interest me enough to try it, and I love it! Its quite a good combination of game mechanics. I would describe it kind of like playing a weird combination of Torchlight and Hearthstone in an arena combat format. Its really well paced, its fun, its challanging and rewarding all at the same time. Customizing your character is like building a deck in hearthstone, every round you get 1 mana added to your pool starting from 1 and you have a hand of cards with cost that buff your character up to 8 rounds which is a boss round. you get more cards as you play to customize your deck more and more. It also has that ""just 1 more game"" hold on you since the rounds are pretty short.			"

												This is an awesome game! (If you're into rougelike games with a card game on top)The challenging gameplay keeps you frustrated and addicted at the same time. The game has a decent introduction to the mechanics and overall rules of the game. When they are mastered it is off to do arena after arena to earn gold to buy cards to ultimately better your chances of winning more gold and more cards in the arenas. So an infinite loop of fun.However it can get repetitive to run arena after arena to get more cards and thereby grow stronger as a character. Since there is no end goal in the game, other than getting better at the game and growing your card stack.This is the strongest and weakest point of the game. You get stronger for every card you earn, but if you lose sight of your progression you might lose interest in the game. This is not to say that the gameplay is not fun, challenging or exciting, because it is.... It definitely is. Every match is a new beginning and the frustration of getting a bad card or the relief of getting a good one has an emotional impact on you every time.It is a game you can play for a short periods of time and still get something out of, which is a nice change of pace compared to longer games. You can boot-up the game and play for 10 minutes and have a blast in those 10 minutes. That makes this game a nice ""let-me-just-clear-my-head"" game. The only ""downside"" is that you might get hooked in those 10 minutes and unable to stop for the next hour or two. ( This happens to me all the time)To recap: A really addicting and challenging game with a nice touch of randomness to it. You might lose track of the main goal in the game, but you will soon forget that when you are blasting your way through enemies and earning cards.			"

												at first i thought i was going to hate this game because i tried playing the original FORCED with friends and even though it was a good game it just made us mad at each other. this game is different, and furthermore it's a blast to play. the card system seems odd or even counter-intuitive at first, but after playing a few rounds you get the hang of it and soon you'll be making new decks with your (admitedly small at first) collection of cards. there's a real strategy and rhythm to it, and the game keeps throwing curveballs at you just to be sure you're on your toesthere's probably a few things i don't like about it, but i can't think of any right now...

												Like many working their way through the public school system, I had a years long fling with Magic: The Gathering. Besides piles of cardboard still littered around my apartment, what I took away from my time with Magic was an appreciation for all the little moving parts of a game, whether that game is physical or digital. The interactions between mechanics, the thousands of permutations possible between two decks, the arcane rules that cause both excitement and frustration—it’s all fascinating to me. FORCED SHOWDOWN has a bit of that same magic, turning the power ups and items that fuel a roguelite’s procedural systems into cards you can place into a deck. It’s not perfect, but it is a neat twist on the genre that kept me engaged throughout my time with the game.Want to know more? Read my full review of the game over  at TechRaptor	[techraptor.net] "

												TL;DR is that -FORCED- : Showdown is a really good game with a ton of potential for growth. My advice? Pick it up and spread the word. Words, many of them (handle it), below.NOTE: This review was written during the private beta period before launch, thanks to winning a code in a stream (Twitch's RockLeeSmile, to be specific) from the developer's launch event. As such, I am reviewing a game that I received for free, more or less, from the largesse of the devs. Feel free to take that into account.I came into this game from a Polygon video review that didn't exactly show it off in the most flattering light (blame one of the worst members on Polygon's video team for that disfavor). From there I hit the Steam page and found the developers' unique little Twitch-fueled discount and giveaway pre-launch event. I found a streamer I recognized from YT and hopped in, expecting a decent Ziggurat / Isaac style arena roguelite with mild card-based elements. What I found was actually a slick, well-designed and visually exciting game with some serious chops on every level. The world they're assembling is fun and interesting without being overwrought or ridiculous. The card mechanics go above and beyond the realm of ""feature"" and into this being a true deckbuilder with serious depth. The actual gameplay is frantic, well-balanced, nicely paced and not too hard yet not too simple. The pre-launch event is a really clean and well-designed piece of work as opposed to a contrived ploy for attention, and it organically builds a community in a really smart way. If I had to bring up any downsides, it's one of the most fixable: In its current launch state, the game doesn't have enough variety in terms of enemies, levels, and especially bosses. Given the devs' update plans? I doubt that will be a problem for long.			"

												An arena rogue-like 'game-show' that truelly lives up to what it offers. I saw Forced (the first game) and was very tempted by it for a long time, but then I waited for this game instead when I heard of it... I then waited very patiently for the summer sale and VOILA!! I'd just purhcased one of the best games in my library!This rogue-like includes deck building, which you then take in with you into games. Each round (arena) you get a card or two and get mana to cast on them - Simple really. But it is done fantasticly so! The variation in the cards is noticable, which makes each one generally unique and useful in it's own way + (as is expected really) each different character gets their own unique upgrade cards, which affect abilities in various ways. 10/10 on this part of the game, the deck building is smooth, easy and beautiful. The artwork of the cards is very nice. And each card feels unique - Everything you could want.The gameplay is AMAZINGLY smooth, even on ultra settings. I'm extremely impressed with the optimisation + zero bugs discovered. Entire 'game shows' (start to finish) can take anywhere between 10-40 minutes, depending on difficulty and if you die... But of course, you can hop out and jump back in at any point, so no need to do the entire thing in one session! Bonus points from me for this! Each character is completely different, and each playstyle stays true to what it says it is. 10/10 for the gameplay aspects from me, I couldn't ask for anything more from this! Perhaps a few more characters, but it is early days I guess so who knows!Music... The music and ambience sounds are great, but it can get a liiiiiitlle repetative. It's not the end of the world though as they don't occur too often, and it's the gameplay itself that counts! The sounds and special affects of abilities/creatures etc are spot on. No lags or misleading noises that confuse the player - It's all exactly as it should be. 8/10 for this - As said some things can get a little repetative, and I wish there was a little more variation in dialogue. Not game changing though.So I highly recommend this game. It's very unique in it's own way, and with a good community going on, 4 different types of daily runs that even the pros seem to struggle with means it ain't an easy game either and there's constantly plenty to dig into! Each battle has different combinations of battle enhancements (good & bad) meaning variation is in abundance too ;) Do enjoy if you pick it up, I'm sure you will!			"

												Fast paced rogue-lite arena brawler / ""twin-stick shooter"" with interesting setting (as a TV show).You can choose between 4 different heroes - each with totally different playstyle (AoE focused caster, glass cannon, combo ""enrage"" fighter and melee heavy hitter) + one of 3 companions to aid you.Main meat of the game is you fight in multiple rounds of small arenas (2-5 mins each) until you reach a boss. Rince and repeat until you reach the final boss of the show (in like an hour).Twist of the game is, that you also build a deck of cards (permanent buffs, spells, etc.) that you play throughout your run and become stronger and gain new modifiers to your abilities - thus getting that ""leveling up a new character"" vibe.After each run you get random new cards that can improve your deck (so there is permanent progression) and you start over (later even with optional challenges).Easy to jump into, hard to master, lots of fun in between...

												Probably the most fun you could have for $20 ;) Well legally at any rate...The game description and video's describe full well what you're getting into,My friend asked me to describe it to him and the best I came up with was a chaotic Zelda game mashed with card battle.... and maybe a dash of Darksouls (""You died but at least it was fun to watch."")  If either piece was missing the game wouldn't be as fun to be honest. They've done a nice job so far as I've seen in the game with the combat system and cards. I've started to branch out to the different ""Contestants"" and think all of them could be viable if you build a good deck for them... makes me want to earn more cards which is a good thing. :) The boss battles are challeging with the different fighting styles it takes some watching to see what they do before you go rushing in. And even then at times I find myself walking right into a rocket > < Even the regular minions are enough to dash you to pieces if you're not careful sometimes...Anywho...It's a good game, not expensive, and being well suported by the dev team. Don't think you could ask for more.			"

												Underdog developer Betadwarf follows up their tragically overlooked but wonderfully entertaining co-op action puzzle game Forced with a single player sequel in the form of Forced Showdown. This game mixes rogue-lite session-based gameplay with twin stick action combat and a healthy does of deck building and card game mechanics. What comes out the otherside is truly a sight to behold and you're welcome to watch me gush about it for a half hour if you really want more info:

												Extremely fun, engaging and above all addictive. Graphics and voice acting is supreme and the concept that's evolved over the last few months has really brought the game together in the most positive way. Introduction is great and it starts out slowly enough for everyone to take part. If you're a veteran rogue-lite/dungeon-crawler player, start may feel a bit slow, but beware - the curve becomes crazy steep once you get further into the game, and luck plays a massive component (as with any game involving CCG). Forced Showdown is very much a ""git gud or git dead""-game, and once you start, it's hard to stop challenging yourself. If you don't like to die over and over, this ain't the game for you :P			"

												Ask yourself two questions1: Do you like deckbuilding games?2: Do you like action gamesIf yes, then Forced showdown is a game for you!Forced Showdown is a spinoff from Forced that was a splendd Co-op game, where Forced Showdown is a single-player game ATM. The game lets you make a deck consisting of 30 cards. No more than 2 of same cards is allowed.You choose 4 champions (5 with expansion) that either is meele oriented or ranged. Each champions have a diffrent aproach regarding active and passive skills. It takes skills to master them all.A similar game idea is Hand of Fate that also is action-based with deckbuilding feature. The diffrence between them is that in Hand of Fate you could randomly start with the BiS cards in the beginning (after you have collected them of course) making the game really easy. Where in Forced Showdown each card has a manacost. Each new arena in a battle gives you more and more mana to spend on those awsome late-game cards. But until you reach late arenas you har stuck on relying on early cards and skill, wich is a good thing =). You also get a pet companion that help you in each arena. You can chose one from three companions once unlockedAquire new cards is done by spending gold that you earn in-game. You get a random card that is divided between 3 raritys. You can have max 2 of each. If you get a third copy, that card will automaticly be converted to shards that is spent on making new cards that is guaranteed to be a new card.The game have many achivments. Each achivment is part of a quest. When a quest is completed you get in-game rewards. Be it more gold, shards or a special boost, that is up to you to find out =)All in all. This is a very good game that provides deckbuilidng, action, achivment hunting and grinding.Best game 2016!10/10			"

Also there is a decent amount of content and the progression system feels very well paced.The biggest downside is probably the complete lack of multiplayer.Basically: If you do not expect this to be Forced 2, then it is a pretty fun game and probably worth your time.Commented gameplay:

The graphics are very pleasing and varied as well and I just love the puffs!Definitely recommend 5/5!			"

												As a big fan of roguelite genre, I can say that this game is quite fun. Upgrading you character by using cards is a fun way of making this game replayable and unique. ---Problem with current build (29.03.2016)---Not sure that is this game on early access or still development phase but there is a huge bug right now. For some reason, game alt tabs all the time and it is pretty much unplayable. Already sent a bug report about this but looks like they didn't fix it yet. I tried to remove my gamepad, disabling it and verify game files but no luck. Hopefully they will fix it soon.An unique consept with nice graphics and gameplay. You should buy this if you enjoy roguelites! "

 TL;DR.  If you like Card games, ARPG style slashers, and randomly generated rules and dungeons. Buy it and you wont regret it. Want to share some info that i was mission when i was wonfering will i like this game or not.This gave is a mix of Card game and Randomly generated arena fights, where cards are your skills  (passive, active, ect.)Core gameplay is to finish a ""show"", wich consists of ""X"" number of arena runs. For each run you earn coins and unlock new cards with them. Creating new decks, and trying to finish THE SHOW. There are three of them ATM, wich consider to be a ""story"" . I really hope there will be more. With 4 hours ive completed 1 Show, and half way with second one.Each Arena have its own RULES wich is Random each run. (summon additional strong mob, or meteor storm rainig all fight.)At the endgame, there are lots of diffrent challanges with endless count of rules sets. "

												I recently bought the division but can't seem to make myself want to play it over this little gem that I backed on Kickstarter.Fantastic little rogue-like twin stick shooter that takes many different elements from a few games and pulls off a unique experience. Easily one of the best games as well when it comes to achievements which it merges into it's in-game quest system, sometimes you have to make decks specific to get an achievement. It really keeps you going. It's challenging but not unfair ever and the variety is decent, not perfect, a few more heroes might be fun but the daily challenges keep the game fresh.It is not without it's flaws though, a few crashes here and there, as well as a memory leak it seems (game gets super slow and is more prone to crash the longer you play). But the devs update the game all the time and I think we'll see these problems ironed out fairly soon.			"

												It's like Heathstone and DotA had a roguelite baby! And it's a really awesome baby with fires and explosions and snake monsters!To explain it as simply as I can, it's a series of condensed roguelite arenas using hero characters with a set of roughly 4 abilities (there are 4 available at the moment). At the beginning of the 8 floors in each arena you get the opportunity to play cards using mana. The card system works a lot like hearthstone: gain 1 total mana every turn/floor and get it refilled.Characters start out with a pre-constructed deck, and with a currency you get for achievements in-game you can obtain a larger collection of the 150ish cards! Cards vary from consumable items to spells to upgrades that remain all the way to the end of the dungeon.That about covers it. Some people seem to be experiencing crashes, but I've not experienced anything like that, so I can't comment. Just keep it in mind. Feel free to comment with any questions!			"

												This game. . .  is simply amazing imho. I watched some youtube videos of people playing it. It LOOKED like something I would like but I hadnt heard much about it. Man, am I glad i picked it up. If you liked the old game Super Smash Tv. . . it kinda reminds me of that but with loot/deck building element. The deck building is amazing. You grind for cards that empower whatever character you decide to play. The arenas you play in are random. I think the replayability for this game is through the roof. I only wish it had multiplayer. But, it has other really cool features such as different arenas having different rulesets and you also have ""dailies"" you can do to get different things. The combat is fun but not overly complex. The voice acting is entertaining and the graphics are easy on the eyes. Definitely worth a try. You will know within 2 hours if its a game for you for sure.			"

												This game is very captivating - it really draws you in, and you really need ""just one more go"" - For me, if I play a game with roguelike difficulty, there needs to be progression between attempts, otherwise I am just wasting my time - Forced Showdown delivers, on so many levels.			"

												I'm at a loss for what to say about this game. It combines Gauntlet with CCG and roguelike elements, mixes well, bakes for 15 minutes on 'awesome' and the end result is something that, honestly, is a real hidden gem of a game that I can see eating up a ton of my time playing over and over. Emblems add replay value to what would otherwise seem to be a pretty short game, ramping up the difficulty in a customizeable way so that things are just challenging enough to be fun without being overwhelming...unless you want it to be! Completing 'quests' by getting achievements gives permanent boosts to your characters to make things more manageable, though it's hard, if not impossible, to know what achievements complete what quests until you do one on accident (or look up a guide). Just needs a multiplayer mode and it'd be 10/10, but without it's 'only' 9/10. Still, worth picking up.			"

												This game is absolutely wonderful and the developers are great.  They are indie developers to the max - just check this Imgur album: http://imgur.com/gallery/yacucU1I love their games and they work so hard.  I bought this just because I heard their story and I'm glad I did.  If you like top-down shooters that are heavy on permadeath and RNG but have a very strategic layer of abstraction, this game is for you.  I don't want to write a whole review yet but if you want a mixture of Hand of Fate and The Binding of Issac, this game is absolutely for you.			"

												Forced Showdown is a singleplayer arena action roguelike card game. A ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ mouthful if I say so.You fight through multiple arenas to get to the boss while buffing yourself to be stronger. In this game you can make insane amount of decks, but they can fall pretty much to the same type of decks. Going just upgrade decks with some healing consumables, full-on consumable decks, class card decks and spell decks.There are 4 different heroes (1 dlc hero extra) with like 2-3 abilities and most of them have a passive. All heroes also have their own class specific cards. Spin move with fireballs. Volcanic Strike that splits in to 2 or 3 and even a card that makes the range infinite. 2 of those cards and it'll loops once again. Those examples were for Volco, but he's probably my least favorite hero.I probaby don't like him as much because he gets locked in place when you use his Volcanic strike or auto-attack. I've got hit too many times, ♥♥♥♥ him. Some characters like Stormbringer and Squire of Light then have really op class cards. You can basically just pick them and automatically win.Ravager is my favorite hero but his class cards are butt. Like really weak, but he's hella strong with pure damage cards. His only weakness is the new dlc boss because Ravagers strong point is staying on the boss and using invulnerability frames to stay alive. The dlc robot ninja boss keeps teleporting away making it hard to chip away his health.My interest in the game came back strong with the new dlc and it added the needed enemy variety. More cards and a Maze making the game very interesting again.I finally got the 100% achievements in the game but one of them were bugged until a recent game update. So they are still fixing the game. Which is a good thing, I at least didn't see that many bugs until I was almost done with the game.I do recommend the main game and the dlc even with full price. A ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ good roguelike card game whatever.			"

												I don't remember when I had so much fun with game last time. It is one of the ""Just one more try"" things. Just keep 3 things in mind before purchasing:1. If you don't play too much fast placed bullet-hell-like games, it is HARD.2. Don't expect to have every card after few hours.3. If you get a little bored with first Program, just keep going. There is much more fun after that.Sometimes I choose harder maps for fun. Turns out meteors from the sky, fireballs from one side, 2x faster time and 100% more dmg is not something you want to try. Trust me.			"

												I'm re-writing my review for this game, after giving it another shot. My first impression of this game was really bad, though I had a pretty bad set of arenas and I didnt like the starting character. CGamer commented on my review as seen here: http://i.imgur.com/AxIAbgy.png Massive props to him for going out of his way to get me another coupon (though refunding it did actually return it to me but its that he went out of his way to actually do it that counts). After reinstalling and conceding the first game to unlock a second character, the game became A LOT more enjoyable.So first off let me explain why I didnt like the game the first time:The squire of light is the character you start with. He's pretty basic and really easy to play. I'd first bought the game thinking it was multiplayer (Which was bad on my part) so I then started treating it as a single player game and wanted to see if I'd like it before the 2 hour refund time. The Squire of light was just boring to play to me. The game was so that I didnt know if I'd be challenged at all, I barely got hit after I'd played the first 2 arenas, everything died incredibly fast and the characters playstyle just didnt apeal to me. On top of all of that, I randomly selected the same 2 templates multiple times and didnt have any fun fights in them anyways.The second time I played:I played Volcar (I think is his name, the hammer guy). He's melee, he's got a melee attack that you can chargre rather than just aiming a laser at people, his starting deck is really fun, and most importantly his playstyle was alot more what I was looking for. I never played him in the original FORCED because my friends would pick him, so I intially went in thinking I'd try to make myself really tanky, because that's what I enjoy normally. But I quickly found that stacking as much offense and playing like a berserker was what I really enjoyed about him. Not only that but I got different tile sets this time and actually had some close counters in combat that made me really enjoy it alot more. As well as encountering new, harder enemies on tile sets I'd seen before.Aside from my personal experiences of the game, I've always thought that the whole concept of the game is awesome. I love roguelikes, and if you do too, you'll most likely like this game as well. There's heavy replayability in the way you can build your character between each game. You've got your deck which you can customize, you get delt different cards each individual arena fight. Across a single campaign you'll basically 'level up' and get a set of boons to pick from that can give you different buffs. So as per your typical roguelike, you can be delt a very bad hand that can make your run very hard. Luckily in this game you can most likely just outskill everything despite being weak from what cards/boons you're offered. Which is something I love. Challenge and replayability is important in roguelikes. Anyways, I just wanted to update my review so this game has the rating it deserves. I'll probably update it as updates for the game come out and as I get further in the game.			"

YouTube™ Video: Forced Showdown Review | PC Gameplay and Performance 

			Views: 11,325		

			This video was done using review code provided by the developer. Timecode to skip to Options/Performance: https://youtu.be/e0uAI-cusAg?t=5m35s Forced Showdown by Beta Dwarf ""Action and deckbuilding...		

What is Forced Showdown?  It’s a Galactic Gameshow where you’re the contestant competing in gladiator battles to become a crowd favorite.  But that’s not where the game ends.  They also found a way to cram Hearthstone into it.  It’s actually hilariously obvious how the devs are huge Blizzard fans, because the game even has Treasure Goblins, sort of.  Don’t take that for a criticism though.  They have done so in a creative way.So where does the Hearthstone mention come in to play?  Well, each arena run is based on a deck of cards.  The match starts with a 4 card draw from a 30 card deck.  You can keep the cards or mulligan them.  You also have a mana bar which increases by one for each subsequent arena match in a particular gladiator battle you win.  The cards are comprised of upgrade cards which increase damage or other abilities directly, spells which have unique instant effects such as gaining mana temporarily or drawing a new card that costs less, and last consumables which give you for the most part single arena active skills temporarily like throwing a powerful bomb.The gameplay is very satisfying with great effects, solid visceral abilities and nice quick action.  Where the game really shines though is in the audio.  I mean this in the nicest way possible.  This is an indie game and is the second title from Beta Dwarf.  It’s got no business having audio this good.  The voice acting is absolutely top notch with an amazing announcer introducing the lead up into the matches, great boss voices and an incredible blood pumping action heavy sound track. As with any game there are some elements that aren’t so great.  To start with, there is a limited selection of 4 heroes and 3 companions.  This is the kind of game that doesn’t rely on the levels to be the unique element and as a result, I’d liked to have seen more player characters.  The cards do have some character specific variants, so I can see how that would complicate things, but I think it’s worth the effort.I’m not a huge fan of some of the UI choices.  The card wheel where you spend your gold on new cards feels janky and cheap compared to the rest of the experience.  The UI for building decks has a fair bit of visual overlap on what is clickable while filtering cards and I found it a bit awkward to use.  And the UI for showing quests also feels pretty bare bones.  For a game that is as flashy as this, these UI elements are boring.It also has some very long load times in between matches which is not good.  They’re having some server issues too which essentially causes the daily and season structure to be non-functional.  As I understand it, this is a pretty high priority for them to fix right now, but it’s still a little broken.  I’ve also confirmed with the developer that the build I’m playing on is the release version.My conclusion is simple.  Forced Showdown is a game that surprised me.  I went into the game expecting a crappy little brawler and what I got was anything but that.  Combat is responsive and fun.  The audio is hilarious and incredible both in music and voice-over.  The game looks great and plays great.  Yes some of the menu UI is boring and it’s got reasonably long load times but for $20, I think this game is great value and absolutely worth playing.			"

												Fun deck based, twin-stick arena game.Between each around you have mana that use to play upgrades or special effects.I was surprised how easy it was to get into the game. I didn't have a lot of time the first time I turned it on but i was able to jump right in and start playing with the default deck.As you complete challenges and win battles, you get coins to unlock more cards, allowing you to customize your deck.Each battle has its on rules, such as fast enemies or free bonuses, which can increase/decrease the amount of enemies to balance the difficulty.I look forward to the additional updates!

												At first glance it might seem like just a nice little simplistic twin-stick action brawler. That's what I thought. But once you get the hang of the cards, it really opens up a whole other level.Don't get me wrong - the basics are still fine, but it's the card element that gives this game it's longivety. Combined with the different rules set down for each battle, the different champions, pets and cards create a lot of variation. Sometimes it does make it a little to easy maybe, when the rules and cards combine to make it possible for some pretty OP builds, but most of the time it's nice.Being a boring adult with kids'n'stuff I can also really appreciate the game being split up in manageble battles of abt. 10 minutes, which makes it great for short sessions as well. The technical stuff seems fine. GFX, Audio and controls are def. pretty decent level for an indie game. But again - it's the depth offered by the cards that is this game's real draw (see what I did there!).			"

												Wow... what a fantastic game. This one took me by surprise, I am not normally keen on games involving cards and decks.But this one really pulled it off spectacularly.Gameplay is fun, it feels great with some really nice characters and abilities. The sheer amount of content and replay value is probably most impressive.Graphics and audio are also top notch. I am very impressed with all components of this title.Please watch my video for more information.

												This is a great little game. it's a good mix of deckbulding and straight up action.  The gameplay is quite fast, andis mostly made up of 5 minutes bite sized arena thorugh which you level up to fight the mini boss at the end of each one. eventually movng up to the final big boss for the showdown.  it's the perfect pick up and play game and well worth the price asked and a steal on sale.

												I'm ~30 hours in, and I'm really enjoying this so far.  The combat is a fun, fast-paced, Diablo-style slaughterfest, and the addition of strategic elements really makes the game much more enjoyable and gives a sense of progression in a very fun and unique way.  The difficulty is certainly high, especially once you complete the first show, but a little determination, a little luck, and a few new cards can be all you need to turn it around.  It's a big pile of fun that I've had difficulty pulling myself away from. There are warts, however:  I've run into some crashing issues, and situations where the game will simply hang the entire machine for a few seconds, but these seem to be getting better with each patch, and BetaDwarf is pushing patches very quickly so far.  The only other issue I have isn't with the game itself, but rather with dicumentation:  It's almost impossible to find good information about the game online.  There is a wikia page, but it has outdated versions of cards, lots of incorrect information, and a new ad on every page (at least on mobile).  Some of it is that the game is so new it hasn't yet built up a community, but BetaDwarf has not done a good job up to now of seeding this information to the players & potential community-builders.  Hopefully, this is just another symptom of small team with a brand-new product; They're probably working like mad right now, and these kinds of niceties will come later.  Maybe once they're done with that, they might work on a multi-player component, or Linux/OS X/SteamOS compatibility??  Pretty please??Despite these things, I still couldn't not recommend this game.  It's just that much fun. "

												This game is great. It's a strange mix of Issac, League of Legends, Diablo and Hearthstone. It's a combination that has no right to be good but it is. Taking place in a game show setting (a setting that is oddly approiate), you are a contestant who is battling their way through a series of dungeons to reach a boss, playing cards from a deck you built before-hand that give you access to buffs and items that help you along the way.The runs are fast and varied, attacks actually feel powerful, and you feel like you are making progress all the time. The difficulty is hard but fair as you eventually learn what the modifiers do and start to unlock more cards to add to your deck. I will say that the quests that you need to complete to unlock characters and extra stats sound way harder then they actually are. Because of the variety of playstyles offered by the characters, the only way you will hit a runt is by only playing one character  and one deck. And honestly, there is a lot of content on offer that if you are looking for a lot of replayibilty for your buck this game fulfills that in spades.There are some cavats I would add, however.First, there have been a lot of people who have reported crashes. Nobody seems to give a reason why and it seems to be just luck if you're affected. I willing to bet though that they are running this game on a laptop or a ""potato"" and they may be running into a hardware issue. I did a spec check on this game on a whim, and was surprised at how demanding it was. It's not Witcher 3 demanding but if you've been thinking about upgrading your PC, this game is a good argument to do so. For me, I run a 3rd-gen Intel i5 motherboard and a GTX 660 and it runs smoothly.The other cavat I would keep an eye out for is that this is a deck-building game. And because this game pretty much flew under the radar as far as coverage is concerned, almost no community exists and the wiki is definately missing some stuff (like how to unlock characters). And while I find figuring it out on my own rewarding, if you're the kind of person who goes looking for ""builds"" online, you're♥♥♥♥♥♥out of luck.Other than that, I would reccomend this game in a heartbeat as soon as there is a sale. If you are on a limited budget and want a game with a lot of replay value, this is a good choice.			"

												An AMAZING game. It's very well-polished and filled with high octane action. The deck-building is arguably what makes this game so amazing. Each character feels unique as it is. The ability to change that up even more by making decks for them is simply mind-boggling. As a Johnny, I do love finding some stupid decks that work in hilarious ways.Currently, I'm running a Spell deck that essentially plays like Miracle Rogue. I can have like 20 Magical Puffs on screen. It's hilarious.			"

												Okay, this review is only after a few hours of playI LOVE this game. I've been debating getting it now or waiting, but i'm so glad I got it early.Few things. First, it is bullet hell. Not too difficult at first, but there are a lot of things to do and it gets harder depending on the enhancements.Second the card aspect is great. They make all the difference when playing and can save or hurt you. Its a bit difficult to get cards but that adds to the excitement to keep trying. Third the characters are so different and fun to play with. Tip: GET the expansion. It's fun to go between distance and close combat. And finally there are quests that will help you get higher and higher up. They'll had hp, gold, and other perks. Plenty to do.I just hope they make co-op so i can play with friends. I'd definitely recommend this game if you like card games mixed with some bullet hell aspects			"

												I think the best thing about this arena brawler is how well it mixes choice and randomness. Pure randomness can be frustrating, and pure player choice in a roguelite can make things samey, but if you stike the right balance it can be great, and Forced Showdown does just that.  Your upgrades are chosen through a card deck that you get to build, but your choices are limited to the random ones drawn.  Each arena has random gimmicks that change how it plays (such as enemies that move faster or extra AI allies), but you have a choice of arenas so you can avoid the gimmicks you don't like.The 4 (or 5 with the expansion) charcters play vastly differently, adding good replayability.  They aren't balanced particularly well vs each other, but since this is a single player game that is not really an issue, as it indirectly allows players to choose their own difficulty level.  Speaking of difficulty, the game is not very difficult on it's default mode (coming from a gamer who's pretty good at action games and bullet hells), but you can add extra challenge difficulty (such as giving bosses extra health and damage, or making enemies aggro much higher) and recieve extra rewards for your efforts.  I love this sort of method that's reminiscent of Bastion (and likely other games I don't know about), as it lets players tailor the difficulty the way they want it.  Too often games make difficulty levels simply effect enemy hp and damage... The way Forced Showdown does it is far more elegant, customizable, and fun.So far I'm having tons of fun with Forced Showdown.  Highly recommended.			"

												Forced Showdown is a pretty awesome twin stick rouge-like mixed with CCG. Its kinda like Hand of Fate but with much better combat. The controls are tight, the playable characters are totally different, several bosses to fight, SEVERAL cards to collect that drastically change gameplay, and more! Watch the TB video on the store page to understand what the game is and how it plays.  My only issue is that I wish that the arena levels were fewer and a bit larger, other than that, try this game if you like twin sticks, rouge-likes and CCGs. Personally I think its WAYYYY better than the first Forced.			"

												Forced Showdown is a game that has some really cool features. I like how they've mixed cards into the game. The cards adds different buffs and passive abilities to your character, which makes it easier to customize your gameplay and therefore feel like you can make a difference. Your hero's strengths aren't decided from the beginning, giving a whole new level to the game :)			"

												I want to state up that I did back this game on Kickstarter. I do not let that effect my opinion of the game (not that anyone is likely to believe that)I'm still getting into this game, but you should too! They get you into the action quick and keep the tutorial short. It hits on all the points you need to know and doesn't drag it out for a long time. I've only played the first campaign and it is longer than I expected. You play through multiple matches of 8 arenas. Each one has it's own special rules making the different matches interesting and unique. The card system also helps each run be unique and as you collect more you get to create your own deck! :DI'm still getting into it and will continue to revise this review as I go on.My current only complaint is that you don't know what the effect the arena will have before you enter it. It will say something like ""Speedy Minions"" (or something like that). Once you enter it tells you what effect it has and then you know it for the future, but as you see new ones you don't know what you are walking into.			"

Died once from sheer stupidity but it's not felt unfair, easy enough to get the hang of tand the card system adds an interesting gimmick.Luckily the game doesn't seem completely reliant on it, even when you get lousy cards off the bat its still easy enough to power through so it neever feels completely unfair, only real issue i've found is an odd bit of lag when completing arenas sometimes, but thats hardly a major issue. Definetly recommend getting it, altrhough you may want to wait till its on sale, as is the way with steam			"

												This game has something that appeals to everyone. It has an action-rpg playstyle, with card mechanics, and there is a ton of stuff to unlock and collect. It is a roguelite so it also has tons of replay value because no 2 runs are ever the same. I play almost every roguelite i can find, and this is definitely at the top of my list. The combat is super satisfying, and everyone could find a character playstyle they enjoy. The enemies and arenas look great, and the boss fights are epic. Everyone who enjoys video games should do themselves a favor and check this title out. You will not regret it. I personally rate it 9.5/10			"

 CCG meets MOBA (SOBAs?) and it works!Full Site Review[gonewiththewin.com]How many top down shooters are there to choose from? Too many. FORCED Showdown adds that ""something"" that makes itself not only stand out, but very addicting to play. The CCG aspects work (incredibly) and add a layer of planning, randomness, and distinction to an otherwise overdone genre. By adding in cooldowns (similar to MOBAs such as DOTA, LoL, and HotS), combat is more about timing. Cornering mobs so your abilities lay down damage with maximum efficiency, as opposed to spray and pray typical with twin sticks. Showdown is an intelligent man's action game. With an emblem system to increase challenge, boons that stack with your character, and battle rules that keep mixing things up so no two playthroughs are exactly the same. Building a deck is not a tacked on buff system, but a strategic element that must be planned for, and utilized well to survive in the arenas. This is an easy recommend, worth hours and hours of entertainment to gamers.PROs- CCG and top of twin stick action, with a hint of MOBA.- Great art design, particle effects, post processing, and nice soundtrack- Blended strategy elements, emblem system, battle rules keep it challenging- Great boss work, each boss has quotes and affect each round of battle- Deck planning doesn't get old as you anticipate another run through a campaign- 42 Updates? Are you serious? These devs love their game.CONs- Battles boil down to the same thing at times, can wear on you- Multiplayer in some fashion, could have improved variety "

												It's a fun game, don't be fooled by the bad reviews. It is a Diablo-style game, with a deck-building part. It is fun to play even in short bursts. You get rewards, new items every time, even if you lose, so there is a feeling of permanent progress.Also, the enemies (especially the Drones from the DLC) are looking quite fun and malicious. ;)It is a game what Hand if Fate wanted to be, with a lot better combat.Give it a chance!

												I highly recommend Forced Showdown! A really fun game that you can either have a 5 minute round before dashing off for work or spend hours tinkering with new decks & trying to beat your best scores. I have not played a similair game to forced showdown but was looking for a good game to get into after finishing Dungeon Of Endless. I decided to take the jump into FOE and I am so glad that I did.I went and purchased the DLC just a couple of days after picking this up from the humble store. Even though there was so much content in the base game I just wanted to experience more of this goodness! One major point I love is the amount of cards to acquire. Thank you Dev for giving us an abundance to unlock with IN GAME points you earn not buy. Hopefully more heroes and sidekicks to come in the future but  there is enough variety to keep me satisfied for many more hours, I am just being greedy =D			"

												Don't expect this to be like the original FORCED at all. This is simply a top-down shoot-em up arcade game, but probably the best one I have seen due to it's tactical deck building element. You can make an OP deck, but you still have to be good enough to dodge all the projectiles and enemies as you progress.			"

Some card might seem powerful, but that is super fun to try and discover. Pros:- Very high quality graphics- High replayability - Tight controls- Not too easy- Nice SFX and Music- PuffsCons: - Somtimes cheesy voice lines- No other languages (yet)Developers have been very active and shown they will support the game.

""well at least it was fun to watch:)) ""- moves nicely, good graphics- good variety in the enemies- reminds me somehow of the Dead Island Epidemic (which was shortly in beta and discontinued)Overall a good game in which i had a lot of fun so far.

												A unique approach to the roguelite genre makes this a refreshing experience. Overall I was surprised by how polished the game felt as I am usually a stickler for the small things and indie games tend to have their quirks. The game plays really nice though, smooth animations and the works.Everything in the game is easy enough to get into, however still has that ""hard to master"" feel as there are a lot of interactions between cards in the deck and how you use your skills. This also gives the game quite a lot of replay value.You might think the game starts out a bit easy, I know I did, but once you get started on the daily challenges you will need to revise your deck daily to adapt to the different ""mutators"" the game throws at you.

												After 51 hours and more ( now ) of game play I think I have a good idea of the game. First, some user tags are wrong. Its not a RPG at all and its not a trading card game because you cant trade, it a solo game. Its a rogue like / card game / top down. Sometime its really frustrating because its hard making a strategy because of the randomness of the card but its part of the game, if you hate gabling stay away from this game. Graphic are childish and game run well on my 10 years old computer as well on my new computer,  except the game crash near every time I close the game on my new computer and both use windows 10. There is a campain and daily challenges. Challenge go to medium / hard to ridiculously insane hard. Ive got the game for 50 % discount on humble bundle, a fair price 10$ + 7$ drone invasion ($CA). Since rogue like are not my kind of game I would not pay more than that.Edit:Be aware sometime game server ( maybe a bug ) dont allow you to play the season. I cant really say what is the problem because dev seem silent. Wiki are bad and if you need info for any help be prepare for alot research. For some reason game stopped crashing on closing. Dev seem not present on forum.			"

												Sweet game this my 1hr in review but so far I'm enjoying myself. Normally you wont see me play many cardish styled games. Think this one and chaos reborn are the only 2 I own lol. But this one pretty nice got its moments of hard got it's moments of easy I could see myself playing it in depth. I think only downside you my find is no co-op or MP play but I rarely touch either anymore so it is fine to me as a SP game. Pretty hard for any game to please me or hold attention for long (just getting old I guess) so when i say a game is entertaining I'm telling the truth. If you are interested buy it if not then you arn't right? Just note that screenshots on store page don't really give the game justice at all hit up youtube find a few gameplay vids. Think that's where I found out most about it and then added game to my wishlist as it looked interesting. Bought it+dlc while on sale. Game seems to be well maintained via dev end and they give stuff away yet so that's always a plus. Community seems pretty active on steam. If you want other players company.13hrs in game solid but got momments that pisses me off lol Not really the games fault entirly maybe my card setup might be way it deals the cards some arenas are bit annoying at times but guess it does it all like it does so still be challenging no matter what class or cards you use.

												Originally this review started as a do not recommend due to the fact that I was experiencing something like a 95% crash rate. (original quote was 2 successful launches in 43 attempts). I had mentioned that I love the idea behind the game and found the game highly enjoyable and aesthetically pleasing. I explained my gripe with the game and left it at that thinking I would never see a solution. CGamer, one of the developers in the game replied to my review explaining they released an update to fix my issue. This update did not fix my issue so I decided to email them my crash log. Less than a week later another patch was released which fixed my issue entirely.For what appears to be a small developer I am impressed with their creation and originally was let down with the technical side of the game resulting in my game crashing endlessly. I am very happy with the support the developers have shown and direct communication they have given me regarding my issue.I would highly recommend this game not only for the quality of the product but also for the support the developer provides.

												This game is rock-solid. A rogue-like arena brawler with short intervals between each arena. It's difficulty may vary but it isnt too hard to pick up and play. It is soo much fun to play and its definiately worth the price it is asking for. But if you feel like the price is too much then grab it on a sale definiately as it drops to 40-50% off. So as far as gameplay goes:Pros:+ The deck building makes the gameplay unique and varied from every arena session+ The varied gameplay with each arena having passive effects make each one different+ The AI mobs are not brain dead and don't just soak up damage all the time and actually fight+ Can vary from normal roguelike to bullet hell depending on the mobs+ The amount of classes make the gameplay Unique+ Pets are not as useless and can be very helpful in both damage or tanking+ The boss variety in skills make it an enjoyable experience+ Short burst of arena sessions makes this a game to play off and on or for long hours.+ The boon system which rewards a buff after each completed arena makes some future sessions start off better (reduce some of the rogue-like start off flaws)+ Daily missions with some fun conditions is always a plus (ex: Every kill revives them as an ally)Cons- It seems like most of the classes feel a bit weak (in  terms of skillwise) with the exception of the first class you play at the start- Like most rogue-like games the start of every session of arena feels a bit dull with no upgrades to start- You AI companion/Companions you need to save may sometimes have bad AI (stand on fire traps or run towards mobs)- Difficulty in terms of damage is outrageous on traps and mobs sometimes (some mob charges me to 2-3 fire trap and I die cause I'm stunlocked in the fire trap. Health from 120 to 0 in 2 seconds or I kill a mob and it explodes with a huge radius and kills off another mob which chain explodes into another mob that does the same and i go from 200 to 30 just for that)- Your companion has limited to no skills and just has an auto attack ( wish they gave them skills or even a skill tree to make them more customizable)- One of the stage passive with damages you by 10 for each unused Mana point spend needs to be nerfed (End game can be a pain if you dont have any more cards and end up taking a large portion of the damage for something your not really too in control of in terms of what you draw for the mana cost)- Melee classes needs a bit of a tweak for buffs as melee in early and later levels feels a bit weak with having to take alot of damgage just to go close up to even attack compared to the range classes. (maybe buff its defense or hp pool or chance to block [as in most games melee has parry but there is no parry so block would be better] )- The respawning of dead mobs as a special summon makes it a bit difficult on some levels to force you to rush on killing all the real mobs on the level as quick as you can before this happens.- Some of the enemy's Card consumsables are a bit hard (Meteors fall on you, excess of bomb traps all over the place, a plane that comes out of no where and literally does a ton of damage)- Uncontrollable Lag during Snake boss (Occurs when the boss is spawning mass minions) and there is no way to reduce the lag at all as I have set everything to low or off to try and test it but with no change.Overall this game is really fun despite the long list of cons you may have seen. It just makes the gameplay that much difficult but makes you want to play and try to overcome them to feel like it was worth it (Beat a boss with literally 1 hp throughout the entire match due to arena passive of dealing  10 dmg per non spend mana and 80 damage cause i had no cards leading me to start with 1hp). I play a lot of rogue-like games and this one feels like a mix of gauntlet legends (the asthetics + and quick pick up and play) mixed with binding of isaac (Movement to have to dodge + difficulty)  mixed with Hand of fate (Deck System) all in one. I bought the game on a sale for $24 for the complete bundle and I have not regretted it. I know I will spend a ton more hours on this game and its replayability is no questioned there with each playthrough being different. Feel free to buy this on a sale or not because despite not having alot of advetisement to get this game known, it is certainly a hidden gem for any one into rogue-like games. A must buy and not one you should look over.			"

												I enjoy this game a lot. Card use for buffs/heals/adding items in between rounds of top-down twin-stick style action works really well with permadeath. The game show theme works really well with the playstyle.It's not at all like their first game, Forced. Forced was a co-op dungeon crawl with puzzle segments that really required (forced) cooperation between players. This is a solo game made to be fun to watch and to stream. Both are really good in very different ways.			"

												I have gotten this game to run from the ""play"" menu once.  What i will say is when I did that, I had a lot of fun with the game.The downside is that I have tried to launch the game over 10 times now, and like I said it worked once.  So if you like to play a game 10% of the time you want to, get this game.  If you would prefer a game to not crash 100% of the time, get somethign else.What a game, the game is great too.Edit:  Developers seem to have resolved the issue.  Will update again if the game starts crashing like it did before.			"

												Great addictive game. If you like MOBAs, Action RPGs like Torchlight or Diablo, and card games like Yu-Gi-Oh, this is the one for you. Hell, even if you don't like those this is a great combination of all of those things.One thing. It's buggy as hell. I just lost over an hour of my life because it crashed at the end of beating Ruby. This has happened to my friend too, with an ENTIRELY different computer in specifications. Fix it.			"

												I played the original Forced and I totally loved it, both because of the co-op and because of the brilliant combination of WASD action and smart level design.I was first hesitant with Forced Showdown as it's only singleplayer, but boy was I mistaken to delay playing it. I had never played a rogue like game before, nor had I played a deck building game before. The rogue like part brings suspense and a rewarding feeling to every battle, and I totally love the way Beta Dwarf implemented the deck building part in Showdown. I personally like the RNG of the cards as it brings flavor and variety to every single battle, and the sheer number of cards means that you can play each character in multiple ways simply by switching to a totally different deck.If you decide to go for it, I recommend being both focused and patient in the first few hours until you get a good grasp of how the card draw works. Also, roll the Fortune wheel each time you get gold as you have a ton of cards to unlock.Before confronting some of the higher end bosses (for example the last boss of Frontline and higher), I'd recommend doing a bit of reading beforehand. A quick google search will make you understand some mechanics and will spare you a lot of lost time (remember, this is a rogue like game, so if you die you start over).All in all, a brilliant game which I see myself playing well over the 100 hour mark to get all the cards and complete all the quests.

												90 hours played before release and it has been an utter delight to follow the developers on their work!With all the cards, upgrades, maps, environments, arena rules, champions and companions, this game is perfectly random while still requirering skill and strategy to win. No battle is the same!There might still be crashes and bugs, but trust me the developers are intensively working on this game and they actually care about the players!			"

												3rd person fighting, deck building, campaigns and quests – this game is doing everything at once! I'm not really a big fan of card games, and I quickly gave up on mastering Hearthstone, but in this game I do not have to master the art of deck building to feel awesome. I might feel even awesomer if I could build the one deck to rule them all, but my ""I think this should do""-deck is working fine, and I can explode things. The graphical details are overwhelmingly amazing for an indie-team development. Everything in the arenas are well-made, from the randomized layout to the small critters and the billboards on the sides. With my attention span around pretty things, I really need to focus on not getting killed whenever I see a butterfly. The humor and puns are everywhere in the game, and the detailed artwork of the cards is both awesome and hilarious. I still crack up when I think about the Hit and Run card with a dude on a one wheeled bicycle shooting some kind of laser backwards xD. I really look forward to getting more cards in that style!I love the voice acting and soundtrack, and I am exited to see what the team comes up with of new content next :D. "

												Really fun game, i don’t really like single player games normally, but this has the right amount of speed, action, for it to be a really great experience. It’s my favourite game to play, after coming home from a long day of work.I really like the old-school stile, where there is no help is you die, this gives more playtime, but also an intense gameplay.Some of the cards and magic’s are really great made, and its great with the huge variety of cards, which makes the game different to play every time.Hope they will add a multiplayer function at some point, but for now the single player part is just fine for me.

												This game is a LOT of fun. It took a little while to get used to it, but once I got the gameplay down, I got addicted. LOVE the card system. It adds a LOT to the gameplay. I'm not great with games like Hearthstone. I like the IDEA of card games like Hearthstone, but I'm just not very good at card strategy. Forced Showdown is right up my alley. Just enough card building to scratch the itch, but the rest is a fun action game. Kinda Gauntlet meets Hearthstone. For you younger gamers, change that to Diablo meets Hearthstone. :)I'm even MORE impressed by the developers of the game. BetaDwarf has been Johnny-On-The-Spot dealing with any issues with the game. Just check out the discussion board. One player complained about V-Sync not being available, which would make their rig overheat. The dev actually grabbed a programmer and took care of it.BetaDwarf also has an amazing origin story. It’s amazing what they’ve accomplished. Check out their story here: http://imgur.com/gallery/4fsfR "

There's alot of cards that are unique and adds ""special effects"" to your hero.+ Alot of content to complete(considering all quests).+ Leaderboards to show off your your skills.+ It's a beautiful looking game.+ Also if you're an achievment hunter, there's _alot_ of hard achievments to be gathered!Cons:- Im now addicted. 11/10.JOIN THE SHOOOW!

												Hi there! You're probably scrolling through the reviews wondering if this game is any good. Well you can stop scrolling, because everything you need to know is in this next sentence: The game will be amazeballs, so buy it now.""Will be?"" you might ask, and as you should! Right now, the state of the game is simply 'amazing.' All of the core mechanics work, music is top notch, voice acting is so fantastic it would make Kevin Spacey blush (no this is not a biased opinion of the VO just because I voice C-SAR. I'm pretty sure he would blush. Might even ask me out), and the gameplay is solid!So why is it only 'amazing' right now and not 'amazeballs?' Well that's because this isn't even the game's final form. There are still so many gaps to fill, especially with the small roster of contestants and three shows to go through! With a bowl of updates, a plate full of hope, and a small beverage of tenacity, this game will surely make you feel all warm and fuzzy inside with how amazeballs it is. But for now, you'll have to settle for just the first serving (which is still amazing).So, in short: The game is amazing, a little more and it will be amazeballs. C-SAR OUT.			"

												A little gem of a game, in my opinion.Gameplay:While it - for the moment being - only offers singleplayer, I find that the singleplayer offers enough variety to keep me entertained for a good while. In many ways, it offers the same type of longevity as games like ""Binding of Isaac"" or ""Nuclear Throne"", with the added mechanics of a CCG to add a level of customization and controlled experimentation.Each character offers a different approach to combat, both in terms of their basic attacks as well as additional abilities (damage avoidance, secondary ability, etc), and this is reflected in the character specific cards as well.Add to this the modifiers applied to each ""Battle"", and you get a system where each new run is likely to be at least somewhat different from the last.Presentation:The games artstyle is good, with a clear sense of direction and a good representation. Likewise, the game is also presented with a good amount of humour, but not to such a degree that you could possibly find yourself ""playing for the laughs"".Support:The Devs have been very open and forthcoming, and you get a strong feeling that they're intent on seeing the game through not just until launch, but well after launch as well, and that they have no issues with listening to feedback (either negative or positive), opting to be transparent in their answers rather than giving a standard-formula reply to questions that could potentially scare away some players if the answer differs from what some people feel should be the answer.All in all:A game that offers longevity so long as you find it fun seeing where the next battle takes you; how far you can make it, what cards you're dealt, what modifiers you're given, and trying to beat your own best score - something that can keep you coming back just to see how the next run will go down.Likewise, with the dedication and openess of the Devs, it's easy to imagine this game evolving beyond its launch state.

												I played the game from an really early version on, and experienced the ""developement"" of the game throughout the years.First of all: it is a nice game, but not worth 20€, imho. Why? Just read my Review about this game, you are interested in.What is this game about?-It is an game, which is about creating an Deck, consisting of 3 types of cards, Spells, Consumeables and Upgrades.|-> you can chose that deck to challenge an Program, there exists 3 Programs currently, with ranging ""difficulties"".-You can get new cards from challenging your luck on the lottery (for gold you earned from quests and finished battles).|-> if you are really unluck and get duplicates all the time, you will get ""shards"", which you can trade for an card you don't own at the moment).-There are currently 4 champions and 3 pets you can chose from.-Exceptions: Dailies, some of those will give you an deck+champion+pet, while others let you create your own deck.Well, that was the basic stuff, how about the gameplay you ask? Here you go:-Each Program consists of 9 Battles|-> each Battle consists of 8 Arenas (exception: if you got the ""quick battle"" rule it will be reduced to 4 Arenas for that battle)-In the first Arena of an Battle you start out with 1 Mana Crystal, for each successful finished Arena you gain an additional Mana Crystal|-> you play cards from your deck each Arena. Each card costs a specific ammount|-> you try to survive, gather scraps/experience and kill the boss at the end of an Battle-At the end of an Battle you will get rewarded with Scraps/Exp, after reaching a certain point (leveling up) you will gain the option to chose a bonus effect from a pool of your current unlocked bonuses.-Goal: Finish all 9 Battles, aka. Finishing off the Program.So, why do i give it an negative review?The game is too random, no real skill is needed because some elements will screw you over.A lot of Rules are creating an enviroment, you will not be able to do great in, with your current deck (you can NOT change it between battles, you HAVE to reset the Arena to do so)Most cards you have at the beginning are just bad, just outright bad, compared to those cards you should unlock as soon as possible. The advantage of those cards you get are just incredible, but it requires a lot of grinding, because the random factor in the lottery is just not enjoyable.After getting all cards, and looking at each card individual, i have to say that around 80% of those cards will NEVER see any play again, because those are no alternatives to those ""top picks"". Why? Those bonuses will create an enviroment where you have to go for some universal answer to every single disadvantage you get.I had to restart a lot of runs, because i was not getting certain bonuses (there are some which are just outright overpowered compared to others, why would i want 20% pet dmg, if i am able to get 35% pet health AND pet dmg at the same time, at the same point of the game? Just an example) and without those i had a LOT of issues finishing both the second and third Program with 3 out of 4 characters.What else do i have to rant about? The balancing is horrible. The strongest character is the Ravager and the Squire of Light comes second, but WAAAYS behind it, why? Invincibility, especially if you are a good player, you will have no issues with any Program if you are able to use the Ravager abilities to your advantage, it will just make it so you will never get punished for bad positioning or bad rules, while others will have some of the biggest issues just finishing a single battle...Just stay out of this game, it will not be a game most will enjoy for a long time, because once you get to a point knowing about the game mechanics and are able to use them, you will hate the game, for how poor designed it is.edit: something i forgot to write about is, how bad the boss fights are. Every single Boss encounter is nothing, compared to the arenas you had to fight in, to get there. I am not understanding why the hardest part in those fights are NOT the bosses, with their poor mechanics (once you know what they do, they will NEVER be any threat to you, so actually only the first ~2 encounters of each boss are difficult), but possible spawned/summoned enemies (and if you got any consumeable to destroy any of these, or even better: make them your allies, then it will get even more easy, then it already is).""Yeah let's make bosses scale bad, compared to the player, who will have a lot of upgrades, etc. on the 8th arena, so he will make it with ease"" - no offense, but it was anticlimatic whenever i got to some boss again after the first time i fought against it			"

												The game is a mix of Deck Building and arena combat, and if you think that'd get repetitive... you're in for a big surprise!Video Review:Watch the video for the most complete impression of the game and its advantages, gameplay, possible problems and technical prowess. 


YouTube™ Video: Forced Showdown - Logic Review 

			Views: 961		

			Forced showdown, a arena-combat deck building action game from the guys at BetaDwarf. This is uploaded at 1440p (upscaled from 1080p) for best visual fidelity. Review copy provided free of charge.		

Textual summary:As always, a short textual summary won’t do the game justice compared to a 30 minute video so take this as the summary it is!The game combines arena combat, deck building, card collecting and score attacks in a comedic and interesting mix of elements that fight the inherent repetitive nature of a game like this.First… there are quite a few cards available, and more to unlock and with various characters (4) available for play as well as different playstyles you will have many opportunities to fiddle, tinker and make up decks for each of them to try out. And daily challenges in the seasons result in you often having to tinker with your decks for the best possible result. The game has no micro transactions or anything of the kind, and while I don’t know if the developers have any plans for this, currently once you buy the game you will be able to unlock everything without any Pay-2-win nonsense.The arena combat is fast, intense, and colorful and the modifiers in each engagement keep it fresh time and again even when you are, in essence facing about a dozen enemy types in total. Those modifiers range from stronger enemies, benefits to you, and influence how a arena run pans out, meaning not just your deck needs a solid strategy but each arena requires you to think and plan ahead.A concern I had was RNG, and outside of some issues with explanations, most of that can be mitigated with experience in the game. RNG really isn’t a major concern. Overall technically the game runs great and has an acceptable options menu – do note, if you are colorblind, you can experience issues as the game uses classical color schemes of red, green and blue to indicate quite a few action elements. Some minor issues, I hope will be fixed ASAP in relation to bugs and crashes.Overall, I like this game a TON and the fact that I’ve yet to beat it and the various options and abilities I have yet to unlock give a lot of value for money. I wholeheartedly recommend this title.			"

												This game is fun......for a while.And in a while, it might be fun again.You see, this game has a set of cards, which are essentially upgrades you get every level and there are a lot of cards, which is fantastic and could give the game a great deal of longevity.The problem is that there is a dead zone in the middle, which I've reached, where the fun of the game is wearing off but you don't yet have enough cards to change up your deck significantly and try new builds.As a result, I'm either going to have to grind through or give up the game and honestly, I'm giving up. There are lots of games out there that aren't grinds, that are fun all the way through, so unless you're really enamoured with the idea, this probably won't hold your attention for more than a few hours.

												First off, it is IMPOSSIBLE to tell you how much bloody FUN this game is!  So stop reading and BUY it!  But this is a review... so.... Well, how to describe the game?  It's part card collection game, part Role Playing\Leveling up game, part Rouge\Diablo style combat game, and ALL awesome gamepad bashing extacy!  You begin by selecting your character - or Avatar - 1 of 5 (the fifth is a DLC), and then you make a deck of cards with the individual you have selected.  Certain cards or only for certain Avatars, while others are for all classes of people.  For example, you can start off as a ""Squire of Light"" - and bring flames to your enemies!  But you don't fight alone - you have a companion who ALSO levels up with you, and you can change what kind of companion fighter you want, along with what cards you have in between rounds.  You fight numerous dungeons untill you reach a boss - and once you've beaten the boss you go BACK to the pause in the game where you can level up, select buffs, spells, attacks, and such.  The game is very addictive, VERY replayable, and well worth a 50$ price tag - and considering right now it's selling (not on sale) for 19.99$, it's a no brainer.If you have played it's prequel, you will feel at ease with the combat style - its easy to pick up, but it has nuances that are a joy to master.  The previous one - while feeling like it, is a COMPLETELY different experience.  But in my opinion, the sequel is even better then the first.And by the way... they have just announced the title to the NEXT entry in the ""Forced"" saga - ""Forced to Duel - Minion Masters'"".  So if I were you, I'd ship myself (me) a whole lotta cash.  Or catch up in the series to get ready for the next addition in this highly addictive, creative, fun, and unique experience.  An easy 10 out of 10!  Way to go Beta Dwarf!  AGAIN!			"

												Forever I've been scorned  by Diablo 3 and their reluctance to give me gamepad support to the PC... not anymore since I started playing this about 23 hours ago and I'm yet to slow down.To keep this to-the-point I'll simply highlight the reasons why you should buy it:1. The gameplay is SMOOTH.2. No microtransactions to stall progress.3. The rogue-like elements are light and by no means feel like a burden.4. The card mechanics add a REALLY REALLY neat mix to the gameplay.5. The areas are short and you never feel like you're doing ANY kind of busy work, it's action action action non-stop.6. This game has quite a bit of RNG in it but on every aspect it seems like you have some level of control and choice making the whole randomness feel much more manageable and giving us a very neat layer of strategy.7. The difficulty seems fair and often times creates very clutch moments.Now for what I don't like:1. It's a indie title and looks like one, the graphics won't impress anyone.2. I'd love some pre-built decks and/or an easy in-game access to suggestions, it's a bit annoying to build them as is and the deck building interface doesn't help AT ALL.3. I’d like more of the commentator in-game, as it stands during matches he barely opens his mouth… I’d pay quite a bit of cash to see YouTubers lending their voice-overs and such. As it stands, it feels very dry on this regard.Bottom line, pay full price if you must, this game is a must have for anyone that has even a passing interest in any of the parts that make it (namely ARPGs, card games and rogue-like), it takes the best of each and while not over simplifying any creates something trully unique and incredibly fun to play.

												Currently unplayable for me. I played through the first area and killed the Burninator while collecting cards and enjoying the gameplay, but once I finished the crucible I could no longer start another run without the game crashing. Windowed, full screen, different characters, companions and areas and the game will allways crash after character select. So while I do really want to play more of this game, until that problem is resolved the game is very literally unplayable for me. I know I'm not the only one facing issues with consistant crashing, just looking into the general discussion on steam will show you that, so I guess I would recommend waiting to buy this game until they iron out all the kinks.

												I would allllllmost recommend this game, but I can't quite bring myself to fully endorse it. The basic concept is that you get put in an arena for eight rounds and need to kill all the enemies. The cool part is that each round you get to play cards that boost your character in various ways, some temporary and some for the whole eight rounds. There are two really annoying features that keep me from endorsing the game. First, one or two of the quests are bugged and do not register properly as completed. This includes the absolutely most annoying quest in the game, which involves being lucky enough to have your partner turn evil, the enemies be smart enough (hah!) to not kill themselves, and you to finish off every single one with the weakest attack in the game.Two, it is more luck-based than it should be. Those eight arenas I mentioned? A ""program"" is several of those in a row, topping out at, as far as I can see, eight in a row. If you lose a single one of them, you're kicked back to the beginning. This can be a huge problem as some characters are at an extreme disadvantage against certain bosses.If this game gets a little more love I would probably change my review, but it isn't quite there yet.

												It's an okay twin-stick game... But it's a premium game with boring f2p mechanics to create a false sense of ""progression"".I would say the game is mostly full of annoyances rather than quality content. The randomness is within reason, but literally everything has some stupid animation you have to sit through (very few you can actually skip). So, most of the time ends up being spent waiting for the game to finish wasting time because somebody thought it'd be fun to watch. Levels have random global effects, but you won't know what each one is until you select the level... not like you could prepare much anyway, since you're deck and companion are locked in.Given that the game has been out for some time, I don't expect things to change. Overall, I can't figure out why I would play this over something like Enter the Gungeon.			"

												I played both FORCED (in 2013) and FORCED SHOWDOWN.SHOWDOWN is still fun to play because of the core gameplay. And I love challenging games and SHOWDOWN is one of them.Now why I don't recommend SHOWDOWN: It's a RNG ♥♥♥♥♥how. Somehow there's a card system that is a rip-off of that indie card game Hearthstone. Not hating on copying Hearthstone but it adds a lot of randomness. You play a series of arenas that are chosen randomly. Against enemies that are chosen randomly. The boss at the end of the series is chosen randomly (except for the final one of ""the show"" and some few exceptions) There are modifiers that changes things that are chosen randomly (i.e. having random fireballs going through the arena that you must dodge) If you have the Drone Invasion DLC which I have, the number of series you are literally in a maze where you must do a series of arena to move and you do this until you eventually find the boss. You have quests that you can do if luck is in your favor (draw the right cards)The whole game is this. You have to play at least 8 series of arenas in a row before doing one more containing the final boss of ""the show"". When you think you have unlocked new content (a new show) you have just unlocked a new boss to fight that you won't get to fight unless you win at least 8 series of arenas in a row without dying once.Because if you die it's game over gg wp and try again. It gets repetitive really fast.Now I don't mind failing and retrying I did that a lot in the original FORCED. But at least I had to restart a specific level rather than the whole game.It feels like BetaDwarf bet too much on random generation hoping that it would dynamically create hours of enjoyable gaming with shiny cards to unlock at the end. It almost worked I did play SHOWDOWN more than the original FORCED. But I enjoyed FORCED much more than SHOWDOWN.In the orignal FORCED game the arenas were smartly crafted instead of having some place with walls and barrels. The progression made sense it was exciting from the beginning to the end. New areas meant new landscapes and enemies. The levelling system was smooth. The difficulty progressively increases throughout the game. And also you could play with friends in Co-op (which you can't in SHOWDOWN).Basically playing FORCED SHOWDOWN is almost like playing an arcade game made by a Las Vegas casino. You insert a coin and you get butt ♥♥♥♥ed by RNGsus and game over. The only difference is that you don't insert coins.Buy FORCED SHOWDOWN if: You like doing the same thing over and over You don't mind the gambleBuy FORCED instead if: You don't have it yet (keep in mind that I played the game in 2013 and the game may have changed since)tl;dr SHOWDOWN feels like rushed. Gets very repetitive. Way too much RNG. FORCED is far better.			"

												I wouldn't say this is a horrible game but I cannot recommend it unless you're someone who really really likes deck building games. I had some fun with this even if it ended up not really being my thing.The stages are simple and tiny, but for the type of game where you're running through a dozen arenas with each arena having ten fights it makes sense for them to be so small; I just wish they weren't so repetitive. The random arena affects try to help with that but most of the time you never want to choose any of the positive ones since it increases enemy numbers, which is usually worse than the negative effects you could instead pick up to lower enemy numbers. There doesn't seem to be a very good balance between effects of arenas, the cards, or the characters themselves.The cards can be a bit fun though, especially the consumables.The only thing I can truly complain about though is the companions. Dear lord they are dumb. They will walk into fire and bombs, killing themselves faster than the enemies do. At first I just thought the low HP of your first companion was the trouble, as it was meant to be just the lil' glass canon sort of deal. But when I got the brawler type it was unbearable and I switched back to the little one cause at least he teleports away from things that damage him so he actually lasts longer than the companion meant to be a meat shield.

												A big part of this games ""difficulty"" is generated by random effects (mutators for the current arena) which make luck a large factor and can sometimes not or only partially be compensated by skill or adjusting your playstyle. Some of those are also not even challenging but just anti-fun.Also the performance is just awful (loading times and crashes).Graphics are often unreadable (e.g. instant nearly non-avoidable damage) but i guess this gets better with more experience.The deck building is really cool but getting new cards is a gamble again and after 20 hours of playing i feel like i'm still playing mostly common cards because i didn't get anything interesting.Lastly the most viable character can only be played by buying a dlc.

												This game would be fun if I could get over the unacceptable amount of bugs.The boon menu has no Confirm button, so I have to blindly click to select boons. (I had to look up a gameplay video to figure out what kind of magic was needed to select a boon, and it turns out several UI elements are flat out missing in my game.)Every single time I quit the game, the bug tracker stays on, which means I can't open the game again through steam. I have to open Task Manager and kill the process.When I first loaded up the game it was at my native resolution of 2560x1080. I accidentally changed it to 1920x1080, and now there is no option in the drop-down to change it back.Verifying game cache has not fixed any of the above issues.This was a somewhat enjoyable experience, but the amount of bugs are embarrassing for a game that's not in early access. I'm just under 2 hours and I'm on the fence about refunding.EDIT: I checked the forums as recommended and the bugs I mentioned had already been reported.  I decided to give the devs a chance and waited almost 2 months, but still no fixes. Now I can't even get a refund because I waited more than 2 weeks. If the game works for you, that's great, but if you encounter any bugs, there is apparently absolutely no support.			"

												Review to be updated, so all fanboys who want to perform actions for the dev's can go away.I'm just hoping the game gets better and worth the money, but right now, it's not.To sum up the game in today's ""gaming community"": ""GIT GUUD""To sum it up in anyone with a braind's opinion: ""Really hard game""In my opinion: This game is♥♥♥♥♥♥RNG with what cards you get loses you more things than anything else. Whenever you manage one challenge there is another to beat you up with your own arm. There are also Hidden challenges in the later arenas so you can end up in a battle with things that will make your deck  useless. GOOD LUCK!!!So far the game has felt like:Too much Farming.Unfair due to card draws.Undeveloped Card game compared to certain card games.Some challenges are just too hard or a bit too challenging for what you get.Too few levels, bosses and choices.Goes from basic to hard too fast with little in-between, and most unlocks can only happen in the ""normal"" campaign.Lacks some things like a quest-list to keep track of what you're trying to achieve and if you've failed or not,The multiplayer scene could be better, challenges are somewhat fun but wish I could play with someone.Too many cards to choose from with little choice in what you get from the ""lottery"".Rewards are low.Yes it's mostly negative, and some things can be proof of something you love. If you like challenges and options, this may be a game for you. It feels unfinished however and it's good that it's new, because if the game stays for 20€ and is this short (Farming does NOT make a good game, only repetetive and this game does not have the right to be this repetetive). Lately I've also started to realise that after a few quests done in the 2nd campaign just go back to the first and farm gold, you'll earn a lot more, loose less and have a better time until you have every card in the game, because that's what it comes down to, farming farming farming without ever getting any permanent growth except for completed quests, some who have way too difficult conditions, some are too extreme too, ""use 150 consumables"" doesn't work in the easy campaign.So I hope to see some changes for the better and will update this review as it goes.

												I'm apparently one of a few enough number that can't get the game to start that the devs don't really care.  Had tried initially talking to the devs to figure out what the issue was.  Have reinstalled the game, my drivers, etc. several times.  Still waited though to see if they'd put out a patch that would fix it.  Wanted to try the game, but no dice I guess.  They won't be getting any more of my money either, almost exactly two weeks after I had purchased the game, I stopped hearing back from them.  I guess they thought I wouldn't try to get a refund after two weeks, and they could just keep my money for a game I couldn't play.  Poorly handled, devs.  Goodbye.			"

												Hear me out on this one!I bought an alpha key on gamescom a while back for a game named Forced 2: The Rush, it changed it's name till then at least 3 times. And with its name all the mechanics changed. I really enjoyed the key mechanic back then which was racing against other players to be the first to finish a dungeon run. Thats gone now =(. I enjoyed playing the different characters that you have to unlock now wich forces me to play with characters I do not like...Sry for the rambling but lets get to the real point that enoys me. Why do they charge 20€ for this game? And why do I as a alpha tester have to buy it. I payed them money for a game access they never said I'd have to pay more later. I got a 25% coupon for compensation.So should you get this game / is it any good.It is ok in what it does. It gets highly repetitive.And if you get a high discount maybe its worth your time.I just feel mistreated as an motivated alpha tester that saw this game transforming several times. And WTF is this DLC nonsense!!!! Ah and what you need to know is that the game kickstarted twice and is probably just coming out because they are out of money not because it is a finished well polished version =(It was a fun competetive game and now its just a dull dungeon crawler that can screw you over with bad RNG.

												I loved the original Forced. it was a 10/10. Why co-op!!This game is pointless with out co-op.  And I feel like I was tricked into buying this because I thought there was.  When this game becomes co-op.  I'll change my recommendation.			"

												The cards add an interesting dynamic to a genre rich with good games right now and while this wasn't my favorite it looks and plays well and I enjoyed my time. Enjoyed Flamebreak slightly more, especially for the price, but I see that as a matter of taste and not that one game is objectively better as this certainly looks prettier.


Forced Showdown, the Running Man Rouge Light

			Forced Showdown plays a lot like other rouge lights but it adds a few twists. In the video I refer to the game being $15 but it is actually $20. Here is the steam link if you are interested.

												Fun and diverse game. Definately worth a try if you enjoy fast paced games where you can influence the gameplay.The game revolves around your deck of cards, and every round you have some mana to spend on cards to buff your character or your helper. Level mods give all this a twist so you might need to think 1 or 2 levels ahead to maximize your capabilities. Lastly the length of each mission (multiple levels) is somewhat short so you don't have to devote several hours just to play the game. A big thumbs up from me! /Cheers "

												When I bought the first Forced game, I was hooked for many days. So naturally, when its sequel was announced I became very excited about it. However, my thirst was quenched quickly due to my expectations.Don’t get me wrong, Forced Showdown certainly is an enjoyable game. It’s an arena brawler like its predecessor, and certainly provides a good – and fair – challenge. While it certainly can be hard at times, you won’t feel like the game cheated on you to raise the level. Everything can be dodged, and projectiles and explosion areas are indicated. And everything is fast-paced action. Bosses also provide for random effects throughout the area which you have to deal with, and from the second level they will also get cards to make things a lot harder.The game has huge amounts of customizability with its trading cards, which you can use for building decks, which in turn you use to grow stronger throughout each level in an arena – though you lose it after beating the boss. It is random, so your plan won’t work out every time, and you won’t always get the cards you hope for – and with mana rising each level you might not be able to play a card for a few levels if you’re out of luck.It’s replay value is high – due to multiple characters you can master, but also due to the enormous amounts of customizability you get by collecting cards and building your own decks. Also, when you grow more confident in your abilities, you can provide yourself with additional challenges – which you can choose yourself from a list you get provided by the game. There are also daily challenges, in which you can compete for the top score so that adds a lot of replay value too.The graphics are ok. They serve their purpose of setting a more comical mood, but I don’t feel like they are really gorgeous or something. The sound, however, is really nice. Both the voice acting and the music set the tone really well for a fun experience.Forced Showdown also has a few cons. The first that could be considered is the lack of checkpoints. You can spend a long time to hack your path through 9 arenas, but if you die you have to do everything over again, which can be a bit frustrating – especially when you die at the end. However, BetaDwarf has done a decent job in making it so that you don’t have to follow the exact path and fight the exact same enemies so it won’t feel as much of a grind. You also get gold after completing challenges for trading cards so your time wasn’t completely useless.The game also relies heavily on grinding gold and cards. You get gold after arena’s, which you can trade into random prices (cards, shards, more gold…) for it. You can only own every card twice, so they get turned into shards too afterwards – for which you can buy cards you don’t own. Getting cards is very random, and you’ll find yourself playing a lot to get them. Maybe to get that one card that would make your deck complete, or maybe to get all of them. This is the part that can get quite annoying at times.I’ve also encountered a lot of bugs, especially at the time the game was just released. I even dropped the game out of frustration because I was getting a lot of CTD’s during battles. However, most of them seemed to be patched and nowadays I haven’t encountered a CTD or a frozen game after I started playing again.Now, for the things I long for when thinking of the first instalment of the franchise. Forced was a game that provided you with some basic puzzles throughout its arenas, which is one the reasons why I rate it above Showdown. Also, while you have customizable decks, you don’t get the customizable characters you had in Forced. With less and fixed abilities characters feel the same much more quickly, and decks aren't as reliable as abilities and passives due to their randomness. Card decks are quite fun, but I’m not sure it’s worth losing the ability and passive customization for. Maybe a combination of the two was possible, but maybe that would’ve made it a bit too complex.And of course there is the multiplayer which Forced was famous for. This game would also be so much fun in a multiplayer setup. Lesser so because of the lack of puzzles but still a lot of fun. I certainly hope BetaDwarf will implement this in the future.So in conclusion, this certainly is a game worth playing and I've enjoyed it quite a lot, but if you want to buy it because you've enjoyed Forced, you should be warned that Showdown is quite a different experience.

												This game is an action packed single player ARPGish masterpiece. Very twin-stick arcade like game play.Play/buy if you want loads of quick random action that is easy to get into and doesnt require other friends to playthere is a randomish deck building feature, but you can learn the game well enough to overcome.Plus you get shards that help you get cards you dont have. many of the good cards are common which I think is a great thing. I have found that all the characters are fun/viable but due take time to learn since they are all very different from eachother.I was holding off reviewing the game since the season/daily feature of the game was down for a while, but since this was fixed recently by the delvelopers and the feature adds alot to the game, I now have 0 reasons to not recomend this game.

												I hadn't even heard of this game until I was browsing action RPGs, and it's great. The combat is a blast. The game is also very fast paced (with essentially no story, which I see as a pretty good thing in this instance). The writing is pretty funny too.  It's a pretty unique take on the Action RPG genre that actually works really well. I hope they expand with a bunch more heroes. Playing a game like this with a ton of different heroes to choose from would be a blast.			"
