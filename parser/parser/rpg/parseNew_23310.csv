												Let's begin with a simple tip to make life easier for keyboard players:Main Screen > Settings > Gamepad (4th Icon) > Key Signal Display > Keyboard.Secondly, bookmark this page:http://lastremnant.wikia.com/wiki/The_Last_Remnant_Wiki_-_The_Last_Remnant_GuideYou're welcome.---I got into this game via a demo. The demo left me wanting more, and Steam had it on sale, so off I went to get it.I'm on my second play through. The first play through was messed up beyond believe. I didn't know what was what and got stuck in a boss battle that I could not win. That bit frustrated me to no end and♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥me off greatly. I went off in search for a guide to overcome the boss battle. To my dismay, none of the guide helps as I've done something I should not have done: killing everything in sight and trying to spread the EXP love with all my party members. The end result was a severly gimped party lacking in both stats and skills.I stopped playing for a couple of days and dived deep into the wiki. I learn the proper way to play the game, picked up a majority of the content that I just zipped past without realizing it, and focused on growing my party members the proper way. Second time around, the game was infinitely less infuriating and way more fun. The boss that I was stuck at in my first play through became a breeze, though the game did something rather nasty after that particular fight. Thank god I was somewhat prepared for it, equipped with both knowledge and power to overcome that nasty bit. The resulting satisfaction was very, very high. From then on, the game became something I want to explore in depth. I trawled through the wiki and its discussion pages to learn more about the mechanics of the game. Although I've been vigilant in keeping track of the missable content, there are still a number of things that I inadvertently got locked out of without realizing it. I am currently one boss fight away from the end of the game and already I am laying down the foundation for my new game plus. Despite the amazing depth of the game, or rather, due to it, the game will eat you alive if you don't know what you’re doing. The game does not make obvious certain crucial information from the get go. Playing the game with a lack of information can lead to a really bad experience, especially if you play this game the way you would a normal RPG.With that said, the game is excellent for those wanting a good challenge. There is a vast amount of content within the game, and it should keep someone busy for the next 100-200 hours.Update (22 Feb 2014): I've just finished my third playthrough and I'm taking a break to plan for my fourth playthrough. It seems that once you've finished the game once, you just keep going back for more. This game is one of my best investments in Steam.			"

												The Last Remnant is my favorite JRPG of all time, and definitely holds a place of my top 10 games of all time. Here's why.This game is wholly unique. Usually, when one says ""JRPG"", you have a good sense of what you're getting into. Cliched characters (whether you like those cliches or not), quirky personalities, a turn-based battle system, a long convoluted story with plenty of twists, and be prepared to roll your eyes or shake your fist at the screen for some character antics or story twists you saw coming from early on. In The Last Remnant, little of this is true. The story is unique, the art style and characters are unique, some of the twists and story archs are surprising, and the battle system is so unlike anything else you've ever played, somewhere between a JRPG and a large scale strategy game with army simulation elements.This game is known to be quite challenging. I bought the Xbox 360 version on the game's release date, and have beat the game a few times and put a couple hundred hours into it. After completing my first PC playthrough tonight after about 90 hours, I can say for certain the PC version is about 3000% easier. An update was made to the game that made a few changes that made the PC version exponentially easier, though it is still more challenging than the average RPG. So if you happened to try the 360 version and were turned off by its difficulty, I urge you to try the PC version.The Last Remnant needs to be commended for its ability to have realistic and relatable characters, and multiple characters you care about and will remember forever. In this game, you are able to literally build up a small army to take into battles with you, where enemies and your people are separated into ""unions"" rather than each person being separate from one another. It is here where the game brings in large-scale strategy type battles, allowing the unions to act as one unit. Strategy fans will delight in the ability to hire soldiers and characters for their army, picking and choosing people based on their unique skill sets and abilities. You are able to hire people you've perhaps done quests with, or people you've never met that happen to have a skill you've never heard of, just because you want to see it in action. You then pick and choose which people to put with whom, how to set up your unions, etc., giving limitless possibilities for your army. Also, your followers will often ask for certain items, ingredients, etc. throughout the game, which they'll use to upgrade their equipment and become even more badass. (And trust me, this game is full of badass characters.) You can also dictate how your soldiers level up, as they ask you from time to time if you want them to delve into a different skill set or art style.Even if the game had a terrible story and cliched characters, the battle system would keep me crawling back. Battles are by far the best part of this game. While some will say that some boss battles can be ""cheap"" or ""unfair,"" I'd argue that your characters also unlock plenty of abilities and special moves that are just as if not more cheap or unfair to the enemy (Blackout is ridiculously powerful, for example, and that's a move my unions ended up using frequently). In summary, fights can be nail-biting, because you are constantly reminded that you are fighting enemies that are just as skilled and able as you. Will you still scream at the game in frustration? Sometimes, yes. But I've personally also nearly broken things with excitement when a single decision or a stroke of luck turned the tide of battle. Also, I'll let it be known that I find games that are hard just to BE hard quite annoying and to be little to no fun. This is not a game that is consistently cheap or unfair. It can be extremely challenging, and you'll call BS on a fight from time to time, but with strategy, that same fight on your next try could be immensely rewarding and much simpler.The Last Remnant is a refreshing game in a genre that is usually predictable. It has a gritty realism that is usually reserved for western RPGs. It also respects its characters. You'll find no little girls with parasols fighting in battle, nor will you have a guy insist on being shirtless while on the battlefield (seriously...whenever I see that, I think about how easy it'd be to take them out). The characters--while they can be quirky and humorous at times--are never walking cliches. Each woman or man has her or his own personality, back story, goals and motivations--and YOU get to decide whether or not to add them to your army and help them grow over time.This game is a true gem. It is nothing less than a crime that a game of such originality is not mentioned in conversations of JRPGs more often. This is the JRPG that I hold every other JRPG up to--and until we get another game in this universe, I see no other game coming close. I cannot recommend this game enough.			"

												I bought The Last Remnant for $3.74 in 2011, and it took me four years to finally get around to playing it.  It took me 99 hours to get to the end because I went out of my way to do all of the important sidequests, so if you're not interested there, you can be done much faster.  There's also a demo if you want to try a bit of the game out for yourself.  I played the game entirely with the Xbox360 controller and did not try keyboard and mouse.  The Last Remnant is a type of strategic RPG that masquerades as a standard JRPG.  There's a lot that it does differently than compared to a JRPG, but then it's also pretty different from your standard SRPG too.  Or tactical.  Whatever.  I've seen it compared to Ogre Battle and I've heard that TLR was originally a SaGa game, but I haven't played anything in either series so this game stands as quite unique for me.  The story is kinda all right, I liked being able to go back to the city sector screen from anywhere in town, and there are a few catchy battle themes.  Combat is a fairly different affair compared to the typical ""everyone stands in a line and makes hitting motions at the enemy"" kinda game.  Instead of having between three and five people out at once to save the world, you field a max of 18 in the second half of the game, though it's not entirely as though everyone's running around doing their own thing.  You put your characters into small parties of up to five members each, or unions, where everyone pools HP and AP for special moves--but the enemy does it too.  This is a game where positioning and attacking the enemy's side is important, but unlike grid-based strategy RPGs, you can't directly order your your unions into a position to trap enemies.  The game works on a Deadlock mechanic.  Basically, two opposing unions meet on the battlefield and fight it out until one of them is dead.  At least you can break Deadlock to attack another group or heal, and the enemy can't.  But the idea is that both groups are focused on only the other, so you can have another group attack that preoccupied enemy group to flank them, and continue to gang up on them to get further damage and morale bonuses.  Of course you're vulnerable to being flanked, so it's generally a good idea to assign everyone their own target, and to target the flunkies in boss battles first since everyone focusing on the boss first leaves everyone's back open.  There's also the morale feature to keep in mind.  Unions have their own Limit Break-styled morale meter, but there's one at the top of the screen that affects both sides of the battlefield.  Most battles start with it in the middle where neither side benefits, but one side getting an advantage will result in better combat performance.  Enemies appear in the field and you're given an opportunity to initiate combat (on top of trying to draw as many into one fight for a higher challenge and more rewards), but if they catch you, they'll start with a free turn and the bar in their favor.  A stat buff for the majority and a stat debuff for the minority sounds insignificant, but it's very noticeable in practice.  Some tougher enemies will use devastating attacks when they control the morale bar, so shutting them down is a top priority.  There are QTEs during battles.  I know some of you are rolling your eyes already, but I like to think of it closer to a timed-hits mechanic versus ""press this button to not die"" like in some games, since the prompt comes up during the same part of the animation.  The chance for the prompt is tied to the battlefield morale, and during an attack, you're given one of five buttons (default A, B, X, Y, and right trigger for X360 controls).  Successfully press the right button in time and the next person on your side in that Deadlock will leapfrog to the top of the action queue and do their move, getting another prompt.  Hit all of the prompts to finish the combo and the last person on your team will attack with a guaranteed critical hit.  There's a prompt when being attacked too--parrying results in a stun, blocking with a shield results in a damaging shield bash, and evading results in a heavily-damaging counter attack.  Given battles are largely an affair of picking orders and then watching everything play out, this does keep things kinda engaging, though you can also set the game to handle the prompts for you at a lower success rate.  When it comes to control, there's not a lot that's in your hands.  You're given a choice of up to five orders per union, ranging from ""attack with your weapon!"" to ""use Combat Arts!"", but you may not get the prompt to heal or revive somebody when you really need it.  And even if you do pick ""use Combat Arts!"", that doesn't mean everyone in the union actually will, even if they have enough AP.  Some of it is down to union composition, though there's also union morale to consider.  You can at least turn off individual arts if you don't want people using them.  You can't directly give any equipment to anybody except the protagonist, Rush.  There's an .ini edit to circumvent this, though that has its own hangups.  There's a pretty robust item creation/upgrade system, but your characters can only request things you have in your inventory already and they may not ask for or even use things that logic states they should.  You can assign unions their own formations, but you can't exactly move people away to avoid the big boss' area-of-effect attack, so you have to hope that everyone is standing in the right place to not get torn apart.  The only real problems I had with the game were texture pop-in and laggy gameplay, even on a solid-state drive.  Cutscenes weren't immune to this either, but at least you could pause to let everything load, or pause and then skip them if you wanted.  The game was also more difficult than I'd consider other JRPGs or the like, though I wouldn't put it up there with the hardest games in the genre.  A lot of it can be avoided by setting your teams up well, though there's still a luck element involved.  This is also one of the few games I've played where trying to do all of the major sidequests makes the final boss significantly harder.  Given you have to beat a very difficult boss for that 100% completion before a certain part of the story, it's not really suggested to attempt this on your first time through--there's a New Game Plus feature so try it on your second loop.  I kinda hurt my enjoyment of the game by having to grind out because of my unknowing mistake.  But despite all that, I really did enjoy my time with The Last Remnant.  I've never quite played anything like it, and while there isn't as big a drought for JRPGs on PC now as there was in 2011, this game is certainly unique enough to be a keeper in my book.  If you have any interest in the game at all, you really should try the demo out.  It manages to be a fun experience without falling back on established Final Fantasy references or the like.			"

												I got into this because I heard of a $100 prize being offered to anyone who streams and beats this on vidyashorts. This challnge had been going on for years, with the prize getting higher and higher. You'd think if someone is paying for you to play a game it must be either♥♥♥♥♥♥ or they're just a rabid fan of it.A few hours in, I understood entirely why someone was willing to pay to have someone play through it. This was an incredible game that gave me the same vibes that Dark Souls did when I first played it. It had challenge to it, but at the same time I had never heard of it. Watching someone go through the hard times just like when you did on your own play through, watching someone play TLR must be incredible.Going into The Last Remnant without the wiki open makes it hard, but rewarding. Every challenge you overcame felt more rewarding than the last. Not just because you're clearing things, but because the game always rewards you in some ultimately useful way; not how you'd expect from a ""typical"" JRPG. You do the side quests, you end up with good party members, access to newer areas (or expanding upon ones you have unlocked already), and even the ability to use more skills for Rush, the main character. While going off and doing your side adventures, you're running into harder and harder challenges - rare monsters are (fairly) abundant, and you get the urge every time you see a green name to fight it. Who cares if you lose? You can save anywhere.It got easier towards the end because I had take a tip that fighting more monsters at once meant you got more rewards than fighting smaller groups, even if the total monsters defeated during a trip into an area was the same. I skipped a lot of fighting, instead juking around monsters. There are no random encounters, so your progression as far as ""levels"" (Battle Rank) is entirely up to you. This game has level scaling; if you level up too much, the fights get harder. This isn't a problem if you aren't purposefully grinding or you're good at dealing with groups of monsters, to help increase your gains.The story feels like it has odd pacing because of the way that side quests open up during it. Keep in mind if you're stuck and don't know what to do, talk to the guys behind the counter in any pub. They'll tell you about side quests, and typically you'll find the next story trigger in there, if you're lost on where that could be. I didn't fight the superbosses, but they exist. After beating the game, there is a NG+ which allows you to enable hard mode. Normal fights can last a long time, too. I fought rare monsters which required 30 min just for one attempt at it. When I got the hang of things and became stronger relative to what the game expected, the fights got easier and shorter. Never faceroll, though, except for a few isolated cases.This game, while it is a JRPG, doesn't contain the expected JRPG elements you're used to. This is good both for longtime fans of JRPGs who can still play it and enjoy the elemtns which it keeps, as well as for people who aren't really into JRPGs. Nothing silly like buying a new weapon you saved all your gold for just to find it in a chest in the next 'dungeon'. You don't wear armor, just a weapon, shield optional, and 2 accessories.This is one of those games where you really like the characters because they are actually useful. Random quest at the start of the game gives you access to a bad♥♥♥♥♥who you wish you could take out for drinks irl because of how much he helped you early on. Guy from another quest who ""isn't much of a fighter""? You get him too, and hes some ultra badass as well. Cute girls with big swords, old men who will die for you, giant silent warriors, a previous villian and his ""dog"". These are just a few of them. They help you get through the game in more ways than one. Almost every character has their own storyline of some sort, and you wish you could keep them all!Took me 70 hours, completing the story + tons of side quests (no superbosses, skipped some near the end because I was enjoying the story); but only about 70% of the game's total content.Plays best on mouse and keyboard. Oh, and turn auto camera follow off, so you can look around easier at the great landscapes while you're exploring them.Story: 7/10 ~ The pacing, since side quests are so fun, ends up being odd. However, the story itself is good when you're actually doing it.Graphics: 8/10 ~ For a 360 game, it looks good. The battle effects arent bad, in fact, they're really satisfying. Magic isn't as fun as melee combat though. No native anti aliasing.Fun - 9/10 ~ I went into it expecting some marginally entertaining dynasty warriors-meets-FF thing. I got something much better than that. With genuinely satisfying gameplay, I never turned turbo mode on. I left critical triggers to auto and still enjoyed 90% success; I got to sit back and relax as I watched my units do the commands I gave, coming up with my strategy for the next turn. Having your units make a big play to win a very difficult fight is amazing.$ value - 9/10 ~ You'll be playing this a long time if you want to explore it all. I typically played in sessions of 3-8 hours, of which, only 1/3rd was story related. Rarely can you spend $10 and get a 50+ hour game nowadays. Estimate over 100 hours+ if you do not 'cheat' (read wiki, guides). I encourage you to avoid the wiki unless you're in dire straits.Overall, a 9/10 JRPG that you better recognize.Thanks, Peaches, for gifting this to me.			"

 “First they ignore you, then they laugh at you, then they fight you, then you win.” The Last Remnant is a great role-playing game with a unique take on combat mechanics in form of a turn-based, command-based system using symbol encounters. It is definitely the most interesting part of this game providing a lot of fun especially in the larger-scale battles. Originally released for Xbox 360 the PC version of this game features numerous changes from the console, including enhanced graphical settings, a Turbo Mode that increases battle speed (very practical when farming for weapon components), and a New Game Plus option, that allows the player to start a new game with the gold and unique items from their first play-through. And for the hardcore gamers among us there are of course challenges like super boss battles and the component farming for the endgame weapons. On the other hand the sound is a mixed bag of partially epic orchestral music and sorely limited voice-acting. In addition the protagonist Rush is sometimes a little bit uninspiring as a leader figure. Trivia: The battle system of The Last Remnant is originally drawn from Romancing SaGa but refined to a wholly new level. Achievements: While the game has no Steam achievements, a useful guide can be found on the link below.http://lastremnant.wikia.com/wiki/The_Last_Remnant_Wiki_-_The_Last_Remnant_Guide Chronology: The Last Remnant (PC)Role-playing game + squad-based strategy (Fantasy) – 2009			"

												I originally started this game on the 360 but never was able to finish it, partially because of the ridiculously skewed leveling system and partially due to a red ring of death. Despite my inability to get past a boss fight around 80 percent of the way through the game, I really enjoyed it, so I was glad to see this game on Steam. I was even more glad when I started to play TLR again and realized a couple of things: it's a lot easier if you understand the skewed leveling system (and I'll get to that in a second) and the PC version has made a lot of interesting quality of life improvements to the game. Really, it feels like the only thing missing from the PC version is... achievements. (Okay, actually, my other complaint would be that whomever did the cutscene animation has apparently never watched a living person walk before because the modeling is terrible but -- that's minor.)So back to the leveling system. TLR is really interesting in that it removes all control from the player in terms of leveling characters and, to a certain extent, control over a character's actions in battle. So while the lack of control will take some getting used to I actually think the battle system is really fun, if unique. The leveling system, however, causes problems. Essentially TLR has two leveling stats: individual units/character stats (which the game auto-levels/assigns for you) and battle rank, which levels your entire party/army. What I didn't realize the first time I tried the game on the 360 was that having a high battle rank is... actually really bad. The higher the battle rank, the longer it takes for stat increases and the harder the enemies are to beat (to the point where if you have too high a rank, like I did, a boss battle literally becomes a one-shot and completely impossible encounter). So, I'm definitely having a much better play-through on the PC because (a) the PC version seems to have reduced some of the connection between battle rank and difficulty and (b) despite how counter-intuitive it is to NOT level in a RPG, I've managed to keep my battle rank pretty low. That said, the game has an interesting storyline (that I'm eager to finally finish) and is definitely a completionist's nightmare. The main questline is actually fairly short but there's a MILLION sidequests and a couple hundred challenge quests (e.g., kill a specific monter, find a particular item, gain a specific level, etc.) so there's a ton of stuff to do. If you have a good 40-50 hours to kill, you like the idea of transhumanism, and you like SquareEnix, or just JRPGs, I definitely recommend this one.			"

												It's a very deep game, and unfortunately it requires you to plan ahead and optimize.  For your first playthrough go nuts, on the second playthrough look up some strategies :].I hate it when people give reviews and they've only played a few hours, so I figured I should leave my opinion.There's no grinding in this game, although there's a LOT of content for you to miss.  Don't be in a hurry on this one, but also don't try to be meticulous and look up everything on your first playthrough.  Enjoy the cheesy Rush cinematics!  And then familiarize yourself with everything you missed on the first playthrough and make your second one badass!			"

												I personally would not recommend this game because of it's ""leveling"" system. First all, I should note that I don't mind grinding and I hate JRPG's that have the moster's scale to your level, I hate being confined to how strong the developers think I should be at any given point in the game.Needless to say this game has the enemies scale to your level but then goes a step farther to make it even worse with it it's ""battle rank"" (BR) system. The game increases the stats of enemies and decreases the xp received and the chance to increase one of your characters stats. This wouldn't be so bad but the BR sticks no matter who is in your group (or union or whatever they want to call it) so if you level up your main character and the first couple party members in the early part of the game then every party member you get later will be ridicilously weak with no real way to level them up to where they should be.Honestly, google ""the right way to level up"" (skipping the fact a game shouldn't need an explanation of how to freaking level up) with The Last Remnant and they will all say to ""avoid as many fights as possible"". I do not want to play a game where the point of the game is to not play the game as much as possible.			"

												Okay so as someone who I just checked has over 500 hours in this game...  I think that qualifies me to write a review on it.  With that many hours I like the game.  I will break it down into the pros and cons for new players deciding.ProsHands down my favorite large scale battle system.  It balances controling multiple squads facing off against armies without being to micromanaging and yet with still a bit of flexibilty.  Their are some frustrations and a steep learning curve to it though.  You rely upon the computer to bring up your selections and there is a lot of mechanics that go into it from your class, to your formation to your party leader.  Outside of combat selections and even your party build up can dramatically effect your combat.  But when you do finally get the hang of all that you can lead your forces into some truly epic looking and feeling battles.Scenery is lovely in the game and has held up well.  Some areas get repetitive when you are still hunting for rare monsters but usually the areas themselves look pretty.The leveling system i enjoy but it might not be for everyone.  Basically when you begin the game you get to decide how to equip your main character.  The rest of your party you can only choose one of three focuses so they are less customizable. But overall I like the fact that one game I can make him an assassin leading an army, the next a ninja and a combat hog, and a third game an epic healer magic user, and if you have enough patience you can master them all.NegativesThe main character truly has an annoying voice and personality.  How can i play a game so much that I hate the main character?  Well because I truly love the epic battle system it is relaxing and a lot of fun and it gets better and more epic as you go through the game.  And the first time you pull of a synergy or you start busting out the remnants it truly does have an epic feel to it unlike many other games. So just suffer through the main character and enjoy the fights.The storyline.. This game was built to have sequels.  It does not to the best of my knowledge have any in the works yet.  Would love to explore more of the world.  This one has a lot of potential.The learning curve...  You will hate or love the game for the first few hours.  At about hour twenty your going to find someone trick in battle that you didnt realize you could do and things will be easier.  And then youll starting finding combos you can use for end game.  Or formations and specializations.  So the learning curve on this game sucks.  At a hundred hours your still going to learn new tricks and techniques to make the battles more interesting or fun.  Yet while it sucks to take forever to learn it means that there will always be a new little trick you can pick up that will help you later.  Or someone to add to your party in a combo you didnt think of.So the grind is what will get most people though.  Doing all the side quests takes time.  And the first time you have to run across the great sand sea you will appreciate ground transportation that other games have.  This one you have your feet.  No way around it sorry.Overall seems like there is a fair bit of negatives with the postives.  So why do I recommend it so highly?  Because like legend of dragoon the combat is interactive.  The effects in it have stood up the test of time and truly capture the chaos and epic feel of army combat.  Some games will capture that but this lets you control your army in a more fluid manner.  I wish other games had a similar UI. Basically even after 8 years since its release...  The game is still unique in its play and fun to engage in.  Hope some others will give it a try.  That they will be able to suffer through the learning curve and the challenges and find some enjoyment  in it.  And if enough like it hopefully they will make a sequel one day.Thanks for your time and the short novel read.  Have fun my friends and best of luck to you.			"

												This is such an underrated game! The whole combat/unions/formations system is really unique, I haven't played any other game with such mechanics. It is a shame the game didn't sell well when it was released. It is one of the games I come back to replay, again and again. Certainly one of my favourites.			"

												The Last Remnant is the best 3D turn based RPG to hit the PC for ages. The union system allows you to control groups of characters by issuing a single command and while it might seem simplistic, the way you arrange your groups and what abilities you select for each character to use in combat makes it much more interesting, and the way your characters evolution isn't directly decided by the player, but rather managed by what you do makes it very immersive. As the player, you will need to pay attention to what a character's actions are in order for them to become stronger. Also the boss fights can resemble alot what an MMORPG boss fight is like, as you should assemble specific groups of characters, such as a group of healers and a tanking group, and getting the right characters to fill in these roles isn't as simple as to pick them up in a store, the player needs to develop the characters in a specific way if they are to become a specific member of the group, as you can't just put anyone doing anything.The story is interesting enough to keep you going, having it's ups and downs, and the side quests are a nice break and chance to make your characters stronger.The letdowns are how the item gathering system works, as it isn't always clear where you can get the items you need to craft or upgrade your characters, but a great wiki is present at http://lastremnant.wikia.com/wiki/The_Last_Remnant_Wiki_-_The_Last_Remnant_Guide which has all the information you will need to help you with this. The main character is simple minded, childish and might not be your prefered one, but he's flexible enough to become strong in anything, so you'll find him useful.This being said, the game is a great chance for people who have been wanting a deep, fun and challenging turn based RPG, specially on the PC who hasn't had anything like this in a long time.

												100% Complete RunI originally played this game back when it came out on PC and thought it was pretty cool. I remember getting stuck somewhere and giving up. Basically without the updated wikiI was not understanding the inticacy of many aspects of the game. The gmae lacks a tutorial for many important aspects of the game and once hindered the ability for some to get into the game. (There really should be a link to the wiki in the description of the game or something because without it I would never have enjoyed it so much.) Pros+ Story - The story isn't actually all that bad. While it definitely has its ups and downs, as a whole it changes some of the same old broing troupes of JRPS, while keeping others. The dialogue and voice actors sometimes help make the story predictable, but there are some neat twists and some great characters.+Gameplay - The game is remanisent of an MMO and traditional JRPG in that there is an overworld map, which you can choose a location to go to. You are then entered into a 3D enviroment where you can move and see enemies running around, like an MMO or Chrono Trigger. You enter combat by engaging with the enemies on these fields and to help do that you have a special ability that allows you to slow time and link enemies together to fight at once, or manipulate in other ways (like avioding them). The combat system is great for seasoned JRPG fans. Its great fun and sometimes great strategy. You can enter towns and go shopping, grab new quests, do guild tasks, and talk to randoms. +Graphics - For a game thats getting older, the URE3 hold up decently, not ground breaking by any means. Environments are beautiful and fairly detailed, and there are a lot of them.+Completion - It takes over 60 hours to 100% this game. Took me double that. The list I went by is:1. All Quests2. All Guild Tasks3. All Weapon Upgrades Maxed4. Rank 8 Conqueror5. All Arcana Abilities (because they are awesome)For completing the game you get a new game +. For doing all of those individual things, you should get a lot of items to carry over and a gold bonus, as well as proving you can take down the badest of the bad in the normal game.Cons- Story - Short imo. But I guess thats not so bad see as how this game took days of my live away.-Graphics - Even after years the game still suffers from texture pop ins and Rush's skirt....wtf-Gameplay - Battles can feel tedious many times over. Sometimes you will get frustrated with certain enemies, most in the story mode. White Conqueror took me 5 attempts. No minigames :(. -Completion Bonus - All the purple shiny items you get are just Trophies for when you play the new game + mode. That sucks. Also no achievements. I really liked this game my second time through. Shoutout to the wiki.			"

												If it's caught your eye, but you're on the fence about The Last Remnant, then you already love JRPGs; as such, I'll make your decision easy for you: Go hit Add to Cart, and kiss several hours goodbye.As you could probably tell from the videos as well as other reviews, the core of The Last Remnant is a fairly traditional JRPG, though it has a pretty unconventional take on battle and party mechanics. In reality, your success in battle will *largely* depend on what strategies you embrace, and those decisions start well before the battle screen ever initiates. Your Party is made up of all the characters you've picked up or hired, which you then organize into battle groups called Unions. During a fight, each Union is given a set of pseudo-random commands, and you select one of those options for the Union to perform (see the third-from-last screenshot on the store page). While at first, this system feels like a complete roll of the dice, as you get a few battles under your belt and start developing your characters, there is actually quite a bit you can do to help create conditions that give you favorable battle commands. Moreso, there are actually a number of different schemes you can play with for Union organization. For sake of example, I've had equal success with having one healer in each of my Unions, as well as having a dedicated Union that serves as an all-around party heal/buff squad, backed up with a couple long-range attackers. In fact, range also plays a pretty important role in combat; units can be intercepted en-route to their intended target, granting a damage bonus to the intervening enemy squad.Graphics are suprisingly top-notch for a game released back in '09. The spell and particle effects have aged well, and in a *shocking* twist, seem to have been ported favorably from the console version. The controls, however, didn't have as much attention paid to them. Check out warutaru's review for some crucially helpful steps in making the controls more PC-friendly!All things considered, I have had an absolute blast playing TLR, especially for the mere ten bucks I dropped on it. I can honestly say it's one of the most pleasantly surprising games I've bought in a long, long time!			"

												+ The one of a kind battle system will be either the biggest source of rage or fun in this game. In fact, whether you will like this game or not depends almost entirely on this system. There is significant hidden depth within the mechanics of battling but you are also cruelly punished for being oblivious, as the game doesn't bother to explain much more than the basics.+ Story isn't too bad, albeit a bit plain. OST is swell which is saying something since you have to listen to the same tracks for quite a while. The music has a good variety though and they change up the battle tracks too.+ Major improvement over X360 version as well as a significant difficulty step up. The polish balances the game a lot better.- Enemy skill Overdrive is jaw droppingly OP. Your funeral. Their other killer skill Miracle will also make your jaw drop until you realise it wasn't half as bad as Overdrive.- Quick time events are pretty boring but then you realise that deliberately missing some of them gives you some control over the action order... Still that's a pretty haphazard way to implement such a feature. Other chance based events such as activation of remnant arts are unreliable which can be a source of annoyance.- Aside from main boss difficulty spikes, which may require you to grind for a short period of time, DLC superbosses on the other hand are near un-♥♥♥♥ing-beatable.- Insufficient tutorial for the given depth so......If you don't want to have a bad time, consult the wikia properly as you play, which is very well written with spoiler hiding tags as required.

												The Last Remnant is an excellent RPG and Strategy game. While it does focus on group combat, where you can't choose each individual's attacks, it does allow for a more realistic feel to combat. Enemies attack in groups, and use the same kind of tactics that you use. While the game has an ""auto"" save slot, do not expect it to use it. Save often, and be careful about where you go. Not all quest are simple, and bosses are a notch above other enemies. The story is interesting, but there are alot of cinematic scenes at a frequent rate.Overall, it's worth buying. It's an interesting game, and I've enjoyed what I've seen so far.			"

												Before considering buying this game, I thought it might suck. To my surprise, it didn't. Well, of course it has flaws, like the combat system for example.. Yes, it is turn-based, but the outcome is 40% based on luck factor, and its friggin' confusing.. it took some time to understand and get used to it.  You gotta fight lots of monsters, and you are gonna do that several times to level up your char. There are rare boss monsters, some of which will spawn just once (if you leave the area, you'll never gonna see that rare monster again, so if your char/union is weak - you're pretty much screwed) Monsters leveling up along with you.. so watch out. Graphics are ok...(for a consoles) there could've been hi-res textures pack for PC. Music and voice acting is awesome (im playing with japanese vo, English might suck.. don't know, don't care)The story is sufficiently interesting. I didn't beat the game yet.. but I love it! Reminds me of Ys series mixed with Final Fantasy.Well, that being said,my score for The Last Remnant is 7/10.  It doesn't suck, but could've been much better. "

												Excellent Final Fantasy syle game with innovative and interesting combat mechanics and a surprisingly good epic storyline. Very high quality production values, nice graphics, decent sound and voiceovers. To those complaining that it is grindy or too hard I say turn on autosave and learn how to use unions and union formations - if you do this correctly you will find that the difficulty level is fine and that grind requirements are acceptable. It is not immediately clear that when you first go it alone you need to add any newly hired characters to your union formations before you fight - do so and enjoy.			"

												There aren't many JRPGs on PC, and on the surface it seems like The Last Remnant fills that gap to a T. The problems, and there are many of them, appear when you look deeper at the game; for most people, this will likely happen upon reaching a boss battle that seems (and may potentially be) impossible to win. If you can get past that, though, it can be a fun experience.The first major problem with The Last Remnant is the battle system. Some of the decisions made by Square Enix are impossible to understand, as if battle mechanics were decided by throwing darts at a dart board.To participate in battles, you need to create unions. These groups of up to 5 characters fight as a single entity (for the most part) in combat. When you take these unions into combat, you are given up to 5 generic commands (like an all-out attack, or healing, or inflicting ailments) which feature appropriate ability usage from each unit in the union. The issue is that you have no control over the specific abilities as well as no control over the general commands you give to your unions, leading to situations where you cannot use the command or specific ability you want for no reason at all.Secondly: QTEs. Like some other modern turn-based RPGs such as Paper Mario, The Last Remnant uses quick-time events (QTEs) to keep the player engaged. In The Last Remnant, each QTE is a single press of one of 5 buttons, with the other change-up being how fast you must press it. Compare this to a game like Paper Mario, where abilities and attacks will generally each have their own unique interaction, and it's easy to see how tedious The Last Remnants QTEs can be.Compounding upon the lack of variety and utilization of skill is the fact that QTEs in The Last Remnant can have an inordinate impact on the outcome of battles. Hitting QTEs successfully has several impacts on battle: 1) The next unit in the union has its turn come immediately after a successful QTE. 2) Hitting several QTEs in a row leads to automatic critical hits for the rest of the units in the union, provided you hit their QTEs as well. 3) Units can ""reconsider"" their attacks, changing what attack they are doing to what they feel is more appropriate, which is almost always a better option than their original one.Worst of all, QTEs are random. They don't always show up, and you have no impact on when they do. Then, due to how impactful QTEs are, a battle can swing simply on whether or not QTEs show up.Then there's the issue of leveling. The game gives you no information on how its non-traditional leveling works. Your units gain stats, new or upgraded abilities and your ""Battle Rank"" (BR) goes up every once in a while after battle. However, the game doesn't tell you that your BR is the measure of *the opponents strength*, where a higher BR makes enemies stronger in an attempt to have the game have a smooth difficulty curve. It also doesn't tell you that your BR isn't directly tied to your characters' strength, and you can use meta knowledge to have your BR stay low relative to your characters' power by fighting only the efficient battles. Unfortunately for average players (myself included), this leads to situations where you may fight most battles you come across and *hurt* yourself in the long run. And, again, due to lack of information, a player that falls into this pit won't know about this problem until they reach an impossible fight and search the internet for help, only to find out that everything they've done in the game was wrong and they may very well have to restart the entire game to fix it.As you can see, there are many problems (and more I couldn't fit in this review) with The Last Remnant. It is a strategy game with a distinct lack of strategy in places where strategy should shine, and an RPG where how one levels is completely unclear to those who don't metagame. A dedicated player who researches can get past these problems, but the average person will become stuck and frustrated, thus I cannot recommend The Last Remnant.			"

												Great game, people say the combat is all rng but it's about building your units correctly to get the options in battle that you want, you have to actuly pay attention to which units you group together in order to get what you want.  People just simply don't understand the mechanics.I wouldn't say it has the best story but for the price now it's worth it, there are so many ways you can build the characters without needed to control there equipment there is more strategy to this game then people realise.I wish there was more games like this in 2016			"

												I remember when I was a little too young to have a job. I played the demo of this game now and then, trying to figure out what it's all about, how to 'level up' in it, where to go... this game is truly unique and separates itself from any strategy RPG I have ever played. Square Enix hit on something really good with this game, and that is the idea of strategic army-like combat. You get party members of all kinds, from simple soldiers to guild mercenaries with special traits/powers and the generals of Athlum, who are undoubtedly some of the most powerful characters I have. These characters are organized in to ""unions"" which are groups of units on the battlefield. Improving your characters is done through what actions are taken the most by them, so if you have a character using mystic invocations a lot, he/she will improve in his/her mystic invocations (though you can certainly have them learn more than that, depending on the character). There's no real ""leveling system"", Battle Rank is more of a bounty-like rating based on how well you've done in battles (except that it doesn't decrease), and will affect how tough your enemies will be from there on out. It's mostly about having your characters use what you want them to get better at, and then utilizing those growing skills on the battlefield appropriately, which I really like to grow them!Here's the catch that separates this from your typical Strategy RPG: They don't act singly. As I mentioned with the union system, they actually act as a group, so you select from 5-6(?) battle commands which vary based on many circumstances (you can see the wiki page for this game for more on that if you're curious, I highly recommend reading up on it before buying to make sure this game is something you'd want! Even try the demo!) You might get a command that says ""Attack using Combat Arts"" and ""Attack using Mystic Arts"". Selecting the first would have all units who possess a usable Combat Art use it, unless the AP cost is too high in which case they'll do a normal attack. The second would have all units who know a mystic art (not all units can be mystic users! Your main character, Rush, however, can learn all mystic arts throughout the story... I won't spoil how, that's what the wiki is for) use the one they know that doesn't go over the AP budget for that turn; Those without mystic arts would do a normal attack. Many factors influence what option shows up the most, or with the results you want, and it's these factors on the battlefield and in the character's training that make strategy all the more important. Organizing your unions appropriately, with formations that match the role you have in mind for them, and proper battlefield wit when the tide starts turning, make this game quite insane.I highly recommend this game to anyone who is looking for something more... unique in the genre of Strategy RPG. First of all, I recommend reading the wiki, watching some Youtube videos, and playing the demo before you buy. This game isn't for the faint of heart, but it also isn't overly punishing (unless you just try to zerg everything without any forethought at all to your foe's strengths and your own weaknesses) I can safely say, that this is the most unique Strategy RPG I have played to date, on Steam and off Steam.

												First off, this game is AMAZING.Let me start with the bad, just to get it out of the way.--The animation can use some improvement BUT it does NOT effect how well your gameplay may be. In fact, it might even be seen as comic relief, esp. with how the units ragdoll when terminated in battle.--The story could be executed WAY better; not to say that it's completely poor, but there are some cutscenes that are lacking in specific reactions and some relationship development that could've been included to bring about a far more emotional pull.--They don't really give you too much information about the connections in the plot and the background.--In my own personal opinion, it lacks a couple that probably would've been amazing if they made it canon.Now, onto the AMAZING:--AMAZING plot/story with AMAZING characters. They're all dorks, seriously. While relationship development and animation could've been better, they are all unique in their own right. Even the ones you can hire to be as a part of your own union have their own personalities, and some of them come with their own sidequest to get into. The plot itself could have been explained a bit better but it is DEFINITELY worthwhile with a type of ending that tends to be unique among games and even stories themselves.--The bosses, while incredibly difficult and ragequit-worthy, are CHALLENGING. You really need to think and strategize how you sort out your unions and how you use each character and especially what moves you make. Each boss has their own style of being beaten, and it's really awesome to get into how exactly to defeat them. Their moves are unique to them, so you have to think of ways to get around it if you die repeatedly the first twenty times. It isn't easy, and THAT'S what makes it so fun. It can be considered near IMPOSSIBLE because one of the bosses you encounter in this game, The Gates of Hell, is just lkmifowmfoIAMOIAmf rage everywhere BUT I /thoroughly/ enjoyed each battle, no matter how hard I did rage.--The OST is to DIE for. Every single piece is AMAZING.The battle themes? They REALLY get you pumped and it IS download worthy. And you remember that boss I just mentioned? The Gates of Hell? The music that plays during that fight is absolutely SPECTACULAR; it's one of the reasons why I didn't give up straight away.The battle system seriously needs it own paragraphs because of how UNIQUE it is and how PERFECTLY it's set out.--It's kind of like chess, except more elaborate and you operate in what they term 'unions'. The formation and the leader and the units in them are customizable; the unit limit allowed in battle as well as the number of unions is small atfirst but as you go through the game, it increases. The units themselves, unfortunately, are not customizable but the main character certainly is.--The commands are tailored specifically to what abilities the leader has, and to an extent the rest of the union. They are also dependent on situation and the items in your inventory as well as where your unions are position on the battlefield, which makes it realistic.--When you launch your commands, the sequence itself that plays out gets you on the edge of your seat and it's actually REALLY mesmerizing to watch. It's not boring at all and there's the option to get involved in helping your unions attack because there's a live trigger that appears sometimes (I tend to put it on automatic but if you like getting immersed in the game then there it is!).--No character operates individually unless you specifically assign only one character to a single union (which is probably a straight ticket to them dying). Each character works together and it's REALLY charming, in my opinion, because you can really see their teamwork (especially when they're allowed consecutive turns due to the live triggers) buuuut I digress. What I'm trying to say is that this battle system isn't like any other, simply because the way you command them is not as individuals, but as a whole. This means that they attack as a whole, they heal as a whole, and they, well, /die/ as a whole. I'm not sure what other game exists out there that has kind of the same system (except maybe Warcraft and Dawn of War but they aren't exactly turn-based), but nothing else really comes to mind so The Last Remnant REALLY takes the cake on unique battle system.I've probably just rambled really badly in this review but I REALLY REALLY REALLY recommend this game!! I'm actually REALLY surprised that it isn't popular because I would've thought that the story and gameplay would hook people in despite the downsides. All the same, this deserves a FAR bigger fanbase so I really encourage anyone that happens across this review to try it out. Just pleeeaaasee aahhhh. Not even this review can express how amazing I think this game is.			"

												If you like the ""Final Fantasy"" aesthetic, you'll surely like this. The Last Remnant has a very experimental combat system which is interesting if not a bit frustrating at times. The game is actually very difficult, and some boss encounters can take several hours to defeat. Make no mistake, this game is a grindfest. You will need to grind to progress through the game. Thankfully, the grinding isn't difficult, and I found it to be more tolerable than most games.The game really shines durring the boss fights. If you are the right level, boss fights are super engaging, and will require strategy to defeat them for sure.Just make sure you turn auto-save on before playing! If you don't, you may find a boss is too difficult and end up stuck with no way to return to the world and grind a bit.$10 is a bit much, so I would recommend waiting for a sale, but I'm sure the more devoted fans of Square will find $10 a great deal for them.

												It's a very deep and demanding game that almost force you to seek help from the internet to understand all nuances about the battle and leveling systems. That said, those willing to go deep into the system will find a very rewarding game with LOTS of quests and things to do. It's a kind of game that, once you start liking, deserve multiple playthroughs with different challenges (i.e., ""Mystic Arts Only"", ""Item Arts Only"", Low BR Run"", etc).The makers did a great job porting this Xbox360 game to PC, since the console release had lots of framerate issues, all solved on PC.For those interested in the game, I recommend reading the excellent wikia, which still has a decent amount of people discussing and helping those in need (and a assure that you WILL need help in order to understand everything in the game).I do recommend this game to hardcore J-RPG players, there's a lot to be loved about the curious and deep system.

												The Last Remnant is a JRPG that can still be fun despite an overwhelming number of quirks and flaws.As pointed by many reviewers, it's level scalling is inherently flawed, with enemies scalling to your Battle Rank, a measure of how many battles you've fought, but not of your party's strength.The combat is turn-based, as most JRPGs, the system, however is a quirky mess, with your options for controlling unions (small parties formed with your characters) being somewhat randomized and influented by external conditions (enemy type, status, previous actions, leader class, etc.) One can adapt to the system, but it makes combat more luck-reliant than strategical.The major gameplay problems lie, however, on the huge difficulty spikes. During the main story you'll probably never run into those, but very difficult sidequests and strong rare monsters appear way sooner than they should, making you wonder why the devs bothered including the battle rank system in the first place.It doesn't help that the game hides to much info, such as how the class system works, character skill levels, class requirements, quest objectives, material sources, etc. Making it almost mandatory to play this game with the last remnant wikia open on the side.Then come matters of personal preference. Being a JRPG, you pretty much know to expect flashy (and somewhat silly) character designs, oversized weapons, steriotypical characters (although a few are quite well fleshed out).The story itself could be interesting, but it has an incredibly odd pacing, sending you back and forth between cities (your travel on the world map is instant though), walking randomly into city areas in order to trigger a scene, talking with a generic NPC nobody ever mentioned...There are also some heavy sins such as the narration interlude at the end of part 1, interrupting a moment of tension as if nothing of importance happened thereafter. Cliches abound as well with characters fainting or dying before revealling crucial information, characters looking wide-eyed at someone outside the shot and then the scene cutting off somewhere else, antagonists leaving heroes alive just because, and the list goes on and on...To summarize, The Last Remnant is far too quirky, unbalanced and badly written for me to recommend it, yet, it managed to make me obsess over it with a large number of sidequests and room for powergaming. If, despite such warnings you still want to play this game (seeing as it's rather cheap), do so with the last remnant wikia on the side, and study well how to keep your Battle Rank low, how to better progress characters through classes, which characters are useless, which are good, sidequests availability, weapon upgrade paths, crafting material sources, etc.			"

												I walked into a storm when I started playing this. I got this game as part of a bundle and got a lot more than what I paid for. This is what happens when Final Fantasy meets Mount and Blades distant cousin. I'll explain that last sentence in better detail below. The Last Remnant uses a battlefield type feature to change the typical dynamic of an RPG. The Last Remnant is a tale of individuals who accept remnant culture, meaning they accept the magic that comes with remnants. There is an establish figure head for remnants known as ""the academy"" in which they attempt to regulate the use of remnants (meaning no engineering or manipulating the pieces). An opposition exists that wants all remnants abolished. The story line (if you can sit through the masses of cut-scenes) is quite an interesting one and ties well politically into today's issues.The player takes control of a man/dude/guy named Rush. Rush is able to freely explore the world as he wishes. More locations will open up the further Rush progresses through his quests. Usually, there is a main quest available and side quests are up to the player to find the right person in town. It was hard at first to find where I needed to go. Upon taking a closer look at the map, ""!"" mark where quests are available (whether it's in a town or another district). You cannot jump in free roam or any amazing things like that. Free roam is essentially meant for the player to explore or replenish/buy/sell any weapons, armor, stones, dismembered or captured beasts and (not limited to) herbs. Yes, you may capture certain monsters you fight but this is up to the game. The game also decides whether or not ""rare"" monster will appear. Obviously, these are worth more than your average. Upon leaving the city, the player will engage in a passive attacking free mode. You are only pulled into battle when a monster collides with you, OR when you decide to engage a monster. After a bit of time, a time rift ability appears in which you are able to slow down time and move across any dangers you do not wish to intercept. On the other hand, you may use this ability to sneak up on opponents and get the first strike. Now you have entered a battle scenario. How does this game differ than any other turn based RPG game? Well, you're on a battlefield. You literally have to plan out what your units should do or else you'll get flanked and boom, here comes the ""game over"" screen. A union (group of units) may consist of up to 5 units in varying formations (you can choose). You may have a few of these unions. Every character you add, adds extra HP. The issue with unions which makes them sort of mechanical is that you are not able to customize their equipment. Some may find it better this way as micro management isn't such a pain. There are those, however that like to make a connection with their characters. I'm just happy I have such a big party :). When in battle mode, you can choose to do a different variety of things (attack with magic, attack with combat, heal or tell units to use their best judgement). Each unit can be assigned one command. Each unit can also be told which target to attack. This is very vital as positioning of units will change over the course of attacks. If you send a unit to go flank another unit on the other side of the battlefield, that unit may be susceptible to a flank of their own if not properly covered by other units. You cannot physically tell units to move into a specific spot, only which targets they should attack. A neat feature to keep the player involved and on their toes (instead of waiting and watching) is quick time events. Even though it's a small game play dynamic, it still brings me back to the good old Super Mario RPG days where if you timed your attack properly, you could hit your opponent twice. This same idea is here but be careful in choosing turbo mode. Your chances of hitting the right button becomes quite difficult! Dodging doesn't have this feature but some dodges will give you a QTE to counter an opponent. I'm not a 100% if there is a dodging/blocking feature as seen in Super Mario RPG (where you press A at a certain point of the opponents attack). Beyond the fighting, there are accessories that you can give Rush that boost his HP or certain attributes. Weapons can also be changed or rotated from main arm to side arm. Alternatively, you may give your character a shield for a better defensive chance. The grinding so far into the game hasn't been extremely bad (regarding leveling up) but there are times where you won't be able to beat a boss until you get your level up to a certain point. Some may find this annoying. The visuals are actually really well done. When in battle screen and your soldiers and enemies are close together, they will jockey for position and lunge at each other. These are not official attacks but definitely add definitive beauty to the game. I hate seeing steady background when two arch enemies are staring at each other and don't do anything. I'm glad someone paid attention to this. Sounds are suitable to what the games needs are. There is nothing over the top but I think they could have been a bit more creative with the noise. Music on the other hand is quite soothing when not in battle.Overall, I would recommend this game. Some may find the turn base thing annoying (which I completely agree as I hate turn based games) but I found this game appealing enough to keep at it - and I'm glad I did. The battlefield strategies alongside the QTEs and fluidity of battle cinematics should be enough to make you forgot you're playing a turn based game. RATING : 7.65/10 Gameplay B Story / Campaign B Visuals / User Interface B Sounds / Music B Replay-ability C+ Overall  B-ScreenShots  Initiating a battle  There are more than just humans in this game If you are a big fan of cut scenes you'll adore this game. Luckily you can skip if you want Description about your time shift ability A view of the world map (not district map) This is what a district map looks like. Note the symbols  What a battle screen looks like QTE event during a strike In this battle screen, you can really note the amount of enemies on the battlefield map and available targets to choose from on the bottom right Don't crowd around all one unit or he may just take out your entire squad "

												Okay so having finished this game at a 100% completion with over 400 hours invested in it (I played it on X360 too, years ago) here's an actual non-biased review.Pros:The UNIQUE (and by unique I mean nothing compares to it in ANY game whatsoever) combat and leveling system.Not only do you have to keep track of the classes (which, by the way, are in a very large amount), but you keep track of your stats (obviously), weapons, abilities (arts)...Every weapon leads to different styles, different arts, different stats, different gameplay.. The customization possibilities are virtually endless. I really like the graphics of the various spells you cast, the combat is really fun to watch, and sometimes the game can get really, really hard (i.e. DLC bosses omg). But hey, I finished it at 100%, and I'm not some hardcore gamer. There's SO MUCH to learn about that when you realize how in-depth and complex the game mechanics are, it can get overwhelming and you might end up quitting. The wiki for it has a plethora of information, so you can't really ""get lost"". But there's so much to do that a 100% completion, played casually and just exploring without really being sure what to do... That's gonna take over 150 hours, most likely. NEW GAME +. oh yes, starting the game with large amounts of cash, and a few other things that I won't spoil.The units and leaders: So. many. possibilities. You dislike a guy? Bench him forever. Want to make a party of only chicks? Go for it. Don't like the main toon? Don't play him. (But he can kinda do everything so worth using). Ah, also. Beautiful story, I really enjoyed the graphics (I mean I played it 7-8 years ago) and the universe you play in is quite large, there's a ton of quests to do. Cons? Sure there's a few. Kinda flawed, a little redundant sometimes, the main character is not the brightest guy..Magic isn't as strong as you'd want it to be, sigh. Some bosses are super annoying and are tough to kill regardless of what you try. The items for your companions, well you can't really choose what they use. Some have unique items, and to properly ""equip"" them, you kinda have to learn how leveling works... which is very complex. Not complicated, complex.Overall: for it's genre, a turn-based JRPG, I'm honestly giving it at 9/10. I don't see what could possibly make it have a bad score. The bad reviews are mainly because of people not taking the time to understand the in-depth mechanics. IT. IS. COMPLEX. But really, really, really fun.TLDR: Very complex game. Unique leveling/combat mechanics. Endless customization. There isn't a lot of information in-game about how everything works (you need the wiki, srsly). But if you like RPGs, and turn-based rpgs, (enchanted arms, lost odyssey) you're gonna love this. It's freaking 13 bucks (to me at least) and has all the DLCs. Until Lost Odyssey gets to PC, I'll be playing this often. "

												An amazing RPG. Full support. I am now playing it for my third time through and thought it time to give a review. Two pieces of helpful advice 1) Don't sell your stuff. Think of this game like FF9. If you don't collect the right items now you will miss out on content/spells/items later 2) Make sure your characters are specialized. Turn off your mages learned melee attacks, and turn off your melee's magic attacks. This will allow you to get the commands you want (they are randomized and pull from active abilities), and if you have toons with melee AND magic abilities then they won't get good at anything, but rather level 2 or 3 at everything (you WILL regret it later).

												Remember a time when jrpg's and especially final fantasy was turn based and everybody was happier? crop yields where larger, women prettier and the drugs where cheaper. Now we live in a time that turns pass only in strategy or oldschool rpg's, and if valkyria chronicles had not been released i would say that this is the only game on steam besides ff re-releases that NOT only has turn based combats, BUT YOU GET TO LEVEL A ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ OF HEROES TO GIVE THEM ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥S OF WEAPONS TO PUT THEM IN ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥S OF SQUADS WITH ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥S OF FORMATIONS. combat is not exactly turn based, more like you arange what your squads of heroes want to do, you end your turn and the turn plays according to the choices that you and the ai made. If you are more into action, there is an option to have trigger events to make good combos while tha battle phase happens, but i prefer to roll my j and have it an auto. AMAZING graphics, SOLID story, EXCITING music and Classic anime heroes await for you in this J-rpg.			"

												I always enjoy Square Enix games, especially this one, I haven't finish the game yet, but I found it really enjoyable. The Last Remnant is a JRPG that seems similar to Final Fantasy although I never actually played it. There is a touch of grinding inside this game, but I wouldn't say it was boring or time wasting, more of entertaining. I have really low standards for most games so I don't think I have a well made opinion on games. However, the graphics, in my opinion, are eye catching, there are some unique looking characters once in a while which I really liked. The sounds and soundtracks are well made and catchy. Only thing I dislike is how the main character is the typical implusive idiot, that rushes in without thinking, it gets boring when most games today has that type of build for the protaganist. Anyways, I found this game pretty good and I wouldn't mind paying full price for a game like this eventhough I bought it during the sale. Would rate 9/10.			"

Surprising large file size and CPU requirements. * you have many options to turn that down though * Battle system like the old ""SaGa"" games...keep your battle rank low unless you want bosses to one-shot you.  If you have the time and space to download this title and enjoy challenging RPG's...do give this a try !!			"

TL;DR - Its the most mediocre game I ever played. Not really worth a negative review, but I have only two options to choose from. Designed for xbox360 controller, so I recommend using it. If for some reason you decide to play this game, please use the game wiki extensively (if you don't want to lose 60% of sidequests), try not to increase your Battle Rank to fast and skip all dialogue if possible - the plot is horrible. Game offers about 80-120h of playtime. PRO's:+ Amazing graphics -  Stunning background environment, very detailed character and item design. Every weapon in this game looks like the ultimate weapon in some other RPG.+ Unique battle mode - You control up to 5 groups of heroes that you can recruit from special guild or meet during your journey. Each group of heroes permorm a single action, moving on a battle field. Groups of characters and enemies can intercept one-another while they attack or gang up on one group to finish it off quicker. Its a very clever idea for a turn-based combat system.+ Lots of sidequests - There are many different things to do, lots of guild missions, sidequests and hidden bossfights. You can take a break from main plot and gather some plants for potions or minerals for weapons in a spare time.+ Lots of characters - You meet many characters, most of them with their unique backstory and special quests. You can use a lot of them at the same time (up to 20) and you got a big group of people to choose from.+ Decent music - Nice, hard beat during fighs and chilled tunes in dungeons, works great with those pretty backgrounds.CON's- Almost unplayable without a guide - there is a nice The Last Remnant wiki out there and if you want to play this game, you better add it to your bookmarks. The game offers no explanation of some of its vital mechanics (like party formations or Battle Rank) and you might become confused easily (especially because some of the mechanics doesn't work as intended or don't work at all). Whats worse is that all sidequests have cut-off points in the main plot - you can do them only if you stop your main plot progress before unspecified point and look for them. You can't leave a quest you find to finish it off, because there might be nothing to get back to.- Main plot is awful - Rush is the blandest character in jRPG since Tidus and Sora, a cartboard-cutout without a single unique trait. His sister is a run-of-the-mill damsel in distress and all other primary characters have a personality of a typical Micheal Bay movie protagonist. The main plot is terrible, offers little to no payoff, its clear that it was cut and rewritten numerous times during the game development. If you are in it for the story, you gonna be disappointed.- Team orders are randomized at each turn - you can't choose freely what to do with each character or even a group of characters. In each turn you pick one of the several semi-randomized orders you can give at this time. You may find that your team of healers won't have a healing order in some turn or you won't be able to use magic on specified stack of monsters.- You can't equip items on characters other than Rush - weapons, armors, accessories - you can change them freely on Rush, but no other character. If you got a powerful weapon in your inventory, some characters may ask you if they could equip it (they probably won't though). They will however ask you to give them some raw materials for upgrading their own weapons and gear, as well as your opinion on what they should focus on - magic or physical attacks. It barely does anything so you have very little say in what you characters are using in battle.- Havok engine - enjoy your wacky ragdolls :)SUMMARYIts worse than you might hope, but better than you fear. Its really the most mediocre thing I've played. As a fan of SaGa series (its from the same devs) I enjoyed some of its mechanics, battles are unique, graphics are amazing and I had fun playing it from time to time. However, its obvious the game was developed in a hurry - it got so much wasted potential that its really heartbreaking.			"

												This game is deceptively simple and a masterpeice. Choose what you want your group to do, and they do it. You don't know it yet, but learning the systems involved, you can control everything.You can't control what individual teammates do, but you can.You can't equip gear on your teammates, but you can.You can't control how tough the world is, but you can.You can't choose your class, but you can.You can't do all the quests, but you can.The game appears simple. If you pull back ANY of the layers, you will see systems inside other systems. Learn to manipulate them, and you gain more control. Every single system is a layer of complexity you can safely ignore, and enjoy the game. But if you don't ignore them, you will be rewarded.Learning to play this game takes 10 minutes. Learning the systems takes a bit more time. Learning to master it or min/max it could take a lifetime.Above average story, and this is coming from someone who hates JRPGs.Here's the crime, there will never be another game like this. There will never be a TLR 2. The official IGN review didn't even know there were Classes in this game. The game may appear to just be so-so if you never ask the question ""Huh... I wonder why that is? I wonder why I can't do that?"" If you have that kind of mindset, then maybe this game is for you. If not, uh, well it's still the game for you.The Last Remant - Low BR Walkthrough "

												The Last Remnant is a whacky six-year old title from squenix, in which you will find yourself confused for a large portion of the game. You will be dumbfounded by the combat mechanics, as well as leveling systems, which tend to go for the different-must-be-better approach. Likewise, you will find dialog cliched, and wierd game flow ideas tossed in to mix it up. For example, after a main quest mission, you get insta-ported back to a castle. After you walk out of said castle five seconds later, you find an NPC right outside that tells you to go directly back to said castle to progress the game for no real reason. Not once, but multiple times in succession.There are numerous faults with the game, and I defy anyone else to say otherwise. But, it's still kinda fun. It's certainly worth the five bones I spent on it, and the six hours I've put into it thusfar have been relatively enjoyable. It's definitely different, and quite possibly could have turned out brilliant were more time and effort expended developing the game -- especially the plot, combat tuning, leveling, game flow, etc. I doubt if I'll ever get around to finishing The Last Remnant, which is charming because of its interesting approach (if flawed), and is still way more fun than Final Fantasy XIII, the closest thing to a digital lobotomy I've ever experienced.Peace.

												There are lots of good ideas here but the execution is so excrutiating that it will leave you wondering what you played and why no one saw the many problems that would form during development.I can seriously go on for pages about what I don't think works but I suspect the rundown for JRPG lovers is this: If you're going to stick to the surface you're going to have a bad time because you aren't going to understand anything and you might not be able to make it through the game.  If you go in medium-depth, you're going to realize you missed out on a lot and that it takes forever to find anything without a guide- and even then, it will be a taxing journey through page after page of wiki and entering/exiting areas to fight rare monsters you're not even sure really exist.  If you go in deep you're just going to be frustrated to realize that at the end of the day the game is a roulette that you must subtly influence in truly inane ways and can screw you no matter how clever, thorough or prepared you are when it counts.At any level you'll find something to love, but so many things that mar it so bad that you can't help but realise they wasted it completely.

												The Last Remnant stands as an interesting game, even among fellow RPG games because of its interesting... combat and character progression systems.What may seem to be taunting and perhaps nonsensical at first hides a wonderful tactical experience that actually discourages grinding and instead encourages the usage of strategy and party planning.Other stuff worth mentioning includes the superb OST, from its varied city and landscape themes to several battle themes, it's one of the best OST's I have ever heard and not many can touch it!If you like spending time managing and planning characters, crafting your own challenges or just having battles where your strategy more than counts, The Last Remnant is my definite pick.

												This is one of the best fantasy role playing games that I have played on the PC.  The visuals are what you would expect from a modern day game and the cinematics remind you of playing a Final Fantasy game (Square Enix still has it).  The last Remant received below average reiews on the Xbox 360 but don't let that dissuade you from giving this one a try on the PC.  Most of the bugs/problems were fixed outside of some noticeable texture pop-in.  You can pause anytime in the game including the CG scenes!  You can even skip the CG scenes if you doing a 2nd play through.  There is an autosave that will save progress after each battle ensuring that you will never have to replay an hour of gaming session because you took a gamble on defeating an enemy before they took your heath down just to die first.  These are the features that I have been waiting for ever since I started playing RPGs.A few things to note, this game requires alot of forumn reading.  Not as much for the story progression as it is fairly linear but more to understand the mechanics of the battle/formation system.  Square Enix took a new direction in the battle system allowing for a very diverse and strategic gameplay but the in game tutorials will leave you scratching your head as to what is happening during the battles.  This has to be the biggest issue that I have with the game.  After reading the FAQs and forumns I found that many others had the same questions that I ran into and most where answered in depth by users in the Steam community.In summary, if you don't mind doing a little reading to nail down the game mechanics and you enjoy turn based battle systems I would definetely recommend the Last Remnant.  The price even when not on sale is well worth the content and enjoyment that you will get out of it.  This is a AAA title from Square Enix with an Indie price tag.  Go buy it right now if you are a fan of Fantasy RPGs!			"

												Oh, The Last Remnant...how could you fall into such oblivion being such an awesome game? Maybe I'm the weirod here for having put so much time in this game, but I've enjoyed it like I have enjoyed no other RPG since Final Fantasy X.Good graphics, music and voice acting (at least the japanese voice acting...didn't check the english one), innovative tactical gameplay (we'll get onto that later), good story (the characters may be a bit lacking...except for the Enlightened Seven, a group of ¿villains? who kick absolute♥♥♥♥♥ and the bad guy who is one of the best villains Square has pulled off in years) and hours...HOURS to spend on side quests and grinding , which hardly ever get tedious, really.As for the battle system: friends and foes are tossed in the a turn based system on a battlefield. Your party is divided in several groups or formations, each led by one character. Each turn, a not-so-randomly generated command list will appear for each formation. The commands will depend on the build of the leader of each party, and this adds a lot of strategy, variety and richness to the battle system and build of your characters. It may sound complicated at first glance but hte game introduces new elements gently so you can keep up with it.Finally, special mention to Superbosses: they ARE CHALLENGING. So good luck trying to complete the 100% of the game.This may be a bit too much for your first experience in a JRPG but experimented players shouls look up to this game and give it a try. To me, it was a major surprise and has become one of my favourite all-time games.9/10			"

												An extremly well made J-RPG. It starts very conservative and slowly, but once it get rolling it is extremly awesome.Cool characters - although the main character is a  little bit annoying from time to time - , well-written story and a really complex fighting system, in which the battles are really intense. It look a bit like final fantasy, but it doesn't play that way. It has a unique moral system, which increases or decreases the damage of your unions, depending on how you position them, and how you perform actions.  You can totally customize your union, and there is a huge amount of differenct characters, mercenarys, soldiers and questcharacters to choose from. There a a lot of boss monsters, whom are very different from each other, and are most of the time really hard to actually beat. The game looks absolutly stunning. The performance is extremly smooth, and i have yet to find a place, where i have lags or where the games stutters. It is pretty unique and an experiment which you either love or hate.  Be prepared, the game is not easy, and if you don't plan ahead in a fight, you will find yourself loading the last save file. However i would definitly recommend playing this game with a Xbox Controller. Although the keyboard layout is pretty good, you have to first activate the tooltips to show the keyboard-commands instead of the gamepad commands. Some reviews have claimed, that you cannot skip cutscenes, which is rather bullocks. Pause the game, and then there is an option to skip them (on the Xbox-Controller Start+Back).All-in all in my honest opinion, i think this game is absolutly brilliant. It has the classic J-RPG feel, with a very complex combat system, an incredibly well written story ( i am not even half through and it has already blown me away), and stunning graphics. And although there are some annoyances with the keyboard commands, i would definitly recommend this game to everyone who loves J-RPGs or who always wanted to play one. It is under my Top 5 of my favourite RPGs and that means a lot. 9.5/10			"

												Recommended: ""Sort of"".It is a nice JRPG, that tries to do something different with its battle system. But it is deeply flawed in the following ways:1. Graphics optimisation is poor. Textures pop in a lot, which is annoying. Sure you can mess around with certain files to fix it, but most people won't want to bother doing that.2. You really do need to force V-Sync outside of the game, otherwise expect some messy screen tearing.3. The plot is generic enough, but it does the job. Where it sort of falls away is you could probably blow through it quite quickly. The real meat of the game seems to be over the other side, with side-quests. And there's a ton of them, lengthy ones, quick ones, and so on. A few of them get closed out reasonably early on in the game, so if you're a completionist, you'll be spending lots of hours getting through these at the expense of the main story.3b. The main story progresses at lightning pace. Honestly, sometimes all you have to do is go to the main story location, watch some cutscenes for 20 minutes and then maybe have a boss fight, and repeat. (At time of writing I've got to the halfway point with 30 hours, about 28 of those hours were doing side-quests and travelling imho.)4. Battle system is interesting but horrendously flawed and frustrating. Basically you create armies or battle groups of up to five people per unit. And they all share the same health pool and action points. You give them commands to attack certain enemy units. Usually you want to keep physical and magic users separate so they can all use either physical or magical attacks together as mix and matching doesn't always allow characters to act together. Also, you generally put a healer in the unit so they can heal when they get hurt. Here's a ridiculous example of a frustrating battle:I fought a battle and ended up with 1 unit left vs 1 boss monster. They were far apart, so couldn't attack each other. My unit had just beaten everything else on the battlefield, but it had a mere 90 hp left out of thousands. That unit had several healers. The enemy unit was almost dead. All I needed to do was heal, and own it. But the game refused to show the heal command, instead my choices were close in to attack next round, or wait. So I waited three times. No dice. The game then took away the command to wait, and forced me to move in. I had lots of Action points, at least three of my characters in the unit knew how to heal in various ways. In the end, the game gave me one choice; Attack physically (or attack with physical skills). No heals. So I attacked, and I died.Here's the kicker, when you die it is game over. So reload time, wait through cutscenes all over again and retry the bloody fight. All this could have been averted by healing, but the game stubbornly refused to allow me to do so. And this is exactly where it becomes so frustrating, here is another hour to be wasted fighting the same battle, a particular pain in the butt if it is a difficult one anyway!5. Levelling is apparently a no-noEvery guide out there suggests avoiding to grind, as enemies scale somewhat and will just ruin your day. Although it's not as bad as people make out, it can add to the frustration.I realise this sounds like a very negative review, and really, I wanted to give this a mixed rating. There's a decent JRPG in here. Probably one could argue that The Last Remnant was an early warning sign of Square-Enix overcomplicating their games and making them somewhat silly. Still, it is a workable game, it just requires a lot of patience. Worth taking a risk for fans of the genre, but it certainly isn't a JRPG for the JRPG-newbie.			"

												This game abused the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of me. I love this game for various reasons, but I can't recommend it. The leveling system is overly complicated. If your Battle Rank is too high at certain points and you can't go anywhere to stat grind, you're ♥♥♥♥ed. The battle system itself is definetely interesting and worth checking out- but be sure to prepapre yourself by reading guides before actually attemping the game. I cannot honestly recommend it, but I understand why others enjoy it.			"

												To put it simply: this is one very decent JRPG if not for the combat system, which although quite novel can be excruciating at times.Story: meh. Nothing exciting happen and the plot goes far too slow to be enjoyed. Kinda funny for a  game titled The Last Remnant when most of the time the remnants only appear as uninteractable background objects. Characters: okayish somewhatMost of your party characters are mercenaries who have no contribution at all to the main plot. Some of them are (awesome) unique characters with nice side quest tho. It's hard to beat a 4-armed catman armed with dual halberds.Music: okayish somewhatThe battle theme is nice to get your blood boiling but it get repetitive after a thousands battlesGameplay and Mechanic: revolutionary? Yup. Frustating? Hell yeah it isAt first you'll be presented by a bunch of combat mechanic (deadlock, flank, rear assault, etc) that sounds awesome on paper but hardly useful on real battle. Most mooks are weak enough to be killed from just a simple deadlock while enemies who truly need strategy to be downed HAVE a high deadlock threshold to even be flanked. This game also has one weird level scaling (kinda like TES IV: Oblivion) wherein your enemies level growth is high. The more you grind the more unkillable the enemies are until you can't do anything beside restarting the game. So, minimize your grind.And the most frustating thing is the combat command. In this game, you can only give your squads vague ideas about what they're supposed to do next (""Use combat  arts!!!"" ""support them!!!"" etc) and the ai will pick his action from his assorted abilities. The problem is it's fuken random, as in at critical time the command you need won't even appear.Example: You need to heal without breaking the deadlock?  Nah, this time the game only giving you an option to break the deadlock, heal, get raidlocked by enemies, BAM your squad downed  Let's use some strategy! Squad A to tank the damage while squad B attack from afar -> the command ""Attack from  afar!!!"" on squad B does not appear + the idle command does not appear  -> Your weak defense, high magic squad must fight the giant behemoth head on -> squad B downed.Technical wise surprisingly (compared  to other SE jrpgs, at least. *cough *cough* FF XIII series) this game has a superb port. Nice graphic options (not just simply low, medium, and high), good translation, good keyboard support (mouse support is meh but you don't really need a mouse for this game), and most of all no random CTD.Buy this game if you love JRPGs and can't stand not to play one. If you're not, only buy it when discounted.			"

												On the surface this game has a lot to offer, a nice art style, seemingly interesting characters and storyline and dungeons to explore. There is much to get acquianted with but long-time rpg players will quickly get the hang of it. However, personally I feel that any of the game's good ideas have already been done far better in the past. After playing for a fairly long time, around 50~ hours and sort of enjoying most of it, the game's faults finally caught up with me and the battles, farming for stuff in caves and the general gring of it all became too much. The battles seem huge and action packed at first but when you get familiar with it, it's just quick jump cuts to out of context scenes of one character striking another, looking at floating numbers and on to the next jump cut. Understanding that the fighting area of the whole world is really just the same huge flat space with no sense of distance or scale ultimately put me off and removed the little fun I had in the action of this game.The characters are akin to the Final Fantasy tactics games' lineup of mostly silent non-story characters who are just a part of your squadron and are ultimately replacable. In those games you could micro manage and customize them very specifically to your needs and sometimes new characters would be available to you for story reasons, however, again in The Last Remnant cutstomizability is turned down to telling each squadmate what to focus on, physical or magical attacks.The cities have some uniqe appeal to them with special scenery here and there, but as the game moved along it seemed as though the time spent on design diminished to the point where I couldn't tell the difference between the last 3 cities I was in. After playing through the first 5 or so dungeons/field levels you also start to see repeated patterns and quite frankly lazy and boring design choices, for example the floor is always completely flat with no elevation.There are a few good things with the game though, to be fair. The aggro and chaining system was fun and worked fairly well, deciding how many enemies at a time you could fight and try to get them to chase you around. The graphics were okay, the fighting effects were rewarding to watch the first 1000 times or so, and the world seemed open and interesting on first glance.Ultimately the game's faults outweighed its strengths and it became a boring, repetitive waste of time for me. There are already tons of good JRPGs just like this out there, and more to the point, I'd say play any one of those over this.			"

												As you may already know, this game has an unique mechanic, its either hit or miss IMO. But I really love this game for this.After over 100 hours and maybe 3-4 times restart halfway through the game (because I can't defeat one of the side mission boss, its almost impossible to beat unless you know the trick), now I can finally beat him for good. Its so ♥♥♥♥ing hard for godsake, I don't even remember how many times I decided to stop playing 'cause I'm not even sure if the bosses are beatable, but I just keep coming back to it. I never finish this game before, not even once. As for now, I got maybe 60% or so of the story, I guess. But, yeah, 3 times of 60%. And its been 7 years since the first time I played it LOL.If you are a casual gamer and you don't wanna waste your precious time over this ridiculously hard game and just wanna sit back and chill while playing your JRPGs, don't buy this game. But if you are a hardcore gamer who want a new JRPGs experience, you love challenge and you do want to challenge yourself, stop reading, do yourself a favor and get this game.			"

												If you can forgive it's flaws, this game is quite unique and potentially very enjoyable. However, it has a ton of shortcomings. I'd give it maybe a 7/10. I'm only recommending the game because it's $10. If it were anymore, I don't think I could recommend it because there are just so many flaws.You can't properly control what your units do. There are many mechanics in the game that are way too convoluted and not at all well enough explained or explained at all. The story is meh. The dialogue is meh. You can't run away from battles. Many mechanics don't make sense or are just plain wonky. You can't equip your units! You have to buy stuff and hope somebody asks to wear it. What if you bought something that cost 900 million gold and hours worth of crafting components and nobody asks to use it? Well you're♥♥♥♥♥♥out of luck. The crafting system is tedious and a joke wth a gazillion different parts. The same enemy models are reused over and over and they jump in difficulty like crazy for no apparent reason sometimes in adjacent zones even though they have identical models and names and are right near each other. You explore the same zones over and over for side quests. If you're trying to be a completionist and do all the side quests, it can take a long time and can at times feel tedious and grindy. For me, I wanted to try an all-female party run, but there are not enough female characters to recruit, most of the female characters are generics, and they all have bad stats compared to the unique male characters so you end up really gimped and a lot of bosses are like HP checks so if you don't have the required HP you get rekt. Thankfully this game has auto-save in the PC version though.Some great, unique ideas in this game that just sadly weren't properly well done. The graphics are pretty good, especially for a 2009 game. A TLR 2 or a spiritual successor that takes this game's concepts but fixes its flaws would be amazing. Square Enix would never invest in such a gamble though I don't think. Especially not while they're just focusing on milking Final Fantasy series.			"

												An experimental game from Square Enix. Essentially it's a squad based semi-tactical JRPG. Why semi? Because unfortunately it heavily relies on RNG component rather than real tactics. You'll command a mini-army of 18 characters (units) divided by 4-5 squads, the problem is that you can only give them a set of commands (like, ""attack with all you've got"", or ""help the others"") and which skills/spells to use they'll decide on their own, for example if you want to bombard a certain enemy with a certain spell than you'll have to rely on luck, your units may decide to use them, use something else or even just simply attack with their weapons. There are few workarounds (essentially just having 3-5 people in a squad with a desired spell will boost chances of casting it or switching targets to get another set of commands) but sometimes it could lead to a very unfortunate results in your battles. I think it's the main reason why this game was not very well received.Despite all that it's still a very fun game to play, there are a lot of everything in this game: characters, weapons, skills, equipment etc. Believe me - quantity of everything is just enormous. Skill system is pretty complex but once you get a grip over everything you'll be pretty satisfied. There are also a lot of customization options for your army, you can hire generals, soldiers, make different formations, farm rare monsters for materials to upgrade weapons of your soldiers or simply craft them yourself.I guess you have to try it to understand whether it suits you or not, cause you wont be able to answer that question for yourself by watching related media and at this price I can certainly recommend this game, especially if you're into JRPGs and not afraid to try something new.My final score is 7/10.

												The Last Remnant.It's one of those rare games that compel you to keep on playing. A one off a kind JRPG created by Square Enix that focuses on skill based tactical combat rather than simple select action>hit enemy with playable characters as in the FF series. With several Hero characters & a lot of generic soldiers to choose from,each with their own styles & weapon sets,the amount of replayability is quite high while trying out the different teams & formations. Plus the ability to control the flow of battle by raising morale,inflicting status effects or simply bludgeoning through the enemies is an added bonus.  Plus there are guild tasks which can be completed to earn new formations,items,money & new certificates that unlock even more tasks & prizes.One drawaback of the game is its tendency to get repetitive as it heavily depends on grinding to build up skills & find materials to upgrade weapons & accessories. Plus monster spawns.especially the rare kind are randomly generated & sometimes it gets extremely frustrating to get a monster spawn at a specific area to get it killed & unlock new items & magazines that helps in getting previously unavailable monster drops.Overall,It's a great game to have for both RPG & JRPG fans as well as tactical gameplay lovers. The bosses are great & have a few hidden bosses(DLC) that are extremely tough to beat & requires careful planning & approach.It's also one of those few games that I have played & possessed as a torrent download,a disc & finally a digital distribution.My rating for the game will be a 8-8.5/10.

												I have beat the game and put in over 100 hours of active playing (I have a padded time in steam because of leaving the game on while doing other things) so I think I can give this a fair assessment.This was a bit of a let-down.The rich world and combat system had amazing potential, which fell woefully short on execution.Lets start with the world; you are given this great mystery of the remnants and trying to find an answer to their existence, but we are given a short and terrible story to progress through the game with. Towns and surrounding areas are all but-nonexistant because of the way they designed the maps to be enclosed and small. We are given a protagonist who is an utter idiot, and we are supposed to believe all these hyper-competent leaders want to follow this stupid kid who does nothing but mess up and make stupid on-the-fly decisions? The antagonist had potential. in the first disc whenever he shows up he is a pure badass, but then he keeps showing up randomly and leaves randomly. They were stretching it, it seems they just wanted him to do something badass and then disappear again, even though him being at that place and his subsequent actions make no sense. The voice acting is far below par, they have decent VAs but it seems the direction they were given was poor. The worst of it is the character animations during conversations and cutscenes. I read they had motion capture work done, and it seems ALL of it went into the combat animations which were amazing, but cutscene and conversation animations are so bad it is jarring, and it took me right out of what was happening. This is saying something, I have a high tolerance for mediocre character animation, this game crossed a line somewhere.Now the combat... Oh the combat, how you had the potential to be a JRPG game changer. ""Lets take something tactical and add randomness and take away most of the player control, that would be brilliant!"" No SquareEnix, no, stop it, stop... it... stop it. Side tangent; has noone in this world heard of ranged weapons? Are bows and crossbows too complex of an idea, do they have to cast most of their magic in melee range? The combat system of unions and leaders was an amazing idea, but once you get to the actual combat, it becomes garbage. I have 60+ AP to spend, why are all the actions available under 16? The best you can do is remove options you dont want showing up to increase the chance of getting something good, which doesn't work enough to not be very frustrating. All of your unions will want to bunch up when fighting enemies, only way to stop this is to make them stay back. But as I said, there is a distinct lack of ranged options. Most of the magic in this game does NOT have a ranged option, not even healing. The magic that DOES have a ranged option will greatly limit what that union can do that turn, and the best magic is ALL melee range. Worst of all, you can not then control your union positioning, you can spread out these tightly packed unions all attacking the same thing, which leaves rare monsters and bosses with wide area AoE attacks to really really really suck.So lets talk about what I did actually like about the game, the things that kept me interested enough to keep playing so long -- All the side things in the game. Hunting down rare monsters, getting my party members stronger, finding new unique leaders, toying with formations and union composition (especially for the really difficult opponents.)The main quest line might suck, but all the side things to do in this game are what provide content worth experiencing. I absolutely love the SaGa system of character progression, no more grinding out levels to overpower your opponent, you have to be smarter about how you approach bosses. This can be exploited of course, no leveling system is perfect, but for your first play through, you are unlikely to manipulate the system. There is another downside - where SaGa frontier games allow you to build a suitable party early, the unique leaders in Last Remnant are spread out. So, leaders you get early will be a lot stronger than ones you get later, they did not scale recruits to your Battle Rank (your level as it were) they merely gave them starting stats which they think is sufficient for that point in the game.Hunting down rare monsters and crafting materials... at points frustrating, very frustrating, but that just makes the pay off of getting them all the sweeter. Could have been handled better, sometimes the RNG really kicks you in the mouth.I can not honestly recommend this game, what it does well, others do it better so you are better off with those. I was strangely compelled to keep playing to the end, but too much was not enjoyable. I will not be coming back to this game at a later time like the vast majority of my other games, I will not feel like playing this game again, it will collect dust in my steam library. Best I can say is that I really got my money's worth, as I bought it during a steam sale.			"

												TLDR:The game is great, but a controller is near mandatory.Long version:Game Mechanics-This game's combat is really customizable, but at the same time it isn't. Let me explain. The core basics of the combat mechanics are to fill ""unions"" (think small parties of around 3-5 warriors) which are handled as 1 unit, and then use a ""formation"" (exactly what it sounds like) that complements what you would like them to achieve. Want them to hit things hard and fast? Use melee formation... Mage? Support? Use magic formation etc.. . There is also a ""tactical"" feel to combat, Unions can flank, intercept, deadlock... And do a lot of other things  which will influence how much damage is done to you, or the the enemy. Alongside the fact that you are usually controlling 2-3 ""unions"", the combat screen looks ♥♥♥♥ing great since that translates to around 15-20 warriors killing things.The downside of combat is as follows:-you can't change the equipment of your party. There are lots of weapons to be made and found, many which are race specific, but you can't equip it on the NPCs. In order for an NPC to change their weapon(s)  you A) have to have the weapon and B) the NPC has to ask you to use the weapon. -There are also a lot of classes/jobs but you are not told what their stats growths are, nor their upgrade paths. Sure you can look at a character's stats but apart from the obvious differences between a mage and warrior, it be hard to place an unit into a role - which is significant when forming an union/formation. Story- The story, and much around it, just feels O.K...- The characters are O.K -  I personally dislike the MC (think cliche dumbass anime protagonist)- The voice acting, save for a few characters, is O.K. - If you don't go back and re-explore towns after certain events, you can miss A LOT of side quests. Don't get me wrong, it is not a bad story but its not a great one either. Visual, Sound & Performance.- I have experienced very few bugs, and the ones that I have seen have been visual ones. (helicopter capes) - I have played on max settings, with no fps drops. The world looks good, but the combat screen is definitely much better. - The music is great. There are lots of different tunes for different towns, and different stages in combat. - A controller is a must. Keyboard/Mouse is supported but it felt somewhat clunky,  there are quick time events that trigger higher speed/dmg - these can be nightmares for keyboard users. There is an option to make them automatic at the downside that they computer can actually miss the trigger (probably for balance purposes)Overall a great game for its price.  "

												This is a Square made Final Fantasy style game that I never even heard about until I saw it on Steam.  Instead of 1-5 party members like most JRPG's, you get to have around 25 in a fight at a time.  Its broken into 5 man teams.  So each team gets a turn in combat each round. I'm on the fence about the game.  The quality is there because its a typical Final Fantasy world, which I love, but it seems that at a certain point the battles become a flip of a coin to win.  When one of your squads has a turn it has several options it can perform depending on how the party is set up.  Though these options are not stagnant options.  Out of the say 8 things possible that the squad can do only 4 options will randomly be chosen each turn.  This means that if your healer squad doesn't get the healing option for multiple turns it can mean game over.  You can mitigate this by removing options that a team can perform so that they don't clog up the limited action bar.  While that helps, you still often have to rely on luck and a coin flip to get an important action to occur at the right time.  This is the part that I can't get over.  There is little precision to the battles.  In normal fights the chaos can be really fun, but when a boss fight comes it can lead to a large helping of frustration.  It's fun and playable.  If 5 were my recommend mark, it sits at 4.  Very close but with a heavy heart I cannot recommend it.			"

												Going into this game I was hoping to find a classic JRPG made by sqeenix, with the acceptable grind, lovely characters and an enjoyable time. Well I got anything but that last part.The maing gripe I have with the game is the difficult combat system paired with the penalizing Battle Rank (BR) system. The combat is nice once you get the hang of it, though I find it very confusing that the only way to learn the combat normally; trying to get into as many fights as you can, is penalized heavily by the BR system.The BR system is not your level, but it's a rank that goes up according to the amount of fights you've had, the higher it gets the more difficult the enemies get. Not so bad right? Well if you manage to somehow get your BR high before a section of the game played in Nest of Eagles you may very well get stuck here, this only being the first half of the game leads you to redo the entire game up to that point, mostlikely following a guide telling you to keep your BR low. (Not what happened in my case, but I was close to doing this)Not only does the BR system make the fights harder it also makes powering up the later characters you get in part 2 harder to make useful. Now this happened to me. The workaround being farming a unique monster called Bai Ze or in this releases case you could also opt to farm insects at the cost of two unique units. This allows you to farm your characters up to an acceptable stat range or to help you in cheesing the game.The combat is done in unions; groups of characters in formations, different formations give different stat bonuses. The unions then have ""random"" actions that they can do. Herein lies the problem, the actions I want to do are the actions that, most of the time, are not readily available while I feel this takes away from the strategic point of view, it enforces defensive play and working with what you have; it does however make the difficulty of the strategy feel articficial since instead of giving a difinitive way to take on a fight, you have to hope you get those actions to pop-up.The problem comes from the combat and penalizing BR system, you try to learn the game and do all the sidequests once they're all available, raising your BR to a level the game didn't expect you to have and making the rest of the fights too difficult to progress. The sidequests may be optional but some of them become too much to handle, the solutions being to farm a unique monster, to spam hard to trigger arcana spells, and to change your formation into one that simply bumrushes the boss and hope that they die before you get killed. If you still think the game is a fair challenge after this go ahead and buy it, I know it's old but for a game to be unforgiving to a point where you cannot progress the story is just wrong.			"

												The game feels like an experiment, and to me, it worked. A large roster of character, intricate story and gameplay. This is an unique rpg and worth a play if you can get it for a good price. You control and command squads and perform large scale fights rather than xv4 fights. The game is a turn by turn RPG in essence, but you quickly notices differences. You can have as much as 50 enemies on the field and have to make careful desision during combat. The indirect feeling of the gameplay may put off some of you, but i enjoyed the experience, i wish the compagny would take more chance and give us more of this.			"

												The first half of this game is compelling if only for its unique battle system. The story is meh, but it is super addictive filling out your roster.Unfortunately, the second half falls flat on its face. The already meh story goes bonkers in all the wrong ways and the combat plateaus. The latter is directly due to the game limiting your squad to the max you got in the first half rather than continue to build up your forces further. Without what is really the only compelling reason to play, the game quickly gets stale and incredibly boring.			"

												-One of the best RPg's on the steam market. It mixes an old fasioned turn based fighting system with a squad based system. It takes a few battles to get used to but it's worth it since the game is overall amazing. Buy this and you will find yourself in a world of amazement...do not buy this if you dont like turn based gaming. The battle system can seem slow for people not used to older style games. This game lookls the best on a mid to hi-end pc. Compair the specs of your pc to the requirments listed. Now go my fellow RPGer's fly away to this land of dreams.			"

												I played this game when it came out on Xbox360 and loved it then. When i bought it on Steam I knew i was gonna play like crazy. I love the idea of squad style combat. This game deserves so much praise. Wonderful graphics, beautiful voice acting, and the story is so good. I recommend this game to anyone who enjoys RPG's			"

												This is a great JRPG. At first, seems a sub-Final Fantasy title (and, concerning story, characters and the world, it certainly is), but the stellar combat makes it something special. Also, it's a +100 hours game, even if you don't do all the quests and guild tasks. I played it for 103 hours and got to level 92, without grinding or being too much of a completist. It took me almost 10 hours to get the hang of combat, but after I understood its system, the game became really exciting. At first seemed like the characters were playing by themselves, but you start to realize how important strategy is. The most important thing is keeping a high morale, by flanking and intercepting the enemy and not letting him do the same to you. And, as the characters learn new ""arts"", you have more options and the battles get way more interesting _ specially when you ""link"" several enemies and becomes outnumbered. You can also enable QTEs during combat, to perform critical hits and to parry or counterattack _ it takes a while to get them right and it will make you curse at the screen, but it's great fun.There were some boss fights that appeared to be impossible, but became a breeze after I changed strategy. This is a game that's not hard at all, but fair: play it well and you'll have a good time. Besides that, there's a lot of customization, from items to military formations.It's a pity the developers didn't add achievements and trading cards. I'd also love a sequel.			"

												Quest Based JRPG with an unconventional Battle System and drawn out plot. The plot is unique in that it's about political turmoil and backstabbings. Which isn't anything new, but certainly new enough for JRPG's. I enjoyed it well enough, but I can understand if the lack of drama might keep others from being interested in what's going on. Most JRPG's are character-driven, and here it's written with the main actors really being the states and the powerful remnants that reside within each (and the conspiracy fabricated to take control of them all). The title starts out with the simple task of you rescuing your sister, but it becomes quite evident that something much larger is at play and in rescuing her you become allied with a Duke (Nukem) and embroiled in his objectives. Some might get a little confused with some of the political bable and the various actors, but it's an easy wiki to get your mind back on track.That aside, this game is all about the battle system. A battle system the game doesn't bother to elaborate on.The short end of it is that you have unions each with a max of 5 members each. They're basically party members put into small companies that make a mini militia. The enemy is very much the same way, and battles play out between these companies, but since the company has one unified healthbar they're, for all intents and purposes, one ''unit'' in battle and its units attacking units trying to get their HP to 0. You don't control the units in the unions directly (max of 5 per union), rather you give commands to the entire union, like ''Hang in there!'' and ''Attack from afar!''. You can see what these commands will lead to, so it's not too bad. But it can be aggrivating not being able to prioritize what attacks come out with limited AP (regenerates every turn). You might choose for a union to go into heal mode, but the one unit that has a massive AOE heal ignores the command and attacks whilst the other two that can only use herbs that heal for a miniscule amount do the healing. Generally though the game does a really good job at making this a painless way to control your units and I never felt cheated.The game provides many options in setting formations for your unions, with varying effects for each. The problem is that they're not really explained in-depth and, according to most of the community at least, they're not required to play through the game. It's a nice addition but not required to get a grip on. Most of the side-game is doing quests that lead to new union members or simple money rewards, with some resulting in new weapons. There's two things about this game that are bull♥♥♥♥ though:-some quests disappear if you progress too far into the story. There's no warning of this.-You don't gain XP, but you gain Battle Rank (BR). There's no ''BR'' bar to show how close you are to your next rank, but gaining BR is bad as it makes the enemies stronger; lower BR increases stat gains per battle which makes your units stronger faster and it makes it a less grindy ordeal. In a game where you get party members as the game progresses this is bad, as they start out weaker and weaker the higher and higher your BR is and it becomes harder and harder to level them up. The second critique is this game's huge achielles heel. In many ways you're persuaded not to engage in battles until the midway point of the game where you will have most of the party members available to you. Whilst the entire party shares a culminative HP; the units can still be targetted and fall to instant KO spells or killed individually. If a party member is dead at the end of battle they gain nothing from the battle. Apparently this aspect of the game was rushed as they had to get it out. The fact that this isn't explained thoroughly in game is another sore point on this title: there is a severe lack of documentation. Seriously, some aspects of the game the community isn't fully sure of because it's not really explained. I have over 100 fuc*ing hours in this game and I'm still COMPLETELY IN THE DARK about some things. There's this quest where you get different rewards and people aren't sure what the HELL you have to do to get the best rewards. Something tells me the devs didn't really care if the player knew about some things or what exactly the mechanics or effects are and didn't think you needed to know. It's fine if you don't care but aggrivating if you do.Aside from that, with 100 hours in, it's a generally ''new'' feeling game for its story and how the battle system works. It's not ground-breaking and I wouldn't say it's a must-play, but it's not offensive and does tries enough different things for a JRPG that I'll give it a recommendation. I'd say skip it if you don't care for RPG's, but give it a shot if you need something to play/a JRPG and are feeling adventurous in how 'new' you want the experience to be. If there was ever a proper sequel with some fixes I'd be there in a minute.			"

												The Last Remnant is a bit different from any other SquareEnix games.  I almost quit playing about 6 hours in because I was still having trouble understanding the combat system and frankly, the main character was kind of annoying.  For whatever reason, I decided to keep playing just a little bit more to see if it got any better.  90 hours later, I'm glad I didn't stop.  The story really started to grab me.  The game world feels large and alive with each of the towns having its own varied population and scenery.  There's so many extra characters that start becoming available the further in you go.  There are ups and downs to the game, but I'd definitely give it a run if you're a fan of SquareEnix RPG's, even if this one's a bit different from what they generally put out.  I'll try to break things down a bit.Combat and leveling is definitely odd.  Without looking up any guides, I was probably around 20 hours into the game before it REALLY started to click how everything worked.  Fights take place by you giving a general command to each unit with things like ""Attack with combat arts"" or ""Give defensive support"" and your units will automatically use whatever abilities they decide to from that category rather than you specifically saying what each move should be.  This takes a little getting used to since most RPG's let you spell out what set of moves you want to happen.  Every battle you get through it seems like at least one character will level up at least one ability.  Which abilities get leveled up depend on what style of attacks those characters did during the battle.  The amount of XP each character gets is based on how strong you are versus the enemies, how many enemy units there are in the battle, and how quickly you defeat them.  You can also end up with different special attacks that become available depending on which character is in charge of each battle unit.  There's a lot of intricacies invovled in the battle and leveling system that can seem confusing in the beginning, but they'll become second nature once you're a ways into the game.  I've heard it's possible to end up in a spot where it's impossible to progress if you're at a ""bad"" level when you get into certain areas, so it's a good idea to keep a few different saves running.  I've found though that you can sometimes overcome what seems like an unwinable battle by just shifting around your team members to different units, changing their formations, or even changing your tactics for the battle to hold one or more units back from the fight.Weapons, armor, and accessories are kind of an odd thing in this game.  You can only directly equip them on your one main character.  All of your side characters will continue to automatically level up their own equipment as the game goes on OR if you happen to buy something they like enough, they'll ask you if they can ""borrow it"" when you're on one of the map screens.  For me, this lead to my buying virtually every weapon/armor/accessory I could afford in addition to upgrading them repeatedly throughout the game just to see if someone would want one.  Once in a while it actually pays off and you'll get something really good into another characters hands.  For the most part though, it seemed like they didn't care what I was buying, so I ended up with a massive pile of unusable equipment and upgrade parts by the end of the game.Side quests are plentiful.  I probably spent a good 2/3 of the time I played just working side quests, if not more.  You end up having to do a bit of back and forth on the world map at times to get those side quests to come up, but it's not a big deal since travel between sites is instant.  The side quests themselves seemed varied and fit in real well with the game world.  I found it was a nice way to get extra background info on the world lore and your characters themselves.  I'm not sure what percentage of the side quests I got through by the end of my 90 hour run, but I'm sure there were still a lot left to do since I didn't collect a large number of the other side characters that were available to be had, and a lot of them seem to have their own side quest lines you can do.Graphics, sound, and music are all good.  It's SquareEnix, so it matches with what they do in general for their other games, though the cut scenes aren't quite as ultra detailed as some of the Final Fantasy games that are out around the same time frame.  Nothing to be disappointed in there.  The battle music also changes around based on how strong you are versus the enemies and how well the flow of battle is going if things drag on, which keeps things from being too overly repetative since you can spend quite a while playing this game.Overall this is a great title to check out if you're into RPG games with light strategy.

												This game will most likely be most enjoyable for people who:A. Like to spend multiple playthroughs (this is not a short game) to become fully familiarised with all the mechanics,or B. Like to use a wiki as they play to enhance their understanding.This is because decisions you make (how you specialise your units, farming etc.) can have a lasting effect on the rest of the game.While it is entirely possible to run through the game completely blind, it is also possible to create walls for yourself without realising that will be difficult to overcome.Essentially the gameplay is smoother and more enjoyable if you know what you are doing.

												This game is 99% combat-based and the combat is uninspired.  Every turn, you only get five choices as to what to do and those choices appear to be predetermined.  This leads to frustration because, for example, in a boss fight your ""union"" (group of up to 5 troops) may lose half of their health in one attack.  Logic dicates you better heal up so you can survive another attack.  Game doesn't give you the option because your health isn't low enough.  Then there's random number generator (RNG)♥♥♥♥♥♥where the AI does their most powerful attack (sometimes capable of taking out multiple unions in one attack) repeatedly.  Game over, man, game over.  Even if you're leveled well beyond the enemy you're fighting, you may have to retry the fight many times before the RNG decides in your favor handing you a victory.  Games like this should be about knowing thy enemy and stratgizing, not random rolls.  In order to progress in the game without getting♥♥♥♥♥♥♥all of the time, you have to grind, and grind, and grind some more.  I'm asking myself why?  I've got two other games I'd rather play right now and it's not like this game has convinced me the story is worth finishing.  It's disjointed and explains little.  I started feeling apathetic towards the plot about 30 hours ago.  The only reason why I care about the plot is because it is the only way to command more unions and get more troops to put in said unions.I could go on a long time nitpicking about lots of things from the bland environments (pathetic for a 2008 game) to the repetitive music (I think there's only one combat song and that only changes if morale gets to the bottom) to the quick-time-events (you want to look at health guages, attacks coming up, etc. but if you do that, you'll miss the QTE which could easily translate to losing the battle) to the inability to change troop equipment (they ask to ""borrow"" equipment from your unequipped inventory).I suppose there's some people out there that love this kind of game but I am not among them.Edit: The above was written after 37 hours of playing the game.  Because I was long past tired of the combat, H4X0R Mode Engaged! (one hit kills on unions) and the game still took 65 total hours to finish.  I think this would be a pretty darn good game if it ended in ~40 hours but the combat...just...drags...on...forever...and ever...and ever...  it gets in the way of everything else that is otherwise passable.

												Honestly, this is the worst RPG I have ever played. I checked the Wiki and managed to get about halfway through the game and about 1/3 done with all side-quests. I've simply given up on this game; I was going to try to 100% it, but I simply can't. It's too bad.For starters, the writing is incredibly bad. Rush Sykes is, by far, not only the most one-dimensional main character but also is by far the most annoying in any video game I've ever played. His only motivation is his sister; of course, it's charismatic and very noble that he wants to go so far to save his sister, but that's it. No other interests, nothing in his life. Hell, none of the other characters really have anything going on in their lives either. It's all ""for Athlum"" this or ""for Rush's sister Irina"" that. All the characters are incredibly flat and unbelievable; usually I'm able to find a character I love, but I simply couldn't here. I cared for absolutely nobody during my time playing. They all seemed to be pawn's for my battles, and that was it. Nothing more.You have no control over any of the characters during combat - you can specify what sort of action you want them to take (heal, spells, skills, etc), but ultimately you aren't able to change the order these things happen in. This is very frustrating - for instance, I know one of my characters has an attack that can silence enemies, but I can't have him actually use that spell. It's randomized whether he'll use it or not. It's seriously moments like these that lead me to, not only dying, but getting game over over and over again. The game is punishing me for not being able to control my damn characters. You also can't customize their equipment; you're completely limited to changing the main character's equipment throughout.To be honest, the world was fascinating at first. I enjoyed how this world did not have the standard human/elf/dwarf paradigm that many RPGs seem to have nowadays. The races constructed here are very unique and unlike anything I'd ever seen in an RPG before. It was truly a nice breath of fresh air. However, I realized that this world feels practically dead. The only real life that seems to be going on is the beasts prowling around the linearly frustrating dungeons or the vastly open, yet still dead, landscapes. NPCs in cities seem to just stand there and really don't offer anything intelligent, or exciting, to say. All the cities in the game really don't have anything going on - they're simply there for getting side quests and for buying new equipment, but really nothing is going on. It all just really felt dead, like they were simply there, which is disappointing. The point of an RPG is to escape into some sort of fantasy world (and typically to save it), but what's the point of trying to escape into a world that doesn't even remotely feel real?All in all, I can't recommend this game. I bought it during the Steam Sale (I believe for less than $5) and didn't believe it was worth it for me. If you want a game that gives you no control over it's characters, is cumbersome, very bland, and has a good amount of content (but is only available at a limited time - after the halfway point a lot of the quests close), then this game may be for you. It, unfortunately, wasn't for me.			"

I got 137h in this thing and there are still a lot of monsters i dont dare to come near. It's a game full of thouse little things like a 0,5% of spawning a super rare monster in one location, a 0,002% for a ultra rare item to drop, and things like that. Almost every weapon and character got some type of super power that you will probably need to read a guide to learn about or you will miss it.The plot isn't the best, but it's still satisfying and the art is great!There is a lot of space for people who like to go crafting, grinding, do quests, etc. The combat ressembles FF games.And the loading is not so bad as the gamespot review says.8/10 "

												I see not how this game is an RPG, you have no control over your units, you have no control over what they weild, you have no control over how they move, nothing. A game where 90% of it is controlled by an idiotic AI, a game where only luck would judge whether you win or lose. This, is one of the worst games I've ever played. 66/100 on metacritic? Bah, giving it 20 would be generous!I don't mind a difficulty, but I've discovered playing through this sad excuse of a game that there is a difference between being a difficult game, and a frustratingly annoying one. Though the like of demon/dark souls fit the former, this one takes the crown of being the latter. There is little difficulty in TLR except for the one inhereted from the player's lack of any form of solid control. JRPGs were never about skill, but to make one dependant nearly completely no luck? Seriously?The shoddy story, poor execution and sub-par coding aren't helping it either. Square Enix ruined Final Fantasy, and their attempts to create something new is even worse. Hell, if I had tried this one before FFXIII, I might have saved my self some of its disappointment. I can see the similarities. Why not just pull a FFXII or a Dragon Age and let the AI be customizable at least? Damn you, SE! Damn you! "

												This game had potential, but didn't quite meet the expectations. The game has a pretty interesting story enough to grab your attention every cinematic, and interesting battle system. However, the game is ruined by the lack of customization. They throw you into a world with no help at all without explaining anything about the game such as battlerank, unit battlerank, and how the character's stats are distributed. It becomes a headache trying to google everything you need to know and trying to understand how the system works. And, time to time, you will run into situations where you will need to google informations about the quest, weapon upgrade informations, that ""should"" have been in the game.			"

Posted: March 4, 2016
												SquareEnix released this game back in 2011 for PC (on Steam) and 2009 for the XBox360 - and it shows. Below is a comprehensive list of Pros and Cons, as well as some Middling views after beating the game.PROS:+ Story     The story is fairly simple, as is the main character, Rush. He's introduced running into a battlefield while two armies fight - anybody that dumb is surely the main protagonist I want to root for. But, all kidding aside, the story has the basic elements to make it interesting enough to grab ahold of your attention.+ Graphics     The scenery is absolutely beautiful, and you can tell a lot of detail went into the water/background effects, the way that every city or town has their own unique architecture, and every cave or open area feels both wide open and yet closed off simultaneously, as if something is just over the horizon.+ Music     While the battle music does fluctuate randomly (more on that below) the tracks themselves are very good at what they do. The sad music is appropriately tear-jerking, the Uh-Oh music is ready to make you panic a little, and the fight music makes you want to swing a claymore through somebody's torso at times.+ Gameplay     A much-contested portion of this game, based on numerous Critic- and Reader Reviews online, is that the battle system is very interesting. I have to agree - ""Interesting"" being the operative word here. Some battles are over before they begin, for good or ill, and that makes some fights tedious but mostly it's fair enough to not have to re-re-fight something for the umpteenth time because that one character is too slow.MIDDLINGS:~ Travel     You start off the game by running through a cavern. And... that's the entirety of the game. At least, so it seems for the first hour or so. You run here, run there, watch a cutscene, run somewhere else, more cutscenes, finally explore a cave or castle and... more running. Thankfully, once you've discovered a city/cave/dungeon/area, you can just warp to the main entrance directly from the main map, so it's not a huge slog all the time.~ Areas     The scenery is beautiful, but it's so empty. Every open field is huge - really, really big - and you feel so small. Great, right? Well... no, not really. You can sit and stare at the walls for so long before you want to get to where the story or the fighting is going on, but first you need to run down huge expanses of empty field or desert to get there.~ Fighting     If the battle system is great, that means that something has to be wrong with the fights - they're interesting enough initially with a small number of people and a semi-large group of enemies (2-4), but that quickly becomes tedious. So they increase the amount of ""unions"" (groups) available, making the micro-managing element reappear in a shiny new suit. But it's still the Final Fantasy XIII method of winning most of the fights: Mash Enter/Space/X/A to win.~ Music     The cities and towns share music. The dungeons share music. The only places I know of that have their own musical scores are the optional places to go visit, and even then the music is pretty bland after three hours of it. Battle music especially is annoying, seeing as how it jumps based on how the fight is going. Going badly? Bad music; good fight, good music. Bosses are notorious for this at times, with notable exception being the final boss.~ Characters     Loads. Almost 300 named characters, each with somewhat distinct characteristics. That ""mitra"" (human) is a healer, this one's a sword-and-board fighter, and that one uses explosives. Varied and interesting enough for the Generals - that is, the Unique characters you can assign/recruit - to make it so you know who's who right off the bat.~ Voices     The in-battle and after-battle dialogue is especially tedious after the 20+ hour mark. You really start to hate the way somebody says something about ""needing the other one, the other one!"" every time they level up. To be fair, hearing Pagus (a main character) give you a backhanded comment on how that spell was ""effective"" is a nice touch.CONS:- Grinding     This game is tiring, and that's because about 85% of the game is running around killing the same enemies hundreds of times for that one item you need to make the one piece of gear that's a slight upgrade to the piece you're already wearing. Not to mention Mr. Diggs (albeit the best character in the game) is necessary to acquire the ores/metals you need to upgrade or create most of the gear you want, so that's also a factor.- Diggs     The aforementioned Mr. Diggs is a unique aspect to the mining process - a weird rabbit-like creature with huge pink round eyes that dances when it gains a level - but it only adds to the grinding nature of the game. You first acquire him with 5 digs available - he can mine grass or rocks 5 times before you need to exit to the world map and come back in. That, in of itself, isn't so bad; the bad part is that the digsites, and what you acquire from them, are randomized every time you load up the map.- Crafting     No game from Squeenix these days seems to be complete without some kind of Creation gimmick, and TLR is no exception. The gear you make is better than what you buy, and what you buy is the base for what you make. So you've done your 3+hours of Digging and killing monsters and finally have enough materials to upgrade your weapon for a... +3 attack damage output. That's just ludicrous, and not in a fun way, either.- Parties     You start out with a small party of about 3-5 people in it, reasonable enough when learning the game, but you don't actually increase the size of that initial party until a good two hours into the game. Seeing as how you go up against bosses and groups of enemies (6-7 groups at most, with about 3-4 enemies in each group) with your small team, it almost seems unfair the lengths you need to go to survive encounters.     So you've crafted that unique 2-handed sword for your beefy tough guy? Too bad, you can't equip it on him manually. Everything is done automatically for you, when the game decides it wants to let them have the item. And even then, without memorizing who's who, you may accidentally give that new weapon to your healer and not your damage dealer.     In combat, your main group could be near death and the others are at top health. There is no ""heal me"" or ""heal them"" option available unless the game decides it wants to give one to you. The micro-managing aspects that people said have disappeared from this game are what make it so annoying at the same time. There are times when yes, I really do want to use certain attacks by a certain character on a certain enemy, because I know it'll work really well - but the game decides that said character is going to try and level their fighting ability and not that healing spell I'm trying to increase.- Combat     The game already takes forever in terms of grinding, and thankfully, the PC port has given us the ability to speed up the fights. It is wonderful - and yet, the sheer volume of fighting negates that entire wonderful feeling. You're going to end up seeing the same monsters again, and again, and again, for nearly the entire game. There is only one part of the main quest where Giants come into play, and only in that one section. The rest of the time, it's generic enemy models.- Enemies (field)     As stated above, the types of enemies shown on the field are very few in distinction. What is very aggravating are their hit-boxes; the area in which they can start a fight against you. It isn't well defined or even shown, and a gentle tap from a flying enemy above you where you can't see it starts a fight where they get a free turn.BOTTOM LINE: If the game's on sale, and you like tactical RPGs, go for it. Otherwise, just play Final Fantasy.(Or Blue Dragon for the 360, it's like this but better.)			"

												I wish I could give this game a recommendation.  It's got a solid foundation, with an interesting game mechanic, and it reminds of classic Final Fantasy games.  However, there are really serious flaws that make a possibly great game almost unplayable.  Unless you are a big nerd for JRPGs, stay away.Some of the flaws are as follows:1. This is a port of the XBox game.  They didn't even bother to change the quicktime icons that appear during battle, and they don't tell you what they are, either, but they are in the settings.  Still, it's a lazy job of porting it that undercuts the quality of the game significantly.2.  The battle mechanic is interesting, but ultimately flawed - it's almost like there wasn't enough playtesting.  Skills that target one enemy are the norm, and what the majority of both your characters and enemy characters use.  Unfortunately, the game is quickly dominated by AoE spells capable of killing multiple units.  Characters are organized into groups, which have a shared HP pool, and if they are hit by an AoE spell, it may just hurt one character, or it may hit them all (including characters in other groups).  Because the shared HP is much less than the sum of each character's HP, a group hit usually results in the group being seriously injured or killed in one shot, and too many enemies cast group attacks.  The group attacks should have been seriously nerfed.  On the bright side, you also get these spells - but then the game simply consists of you figuring out which action choice will lead to your character busting out one of these AoE spells and then doing that over and over.3.  Speaking of action choices: it's only possible to give up to 5 orders (per enemy) - this means that a unit that desperately needs to perform a certain act might not be able to, for reasons that are never clear.  Additionally, you can only ask for certain classes of actions to be performed, rather than specific abilities.  This is kind of neat, as it leaves only the larger tactics to you, but the problem is that the AI is flaky.  Your units will often do stupid things, like target a single unit with a group spell, or just fail to cast a useful spell because the enemy group has been defeated (but the battle is not over).   Also, you may have a TON of AP, but you may only get options to use a few, and so you waste a turn because of the game, not because of some mistake on your part.Additionally, the plot is some Square Enix gibberish that is completely unengaging.  Square-Enix used to be one of my favorite publishers, and I would really love a good Final Fantasy style game.  If they would stick with the stuff that worked instead of trying to innovate, they could really make some very good games.			"

												For those PC gamers who are willing to try out a new style of Japanese Role Playing Game this is a great game to play with its strong mechanics and story. This gorgeous game is not only a massive triumph of artistic design but also the quintessential JRPG experience. It has an amazingly addictive battle system coupled with an entertaining story and unique characters. Throw in the countless side-quests, treasure hunts, and rare monsters and you have one of the greatest JRPGs ever!			"

												There is a lot to like about this game.  I definitely recommend the game, but I wanted to give a warning to potential buyers.  This is one of those games where you can run into a brick wall of difficulty in several places.  Make sure you take your time, get all the generals you can get, spend the time to get the best gear, and learn all the different aspects of combat.  If you aren't use to tactical positioning, you will end up crushed in a few places.  If you aren't use to using statuses (negative and positive) you will get stuck.  If you rely too heavily on ultimate attacks, you will lose.  Take your time and learn the game well, or you will get very frustrated.7.5/10  Fun, but you can get stuck very easily, leading to restarts.			"

												This game is interesting and very unique. I am still conflicted about whether I really recommend it or not though. To be honest I have not finished the game yet, and am only writing the review now because I have stopped playing the game for now. There are many things to love and hate, and to be fair I recognize that this is a game that was made on a game engine that was brand new to the development team at SE. To put it briefly, for everything I liked about this game, there was a part of that feature that drove me nuts.So here's the deal, things to love about this game include the diverse and culturally rich world with lots of different characters that are all pretty cool. The graphics are awesome (as expected from an Unreal engine game). The story is captivating and enjoyable. There is plenty to do in this game. The battle system is a must see and is almost worth buying just to experience it because it is so unique, or at least it is not like anything I have ever seen before.Now, things that will get on your nerves... (unfortunately it is often easier to say more about the negative, but that doesn't mean the game is more negative than positive)While the world is amazing there not as much revealed about it as I wanted. You see many different races of characters and they all live together apparently peacefully, but why? They have diversity, but don't really use it very much in the story. The characters could have all been human and it would have made little difference. Their attributes in battle are not even that different.The story is great, but admittedly hard to follow (not a surprise from a JRPG really). It was easy to get lost because there is not always indication of where to go to advance the story. Side quests offer some fun side stories, but can be terribly confusing even when using a guide.The graphics look awesome, but the non-movie animations are awkward. Even some of the movies have parts where the voice acting do not line up with the expressions and movements (translation problem, maybe?)The battle system is very impressive in concept, but nigh impossible to figure out. After 60+ hours of gameplay I still don't know what I am doing. Simply stated, it is a convuluted mess that is overcomplicated and chaotic. There are so many variables and things to adjust that I was just overloaded and gave up trying to figure it out. Even forums of experienced players can't make a lot of sense out of it. It seems most players ignore the majority of it and for good reason. You can recruit from a huge assortment of characters, use over a dozen different formations, assign leaders, occasionally be given the choice to have them focus on magic or combat, all of it makes little sense though and possibly little difference. It is essentially information overload in an attempt to give the player the choice to devise their own strategy. Speaking of strategy though, actual battle gives you little control at all. You simply give a general command and the characters choose which moves to use themselves. This can be super frustrating because what you want to do is sometimes not an option. Also, there are so many different variables in battle that you could fight the same battle twice using the same commands, and you might lose terribly the first time and win by a landslide the next. So much for all the strategy... I used a stat grinding trick for about 6 hours from a guide I found online and my characters grew incredibly, but still I have battles that just end badly. Luckily there is an autosave feature on PC, but you must turn it on first. It is off by default.The character progression makes little sense. You know battling monsters makes you stronger and it would appear the stronger the monster, the greater the growth. Things like exp points are absent or invisible. Stats are shown on character views, but no indication of how far along the progress is or how to increase it. Each character also has a unique stat that no one knows what it actually does. There is a Battle Rank which would appear to be synonymous with Level in other RPGs, but it is not really explained what it means. Guides actually show that Battle Rank is better the lower it is because the battles get harder the higher it is. Monsters are stronger the higher your Rank is, which happens to be a feature of some RPGs that I absolutely despise because it makes all the time battling and grinding completely unsatisfying. Final Fantasy 8 works similarly, so if you have played that you might be familiar with it. As the story progresses you increase the number of characters you can use in battle, but you don't reach the max until late in the game, so your characters will end up heavily imbalanced because only characters you use will grow.Sometimes what I like most about JRPGs is the soundtrack. I will say this game's is a rather generic fantasy one though. It is ok, but nothing to write home about. Certainly not one I would listen to outside the game. I actually find myself playing on mute though, listening to my own music or watching a show while I grind. All in all, I give it a 3 out of 5. I stopped playing because I lost interest and after reading a ton of guides and forums I decided it is so unnecessarily complicated that I don't care to figure it out. I just want to see the rest of the story and have it be over. I guess I will recommend it because if you haven't played anything like it before, it is an interesting experience. I bought mine in a Final Fantasy bundle, so if you can find it in one of those for cheap, it is worth buying.			"

												While this game has gorgeous graphics and there seems to be some really solid game mechanics and plot in here, I have to caution potential buyers about 2 things. First if you do not have a gamepad style controller the keyboard and mouse controls are clunky and odd. Second your character, which appears to be the main protagonist for the game, is so stupid  calling him a village idiot insults village idiots everywhere in the multiverse. The voice acting is mediocre to good, but hardly what you'd expect for a Squeenix title. I'm not very far into this at all at the moment but as I said initially, this game has some really nice potential, and some interesting game play elements that make it stand out from other titles. I can easily say its worth full price at $10, just keep in mind that keyboard & mouse are... odd... and clunky. The desire to murder your character, just to purge the stupid, can also be a hurdle but RPG gamers have survived far worse. ;)			"

												ok, this is definitely NOT a crap game, but you can have much more better RPG experiences.After playing 13 hours i'm giving up because it's nearly impossible to continue due to an irrealistic hard boss fight (Namul Niram) - and this makes me angry.Story is pretty confused and characters makes odd decisions, and you don't know why. It's a shame because the setting is well conceived (final fantasy like). Combat system is complicated at the beginning but after a few time you discover that is static and very less tactical than you can imagine.In the end, the game is NOT bad.But you can spend your time playing things MUCH MORE interesting.

												I decide to Rereview this game after a long time I played before.I have to say that this game is NOT a classic JRPG game.If you want a very thick or deep or mature story, this game can not give you that like some other classic JRPG as Final Fantasy 7 etcHowever ,it doesnt mean the main story is bad.The main story is like 7/10,that's it!But the Side quests are much more interesting!!!!!!!The background of the world the underground of the world who is powerful who was powerful why did the world become like nowadays etc!They  were  all maitained in the side quests!!!!!!!!Besides,the best charming thing of this game is about its battle play and characters' personalities.At first it is very confusing.(Even today some personalities can not be explained officially I can just assume their effect to the battle ...)As we all know in other games:""The more monsters we slayed the stronger our characters will be""But not in this game ...The Battle Rank does not equal to your abilities.If you dont know this trust me this game will crush you and it happened to me before.Because my Battle Rank was so high but my abilities and my weapons were far more weak .So I couldn't beat the boss I met in the main story....Before you bought this game .Search it on Wiki It will help you a lot !And you will have so much fun Because the game design itself is very high level .The character the voice the monster the world bosses...If you do have some time Believe me This game is totally worth every penny you spent!

												Personal Rating: I liked the game but it's flawed.Classic Rating: ★★★☆☆✓ Why did I like it?Well, this is the second JRPG game I played in my life, being FFVIII the first one - and I loved that, spent an insane amount of hours couch-playing with my PSX.The Last Remnant is not a masterpiece: graphics are not that good but not even bad - you can smell a console game a mile ahead; story is quite nice but I haven't completed the game yet, so I don't have a full view - I loved all of the cutscenes so far though, they add up a lot to the game; characters (mainly your party) are not so deeply developed but you get a quite well detailed picture despite everything.. Music, voice acting and sound effects are quite good too, they fit game play but also get repetitive (boring?) after a decent amount of hours spent in combat.✘ Why is it flawed?Because... You already know, don't you? This cannot be the first review you've read about this game.Anyhow, combat/inventory systems are flawed, it's not just a tough game.Fighting can be a PITA because the game offers you only a limited set of choices: what I found terrible is that most of the time I had to battle a Boss I couldn't heal, because there was no option to do that.. I could only fight. And you can believe me that when a Boss strikes, it can take away half of your HP and that's not all... There are attacks and counter-attacks, so you might receive additional damage in one turn and if you're not given an option to heal as soon as you need it, it's game over - no workarounds.Basically you'll have to grind in order to fight Bosses and I understand that's part of the game, levelling up while doing side quests and so forth, but it can be annoying too.


That's what I was talking about.. I can't heal :-( 
A Screenshot of The Last Remnant
By: roughnecks




Inventory is half broken too because you can't manage your party's. Say you have some objects sitting in your inventory - a potion, a weapon or anything else -  you can't trade it to another companion because it's not possible at all. They can only request you things after you have harvested or crafted them: I read about a hack which lets you edit/use inventories the way they are supposed to, but I personally didn't want to take that route.Most of my friends warned me about these issues I've been talking of, but I didn't want to listen before actually trying myself.. You know how it went, I have to agree with them.I won this game in a giveaway, so I am not regretting buying it but I can't recommend it anyway (especially if you're not a true fan of the genre) even if my actual feelings about The Last Remnant are mostly positive.

												I've been playing for a couple days now with 15 hours of gameplay and my initial opinion of the game is not that great. The world that is presented to you is interesting but many of the characters are incredibly annoying and story telling isn't particularly good either. The main character is a whiney little brat that makes stupid decisions one after another. The game also has a very deep character development system but it is muddled with hidden stats which make it difficult to tell if you're going the right direction.The combat system has potential to be great but it is very frustrating. Besides the extremely frustrating battle command system, it's not uncommon to run into battles where you can be instantly wiped out without anything you can do to prevent it so saving is your best friend. 1 union vs 5? Yeah, you don't even get the option to heal and round one you die. Boss fight? He's got an aoe attack that can 1 shot your party and uses it every other turn. Without using a guide, figuring out the battle commands is nearly impossible and even using a guide, it is often quite frustrating. Character development is also annoying because there are many hidden stats that are factoring into character class and development. If these stats were visible, it would make the game much better and if you could always tell your units exactly what to do it would make the game immensely better. But that is not the case so it lends itself to an incredibly frustrating learning curve. If I had paid full price for this I would have returned it in a heartbeat. At $4 I still feel annoyed that I spent the money on it. I feel like this game had a lot of potential that just wasn't capitalized on. If you do end up giving it a shot, don't grind early on. It only hurts you. And start reading a guide from the start to save yourself a ragequit. If you're not using a controller, in the game settings on the controller page, there is an option to change which buttons the tooltips show (xbox, ps3, keyboard, etc.). Change this to keyboard. And to skip cutscenes, hit Pause/Break and then S to skip.			"

												Combat - likeable, a turn-based combat with unique squad designation systemBUTThe core mechanic - ""Battle Rank"" system is poorly executed. The more monsters you kill, the higher your battle rank goes. This will lead to bosses and other enemies scaling to your battle rank to be a lot more tougher to provide you with bigger challenge. That's fine, in fact, I like the idea as it seems similar to the Final Fantasy 8's level scale system. However, there is no real character level in this game and you are randomly given stat increases after certain number of battle based on how high your battle rank is as well as what kind of commands you have given out to your party members during combat. What this means is that your enemies may scale with your battle rank and grow stronger consistently while your own party may or may not and this can lead someone to completely stagnate themselves at certain points in this game. There is no real sense of progression, it's more favorable decision to avoid any side quests and field enemy encounters to keep things in balance. What kind of RPG does this?			"

												Last Remnant is a JRPG with some good production values and it is worth buying cheap on that count alone. The 'thing' with Last Remnant is the combat system that lets you put up to an army of characters into battle for you. To do this however the game engine has a lot of complexity and much is this is shielded from the player by automation. If you let the automation do everything then you're not involved much and your characters won't improve. However the problems come when you naturally try to understand what's happening and manage the automaton. Unfortunately, it's just difficult to get past the automation and the manual doesn't help you to do it at all. For example there massive amount of detailed itemization in the game and it is important to equip your characters well, however you can't give them items unless they ask for it. They typically won't ask for stuff you want them to have, but if they do they ask for the wrong item, the wrong person asks for it, the same person asks for everything, and even if they take something they might discard it for something worse later. That's just one side of the itemisation problems as well.So anyway, there are a lot of good things in just playing Last Remnant but it encourages you look into the complexity and disappoints when it is frequently opaque.

												As a fan of RPGs new and old, I was tempted to purchase this game as I've heard many things about this ""hidden gem"". Sadly, I was disappointed to find out how big of a let down this game was.Jumping into the game without knowing anything about it aside from the title, I was pleasantly surprise and confused to see the game in action, jumping straight into the first battle. But seeing the game in action, it caught my interests and I was more than excited to continue and try to figure out how the game worked. Unfortunately, after 12+ hours of playing, the game felt like it was on a constant tutorial, only to find out the game really didn't have much to offer. As interesting as the game looked, the strategy within the game play comes off as extremely shallow, leaving little to no planning even in the most difficult combat situations. The idea behind the game play is extremely interesting and had so much potential, but alas falls short, lacking depth in every aspect behind it. In other words; what you see is what you get.The story itself is a complete joke, as it feels like it's parody of an old anime that I've never seen before. It makes senses, but the story is laughably lame, as with the behavior the main character is so unpredictable yet very forgivable regardless of the outcome.The dungeon design are completely lack luster, as it feels like almost every dungeon is design to be shaped like a Y or an L, and copy paste from there. I never felt lost, and had I come across a dead end, I back track over to a fork in the path I missed, pulled a trigger, and the dead end was averted. Funny thing is, that's basically every dungeon in the game.The Battle music in this game is great, fitting the tone and idle animations of the characters fighting off their opponents as they wait for you to make a decision on their next action. It's a nice touch, as it almost looks like the party members are hyped up with the music, which also gives out a great arcade-ish feel for each battle (which is not a bad thing for me). Sadly, all songs outside the battle tracks are completely forgettable.All in honestly, I'd say to avoid this title at all cost and play another RPG title instead... literally any other RPG. If you're still curious, I'd say wait for a sale.			"

												I gota say, I wasn't expecting a lot. I play my Final Fantasy games at 2x or 3x the speed in a emulator to call them playable.But it looked kinda pretty so I bought it.What I did with this bad bad game was to increase its run speed until it would be playable. It's not playable. It is super repetitive even when playing at 20x its speed, and the only thing that kept me going was the story, until I decided it too was horrible. "

												This isn't one of the best games in the world, If you're looking for a good RPG there are several better titles laying around steam. The combat is somewhat fine but seems pretty automatic and easy to deal with if you're a JRPG player. Almost zero grinding (possibly zero if you're not a newcomer to the genre).  The animations are poor. Most characters have nice models but lack expressions and end up doing the same moves over and over. Biggest problem is voice action. Japanese is bearable but english is just terrible making me want to skip every cutscene just so i don't have to deal with those poor dialogues. I wouldn't recommend this game if you're looking for a immersive RPG with good voice acting, outstanding story and great combat mechanic. Overall it's a 5/10 . Playable but just another RPG with nothing to add but a unique combat mode, not that great to give this game points though.			"

												Iniciei este jogo e:Já sou suspeito pra falar de jRPG, por que são poucos os que eu realmente gosto. Mas esse jogo não tem nada demais. O roteiro é muito pobre, acontece tanta coisa em 5 minutos de jogo, que você acaba se perguntando: Como é que isso está acontecendo? Quem são essas pessoas? Por que elas me ajudam tão fácil? E ainda tem o típico protagonista Japona, simples, tenta ser engraçado, corajoso.A animação de movimento dos personagens é lamentável. Ver os personagens andando e gesticulando para falar é uma tristeza no jogo.O sistema de batalha é muito confuso, com muita coisa do tipo ""faz ai"" ou ""nem te conto como é que faz"". Por que parece que é isso que o jogo te fala. Muita complicação e coisas que acontecem no meio da batalha que você não pode prever e nem se defender.O sistema de quest é uma vergonha.NOTA: 4.0 / 10.0			"

												The combat system in this game is downright horrible. You are given a very limited set of options every turn and then the game plays itself. For example, you may have 100 AP, but are only given a choice to use an attack that uses up 7 AP. Im not kidding. It is extremely frustrating to play. The game may also decide that your unit, who is low on health, doesnt need healing and won't give you that option. I have given this game a fair shake and just cannot recommend it. Additional points:Bland story75% of content is missable and is just sidequests that don't really relate to main storyAnnoying main character Lots of slow paced runningFrustrating gameplay - The game will cheat by having the enemies suddenly block or dodge all your attacks that would have otherwise killed the boss/enemyA leveling system that is not explained at all in game...in fact hardly any of the game mechanics are explained in game - Thankfully there is a wikiSave yourself countless headaches and moments of staring at the screen going ""Really?!"" - Don't purchase this!

												I'd recommend this game for the battle system, which I found really interesting.(Really, really long blocks of text ahead. Sorry. TLDR at the end.)The story was meh, I felt it was a little confusing at times, and not particularly gripping. However, I'm really not one to follow the plot carefully in RPGs (what am I doing playing RPGs then? haha, you have a point...), so I've probably missed some parts that would've prevented the confusion and maybe even foreshadowed the ending. Still, not a tale that grabbed my attention.The battle mechanics were what really drew me in. It's brilliant! I've put in way more hours than the recorded 15. Once you run through the game fully, you get to start a new game in hard mode which is a whole other challenge (worth the torture, in my opinion).As plenty of people below have pointed out, combat is turn-based and rather than controlling single characters, you can fight with 'unions' of characters. At each turn, you give general commands to each of the unions, and the AI picks the different attacks/spells for each of the union members (you can see what gets picked, but you can't change this specifically during battle). And that's one fun part of the battle system- it might seem like all their actions are out of your control, but careful union setup with suitably trained characters makes a HUGE difference in the sets of commands you get. You even get to fine tune the kinds of attack/spells each union member can execute by blocking some of their learned skills. This helps increase the chances of the AI picking up the attacks you want, since you've removed the ones you didn't need, even if it's just for a particular battle.You're free to set up your unions as you wish- have separate unions for offense/tanking/healing/debuffing (like most sane people), just have an army of attackers slashing through monsters (this may actually end badly...), maybe, like I usually prefer, have self-contained unions capable of looking after themselves in battle so that you can forgo a healing union altogether, or all of these at different points in the game. You'll need a bit of care with how the unions are set up and how members are trained, otherwise the commands generated during battle can be really useless and frustrating. There's a lot of flexibility to this system, which becomes clearer as you progress further into the game and begin handling more unions; if you've trained your characters decently enough in their roles(warrior/thaumaturge/mage/warrior-mage/whatnot), you can swap them around a lot and calibrate their skills to try different kinds of union set-ups, and this allows you to try out any number of strategies for tough battles. That said, there will always be few hiccups out of your hand. Veeery few, if the unions are decent. The other fun part about the battle system is that once you've worked out a few stable union combinations, just hit the spacebar and the AI does all the gritty work really well, and you can focus on your overall battle strategy/approach instead.Stat increases are not random, their general direction of growth will depend on how you use the characters. Spam spells all the time and you'll see your characters' INT levelling far quicker that STR, and finally ending at a much higher number. But this is as far as our immediate control over stats gets, as far as I'm aware.There is a 'morale bar' on every battle screen, and the gauge changes depending on how the battle's going. Maintining a decent morale in your favour can have a big impact in boss fights especially.The game does have a strange levelling system, where grinding is not always rewarded (there are a couple of tricks to super-powering your characters early on at specific spots in the game via grinding, but that just really sucks the fun out of the whole experience). This, I feel, is a good thing; gives you more time to just explore the world, kill all the monsters, loot all the dungeons. Contrary to what's mentioned often, you don't have to skip -all- battles at first or be excessively wary about over-levelling. I have a habit of clearing out every new map, which is just what I did for my first playthrough, and ended the game at a Battle Rank of 144. Some of the boss battles were hard, but not too hard (except the Lost Remnant, maybe), and certainly not unbeatable. The hardest point in the main storyline in that playthrough was the part called 'The Nest of Eagles'- took 4 tries to finish it at ~BR 60 (considered a fairly high BR by most for this part of the game), but the fight needed a whole lot of re-organising on my part, and this made the win even more satisfying. Basically, the higher your Battle Rank, the more challenging the fights can get, but they rarely become insurmountable. I personally love the lack of intense grinding here, it just let me play the game to the end casually the first time around.There are several classes you can train each of your characters to get into, depending on what skill sets they can acquire, and which ones you focus on. The Wiki is a great place for all the information you need on classes (and everything else). There are lots of weapons to choose from (a plus for me), each with different upgrade paths. Lots of scope for crafting. Nice loot from the bosses.  With the game config files as is, however, you can only change your main character's equipment. The others have set weapon paths, and you can only choose their upgrade focus (combat/mystic/balance).There are lots of sidequests to complete; the bulk of your time will probably be spent on these. So if you become friends with the battle system, this can only be a good thing. The DLC battles are great, in my view. My favourite part of the playthrough.Graphics are cool, but this point is probably very subjective. I've had no issues running this game, performance-wise (on a system with recommended specs), and have been able to run this on a system with specs slightly lower than the minimum suggested (significant lag, but that's where I finished my first 3-odd playthroughs, and I loved the gameplay enough for this to not trouble me!)If there's one major complaint I have, it's that far too many playable characters come too late into the game, and are much weaker than your current set of characters. If you don't watch the BR, this difference becomes even more stark. Or sometimes they're really cool, but you're almost at the end of the game so what's the point in hiring them.TLDR; the battle system is very intriguing, give it a shot! Especially if you like battles. The game seems to be perpetually discounted on here anyway.			"

												Great game, just REALLY not for everyone. tons of unexplained mechanics, but if your up to learning the different systems this one can be quite wonderful. the world is gorgeous, there are a lot of places and npcs to interact with and the music is fantastic. also: the story - while much of it is coming through sidequests and with that worldbuilding, is a treat. just be aware that this is one of those games you really have to put many hours into if you want to truly understand it...and truly understanding it is very important when it comes to beating it. i myself am not quite there yet. please don't do what i did: don't try to overanalyse the game by going over gamefaqs for hours. the whole enemy-scaling-discussion, that much should be said, is just irritating. this might have been a problem on xbox360, but it definitley isn't one here. just don't farm for 20 hours in the first couple of dungeons and you should be fine as long as you try to understand your strategic options. this is not another oblivion. not at all. i get why some people don't like the game, but i would totally recommend it.

												This game is amazing. I would recommend using a controller, I personally use an Xbox one controller. This game is deep, you can fly through this game and get a pretty good story. But the game rewards you for playing smart and going everywhere. If you do all the quests and side areas, you should be well equipped for the main story. The enemies level with you in this game and it can get a little grindy when trying to upgrade your teammates equipment, that is where the wiki helps a lot. For first time players, this game can be complicated and frustrating. You have to plan how you want to build your characters. I'm on my 1st playthrough on PC. I have 4 other playthroughs on Xbox. I still haven't played with all the different skill types.Great game!			"

												If you like turn based rpg's this game is for you. If you like more action oriented rpg's this game may not be for you.Originally i played this on xbox 360. The 360 version had so many flaws. The PC version runs much more smoothly. The game can get quite challenging - with the first major test being when you arrive at Nest of Eagles. If you are not prepared for it you will die - alot.The only thing the xbox version did better was unit building. I liked having to carefully decide which ""leaders"" to put in my units, and being limited to only a certain number of them. However the pc version has no limits - your entire team can and should be made out of ""leaders"".			"

												I wanted to like this game. I really did. When I first played it, it had the look of Final Fantasy XII (that's the latest game in the series I have played so that's why it's my comparison point) and a fairly good story to match. The combat system at first was appealing. It was different, which I liked. However, as the story progressed and I went further into the game, I started to stop liking it and started to loathe it... and loathe it... and loathe it.The problems I have with this game are as follows:1) The combat system. You don't get to fully choose what your unions can do in each turn. You only get to choose from up to five options that the RNG decides what you can choose between (one of which is always the basic attack option). Each set of options changes for each opposing union you can engage so there's a lack of consistency. This means that you will often find situations where you want to heal your units or choose to defend, but only be given the option to attack. When you're being sent into battle against an enemy you know is too strong, you're more than likely going to quit before you get killed.How they could have done it: Have a standard set of options available to each union for each opposing union. Standard attack, physical arts, mystic arts, healing arts, defend. Additional options can be added in for relevant opponents or scenarios, such as closing in on distant enemies, using item arts or initiating unique attacks such as Omnistrike or the Gae Bolg. Make it consistent and take away the RNG element that makes the system unreliable.2) The item system. This is just a catastrophic failure in my opinion. It's overly complicated and to this day I still don't understand half of it. My first problem is why can't you change the equipment of any member of your party except Rush? SERIOUSLY! What the hell, Square? Every other game you've done like this allows you to change the gear of other members of your party. Were you trying so hard to not make another Final Fantasy game that you decided none of them needed equipment changes unless the characters just so happen to ask for it? Once again, you put the player at the mercy of the RNG in a part of the game that shouldn't even be random! Also, why did you feel the need to have every member of Rush's group constantly ask for random items? Why did you have to make the system for giving them better equipment overly complicated? It's unwarranted and infuriating, especially since half of the weapons available from the merchants throughout the game have to be given to other members of the party... but only if they randomly happen to ask for it after you've bought it.My next problem about the item system relates to the method for upgrading and building weapons and accessories. Why did it have to be so complicated and also not even necessary to proceed with the story? I have not ONCE upgraded any of my weapons nor have I ever created anything new. Reason being, I have never been fortunate enough to possess the very precise consumables needed to do so. Yet, I never felt the need to try to obtain them because the game already provides you with effective pieces of equipment for completing quests or even just exploring areas and finding chests. You added a feature that was confusing and complicated... and then made it completely unnecessary. So my inventory was full of tons of rare enemy drops that I didn't want to sell because I felt I might need them... for no real reason at all.How they could have done it: Make it possible to change the equipment of your other party members just like in every other game you've made. If you want to have a weapon crafting system, reduce the requirements for creating them and make the item drops rarer and reduce the numbers of items you can obtain. Also, remove the constant nagging requests from every one of your party members asking for items you've never even heard of. It's pointless and wastes time whenever you go to a city map.3) The Battle Rank system (including quests). Now this has been the one problem I've encountered most in this game. Many of the walkthroughs and forums online say to keep your battle rank as low as possible and to avoid battles as much as you can and then others say to grind and get it nice and high. Honestly, it's overly confusing and I've found that if you don't engage in battles, you get slaughtered. But it's not just ordinary grinding you have to do. It's the quests. Quests in RPGs are necessary for a simple reason. They provide a source of money, items, allies, experience etc. However, they are OPTIONAL, except in this game. In The Last Remnant, if you don't complete the quests, you will be killed when you get to a boss fight. Why that is, I cannot say. I do however know that it's true. I failed to beat many bosses, so I went away to take on some quests, did as many as I could handle before I got bored, went back to the boss and beat them (after a smaller number of attempts). Not only this, but you are encouraged to take on the quests before a certain point in the game because if you don't, you lose the opportunity to do all of the quests you left behind and any areas you didn't unlock before that point will be lost for the rest of the game. I consider this to be a massive mistake on Square's part. In Final Fantasy VII, you had to change the discs, but you still had access to most of the elements in the game when you changed them. You only lost the chance to unlock a small number of secrets, but the majority of the game was still available to you. So why did they make The Last Remnant in such a different and quite frankly, horrible way? I don't want to feel pressured to complete what I feel are a bunch of tedious and boring quests just to make sure I can progress in the game, especially since all of the quests I have found follow the same format (except one). Get transported to location. traverse location to find boss. Defeat boss. Claim reward. It gets even more boring because of the fact that you keep running into groups of enemies that will run after you and force you to battle if you can't get away.I'm going off on a tangent here so I'm going to just end this section.How they could have done it: Make quests optional and replace the battle rank system with an ordinary level system that applies to each individual party member (which would make it easier to form even unions with in my opinion). Also, don't revoke access to areas within the game just because you've reached the middle of the game's story, In addition to that, add in different kinds of quests. They don't all have to end in a boss battle. They can be simpler such as delivering items from one area to another. The quests in Final Fantasy XII were varied enough. Why not here?4) Battle length. This is one of the reasons quests drag on so much. The battles take so long. The animations are not skippable and you have to watch the entire thing even though you're not doing anything yourself.How they could have done it: Add an option to skip battle animations and just give the player the outcome of each engagement. Simple.There are other gripes I have with the way the game was made but I'm going to leave it there for the simple reason that it's long enough already and I doubt that most of you will have even read the entire review. If you did read it all, go have a cookie. You deserve it.The fact of the matter is, I expected a lot more from Square Enix. They're an incredible group and have produced games for one of the most famous RPG titles for years. Yet, The Last Remnant just fails to live up to the name. Had it not been for the way the world was designed and the unique races that you find in the game, I would never have been able to guess it was a Square Enix title if they took their name off of it. I only managed to make it to the Gates of Hell before I just couldn't take it anymore. GG Square. You beat me.			"

												Quite a nice JRPG from Square that isn't a Final Fantasy. Pros:Above average JRPG graphics. Don't expect photorealism however. Some spells and abilities have great visuals though and same goes for invocations.The combat system and the way strategy is designed make for some nice gameplay.Unique characters, some of which with backstory to discover in side quests.The main quest is long enough without being necesseraly tedious.Unique cities, very varied to visit.Con: Character levelling is difficult to grasp since it's dependant entirely on the arts and abilities used in game, which are linked to the chosen weapon, with no real ingame help how to tailor and fine tune it. Player effect on character stats is indirect through equipment solely.It's a JRPG so it's somewhat on railroads and definitely not an open world like Fallout or Skyrim. A lot more freedom of movement and action in this one than in many other JRPG but it's restrained at times.If you follow the story, the ending is really expected. So the main story could definitely be improved.I've overall spent a nice time roaming the various, very unique cities, all of them with a specific style and going through sidequests, not of a few of which are very humorous. The way combat is done may rebuke some, but it's got its advantages although it can be quite frustrating at times. I prefer to have more control on my characters in general, but that was far from an obstacle. Crafting offers some variety though looking for specific components can take some time. Recruiting unique squad leaders and unique/rare bosses make free exploration rewarding.It's not the game of the century but definitely worth the investment to have a relaxed time in a JRPG by Square Enix. These guys know to make games.			"

												Do you like the Final Fantasy franchise and are you are also looking for a new and interesting storyline? Then this is the game for you!!! This has an awesome turn based battle system. Even though the graphics are not equivalent to Crysis 3 it is still very enjoyable. Keep in mind that this game was released in 2009 so please don't be♥♥♥♥♥and say ""THe GrApHiqs aRen't l1ke BaTlLeFiElD! "". This game also has a morale system that takes place when you enter a battle phase. There are also other factors that can turn the battle around at any point such as the Multi Deadlock, the Flank Attack, and the Rear Assault, and etc. Overall this game was great considering that it was released in 2009. I would give it a 9/10 on gamplay, 8/10 on story, 9.5/10 on the combat system, and 9/10 overall. This is all great and everything, but the question that you might be asking yourself is ""But how much does it cost?"" The truth is, it only costs $12.99! So take your kids' lunch money and buy this game!			"

												Very fun game. If you didn't own the Xbox 360 version, then this game is the best version. Tons of fixes went for this version. Unlike the console version, it had slow downs, lower frame rates and sub HD. Unlike the PC, you get new content, new formation and tweaks on the difficultly. If you never played this game, trust me, it's that good. Pros: Fun gameplay. Pros: Amazing music. Pros: Tons of side quest and character to choose. Cons: Main character can be dull for some people. Cons: Don't level up too much. Can be a pain. Cons: Can be short if you know what you're doing. Overall, 8/10. Must HAVE! If you're a JRPG fan like me.			"

Recruiting unique squad leaders and unique/rare bosses make free exploration rewarding.It's not the game of the century but definitely worth the investment to have a relaxed time in a JRPG by Square Enix. These guys know to make games.			"

												There is something unique to be found about The Last Remnant and it is the battle system. The game asks that ''battle unions'' be formed up to a maximum of 5 units per union with at least one leader unit in each of the 5 available union slots (available as the game progresses). Instead of levels, units gain stats growth via battles and the harder the fight, the greater the stats increase will be.Played the 360 version of the game but the Pc version is superior to the prior with the additions of leader limit no longer present, locking art categories of leaders and better performance overall. Clocked in around 200+ hours (over 4 years of playing it).6/10 (Xbox 360 version) 7.8/10 (Pc version) Verdict: What an experience. Not to be missed imo.			"

												If you liked Final Fantasy 12, you'll probably like this game. It uses pretty much the same game engine as FF12, though the combat in this game is turn-based and more complex, and it incorporates team confrontations that are larger in scale than those in FF12. The look, style, and setting of the two games, while not the same, are very similar. However, this game could never run on a PS2. It has widescreen graphics with high-resolution textures, advanced lighting and shadows, and higher polygon counts than a PS2 could handle.Even though this game runs great on a PC, it's not meant to be played with a keyboard & mouse, which results in confusion and frustration. Use instead a gamepad, preferably an Xbox-compatible one, with similar button layout and colors.The Logitech ones (which are Xbox-compatible) work pretty good.			"

												I was looking for some good RPGs a few weeks ago and I saw someone recommending this game. When I looked at it on Steam I wasn't really sure about buying it... Well, I did and now I must say that you MUST buy it!!!The Last Remnant is an awesome Strategy / RPG game!The combat system feels good, making it easy, but also very challenging at some points. It focus a lot on group combat, while you can't choose each character's action, you can order the group to do the same thing in a strategic way. You can split your party members into units that can have up to 5 members, when you choose an action, the whole unit will perform that same action. The game sometimes changes the options you have in battle, for example, if you're in a story related battle, it sometimes changes your combat options, making you trigger an event. The strategy you use is totally up to you to decide, the game gives you a lot of customizable options, you can change an unit's formation, change it's members, and use specific commands in battle, like ordering an unit to heal other unit.The graphics are also very good, you know, for a 2009 game.. And since it's a Square Enix game, you can expect a lot of amazing cutscenes and a very well written fantasy story. There's also a few more features included, like crafting and hiring soldiers to your party.The game only lacks in some things, like the character's level, since there's no level thingy, sometimes when you complete a battle, your characters can get stronger, gaining HP, AP, Attack, and even their weapons can get improved, but you can't see your stats growth 100%, you can only see things like the HP getting bigger. The option to choose each character's equipment would also be very usefull!So, I would trully recommend this game to anyone who likes JRPGs! The game is also very cheap!!8.5/10			"

												Ok, I got this game as a gift from my girlfriend.I really had a lot of expectations, and added it to my wishlist after having watched a trailer and played a demo on the Xbox 360.Well... after around 35 hours I started wondering how come enemies were becoming stronger and stronger (e.g. 1 hit kill) even though I had good strategy. Let's break the issues down:- Fighting/Turn based whatever: this is pretty much random. You can attack an enemy, but even though it's your turn sometimes enemies get more turns than you do, and even take your turn! As soon as you reach a level of 25+ and progress through the storyline, then this becomes a problem since you get your a** kicked REALLY badly.- Grinding: I wandered around a lot in this game, trying to get more XP in order to unlock some magic, special skill, new areas, collectables, and so on, as it is in any RPG. For example, exploring areas around you and encountering enemies it's always for the sake of a good battle but.... as you read in my first point, I soon realised that this game is not meant for exploration because exploration means fighting (of course, you meet enemies and even if you try to avoid them, you'll probable end up in bloody mess with attacks from everywhere), and it's not about the classic role playing gaming you are used to. This game does not want you to explore or fight - which is the main thing about RPGs - , else you end up with a really high level and you are f***ed as every fight will be a disaster and you'll probably end up using a trainer in order to just finish the game and just delete it forever. Ok, you might say that there is a challenge, however there isn't hardly a challenge here; the game is unfair at all levels, the AI will be just concatenating attacks even if it's your turn, and if you want to have great weapons and ""hoping"" to kick some enemies' a**es , well you can only get those by collecting materials (killing enemies?) and exploring, and then? Ha! Well, then the enemies will level up as well, so it's just a pointless chain.If you have time to spend, have patience to spend months and months on this game just to reach an ending to a story that is not really that great tbh, and if you don't like classic RPGs, then go ahead. I strongly suggest not to play this game if you don't want to end up hating RPGs.I think I should go back and play some good old Skies of Arcadia.I'm so glad I completed this game, finally.			"

Having to rely on seemingly random dice rolls for action selection each turn, making positioning on the battle field be EXTREMELY important without allowing the player to change positions manually, the list goes on.This is one of the few Square RPG's that I am just not going to finish, the only other being FF-8.Utterly disappointing.

												You play as Rush Sykes , a young man who is on a quest to find his kidnapped sister. He later runs into a group of people who are willing to aid in him in is journey. Things turn for the worse when a war breaks out  over control of ancient atrifacts known as remnants, and finding the sister seems impossible. The gameplay in the game is fantastic. At times it can be very overwhelming and seem impossible to figure it out at times,  mainly becasue you do not control one person but groups, or unions, but trust me when I say it is possible to master it. If you are new to JRPG's I would not recommend you getting this title just yet. If you are comfortible around JRPG's and want a challenge then by all means purchase this game immediatly. This game requires patience as well as skill  because this is a 50+ hour game and like I said the battles can take some time to get used to. If you are looking for a challenge and just enjoy a very good story then I highly recommend you buy this game.			"

												This game recommend when its on sale but for full retail of  $10 its not bad priced either had over 90 hours of game play for me.  Picked it up for a steam sale for under  $4.00 well worth the investment.  The battle system was a little bit of a learning curve and the voice acting during the battle system got a little bit annoying but all in all a good game.  Story was good set in a fictional land where city states rule and remnants these magical items protect cities and are bound to individuals.  Rush the main character is on  a mission to find is little sister kidnapped by the conqueror the main enemy.  If you play the story straight through and no side quest/missions you can probably beat the game in or under 25-30 hours.  Graphics similar to the final fantasy series since it was produced by square enix. If you see this game at 50% or 75% off well worth the buy.			"

												This is a difficult choice, the game has a lovely new and unique battle system that is fun to use and can be customised in great depth. However the story is rather slow and many times I saw myself taking long breaks (weeks or months) away from the game so I could enjoy it.Another problem is that you have almost no control over a characters growth, it is eaither too easy or too hard, you will be able to swep through areas without much effort, or you will be forced to fight opponents one at a time (which takes ages).I believe the game is very well made, the story is fresh and new, and very nice to look at.However the game failed to keep hold of me and therefore I have chosen not to reccomend this game unless you are willing to be very patient.

												I am now going to write some things about a video game.This video game is called ""The Last Remnant."" Like many Japanese RPGs, the MC is a young child (called Rush) who is  estranged from his parents, and naturally this is a key plot point and one of the driving forces behind the story. This is generic and loathsome and not something I enjoy. However, the detestable MC, who is probably named after his tendencies to act brashly and without thought (Very subtle, game.) is one of the few characters I found myself disliking. I rather quickly grew fond of David and his 4 generals, for instance, despite their lack of any given motive other than to serve their leader. In fact, David's motives are perhaps the most confusing of all. I found myself playing on to try and discover what they were.However, along the way, I was swept away by my love for the combat. It's highly detailed and strategy based; you create squads of soldiers and have them perform commands as a group. It's an interesting style and quickly captured my attention. However, it quickly lost it again once I realised how grindy the game is. It's also needlessly complex for newer players, not teaching anything more than ""Attack enemies! Heal allies! Win fights! Don't lose!"" The character progression system is overly complex, and is never quite explained, to my knowledge. I've done a fair bit of research, and the gist of it is that the more a unit uses a specific type of command, the better it becomes with that type of command (e.g magic, physical attacks, healing spells) and will learn more powerful abilities of that type. However, managing the equipment of your allies is hopelessly complex and grindy and this is where the game falls down. It's painfully slow in the early to mid game, and that's about as far as I got before getting bored and giving up.It pains me to say that I don't recommend the game. It's an interesting game with a fairly nice range of characters, and there is some kind of ridiculously complex yet... existing plot. It features magic, so you know it's good. But the monotony, repetitive battles and grindy nature make it far too slow to enjoy. And this is coming from a guy who loves a good grind.			"

												Not recommended.  Why?1. If you don't have an x-box controller you have to interpret and memorize all the keyboard buttons to even play it, because the in-game menus only show the x-box controller icons.2. The maps are barren and boring.  There is a serious lack of decoration, props, etc.  Almost as bad as Chantelise.3. You have little control over what the units actually do in combat, and can NOT control individual units.  You get to pick an attack type and go!  The attack is executed by the entire group,  through simulated combat, and it's more CHANCE than tactics.  I played the same battle twice, doing the same thing, and lost once and won once. "

INTRODUCTIONThe Last Remnant is monter-hunting game but it's not the same as monster hunter, since the battle system isn't like an action game it's more like a turn based game and this game rely entirely on strategy, but it won't go the way you want to be Let's go to the pointPRO- Great Visual ( For a 2006 game and about $6 game )- Lots of skill- Battle system is quite complicated- Skill system is pretty well made, you need to use it to make it better- Story is not bad but also not that good, i haven't finished it so it might changeCONS- Protagonist is pretty idiot and rude- Require alot of time- Boss battle is the only thing that made me excited- Weapon upgrade so limited- A lot of the material is not going to be used CONCLUSIONI would recommend you to play this game, seriously. It's only $6 you can get a unique gameplay that you don't see very often (at least for me) or maybe you could try to grab it in summer sale or winter sale. And also in this game would be so exciting if you spend alot of time playing it cause the monster keep getting stronger but remember that it's pretty boring only the boss battle is exciting.			"

												Never mind the playtime listed here, I've invested atleast 3 hours into this game but it only recorded a fraction of that.TLR's battle system is new in the series (as you can also command individual squads, rather than just single protags), but not completely innovative. Its also too needlessly complicated, as if SEnix was trying to crowbar Tabletop wargame rules into an FF game. It'll take you some time to get a hang of it, and even then, you still won't have a complete grasp of what the hell you're even doing. Still, it has its charms. Combat, once you figure out how the frig it works, is as fun as Final Fantasy RPG combat can be.As for the characters.....most of them are generic and tolerable as far as JRPGs go...but GODS help you once you control the main protag ""Rush Sykes"". I'm not blowing anything out of proportion here. Rush is GODSAWFULLY and unberably annoying. He's your typical upbeat protag found in your typical JRPG, he just sounds and acts annoying. He's so horrible as a protagonist that he is THE SINGLE reason I refused to touch this game after playing for 3 hours. He is simply that bad.Overall, I don't recommand, simply because of Rush GODMOTHERGODS♥♥♥♥NUGGETS Sykes.			"

												If you are looking for a very deep RPG that has tons of polish, The Last Remnant is very satisfying. You may hear complaints about the lack of control during battles, but I see it as a nifty time saver. Instead of telling each member of each party what monster to attack and what to use, you tell the whole party instead to just use magic, or physical, or heal, or just stay out of the battle in case you want to level the other parties abilities. I have 150 hours on record and still havent beaten this game, there is so much hidden in this game. You will need to read some guids to get the most out of this game, but you can also just play casually and enjoy the engrossing story and amazingly artistic cities and landscapes. Really, it is amazing how detailed this world and its lore is.			"

The Last Remnant, one of the best square-enix jrps!I really love this game! Sadly, it is heavily underrated, unknown and underestimated, the Xbox 360 version didn't give it much popularity, but all the problems it had were solved in the PC version. This game is like an old school jrpg, it uses an evolved and funny to watch turn battle system where you can use up to 18 characters, the game features a LOT of playable characters, many sidequest, epic battles, fantastic cut-scenes, a good story, good voice actors, many playable hours and a very good replay value.If you love jrpgs you can't miss this game!

												This game came well before the Final Fantasy 13 garbage that was spewed out, and there's almost no reason to hate on this game simply because Square-Enix made it, unlike many other terrible titles they later ended up churning out, this is fortunatly not one of them. It has good voice acting, an interesting battle mechanic with equally interesting characters and races. THIS is the game that should have got two follow ups instead of that piece of crap FF-13. If you like a laid back RPG, with a dose of strategy this is for you. However, if you're a Final Fantasy 13 fan that expects the game to play itself, stay away from this and go back to licking Lightnings dirty urethra you piece of human feces.			"

												before you read this seemingly negative review, keep in mind that i still recommend the game because i think it is overall great.oh and here's an obligatory ""sorry for broken english, me no native, or any good at it""now, this game is not perfect, it's actually very flawed in many ways, some consolitis sympthoms and a bit of general oddities among other things. for starters, the way it handles your party and their inventory is just plain stupid. it's not game breaking but it can be rather inconvenient. what i'm refering to here is the fact that your party will ask you for resources they need, but will be unable to grab said resources from your inventory, and you also cant give it to them. you have to go find it after receiving the request. this game also relies heavily on Wiki crawling, otherwise you may just miss half the game.it's a hard game, expect grinding. not just simple ""find things and kill them"" grinding either, theres techniques and methods that will gain you the best results, grinding simply through finding things and killing them can be directly counter productive. there are also good characters that arent explored at all or just far too little, leaving you wishing there was a place to find more trivia about their pasts or personalities. there are also technical issues here and there. i personally had a couple crashes and memory leaks, plus shadows that are glitchy on AMD Graphics cards. i also recommend that this be played with a controller of some description, i found it to just generally work better. you can play with keyboard and mouse too, just remember to go into the options and tell the game to show you the prompts properly.but with all those issues, even plus some, i still say this game is well worth its price. i ended up more or less binging the damn thing. the story is engaging and the characters are likable. the universe is facinating and the visuals, while not very high fidelity, still manages to pull off sceneries that at times are far more impressive and imaginative than most fantasy games these days, save maybe from final fantasy. the gameplay is also an interesting part of this game. it remains turn based like most jRPGs, but it relies a lot on strategy and to varying degree also luck. i found it fun and engaging in large battles, though grinding gets bothersome fast. i would glardly suggest you pick up this game if you see it on a sale, and if it's already in your library from who knows where, install it and try it. you might just like it.

												I had high hopes for the title after seeing some footage and reading the description. Unfortunately, my high expectations lead to dissapointment. There were plenty of flaws in the game, and I only made it a few minutes in before I threw in the towel. The game is a lazy x-box port, with only the most basic level of effort involved (even the symbols for an x-box controller remain intact etc). The camera in combat spins around the battle so quickly and nonsensically that any sense of emersion is lost, and the combat itself is played out as a series of cutscenes that add nothing to the game, but drag battles out and showcase the poor animations.Huge dissapointment, 1/10.

												I have to say this is one of my favorite RPGs; with dozens of characters each with their own background and often related sidequests, a unique story and battle system, and excellent graphics and voice acting, it is easy to find things worth recommending. Completing all there is to do in the game would easily take you over 100 hours, but the cool thing is you can spend as much or as little time as you want delving into the side missions, crafting, and rare monster hunts or focusing on the story. New Game + gives some good replay value, especially coupled with the amount there is to do in the game. You are also able to choose the combat focus not only of the main character, but all the characters who each have a variety of abilities for you to decide which to utilize and improve. Use awesome weapon techniques or cast powerful magics from a wide variety of schools, all the while improving your stats and abilities based on what you choose to use.			"

												Difficult to recommend.- The combat system is unnecessarily hideous, but it has its vibe.- The texture popups are still an issue  after all the years, but the graphics and the art is generally good.- The story is usual JRPG story, a bit stupid, but tolerable, iz has Japanese voice acting, that helps a lot.There are some rough things: - the first one, the controls, everything is indicated with x360 controller signs, not the keystrokes, that's annoying. - The first few towns I have seen so far are simply empty, and the dungeon design is  poorAlso, it feels like it is not an AAA RPG simply, it is more like a combat simulator with cutscenes.- When I visited the same dungeon the 3rd time in a row, with fetch quests it felt really cheap. And the whole dungeon was empty basically, with a few enemies here and there. - The world map is ugly, feels amaturish.- the towns are static, and the maps are tiny. I suppose the team had limitation back than fighting the xbox memory.- It is the same old JRPG thing that there are a few civilians standing there with a excalamation mark on the top of there had and repeating the same 2 lines again and again, it was already dumb in 2005, not 2010 or nowadays.

												One of those games that no one has heard of. Made by Square Enix, The Last Remnant is a unique J-RPG and is probably the most underrated and unappreciated game I have ever played.There are many forums, faq sites, and even an entire wiki dedicated to the game, so I'm not the only one who loved it.Amazing gameplay with hundreds of characters to choose from to form your army.The battle system is also very unique; has a squad based battle system with squads (unions) formed using characters you have recruited / allied with.It might seem unneccesarily convoluted at first, but you will see things fall into place as your party and unions expand. You can spend ages just tweaking formations, party combinations and arts.Characters have a massive range of skills too, some will be amazing warriors - evading attacks and dishing out massive physical damage via combart arts or unique arts, others will be able to cast spells that tear apart entire armies, hex and cripple enemy combatants in every way possible or destroy enemy morale (morale is one big factor in battles too). Some will be able to support unions and heal allies, and others will use traps, explosives, shards to cripple and destroy the enemy.Way too many skills to list here again!On top of the gameplay, The Last Remnant has a really sweet story and amazing graphics.The Xbox version was great, but the PC version improves everything and adds many more features, far too many to list here.The demo is free to download on steam, so you should definitely give it a shot. The game is really cheap to buy too, is £2.99 in pretty much every steam sale. Even when it is not on sale, it is only £7.99.I can't recommend this game enough, it really is epic.			"

												The Last Remnant is a pretty darn fun game of its type. it's solid enough to be worth your time if you've taken the time to read this.I really enjoyed this. As a bakka gaijn I've always found many  jrpg story aspects to come across a bit stunted or less than natural, and this game is generally the same, at least when the characters get into long conversations and try to be super dramatic with their fifteen second pauses between sentences. The story itself is standard stuff, but done well enough to keep you from getting bored. I found the combat to be really a high point of this. It's pretty damn strategic. You HAVE to spend ten or so minutes reading a combat guide describing how everything works, though, if you're going to have any chance of understanding and enjoying it. The group controls are determined by the specific characters (and their focused skills) in each group and is also influenced by their location on the battlefield -  relative to the enemies. it's interesting, and never feels repetitive. You can recruit many different people, kinda like Suikoden, and train them up in different ways, each with their own different bit of story to contribute and it's pretty cool. There's crafting to make weapons and gear and potions and stuff. I thought it was a really pretty game with some cool combat systems and a lot of different quests and people and things to talk to. This game discourages grinding and over leveling, so be careful not to. If you just play it, you'll be fine.			"

												A jrpg with lot of (side)content. The combat system is unusual and needs some time to get used to. I personally quite liked it. Before playing this game i highly recommend you read the game manual and look up few online guides because the tutorials are really bad considering the battlesystem is somewhat complex and because of the battle rank system, which will kick you in the face if u dont understand it. But if you understand how it works it wont be a problem. If you like JRPGs then you should try this. I give it 8/10			"

												TL;DR -- Story saves the game from the furnace, but everything else assures it stays in the bargain bin. 4/10I've tried twice now to like this game. The first was years ago on my Xbox, and now on the PC. The story is appealing and involved, but the main character is a cringeworthy blockhead. I understand at the beginning of the game he's meant to be lovably obtuse; a character meant to have room to grow. But it'll leave you gnashing your teeth at his sheer density more often than not.Additionally, the game's scaled-down version of Dynasty Warriors it calls a battle system is a hot mess touted as being unique. There are so many things going on at once you're left guessing who's attacking what at any given time. You are encouraged to attack multiple enemies at once due to additional reward drops, but this can be unfair at times. If an NPC-controlled unit contends a player-controlled one, the enemy NPCs usually get a first swing, and rightly so. But I have found, much to my dismay/frustration, that this is STILL the norm even when a player-controlled unit starts a skirmish. Enemies will get to attack you first whether you're on offense/defense, and it has bequeathed me with a Game Over more times than I can count. And if ever you wish to heal your units, you have to break off fighting any enemy units you're currently skirmishing. And you know what that does? You guessed it; it provides the enemy with another chance to attack you.The game also suffers from an error many of its predecessors have made: level-scaled enemies. No matter how strong your characters get, you're no stronger comparitively to NPCs than you were at level 1. You just dish out bigger numbers against bigger health pools.Worse still, if you don't have a character in your party, they will not receive XP. Couple this with scaled enemies, and you will have a very, VERY tough time trying to level-up any neglected party members later in the game.Another minor nit-pick is that the camera controls while using a keyboard do not lock while navigating dialogue or game menus. You will often see the camera pan/jitter while moving up/down/left/right through menu screens, and yes this does happen during battle as well. Again, minor annoyance, but it is pervasive, and for this reason I had to complete the game on my Xbox instead (notice the 1.5 game hours on record).I feel this game's story was a solid pitch, but then poor dialogue and (english) acting, as well as an experimental battle system gone awry have left it collecting dust. It's unfortunate, considering an epic story is only 1/3 of the formula that makes this genre great--the other 2/3 being story delivery and battle system, where this game falls horribly short.Can't a guy dream for the return of the original turn-based encounter system? Tried and true, it's what put this genre on its feet. What on earth was so wrong with it? Don't fix something that isn't broken.11.9GB of squandered potential.			"

												To read other reviews this port is much easier than the original console version. That must have been something because I am still getting my♥♥♥♥♥kicked just a few hours in at the first serious boss battle. Don't think I'm doing anything obviously wrong either. Given that the game isn't even entirely out of tutorial mode at this point, one might expect a little less of a steep learning curve. As it is, the fun has largely been drained out of it. Some may like it.That aside, the game is reasonably pretty. The characters display the usual array of JRPG expressions and personae, which can be an acquired taste. But the dialogue, especially in the english dub I suspect, does not flow at all. Long silences between each line, as if the game was loading a new tape each time. That makes it hard to feel engaged in whatever they are saying.Therefore overall: decent interface, irritating gameplay difficulty, and forgettable / mildly annoying story development: I'll give this game a pass after all.

												Game has high system requirements - However it's completely scalable to almost any PC. If you run the game at lower resolutions you will get the letterboxing effect with black bars at the top and bottom of the screen. Voice acting and cut scenes are pretty good and the battle action is pretty interesting. You should use an XBOX 360 controller for the best experience as some battle actions where you can attack an enemy more then once require pushing different buttons, timing it just right so you can attack. The trigger buttons on the XBOX 360 controller is a  little glitchy when your in an open world where enemies - just when you thought you initiated the attack for first chance to strike , you often find yourself at the mercy of an enemy surprise and it may greatly affect the outcome of the battle. For those of you who are used to older Final Fantasy games, this is not just your standard RPG game - you can highly customize your characters and openly choose where or what you want to do next and there are lots of combination choices as far as the weapons and items go. It's not simplistic and suggested that when the game tells you of a tutorial you follow it , or write it down, otherwise it's going to affect the enjoyment of the game.			"

												Got through the tutorial phase, hired your first soldiers, did the sidequests and generally played normally trying to do all the things the game told you to do like chaining enemies together for better items until I got to The Fiery Idol. Boss is literally impossible. Most attempts I die in the first turn. If I don't then the boss typically AOE's everyone to death in the second or third turn for more damage than my max health.I'm BR 5. I made sure to kill all the enemies along the way but didn't grind for anything. Apparently this is where the game ends for me.Don't buy this if you don't feel like wrangling with this game's enemy scaling system? Or do... It's only $2.50. Maybe you're more tolerant than I am. Not much to lose.			"

												Was in a battle with a boss mob, I had 4 unions 3 members in each, two members in each union could use heal either through arts of herbs then an AOE attack hits me and knocks my unions down to < 200HP. On the next turn I get no healing options for the unions, just attack. Naturally I died, this was not the first time this had happened either. I like the combat concept but surely this is not working as intended and therefore I would warn anyone away from wasting your time with the cheap deaths needed to endure what at times is a pretty boring game.

												I really wanted to like this game i enjoy RPG's and i just finished playing valkyria chronicals and thought this looked like it could be fun. I was mistaken. This game sadly falls into number crunching your party members and hoping for random abilities or battle options to appear before the enemy gets thier opposing random actions or crits. I could be stuck on a battle for an hour and try all kinds of party adjustments, targeting and actions and in the end the battle would only turn out diffrently if i got a critical skill off before the enemy or was lucky enough to press a quick time button in a defense that killed an enemy party instead of just boinking them for 2 damage. This game acts like theres some strategy but in the end, battles often just fall down to who crits a few times first or randoms some massive skill in their attack action. Whats to bad is the enemy doesn't need these things nearly as much as you do and the resulting ""difficulty"" that is associated with this game is nothing more then redoing a battle enough times until you get the magic combination of chances that result in a win.Also the main charactor is a 5 year old in a teen body. Brash dumb and whiney dont make for a good main charactor. I can understand if hes supposed to be going through a charactor arc, but this kid is an ANNOYING and thoughtless husk. If your going to do childish to start, give me a Tidus style charactor. Young and naive but with somthing admirable so i dont begin the story by hating him.Do yourself a favor and avoid this game unless you enjoy rolling dice once every 5 minutes and hoping for double 6's.

												Don't be like me and play all the way through this. Don't download it in the first place.The story is generally stupid and mostly told through a series of long and boring cutscenes. The dialogue for these is poor, and the ""editing"" is strange with frequent awkward pauses between various characters' speech.Combat is a total mess. The leveling system is skill usage based, but the actual choice of skills to use on each turn is random. Characters change class based on what skills they use most, which is again, largely random, The whole game has incredibely broken level autoscaling, so that characters acquired later have no chance of catching up in power to those obtained earlier. Level design and pacing are odd as well. Later dungeons are larger and more difficult to navigate for no apparent reason. There is one point toward the end of the game which is cutscene, cutscene, long walk through an empty dungeon type area, followed by another cutscene. The score is great, which might be the only redeeming feature of this game, but not enough to make up for the mess which is basically every other aspect of this game.To repeat, don't play this.			"

												Heyyo, I'm so dissapointed in this game... Square Enix should have ported Star Ocean to PC instead of this. Star Ocean is insanely better... Thought Last Remnant would be a great turn based game, but the combat is both good to watch... confusing to try and understand, and fails you in boss fights in a big way. :(Here's a guy that explains it in massive detail:http://steamcommunity.com//id/zirune/recommended/23310/Here's my screenshot explanations... Boss fight, I'm less than 50% HP on #2 Union (squad) and I have lots of AP but for some reason I don't get the option this round to heal #2 Union...


Heyyo, *sighs* and this is why The Last Remnant's combat system fails this game. I'm hurt, lots of AP... AND CAN'T HEAL THIS ROUND!?

Note now that #2 Union that I couldn't heal is now dead... great. This round #1 Union gets a basic heal...


Heyyo, one turn later from last photo.. yep, that Union is Terminated cause couldn't heal. These guys get a basic heal this turn...

Next round? No heals so I select ""Finish Them Off"" Which ironically must have meant my last Union.. cause I died. Boss fights in this game ruin what could have been a fun game with a flawed combat system.


Heyyo, and the most common screen when trying to fight boss battles and no explanations why no heal turns... ♥♥♥♥ this broken game. 1 / 10.

												Bad!While people with a taste for story-driven JRPGs may have more endurance than I, I only made it 8 hours into the game before I gave up hope for its salvation. Incohesive design occupies every facet of the game, and while screenshots are happy to show you flashy things like CHAIN x87! and Rush changed class to EXPERT LANCER, very few of these elements either mean anything or are explained to any length of detail. I was left feeling punished for leveling up, unrewarded for exploring, and like a spectator for combat rather than an actual participant.A few key points of obviously bad things:-Boss fights, or ""Boy, I hope it doesn't use its AoE attack and oneshot my whole team!""-Boss fights, or ""What do you mean that creature that looks almost exactly the same as other creatures I've fought is a boss?""-Boss fights, or ""Aww it's a cute little squid this should be eas OH DEAR GOD IT KILLED EVERYTHING""-Turbo mode, or ""Yeah, we get that there's a massive disparity in difficulty between normal fights and bossfights, so we put this in to let you literally fastforward gameplay. That's not a red flag, is it?""-AI-controlled unions, or ""After playtesting, we concluded that letting the player have any control was harmful to our collection of gameover screens.""-PC dying = gameover, or ""Sure combat is mostly a spectator's sport, but we feel letting the computer fight itself crosses the line, so we just made the player gameover instead.""3/10. It's pretty bad, but I'll leave it with 3 points for people who don't mind this sort of thing.			"

Product received for free
The Developer Square Enix 	The Last Remnant is a classic Japanese role-playing game published and developed by Square Enix, the creators of the Tomb Raider, Hitman, Just Cause, some of the Deus EX games such as the original on PC and Human Revolution as well as the creator of Life is Strange and are most recognized through their work with the Final Fantasy series that became a hallmark for later Japanese Role-playing games that have followed in their footsteps. Summary/Overview  	The Last Remnant is a certified triple A title made by Square Enix first released in 2008 as an Xbox 360 console exclusive never ported to the PlayStation 3. You play as a young man named Rush Sykes, the main protagonist of the game. Your sister, Irina Sykes has been kidnapped by an anti-remnant group that believes that everyone who uses these remnants are corrupt leaving the gods of the power invested in the remnants displeased. The man in charge of this anti-remnant activist group is no other than a distinguished man, Wagrum clothed in a white robe with some gold tethers upon first meeting him. It is similar to some type of robe a bishop of a church would wear but instead of it being red, it is all white with gold tethers. He is a corrupt leader that wants to trick your sister, Irina Sykes into following him, working for him. He has connections with Rush and Irina’s parents who do research over at the academy on remnants. He is actually a member himself of the academy but wants to harness the power of all remnants in order to ensue chaos and cause the unbounded remnants, ones that are not bound to become unstable causing chaos and destruction in the environment around you. 	Remnants are treasures found throughout maps in the game that are considered to hold great power. Usually each remnant is bound by a particular god of some sort and bound to a person. Once a person is bound to a remnant, you can't obtain it for yourself to harness that same power. You will want to be thorough throughout every corridor and open every door along each city-state, territory in order to sometimes find a remnant key. A remnant key is a key in the form of a remnant that can be used to unbind a designated person to that remnant and proceed forward to new places in the game. Monsters (Normal & Rare) 	The last part of history you need to know that sets up the story are the monsters. You will fight monsters constantly in battle in order to level up certain attributes such as intelligence, strength, health and experience points. Monsters range from normal encounters to limited rare monsters. These rare monsters are quite similar to the Pokémon series, yet, they don't run away when you first encounter them. Instead, they despawn after a certain period of time. You want to make sure that if you see one, that you get to it as soon as possible or else it will disappear.     During the time of this initial review I have only played around seven hours. I encountered one rare monster in Dillmoor named Longbeak during that time. I researched and unlike the other rare monsters that reappear, Longbeak does not. Instead, Urraco will appear replacing Longbeak. Others also sometimes only spawn once when you find a new area, while others, are fulfilled through other objectives as you progress in the game.     Apparently each rare monster has a normal location they spawn at.  However, they are extremely overpowered so I recommend trying to revisit places once your battle rank and hit points in damage in individual units and as a union increases. For example, I was only battle rank five or six I think near the time I encountered Longbeak while he ranges fifteen through seventeen base battle rank without a bonus. However, it can appear within a maximum battle rank of sixty-six which for you means that you will have to grind experience points as much as you do more likely in a Monster Hunter game developed by Capcom. The worst thing about Longbeak that makes it a pain to fight is it multi-deadlocks automatically up to three unions. This means that it has you pinned from multiple sides usually.     You can't heal your teammates during this time because if you cancel an initial deadlock once deadlock has already been activated by the opposing union, it will perform a raidlock in which it can attack long range preventing you from further being able to flank the rare monster, Longbeak in our example I am using. A flank is where your whole union at once can attack the object from the left, right side while pinning it down. Longbeak's statistics on the personal computer version range deals twenty-seven thousand five-hundred seventy-one hit points through one hundred seventy-nine thousand three-hundred twenty-two. Gameplay (Features, controls, graphics and mechanics) Features     Turn based combat   Battle ranking system     This is the experience point system that the game has. Instead of Final Fantasy and most Japanese role-playing games that show you what experience level your character and whole party is at one time, in the Last Remnant, we instead have battle ranks. The battle ranking system make it more perilous because you can't see how many experience points you have until the next rank or know when your party members will gain more health, experience points and attributes.Non-Western Traditional Storyline     The main feature that separates western role-playing games from Japanese role-playing games, their main counterpart, is that western role-playing games rely on an expansive open-world that you can explore freely as you choose and they normally have interactive panned cutscenes that contribute less to social order and politics than its counterpart, Japanese role-playing games do. The Last Remnant is no exception to this rule and follows a similar pattern to The Legend of Heroes: Trails of Cold Steel. You have an academy that serves as the commonplace of intelligent design, intellect, history, academia and knowledge of all the towns, city-states, provinces and areas you visit in the game as a whole unit. The storylines also follow a much different and unique pattern remaining linear, is contiguous from area to area and nonanomalous whereas western role-playing games normally have a non-linear storyline that changes from place to place. The Controls/ Camera     They are on point, awesome when the controller vibrates and one hundred percent responsive. The camera controls take a while to get used to based on your preference of adjustment but overtime measure off well. A controller is highly recommended for this game.The Good & BadPositives•	Superb storyline with great voice acting and characters•	Good variation between monsters, city-states and towns•	Nice combat system•	Challenging boss battles•	Good PlayStation 2 style graphics similar to the Legend of Heroes series & Kingdom Hearts 2•	No achievementsNegatives•	Repetitive gameplay•	Arduous experience point and leveling system•	Battles sometimes left to chance, luck•	Long main story estimated sixty-three hours, longer than Dragon Age: Inquisition, Final Fantasy series and some games in the Legend of Heroes series.Overall 7/10Key1-3= poor3-5= ok6-7= good8-10= amazingDisclaimer     I received this game for review purposes from Steamified.

												Don't be like me and play all the way through this. Don't download it in the first place.The story is generally stupid and mostly told through a series of long and boring cutscenes. The dialogue for these is poor, and the ""editing"" is strange with frequent awkward pauses between various characters' speech.Combat is a total mess. The leveling system is skill usage based, but the actual choice of skills to use on each turn is random. Characters change class based on what skills they use most, which is again, largely random, The whole game has incredibely broken level autoscaling, so that characters acquired later have no chance of catching up in power to those obtained earlier. Level design and pacing are odd as well. Later dungeons are larger and more difficult to navigate for no apparent reason. There is one point toward the end of the game which is cutscene, cutscene, long walk through an empty dungeon type area, followed by another cutscene. The score is great, which might be the only redeeming feature of this game, but not enough to make up for the mess which is basically every other aspect of this game.To repeat, don't play this.			"

												Last Remnant is a reminder to any Square fan, of how far they have fallen from the RPG tree. What could've been a solid RPG, looks like it was never play tested and still is treated like that to this day. Square treats the consumer as if they are mentally challenged, and it's clear with this game.Why is the player unable to equip other party members? Why are they forced into classes that don't even sound neat or interesting? Why were so many monster sprites reused so much? Why are rare monsters so freaking hard? Why is the player formations limited to 18 characters when you have 4 unions that can hold up to 20 characters? It makes no sense.This is the ball, and this is Square continuing to drop it			"

												I loathe JRPGs with a passion (I'm Asian and speaks Japanese so stop with your racism accusations). This game presented itself (at first) as the antithesis of JRPGs: no grinding, large scale, 18-member combat, and customizable party. But once you get to meat of the game (>10hr in) it really begins to fall apart.Pros:- Avoids most boring mechanics of JRPGs e.g. grinding and random combat- Servicable story and protagonist. Rush is less emo and annoying than most JRPG male protagonists. You may even like him quite a bit.- Combat successfully conveys the epicness of an 18-member army w/o feeling (too) repetitive and clunky.Cons:- Combat tends to last very long and after a while it really starts to get boring; there're no ways of escaping or skipping combat animations either.- The game simply refuses to explain its own mechanics to you. You can't customize your characters directly, instead they will randomly ask you seemingly inconsequential questions. If you gave a wrong answer it will permenantly lock them out of abilities and skills, rendering them useless.If you're a completionist don't play this game. The game deliberately and actively trolls you by locking you out of character skills and content w/o telling you so. By the time you finish your first playthrough you will have more regrets on your choices rather than feeling accomplishment.			"

												I got Last Remnant on sale so I got it for super cheap. I was very excited about finally getting my hands on it but unfortunately that exitement turned into frustration and finally into rage quitting the game just within 6 hours of playtime. While the game does have many good points like a fantastic soundtrack, beautiful visuals comboed with an interesting story and combat system it has some seriously frustrating elements as well. Firstly the game does'nt do a very good job of explaining most of it's mechanics, google is almost a necessity if you really want to understand the game mechanics. The second major issue is the randomness of combat. Sometimes the combat can feel really random especially early on in the game where it feels like you're at the mercy of the enemy AI units and your own ally AI units. I spent 4 hours trying to fight this one early boss called the fiery idol whic you will face an hour or 2 into the game depending on how you play it. The Fiery idol was pretty frustrating even after completing all the side quests I could find and upgrading my weapons to a good degree. If the boss decided to use its powerful AOE firebomb that chops 70% to 60% of your health on turn 2 the you're certainly dead and havve to restart fight. This is the boss that made me give up on the game. No matter what choice I made in fighting this boss it eventually boiled down to RNG deciding my fate. Will the boss use its ultimate on turn 2? will my AI companions who I can't order randomly heal me? It felt really infuriating. I finally did manage to defeat the boss and I reloaded the game to see iof I can replicate by making the same decisions but I had no success. If you are somebody who isnt frazed by a ""healthy"" dose  RNG you might actually be able to enjoy this game. But, for me its not probably going to happen an Im deleting it from my PC.			"

												What a doozy. This game deserves the ultimate award for""in dire need of one more update"".So, let's boil it down to the real issue here, the BR system. There are others, but this is the main one, since it forces you to not play the game and grub around till you have the party of characters you want since if you start leveling up BR before you have them, they will never get caught up.In short BR makes everyone stronger, but if you're smart about it, your guys will always be the bestest so no issue there. So once you've got that part set, and decide to try and change it around to accommodate new hires, you quickly realize the mistake and put back in the old guys, who have now lost a bit of their edge. There in lies, the problem. Getting further away from the start of the game makes the whole thing a tight-rope walk of using what you're handed in the first part of the game, which has some great hires btw, and excludes about 1/4 of the other talented available buddies to bring along.So as an rpg perfectionist, it's like the long the game goes, the more dire the feeling of ""maybe I'm doing this wrong"" builds, till you have to restart thinking it'll be different this time, but alas, the game randomly choosing your skills means you'll never make that mystic group, or mix-tactics group your thinking up.In short, this review is for the hardcore rpg guy. The Last Remnant offers some surface fun and excitement over the strategies you think you'll be able to construct, then just punishes you mid-late game for not specializing enough, which makes for a real drab experience of the same old ""do as much damage as possible"" thing, which then drags on and on.I keep replaying thinking it'll be different, but the game sorely needs an overall with more union options to accommodate mixed tactics, or being able to multi-deadlock with one union for defensive strategies. Or just, being able to move a unit out of combat to do just long range attacks.			"

Things I Wish I Had Known.... 
A Guide for The Last Remnant
By: Zloth

			There are a lot of things in Last Remnant that I really think should have been explained to the player. In this guide, I try to cover those things without spoiling the story.		


SPOILER SPOILER SPOILERSPOILER SPOILER SPOILERSPOILER SPOILER SPOILERSPOILER SPOILER SPOILERSPOILER SPOILER SPOILERSPOILER SPOILER SPOILERSPOILER SPOILER SPOILER It is an annoying linear walking simulator game. At least you don't have to explore much... EXCEPT FORi¡i¡i¡i¡iBIG♥♥♥♥♥DESERT? BIG♥♥♥♥♥DESERT!!!!!You can't individually order units to do squat. It's semi random squad based.So you hafta organize your squads with their individual units, that way you know which squads can do what attacks n magics EVEN THEN. YOU STILL CANT DO SHEET. Example.  Most fights when you want to heal? YOU DONT GET THAT OPTION SUCKER!  I have several people with healing abilities in all of my squads, and almost every single dam fight they can't heal when i would like them too.  99% of the time i only get attack\defense commands.in the very beginning, with it's semi awful tutorial throwing you into a battle right away with not much context clues.  it shows you a full army of people to control. I googled it, you can never get that same size 25 people. 5 squads of 5 :*(  only 3\5 or 4\5 of it    so as of this review. i am perhaps 1\4, 1\3 of the game.  and have reached full army capacity so google tells me.  which is 20\25 :*(  so 5 squads of 4. or 4 squads of 5most battles, you will earn item rewards for crafting. Sometimes a character in your party will request it.This get's annoying as hell.  Because I have several characters i want to get the items, but they rarely ask for it.  You can't force it on them, they have to request for it after a battle.You can deny them the item... but still its a rare thing to occur. So unless its a character you don't want upgrading you let them have the item.	 "

												I'm 4 hours in.I'll keep it real:The combat at the beginning of the game is a total mess. And everything you need to know about the mess you just walked out of is explained slowly as you play. And I mean SLOWLY.The story at the beginning is unbelievable/poorly executed nonsense (no spoilers). There were parts where I would think ""Who wrote this SH**?!""The no-name NPC motion capture I've encountered so far is BAD. I recommend you turn on subtitles just so you don't focus on them.But if you can manage to get past the first 3-4 hours of♥♥♥♥♥♥and keep an open-mind, you'll probably fall in love with this game. It's been a while since I was able to play an RPG game that's held my attention for this long. And by 'while', I mean when FFX came out in 2001.Again, what I've played of this game so far is a half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥mess (squareenix+Yoichi Wada=Cash Grab Era) but it shows earnest potential and is slowly becoming more interesting and is showing promise. If you purchased this and hate it because of the beginning: DON'T GIVE UP ON IT.Update 10/07/2016:...I gave up on it. This game punishes you to death for grinding regular enemies. I don't understand how the ""Battle Rank System"", as a whole, can be an intentional game mechanic meant to draw people into playing it.If you enjoy:-Combat in an RPG game to the point where you pick fights intentionally-Instructions that make sense/go in-depth for those interested-Customizing your players to the MAX-Excellent/Great/Good/Decent/Ok Voice Acting or Mo-Cap-Playing a balanced game where you can fight everything in one playthrough...well, ""The Last Remnant"" isn't for you. Find another game. **TL;DR**:This games♥♥♥♥♥backwards ""Battle Rank System"" has ruined the experience for me. (pun intended)""Give up.""			"

												The game has quite recent graphics, a quite unique battle system, but all that under a mediocre story and some flaws. I bought the game under a sale and I have to say the game just might be worth what I paid for it.I've seen many flaws in the story (""oh, hell just broke free... let's sit around until things calm down for a while"" in CG form) and the protagonist is quite goofy.The battle system is nice and let's the player either use his reactions to deal more damage or leave it up to chance (which I spent most of the game doing, since I didn't want to actively press buttons for every attack)The big downside for the battle system is that it's quite random. Formations have hidden stats and there's this ""mobility"" which might change your attack from ultra succesfull to uther failure. Also, many times have I died in a single turn because all my groups decided to attack a rampaging boss who decided to use his signature ultra damaging skill in that particular turn. Although the game is quite forgiving in that sense, it doesn't feel really rewarding.With all its ups and downs, I'd give this game 6/10.+Lots of content+Nice animations+A lot of skills to keep you entertained in battles-Difficult to handle battle and leveling up system-Mediocre story			"

No leveling (experience is somewhat hidden and level of characters as well), no freedom of choosing which skill in the battle you will use, stupid quicktime events which can happen in one battle 3times in a row and then for 10 battles nothing will happen, insane dificulty peaks hand in hand together with automating leveling of enemies, etc.Short version - if you want to try RPG, there are different options than this. If you want to try REAL JRPG, try Final Fantasy VII or VIII or VI, however this game is waste of money and time			"

												this game is terrible only a few minutes in and i could barely stand the choppy broken dialog.Not to mention the gameplay and tutorial need an overhaul i found myself liking the idea of the gameplay but i play on a computer when this game was made for a playstation or xbox it was so bad they hadnt even bothered to change the tutorial mechanics to pc standards i spent several minutes trying to figure out what the x button could be along with the rest. I could go on but i think ive made my point this game is NOT worth the money DO NOT buy this game.			"

												What a doozy. This game deserves the ultimate award for""in dire need of one more update"".So, let's boil it down to the real issue here, the BR system. There are others, but this is the main one, since it forces you to not play the game and grub around till you have the party of characters you want since if you start leveling up BR before you have them, they will never get caught up.In short BR makes everyone stronger, but if you're smart about it, your guys will always be the bestest so no issue there. So once you've got that part set, and decide to try and change it around to accommodate new hires, you quickly realize the mistake and put back in the old guys, who have now lost a bit of their edge. There in lies, the problem. Getting further away from the start of the game makes the whole thing a tight-rope walk of using what you're handed in the first part of the game, which has some great hires btw, and excludes about 1/4 of the other talented available buddies to bring along.So as an rpg perfectionist, it's like the long the game goes, the more dire the feeling of ""maybe I'm doing this wrong"" builds, till you have to restart thinking it'll be different this time, but alas, the game randomly choosing your skills means you'll never make that mystic group, or mix-tactics group your thinking up.In short, this review is for the hardcore rpg guy. The Last Remnant offers some surface fun and excitement over the strategies you think you'll be able to construct, then just punishes you mid-late game for not specializing enough, which makes for a real drab experience of the same old ""do as much damage as possible"" thing, which then drags on and on.I keep replaying thinking it'll be different, but the game sorely needs an overall with more union options to accommodate mixed tactics, or being able to multi-deadlock with one union for defensive strategies. Or just, being able to move a unit out of combat to do just long range attacks.			"

												A jrpg with serious grinding and convoluted story problems, but still worth a play.  The main protagonist is horrible and unintelligent and unlikeable, and I'm starting to think that maybe that was intentional?? He's basically jRPG George Bush Jr. as a teenager.The combat system though is pretty awesome and I wish other games used something like it. A final fantasy 9 remake with this combat system would be the♥♥♥♥♥♥ You have characters and they're put into little squadrons that fight together as a single unit, and how you attack and approach enemies and the angle you use (and subsequently, the ones they use) determine not only your damage bonuses/maluses and the abilities/tricks you can use but also how the morale bar progresses (either towards the enemy side or your side). Understadnably, the morale bar is best on your side, as it has a severe effect on everything.  Its very strateigic and a good play can easily turn the tide of battle in even overwhelming situations. However, a severe downside is the sheer amount of grinding and gathering you have to do. Dear goodness. You can certainly play through the game without doing any but you'll eventually hit a brick wall of 'this is way too hard even if I play this perfectly' 3/4ths through the game (I did that).  You have to grind this, collect that, grind that, grind this, grind that, so your characters all level up in their weapon and level their weapon up and level what weapons they can craft up and level what weapons their crafted weapons can craft up and level what's availible from shops to aid in crafting that sword to craft an axe to switch over to another skill set and do it all over again for 30+ odd characters. Nope. Not for me. Maybe for you?			"

												Ok so I kinda had a placeholder recommendation up for this thing for the longest time, but after dropping 80 odd hours into it and not finishing every quest I decided ♥♥♥♥ it, I'm gonna see the ending. Battle system is a ton of fun, very enjoyable. Story is animu as ♥♥♥♥ and can be kinda cringeworthy through uh, the entire first half of the game, not so bad in the second half. Not worth $50, but if this ever goes on sale for like <$20, pick it up ya.			"

												It's too bad this game came out too soon for the Xbox 360 and ruined its potential. That version was buggy as all get-out and nearly unplayable and, as such, was reviewed with a very strong negative light. This version fixes pretty much every single graphical and technical issue that made that one unplayable and thus is allowed to shine.I'm mostly a console gamer these days(even though I've been playing PC and Console games both since I was 4 in 1987), so I live for Square Enix games and know their history very well. I worshipped at their feet in the glory days before the merger. They haven't been great since, but for me, The Last Remnant is one of the few standout IPs they've had since they left their old Squaresoft monicre behind them.This game is equal parts JRPG, strategy, and story-driven RPG. The combat is the main draw and probably the most unique form of turn-based I've seen in many years. Battles take place in a pseudo-strategic form where the player holds many groups of 3+ toons forming smaller parties broken off from the main group of up to 25 party members. You can fight groups of enemies as large as 75+ forming wave after wave and it really lends itself to the whole ""continental war"" vibe that the story tries to evoke. It's something you don't see often, if ever and it's very engrossing. There is well over 100 hours of content to explore from sidequests to mob hunting to the main story itself and it very rarely gets old. On the pc, t graphics shine and the art style and creativity of the world is awe-inspiring at times. It is, again, something largely unique in the world of JRPGs. It doesn't feel too much like Final Fantasy, but you can see the influence.One of the best aspects of this game, believe it or not, is the music. Take the best soundtracks of the FF franchise and combine it with hard rock compositions by some of Japans best and you have a soundtrack unlike any other out there. I bought the 3+ disc soundtrack I love it so much. It really heightens the impact during combat and brings you in that much more.All in all I'd say any lover of JRPGs will love this game. It didn't get it's fair chance because SquEnix botched their chance with the ill-adviced 360 version. Rest assured that this game is 100% playable and will be well worth the cost.			"

												tl;dr: This game is mostly RNG based despite what it tells you, so if you're fine with relying on luck, then you might enjoy it.If you like to win through clever tactical decisions or being overleveled and steamrolling enemies; this game has nothing to offer you.I got this game wanting a chill tactical JRPG where I could grind, explore and craft. After about 50 hours in I feel it delivered on the side quest, exploration and crafting side---HOWEVER:The combat is insanely RNG heavy. You don't have control over possitioning of your party and the game punishes you for bad positioning, you also don't have direct control over what attacks/moves your characters perform. Different moves have different modifiers that are strong against different types of monsters but you don't actually get to choose to use these moves, you just have to hope you get them.  There is also a chance you get a roll in combat where your mages only get to choose between Physical attacks and fighters only get to use Magic attacks. The combat can also otherwise completely screw you over when you get a bad roll out eg: you can end up in situations where you need to/want to heal but the game just doesn't let you because you get bad RNG (this has cost my alot of fights). Even if you get the heal option you only really get one of two options: ""heal yourself"" or ""heal someone else"" you don't get to choose who that someone else is so you'll just have to cross your fingers and hope.There is a moral system that supposedly rewards you for making good tactical decisions, increasing your damage and defense when you keep moral high. However most of these ""decisions"" are actually based on RNG and completely outside your control, and several mobs are immune to it anyway making the combat in general favoured towards enemies, especially vs bosses and Rare Enemies.There are no random encounters, so that's good, but there's a system where if an enemy sneaks up on you they get a combat advantage, however there is no way for you to get an early combat advantage over you enemy via something like a pre-emtive strike.If you're the kind of person who likes to spend a lot of time getting good gear for your entire team, this game doesn't allow you to do that either as you only have control of the gear on the main character, while everyone else has their own gear that can only be improved with (say it with me) RNG, as they may ask to have some of the gear you're not using if it's better than what they have. The other way to improve you're allies gear is to gather monster loot where your crew MAY ask to have some of it to improve their gear.Lastly all the enemies in the game scale with your ""levels"" so grinding isn't all that useful, pretty much taking all the point out of leveling. Further more you can't watch how much XP you gain to see how much more you need to get new moves or what you need for your stats to increase, which is just another annoyance in my already page long complaint.

												TLR is a JRPG from Square-Enix with a few flaws and a predictable storyline but is beautifully done.From the get go, you might have control issues, I did and I had to google how to fix it, but after that it should be a breeze. There isn't a very steep learning curve, but you will most certainly miss things on your first play through than you would if you had known a few things. For example, there's some side missions that unlock certain playable characters that are amazing but they're only open for a limited time, and if you progress in your story you will miss the opportunity to recruit them.As far as battles go, the fighting is pretty simple, you can set up your characters to form unions (or squads) which pool stats, which I thought was a little disappointing because I really wanted to be able to attack certain characters differently and position mine differently. Not a bad point, just different from what I'm used to. They have a sort of Limit Break attack move for certain characters like most Square games.If you do get to check this game out, be sure to play through without a guide first, then check out what you missed, I had a load of fun this way. Incase you decide to check the guide out first or run through with a guide:


Things I Wish I Had Known.... 
A Guide for The Last Remnant
By: Zloth

			There are a lot of things in Last Remnant that I really think should have been explained to the player. In this guide, I try to cover those things without spoiling the story.		


In short, I would recommend TLR because it's different but still has a Square uniqueness of fun to it. It has some flaws but the flaws are overlooked by the game's overwhelmingly positive pro's to it's con's.			"

												After 190 hours of game time, I just finished my first playthrough of this game.To be fair I nearly did 100% of its content. But yeah, it has a LOT of content, if you do everything.So what is this game about? You assemble a team of people, put them together into units (called unions) and do battle in turns. Depending on who you put together into a union the actual commands they get in battle change and depending on which skills your guys/gals use they level different abilities and stats, which in turn affects which classes they will get into. There are also different formations for your unions to use, which affects the stats of the union.Well, that sure sounds complicated, but rejoice most of this game is easily beatable by just doing whatever sounds good to you.  So you don't have to get into the depth of it if you don't want to, though for me that was part of the fun. It is a really good easy to use but hard to master/really understand type of system. There are a few optional bosses that are very very hard and beating them may require some kind of special tactics. It feels incredible rewarding when you are finally able to beat them, though.Does the game have any drawbacks? To be honest the story is kinda ""eh whatever"", but there are tons of optional stuff to distract you from it. The story battles however are pretty awesome. Another negative point is that a few enemies have really really cheap skills, which can be quite frustrating.Overall I really liked this game a lot and might even start up a ng+ run of it. Yes, that is a recommendation.			"

												     TLR is a fantastic game. Sadly the game has an extremely poor reputation from the xbox world where I understand that it is sub par. On the PC however, the game is absolutely beautiful and suprisingly deep. The story won't win any awards for originality I suppose, but personally I really enjoyed it.      The main draw of the game however is the turn based combat with a twist. Instead of giving individual party members a command, you assemble small armies and assign them a general strategy to execute over the course of a turn. While this system can seem shallow and perhaps frustrating to those without the patience to learn its intricacies, it is one of the most enjoyable battle sysyems I have ever used in an RPG. Building and customizing each union and your overall team is a lot of fun. If you seek out the sidequests in the game (which easily adds more than 50% more content) you will often find yourself with access to many more allies with which to customize your team.    In all honestly if you have no interest in making a decent investment into learning the sysyem then this may not be the game for you. If, on the other hand, you enjoy learning and mastering an intricate combat system, turn based combat, hours and hours of sidequests and a beautiful world to explore, extremely challenging optional bosses, and beautiful looking combat, you will probably love TLR as much as I do.

												One of my favorite games - new areas slowly open up for you to go back to over and over, sometimes with different enemies. The storyline is kind of regular, but this game excels in the battles. This is one of the only games where I find grinding fun.			"

												The Last Remnant is... interesting. I like it. Let's start with the components: Audio is good. the music is good. What you'd expect out of a JRPG without being... memorable, though. Certainly not like FF's ""Zanarkand"" theme, or Wild Arms' opening number. Still, it adds to the game. It gives it a bit of atmosphere and adds to the experience, without being intrusive. The voice acting is... decent. passable, though turnbased as if drawing samples from different characters' audio files and splicing them together noticably with a slight delay. There are a few quirks, and sometimes I feel some characters' inflections or timings are off, and wish Pagus would get on with it at some points, but he's old. Rush's line ""Let's Kick Some A"", for some reason, bothers me for a game with blood visuals and literally had an NPC use the word ""B**chfit"".Visuals are nice. They made a world with depth, and beauty, and very nice aesthetic appeal, as you'd expect from a relatively modern JRPG, without migrating into ""OVERUSE BLOOM AND LENS FLARE"" territory. Automatic camera movements in combat can take a little getting used to, and voiced cutscenes that weren't pre-rendered but are voiced, are a tad jerky in terms of character movement. Obviously cued and timed 'gestures' and 'animations', rather than flowing, fullly-choreographed stuff.  That said, they seem to have partly forsaken ""Belts-and-zippers"" design for actual symmetry in outfits, save for when it looks... Reasonable. Elements still exist, but they are less common, and favor symmetry more often.  Exceptions don't often become unreasonable. I still think Rush's ""@$$-flag"" is a bit silly though. It's the red-and-white hanging emblem off his beltline in the pictures the store page shows, but it offers a glimpse of an interesting move by the designers in giving most characters a mark. A symbol of some sort, that identifies their assumed class and role, if you look hard enough. From what I can tell, they actually appear to change as the story progresses. That being said, classes are... transmutable and flow together. It's not as strictly defined as the ""Mage, beatface, healer"" setup as it sounds.  You could turn Torgal for example, into a hexblade, or a combat medic, or just a DPS nuke, though keep in mind those are my own terms. Story: IT'S A JRPG. Yes, there's a story with depth in a world with depth, and relatively well-developed characters, each with their own amusing quirks. I've found it enjoyable so far, and can easily follow the plot. The game, while allowing you exploration, doesn't leave you going ""uh... what was I doing again?"" Because it's always followed by something like ""Oh, right.  Saving 'my' sister from the [redacted] and [redacted], working together with the [redacted lots] to [redacted all over the place]""Mechanics:Out of combat: decent. Though you want to get a USB controller. Something with shoulder-buttons and sticks that can be pressed down. Like something that emulates a PS3 controller.  Also, while an interesting experiment, the system of engaging an enemy before they get to you is a littlte... well, it works, but might not be for everyone. It does however, offer chances for greater risk and reward, or to take multiple squads at once to save time and effort. The item customization and creation system, I think I like, as do I the system of helping your followers find components for their own upgrades. I just wish I could HAND THEM the mats and go ""Here, now stop bothering me in each town! I've got like 50 of the things!"" Though it does offer better incentive to train, as the difficulty class of some bosses starts to get away from you after a bit, further encouraging training, and perhaps even a touch of grinding. IN combat: While micro-managing to get the best out of a party's actions would be interesting, do you really want to give 15 separate orders before a combat starts? I think the system works well for squads, and is believable. You issue a general order. A ""Smoke if you got 'em"" call for mystic nuking, or a ""Beat some face if you got the skills"" call for combat arts, and other specialized orders based on situation, available party members in a squad, and their own talents. The remainder gets filled with standard melee strikes. You should go into combat with several squads, not necessarily light on party members, and here's why: They have a communal HP pool, as do their enemies. A large squad can be tanky, but slow. A small squad is squishy, but easier to do tactical b***hsmacks with. Couple that with the fact that you set troop formations and that they actually modify the troop's combat statistics, and you have an interesting, thought-invoking mechanic that lets you squeeze a bit more out of your characters, if you're not an idiot. However, even with all this, and added features like flanking, deadlock engagements, interceptions, and a nifty morale meter, it's still a turnbased JRPG at heart. I'm thoroughly surprised that they got it all to work so well together.In summary and serving as a TL;DR, Good story, decent graphics, very in-depth but enjoyable and well-orchestrated mechanics. You should buy this game.			"

												The Last Remnant is a really good attempt for Square Enix to establish itself on PC gaming ( though I still play it with PS3 controller since it's easier to control, I used a 3rd party controller program to disguise it as 360 controller ).   Graphics : The game's graphic is a little bit on the middle ground for PC ( and especially for SquareEnix ) though the game show much of its details and the true power of SE-animated on the battleground rather than the cutscene ( Maybe my PC sucks but the grame drop during some of the gigantic animation are quite bad ).  Control : The game is console controller friendly and I would suggest you to use one since It's much nicer to get around using controller.   Game's Mechanics : The game use its old and all popular turn base mechanics from the final fantasy series, with a really nice touch here and there. A big improvement though is apart from the main character, anybody else will be treated equally on the battlefield which make the game extremely interesting and fun to play.  Speaking of the amount of characters, the game offer you up to 25 chatacters to be on the battlefield at one time ( 5 team of 5 ), you will be controlling a team called ""union"", to give order to your troops, the action each troops can take are very situational base, since you are controlling up to 5 characters at one time, the game use a function to give each troops their own chance to use their skills. This might cone at a negative to some person since you can't directly control one particular character and command him to use certain skill at that specific time, but he/she will be using it automatically if the situation is met. The tutorial is there, though it doesn't go in depth of how and when is the appropriate time to use some of the function. The QTE they include in the fight are extremely nice, it make the game goes from spam Attack to win to you have to pay attention on the game in case some of those QTE come in so you can power up your attack or counter the enemy attack with your own for HUGE damage. Which of course have its down side on that it's more centered toward luck-base than strategy for the QTE. Speaking of QTE, another HUGE downside of the game came from the fact that it have the ""turbo mode"" option available for you to speed up the fighting progress of the game, it speed up the animation of the fighting scene and here is a problem that they might not noticed before, the QTE's speed in turbo mode is also much, MUCH quicker, so quick that it's impossible for any human to react to the right QTE sequence on time which in turns, making the QTE in turbo mode, impossible and thus, might lose you in the match that require some QTE action.   Sound : Oh my god, SE did it again with its awesome soundtrack that will capture anyone's heart.  In total, for the price tag of 10$, I would recommend this game to anyone that is a fan of RPG ( first timer are not the target audience of this game ). If you're a fan of ANY of the FF series, Dragon Quest series or  just any game from SE in general, you will probably love this game. I have no idea why metacritics critics have been giving this game a low score of 66 ( users at 82 ), I think it deserve better though the story line is, as you guess it, very final fantasy-like.			"

												Very Final Fantasy-esque, but this fantasy setting does tend to get tiring after all these years. The main character is likable enough, but the supporting characters are the ones holding the somewhat flimsy story together.The controls are definitely made for consoles (I suspect the entire thing is just a weak port, though), so it does take some time getting used to them. Speaking of which, combat is fresh and it gets a bit tactical, but that's only if you can wrap your head around it. It does tend to get very confusing, but once you've gotten the hang of it, it's very rewarding.All in all, it's a pretty good game, neither groundbreaking nor complete crap. Could it have been better, though? Yes, definitely.			"

												This is a decent JRPG with plenty of playtime and sidequests to do, as well as a rather in-depth and interesting battle system. Unfortunately, much of the game is very poorly explained if explained at all, forcing the player to look up all of the game's numerous mechanics. So much of the game design is unintuitive and very strange, such as the idea that it's actually preferrable to avoid random fights to keep your battle rank lower and make important fights easier and the inability to easily directly choose which spells or skills to use in battle, that trying to play through the game without the use of any outside resources will probably be a very confusing experience. Nevertheless, if you're willing to invest time into learning how to play, this game can be rather enjoyable. 7/10			"

												A JRPG on the PC. Can't say that was too common when I played this game. It has a strange combat system where you command squads of characters rather than individually. Commands are a bit random at times. You aren't guranteed a healing command when you need it the most. You might lose a boss fight if you get unlucky with your orders. Story is a little confusing, but that is very typical for a JRPG. Graphics aren't terrible, but will look a bit dated. Since it is quite old, might as well wait for a sale to buy.			"

												Don't let the reviews crying ""no grinding"" and ""impossibly hard"" dissuade you. The Last Remnant is an excellent, turn-based RPG with a very unique battle system (that can even be sped up significantly). I found quite a few bosses that were frustrating beyond belief, but after taking the time to adjust formations, try different squad combinations, and yes, level up a bit, I'd get through them.The key to ""grinding"" is to pull multiple groups of enemies at once. This is clearly stated in the very beginning of the game and helps all of your NPCs level up with you.Very satisfying experience. Finished the game in less than 70 hours and that was with a lot of exploring and side quests (though I probably skipped/missed a whole lot more). "

No much sense on coming back later, or grinding your level cause mobs escale with you and trying a typical sidequest to improve gear can get you to 30 min battle for reach a boss, just to have your whole party one-hit killed... no way to know the difficult an encounter can be until your teams are wiped on the 27 turn by one attack... you can get random monsters, random spawns, enemy reinforcements that appears and lay waste to your troops without you even having the chance to choice your next turn random comands... yup, there are long ( long ) battles , and for a development reason i cant fathom to understand, the choice of orders is random... so you can find yourself with no heal orders at all... and your party will be wiped on any turn.I dont use to give up with games but this one just dont deserve my time.

												10 hours into the game I can tell that this is an extremely interesting game. Aside from the lore which I barely understand in a game that I'm told runs for at least 70 hours more, I know that I'm plunged into a world that is about to hit the fan and feces will start flying all around.Gameplay wise it resembles FFXIII (rather, FFXIII resembles this game) on the world map and in ""dungeons"" but that is not always bad. The real difference comes in the combat scenarios which are extremely more complicated and tactical than FFXIII ever was. You have several units (made from 1-5 soldiers) fighting various assortments of units at the same time, and you have to coordinate who attacks what and if you make up the wrong choice, you'll have another unit intercept yours for a negative morale hit (morale is basically how well your forces think the battle is going. if it's going good, they'll do more damage, and vice versa)Storywise, it's what you expect from a Square(Enix, yuck) game. Extremely complex, lots of names to memorize at once, interesting cartography, etc.TL;DR: Got this game on a sale. I'm at 10 hours and I bought it for like 5$. That's a 2:1 ratio and I'm expecting 70 hours more of enjoyment. Good enjoyment at that. Do keep in mind that JRPGs are not things like Dragon Age, although you can keep a resemblance, you have to expect other things here.			"

												Well, this is a Square Enix game, turn based basic combat.I thought that the squad-based thing might remove some of the parts I find boring in the normal turn based systems, but overall, it makes for a fairly dull system.I only had the patience to go through the first two areas, so it might get a bit better later on, but so far, here is what I found wrong with it:- The movements on the map scenes are slow.- The environments are empty, adding to the slow movements.- Everything dies in a few hits, both you and the enemies (even in the first area), but the HP is restored to full after each fight.- Random chances to get critical hits in or to get hit by one.- No real control over the fights, making it seem like a merry mess of randomness.- Gain of ""stats"" after a few fights, seemingly unrelated to what action you chose (levelling up?).- No way to skip animations, and somewhat poor quality animations anyway, making the ""watch what happens"" phase boring to watch. Added to the fact that the camera switches all over the place instantly, and you get a messy presentation instead of a cinematic one that seems to be intended.All in all, I don't know what I was expecting, it's a Square Enix game, and I really am bored of those menu based combats with occasional QTE.I can get over it whan the games try to do things I find interesting, like the moe system in Mugen souls, or when your choices are a bit more varied, with actually reasons to defend and other similar actions.I guess this game can please some people, because it doesn't seem broken or bad per say, but it definitely is not my thing at all.

												Worst JRPG I've ever played. I really wanted to give this game a chance. 16+Hrs of playtime speak for themselves.The graphics are good, can't say anything against that. But the rest of this game makes me run away as soon as I try to play it. Didn't see that much of the story, or at least i hope so. So maybe the story is decent but the gameplay kept me from it.Now i start with what really makes this game the worst JRPG i've ever seen.1. The characters : The main Character Rush is a dumb, hotheaded but far to talented kid who just doesn't think about any consequence his actions could have. Too often I was sitting there watching him rush(no pun intended) into dangerous situation and i was left with one big question : WHY?!The cast of other characters makes even less sense. Rush meets them and after less than two lines of dialog : ""I'm gonna help you."" Again same question... WHY?! These characters never met before and just exchanged less words, than Hodor from Game of Thrones has in his entire repertoire, and they are acting like BFFs?!2.The character growth system: The game punishes you for ending your fights as fast and efficient as possible. As your character's hp don't grow if the they don't get damaged. This learning by doing stuff was allready bad in one of the older Final Fantasys back on the SNES. And that's not wine, it doesn't get better with age.3.The battle system/battle rank system/enemy scaling : The Battle system itself seems interesting at first glance.Especially the Unit-Formation-Leader stuff really has a lot of interesting and strong points. But then the atrocities begin. The Battle system itself is a lot of random, luck reliant stuff. Which is never good in a turnbased game.You get no indication which Unit moves when, you have no Idea of the enemy's speed. And you get no information on the enemy's movents at all. How is any human beeing supposed to formulate a strategy without even the most basic of information provided? How am I supposed to keep my morale up if the enemy Interferes with any of my moves?Your party strength plays no part in the enemy scaling to your party at all. As you fight more enemys, what you sometimes have to do, your battle rank rises. The higher your battle rank, the stronger the monsters. That system is supposed to balance itself out. But I tell you one thing: It doesn't because at some point enemys will start using Area of Effect Attacks which damage your Unitmembers Individually this is going to oneshot whole Units, at some occasions even the whole Army, as happened to me several times. making fighting impossible because there is no flee option. Then there are these Special Arts that some characters have. They can use them if a gauge on the Status screen of the Unit is filled. These gauges fill as you attack, and drop as you take damage. So these Special Arts are supposed to give you an even greater edge when you are allready dominating the fight. But anything like a strong ""last resort"" type of attack would maybe make many fights less frustrating.So I would not recommend this game, even if I would get paid for that.			"

												The game has an interesting take on turn-based combat (directing multiple parties of characters that share stats  and move as one unit rather than as individuals); however a lot of the nuances of the mechanics are not well-explained within the game itself. I'd recommend browsing a wiki on basic gameplay to get a better handle on the mechanics the game has. If you like JRPGs and turn-based games it's worth checking out, imo, though for people who prefer 100% control over every combat decision the variable nature (based on party makeup, party leader, and positioning) of combat commands in battle might be annoying. Basically, most of the strategic thought goes into setting up your parties' characters and their skills beforehand, and then adapting to whatever options you get during the actual combat turns. It may feel a little too random for some people, though you can stack the deck in your favor if you know what you're going for with your group/skill makeup. There are around fifty unique characters that you can choose to recruit into your parties -- some are linked to the main story while others are hidden and can only be obtained after doing certain side quests, as well as 'generic' soldiers that you can hire to pad your army.The art direction and music are top-notch -- the game looks beautiful on the PC.

A lot of the side content can become unavailable permanently if you progress too far in the main story without exploring every area (though there is the benefit of being able to start a New Game + after your first playthrough).

												This is a great JRPG coming from Xbox platform to PC. Although its initial release was in 2008, it would still be appealing to newer gamers, especially with enhanced graphics (well, it will also depend on the GPU, though..). A lot of playable characters, equipment and skill customizations, and non-linear quests. If I have to compare it to past Square Enix releases, I will say that the game has its roots in SaGa series (reflected in its customizations and quests), but executed in a different manner. It would be enjoyable to most gamers, especially the ones who like to play JRPG.			"

												The Last Remnant is a great JRPG by Square. A unqiue battle system where you take control of a group of soldiers rather than individual units. Hours of quests and exploring. If you like a challenging JRPG this game is for you.However the mechanics can be a bit confusing at first like the leveling system or lack off. Item crafting is pretty much pointless until the second half of the game as the components are just not easy enough to get until then and I wish they allowed you to equip more items than just weapons and add-ons. I would suggest looking at gameplay before purchasing as even I was skeptical at first about this game and after playing the Xbox version the PC version is far more superior.So if your like JRPGs and don't mind devoting hours of your life towards grinding enemies to develop your party. Then The Last Remnant is a game your going to love.  "

												I think this is greatly under-appreciated game. It is unconventional in battles, having squads to control rather than classical 1-4 single characters. The squads give whole another level to tactics and strategies and a bit of a random element at times too. I loved the game, it has lots of grinding to do and challenging ultimate bosses. The story itself is fairly easy to complete and doesn't require grinding so it's a good for those who're in just for the story. The game has beautiful cinematics and the overall story is good. Lots of side-quests for those interested in them. Also I consider grinding more fun in this game as the enemies get stronger(with battle ranks) so even as time goes by they won't just become target-dummies. Also for those who consider them getting too stong; there is new game+ which allows you to keep some stuff for new start.			"

While the story doesn't really stay with you, I found that the depth of the combat made up for the somewhat thin plot. Most missions remained fun and fast paced with only a few being a bit dull for my taste. The ability to chain enemy groups for more difficult but rewarding combat remained fun dozens of hours into the game. Dozens of hours which will need to be invested in order to overcome the many difficult quests. With many hours into the game I honestly say I wish I understood how character class advancedment worked a little bit better.			"

												Ye of warning who might think about buying this game, for trying to play this without extensive study will end up your downfall. This game will punish those who think you can just grind your levels to make up for a lack of skill, will limit your access towards many a thing if you aren't always activly exploring after every story event, and in general be hard as nails till you learn the full in's and out of it's battle system and dynamic nature quarks. For all of it's headbanging thought, this game offers quite a bit that nothing else really comes close towards. A battle system that simulates a 'war' like fighting style, the massive trainable roster to collect and gear up, and bosses that really do not hold back one bit. The storyline...is at least passible, yet was done around the same time FFXII or so, with Mr Skys feeling a BIT too much ( and forced ) like Vaan in turn because of such. Once you get good at everything thought, this is going to start to feel like FFT all over again.			"

												Pros+Unique battle system+Challenging boss fights+Nice aesthetics as well as graphics+A lot of side quests which are generally interesting story-wise+A lot of secrets and extra stuffCons-A few mechanics are not well explained-Limited autonamy in customizing your party's equipment-Some grinding required for the best gearThe Last Remnanat is a turn-based strategy RPG with a diferent kind of combat mechanincs. Each character will be placed in a squad of 5 (max) and will act on a general command, such as attack with magical arts, etc. Usually, the available commands are influenced by the abilities of the squad leader and the condition of the battle (if they're dying or if another squad needs help etc.). However, you will not be able to directly control what type of action each individual will perform. For example, the command is to inflict ailments, but you cannot specify whether to silence them, poison them, etc.However, sometimes characters may change their actions depending on the situation. This is usually due to a successful quick time event (QTE), high morale, etc. Sometimes characters will perform healing abilities because they just need healing, or the command was to offer support to others (not a direct command to heal) or the character's class is just inclined to healing. This makes battles much more dynamic and unpredictable. This all leads up to one thing.Satisfying boss fights. I can say without a doubt, the best thing about this game is how challenging and enjoyable the fights that matter can be. It's the strong point of the game. Paired with secret and extra bosses that are even more challenging, this is what truly makes the game shine.Unfortunately, to get there may take some patience as there are mechanics or stats that are not detailed enough, there is no  way to directly give items to your party members, and getting said items may lead into a dull grind. It should also be noted that to be a perfectionist in this game, it will require you to consult the wiki frequently. But then, every good game deserves a wiki, and the Last Remnant is definitely a good game. "

												The game has an interesting take on turn-based combat (directing multiple parties of characters that share stats  and move as one unit rather than as individuals); however a lot of the nuances of the mechanics are not well-explained within the game itself. I'd recommend browsing a wiki on basic gameplay to get a better handle on the mechanics the game has. If you like JRPGs and turn-based games it's worth checking out, imo, though for people who prefer 100% control over every combat decision the variable nature (based on party makeup, party leader, and positioning) of combat commands in battle might be annoying. Basically, most of the strategic thought goes into setting up your parties' characters and their skills beforehand, and then adapting to whatever options you get during the actual combat turns. It may feel a little too random for some people, though you can stack the deck in your favor if you know what you're going for with your group/skill makeup. There are around fifty unique characters that you can choose to recruit into your parties -- some are linked to the main story while others are hidden and can only be obtained after doing certain side quests, as well as 'generic' soldiers that you can hire to pad your army.The art direction and music are top-notch -- the game looks beautiful on the PC. Areas themselves are linear, though there are many side quests and hidden regions available if you want a break from the main storyline. A lot of the side content can become unavailable permanently if you progress too far in the main story without exploring every area (though there is the benefit of being able to start a New Game + after your first playthrough).

												The story is alright but it is kind of hard to be immersed into the game's world. The gamplay feels limiting as you do not really have much control in what goes on as you fight. For example, if you want to heal but the AI does feel like you have to, it will not give you the option even though it is imperative to heal that turn otherwise you die. And you will die, you will die ALOT. Due to the limiting controls, the boss battles get much harder to the point where it is a random chance if you will beat the boss. The enemies/bosses also scale with level, so leveling up does not make the game much easier and sometimes actually makes it harder to go through due to the increased toughness of the enemies.			"

												Lured into buying it by a decent MetaCritics score, I could not actually play this for very long.  I simply found no entry into this game. The decent in-game video sequences were providing a very japanese RPG feel, and I guess one could view this as mix between RPG and tactical/skirmish combat. However, from the graphics to the controls everything cried out ""console port"", and IMHO not at very good one at that. This may have been a decent console game some years ago, but trying to play this on a PC keyboard was pretty frustrating, the visuals were sometimes a mix between decent and annoying (e.g. not showing your party when moving around, very basic tactical environments), and the ""unique"" turn-based tactical combat system was pretty lame, IMHO. E.g. no tactical movement of your party members, but just a selection of attack options from a list, ""combined"" Hit Points for entire groups, etc. Still, there are the typical RPG elements such as character building, item drops, etc., but nothing like crafting, enchanting, etc. known from more complex RPGs (at least not as far as I went into it). There is a strong feeling that this game almost plays itself, and while some may consider it to have a deep or compelling storyline (though not compared to e.g. BG2:SoA I'd say), I just couldn't stand the gameply between the video sequences which seemed mainly about depicting some asian kids saving the world...This type of Japanese RPG game with simplified turn-based tactical battles may have it's fans, but I am not among them. If you like JRPGs you may love this one. If, like me, you prefer Divinity 2 or old-school BG2:SoA type RPGs with tons of ""fetch this, kill that"" type side quests, then this is most probably not for you.Depth: Immersive (?)Setting: Fantasy Type: RPG/TacticalMy Rating: 4 out of 10 (you may rate this 8 of 10 if you are into JRPGs)...

												Being a fan of a lot of square enix games i REALLY REALLY wanted to like this game... But it suffers from one major flaw, you don't really play the game. I understand a difficult game I do enjoy a challenge but lets be fair here, challengeing because you had to plan ahead, and challengeing because your luck was bad are two completely different things. One example is an easy first boss fight, that i had to do twelve different times and still could not beat. First of all you may die before you EVEN ENGAGE in the battle because of dumb luck. Second you engage in the battle and whatever order you give may just not play out right for some reason, and you never really know the reason why its just ends up feeling like somebody flipped a coin somewhere and said ♥♥♥♥ it. Then you get lucky and can issue an actual battle order but only for yourself hoping that whatever ally you don't control does what you want it to... Did I mention the fact that you can't really control all your party members, you just issue orders and hope they do what you want. I know this is the way the gameplay was designed but it was a poor design choice because I don't really feel like I am controlling anything. Also I might add that as you level up the enemies get harder, while this seems like a good thing at first, its not... You have a difficult boss fight and want to do some griding to come back later to try to beat him... too bad he is just as hard because he leveled up. Want to do some side quests  just to get away from the main story? well damnit now all the bosses and enemies are harder. This game literally punishes you for doing side quests, yea its that annoying. If you enjoy this game thats fine, more power to you and I am glad you did, but for any newcomers please be wary that this game is extremely convoluted and frustrating.			"

Its grinding grinding and more grinding. Watching automated battles over and over is stupefying. There's no blood or guts to give some sort of visceral satisfaction. Story is old hat, its the same japanese anime crap you've seen and watched elsewhere. The main character Rush is annoying and uninteresting.You have absolutely no effect on the way the stroy unfolds, you basically fight your way through to the next story sequence.

												This game is far too difficult to be any fun.  The story and characters are all annoying cliches, but I would have been able to get over it because of the fantastic battle system.  Unfortunatley, that too was ruined for me by the unjustifiable difficulty of the battles.  I'm barely four hours in (I left the game running while paused, which is why my time reads more) and I've already faced two bosses--one side quest, one main--that I could not defeat even after over a dozen attempts.  With each all it took was a single critical hit to knock out my entire union, so each battle ends up just devolving into grinding away at them just praying on their turns that they don't crit.  There's no way around it.  The game is actually set up to punish you if you grind, so there is absolutely nothing you can do if you find yourself in this situation.  My only option at this point is to simply quit, which is infuriating given this game's potential.			"

												I literally started this game this month in hope of it being a very good J-RPG; o boy was I disappointed. To begin with, there are way too many characters within this game. The story itself is bland and forgetable, as it kind of reminds me of FF 13 in which the story actually started becoming good after playing 30 hours of it, I can easily say the same about The Last Remnant. In terms of there being way too many characters, I mean the issue with this is the fact the game only allows a total of 5 parties with a total of 5 members in each of those parties limiting you far too much.The battle system itself is very convoluted and never really explained. The player really has no access to what each party members do in each party. For example, the battle system tells the player that all of the party member will attack this specific enemy, either by physical damage, magical damage. Other times it lets you heal if necessary but those options are unpredicatable as when one of my party was very much injured, it would not give me the option to heal at all.What's kind of worse about the battles in The Last Remnant is the way that they are placed. Most of the battles are ridiculous. Sometimes you go into a new area, the enemies are sometimes very easy, and then suddenly you meet this gigantic bird/ dragon and they tear you a new one because for some odd reason the developers decided to put a rare monster into the game at that specific moment. Of course even though I only died once and the auto saves in this game is very well timed, the fact is that those rare monsters are really not rewarding at all.To keep this short, if you're thinking about buying this game, it's worth no more than 4 dollars. The problem isn't the graphics, because those are superb for a J-RPG on the PC, however the problem really has to do with the lack of story, terrible and convoluted battle system, lack of character development and in general, it really does not feel like a true J-RPG. I came into this game expecting more so something along the lines of FF 12 as my lowest expectation and my highest expectation as FF 6, but really it was nowhere near as good as even FF 12. I can truly just recommend this to players who really just want to understand the combat system by trying different things and such. However, for players who want a deep character developement, good easy to understand combat system and even easy loot system, then this is not a game for you.			"

												I've heard good and bad things about this game, and it was on sale for cheap so I decided to give it a whirl. It's a game that lives and dies by its battle system, which is what one does the most by far. The story is cliche and the CG segments are short and few in between. The graphics are aged by today's standards, which is fine, but the locations and dungeons are generic and uninspired.The choices in battle you can make are random, depending on your available skills, HP, and positioning. If you have a healer unit and the game doesn't allow you to heal, too bad. If you have a full AP bar waiting to unleash hell but the game doesn't allow you to, too bad. You cannot directly control unit positioning. If a boss is dropping AOEs all around himself, you cannot order units to hang back. Extremely unpredictable and frustrating. You can't even see the HP of a boss or miniboss. The game allows you to set formations to trade off advantages and disadvantages and these are essential for boss fights, but these take very long to set up and there is no way to save different formations.Game statistics are opaque and not explained properly. Every character has a 'unique' statistic like 'ego' but after so many years the game is out, AFAIK nobody knows what they do. You can only equip the main character directly. For the other 20 to 50 characters depending on how far you are into the game, you have to actually wait for them to ask to ""borrow"" a piece of equipment you already have. If they don't ask for it, you have to go out and beat up some monsters and see if they ask you again. Talk about being obtuse and beating around the bush.You cannot see a character's skill tree so you don't know what skills he/she is going to get, and you can only level up skills by using them, making the normal attack option mostly moot. Every now and then a character asks whether to learn a new skill or not, or to focus on physical or magical skills. You cannot postpone the decision. The game doesn't explain what the skill does or who the charcter is or what kind of stats he or she has, so it might as well ask the player to pick randomly. There is no quest board, so after every story event, you find yourself wandering all the towns, pubs, and guild areas just to pick up new quests. At least quests don't get offered in dungeons so you don't actually have to check those.Money is extremely difficult to come by, and I finished disc 1, I was wondering why the shops even bother to stock the stuff they have. You could grind money but that raises your battle rank which is essentially your level, and enemies scale up with your battle rank. Hence you find the characters who join you later on to be underpowered and generally useless. Since enemies level with you and you cannot gain gear advantage, progression feels very slow and stifled. Despite the game being entirely its battle system, its systems actually discourage you from fighting, until you hit a difficulty spike, look up a guide, and see that the recommended level is way above yours, so now it's time to actually level so you can get on with it.If you are looking for similar previous-gen RPGs, try Star Ocean III or Final Fantasy X instead. I'm an old-school RPG gamer, but the flaws above are designed on purpose and those are unforgivable for a game released in 2008. Not recommended.			"

												Not my cup of tea this one.Like most of Square Enix's games, The Last Remnant features a standard spiky hair teenager you'd see in a subpar anime or JRPG. STORY- Something about demons and his sister? These stories are all the same.GRAPHICS- Simulating big battles in the background is one thing The Last Remnant does very well.SOUNDTRACK- mehGAMEPLAY- I'm not even sure you can call it gameplay.   Pros-    The battles look huge and awesome later on   Multiple ways to set up squad composition   JRPG that discourages level grinding?   Complex combat system    Cons-   Complex combat system (Like myself, most players who start the game will have no idea how everything comes together in combat and leveling. I didn't realize grinding early was bad, considering all the people I tried to recruit afterwards sucked. High BR = Bad)   Yet you still need to do all the side quests just to prevent a wipe from a boss?   Whether you grind or not, it's still difficult   Takes a little bit to get multiple squads (So you can enjoy those big battles)   Individual actions for squad members cannot be selected. (Game revolves around tactical choices for each squad that determine what actions they will likely take. But, it's better than selecting 18 individual unit actions separately)CONCLUSION-This game is not for those looking for a traditional JRPG. Similar to the SaGa series, The Last Remnant has no character development or decent plot, and has a different combat and leveling system compared to oldies like Final Fantasy or Breath of Fire. If you've been fishing out SaGa games out of the trash like I have, you may enjoy this game. I however, enjoyed Unlimited SaGa more than this weird game.   "

												I like the story, I find it somewhat fun... but the combat is almost by chance there is no proper balancing you can't pick what you want to do in battle just have to pick a option. So if heal is not a option and you are about to die, well I just your dead. Also the enemies level up as you go making triva battles drag on and on as well as making some battles near impossible . I love a challenge , but this isn't a challenge this is frustration from a random chance that the right option will show up this time so I can win. If anything get it on sale you may like it			"

												With unique features like the control of 'units' (small groups of individuals) during battles, instead of a couple of separate individuals as in most RPGs, this game should be a lot better. It really has potential, and I want to like it, but certain elements make it more annoying than enjoyable.The first problem is the characters. Both in personality and speech, these characters are the exact opposite of the Final Fantasy games. Whereas recent FF games have gotten a bit unnecessarily overcomplicated, this game is dumbed down to the enth degree. The verbage and mentalities within the game are so simple that it's a bit painful to witness at times.To further compound this issue, the protagonist of the game, Rush Sykes, is very ""simple"", but it's a bit much. I tried to give him the benefit of the doubt because he is from a remote town away from the main cities (even though his parents are famous so he should've been home-schooled and therefore not an ignorant fool--but I digress). Rush is the normal, cliche, naive & independent character we've seen many times before. He thinks he can handle the world on his own. But to an excessive extent, worse than we've seen in any prior RPG... furthermore, his personality, which seems to be an attempt at humor, is much more often very obnoxious rather than funny. The game in general seems to be marketed more towards beginner players. Instead of walking around a city or in the field of the outside world, everything is controlled by a dot, as it is in Final Fantasy Tactics. I'm a bit mixed on this. On one hand, it's nice to cut past running through a huge city--which can sometimes take an hour on its own, (i.e. FF9)--to get to the meat of the game, but it also feels like it takes away from it a bit. More of a subjective feature. In the vein of simplicity, it's also easier because you can save at any time from the menu.The biggest issue might be the battle control, or lack thereof. As much as I enjoy it's uniqueness, the difficulty of this game is bi-polar. If you don't have a high enough level, going into a battle with the choices: a) Attack b) Stand-by is impossible because there's no way to manage the individual attacks of each character. Either choice you pick you will often wind up dead. If you have a high enough level, you just pick 'attack' each time and you win easily. The one positive of the battle system is the 'criticals' feature where you have to press a certain button fast enough to get a critical hit, which keeps you interested during the fighting.Finally, the voice-overs. Basically all the voice-overs in this game--at least so far as I've seen--are just terrible. They seem as if they had a tight budget for the game and couldn't get professionals for the English version. I'd be interested in seeing a totally reworked sequel, but as-is, it's just not my cup o' tea.5.8/10			"

												This game is a lot of fun, for a guy like me who grew up with a lot of RPGs this is a perfect match.I really liked the turn based combat, even if you can't choose what spells or abilities to use exactly, it's more like guiding them on what type of abilities to use. I never felt that I lost a battle due to it anyway.The story is alright, I had some doubts at first but as it developed a bit it drew me back in, and I'd say it's pretty decent. The game also have a pretty good soundtrack to listen to, especially later in the game.You can expect roughly around 100 hours of fun in this game if you complete most of the side quests, and even more if you decide to upgrade every weapon for your squads.A very fun and enjoyable game for turn based RPG fans.

												All in all, I found this to be a very good game. Good story and solid battle system. The idea of leveling up stats versus simply leveling up was an appealing quality to me. As well as the new abilities through attacking and powering them up by using them repeatedly. The story was solid and the voices were well done.The only problems I could find with this game were the glitches found in the game. There were a number of them, most notably the sound issue occurring at random intervals though mostly during cut scenes. As well battles became repetitive after a time and seemed to drag on at some points. Otherwise, quite an enjoyable game I would recommend to anyone :)  "

												Four hours into the game and I still had no idea what the hell was going on.I'll admit, it looks nice. There were just too many negatives that outweighed the time I could put into it:-Battles aren't as hard/tricky as people make them out to be. You just don't have COMPLETE control of all your characters so that's annoying.-The ""zones"". Let's take the first town for example. It has a handful of NPCs, then you gotta exit the street to a map view of the city, to go to the next part of the city. You can SEE the next part of the city from the first street but you need to exit to a world map to go to the next part of the town-The cutscenes. It's awkward. They talk-pause-walk-pause-talk. It's not exactly fluid. Despite the nice looking graphics, it's like I'm watching an RPG from the '90's.Maybe I'll pick it up again when my backlog is complete. There're better RPG's on Steam.			"

												This is hands down one of the best Square Enix games I have ever played and it's got a unique challenge to it.I'm used to their other turned based and tactic games, but this one puts one hell of a unique spin on those past play styles.Yes there are a lot of bad and recent reviews for this game and it's mostly by people who didn't have the patience to really play through the game or came to the PC straight from the consoles. It requires some basic strategy knowledge and a lot of patience. People keep saying there were bugs that they ran into, but I haven't ran into any of the bugs they have listed so far.The story so far is slow and it's not entirely obvious where you have to go unless you pay attention to the cutscenes and talk to the NPC's after they end.I totally recomend this if you want a unique spin on the classic Final Fantasy play styles.

One for JRPG fanatics only, I think. I do love certain genre titles, but The Last Remnant suffers from all of the aspects that make many Japanese console RPGs frustrating and difficult to enjoy. Whining young adults with impossible hair and ridiculous outfits, farcical melodrama and tedious, obtuse, and repetitive gameplay that forces the player to resort to systematic elimination in order to progress.

												Experimental battle system you don't have a lot of control over : as in FFXIII, you give general commands only (at least, FFXIII gave you the opportunity to select the skills you want to use, even if it's useless). This game was an obvious design blueprint for the awful FFXIII battle system. You are supposed to leads groups of warrior, positionning is sometimes key to victory or defeat and, guess what ? You have absolutely no control over it. NONE. So much for strategy. Battle QTEs are anecdotic (for crits), chara design is... meh, and the characters themselves BEG FOR YOU TO B****SLAP THEIR STUPID FACES. This game signs the demise of Square as a JRPG monument on the third generation of consoles. The story is... well, the standard jrpg story : symbolic princess is kidnapped, go for her, make friends, be betrayed from time to time, the ennemies are controled by something bigger than you are supposed to expect, then save the world from apocalypse.

												First:  It's a great port!  It's really well optimized; it runs great on my old living room PC.  Also, the game had a ""leader"" mechanic which was taken out, and which was apparently a good change.  Also, the PC port added a turbo option to make the fight scenes go faster, which is a really nice feature.The story is great too!  I'm only halfway through the game at the moment, and I do want to finish the game to see the end of the story.The major deal breaker for me right now is the tediousness of the game.  There's just so much filler, and the battle system isn't that interesting.  I'm stuck doing sidequests right now that will deactivate when I put in disc 2, and the real game is just SO FAR AWAY.EDIT:  The game also has a noticeable chunk of missable content.  There's two towns that are rather easy to overlook, and some collectibles you can permanently miss out on if you don't read the game's wiki.			"

Hope you like black bars because that's all Enix has for youThe controller thing is fixable with a dll that can be chucked into the games binaries folder that isn't hard to find if you need it but should still have been addressed by the devs when they made the thing.Overall I cannot reccomend giving Enix a cent for this when they can't be ♥♥♥♥ed putting in basic features like support for multiple aspect ratios or working controller support for a console port...Glad to say I didn't give a cent to them for it as I got it from humble and made sure devs got none of the cut just due to how they've acted towards pc in the past.

												One of the most underrated JRPGs ever. The battle system has a bit of a learning curve, but is actually pretty great once you get the hang of it. You actually have to think in every battle, since no matter how much you grind (or avoid leveling up), to the very end, you can lose your entire group in one turn in a battle against the weakest enemies in the game.For those who like to grind and search for hidden stuff, there are plenty of rare monsters to hunt, which can be extremely difficult to find and beat. There are sidequests, some of which are even missable. Some are decent, some are dull fetch quests. All in all, there's a pretty decent amount of content outside of the main quest.The main storyline is nothing to write home about, and is pretty predictable unless you're new to (J)RPGs, but it's not the worst I've ran into. Recommended to all turn-based rpg fans.			"

												Disclaimber: This review was written 11/09/2010The Last Remnant is about a kid who's sister become kidnapped and he ventures on a journey to save her. The game is mainly marketed of it's ""strategic"" combat system where you can flank, intercept and such while still being a ""faithful"" JRPG.When you start up the game you are greeted with awesome music and some really sweet battles and I love large battles. It gives me chills in all the Total War games, but this game is nothing like Total War. The graphics use the unreal engine are alright (when it gets going), although this game is especially slow on loading textures in relatively small areas, which will mean that you're going to watch a lot of low-res textures (this might be fixed by defraging the hard drive though). The art style is a joke. If you didn't like Final Fantasy IX for it's art style you're going to hate this game because it's inhabited by giant fish people, small rabbit-frogs and orcs... no wait, those are just guards. All especially bred to be as cartoony as possible. The main characters are ridiculously emo-looking, and I mean all the main characters, which is why this style needs to die, right now.The biggest problem with this game however is the combat system. It sucks♥♥♥♥♥because it has nothing to do with strategy. Since it uses turns you cannot in reality intercept someone because you never know who they're trying to go after. You ""flank"" your opponents by sending more than one unit towards them, if you're opponent is then fighting more than one squad in the same time you'll flank them and this is regardless of squad size so 1 squad vs 2 squads equals flank but the nice thing is that the squad can be surrounded and that happens when they're fighting over 3-4 enemies I believe. When the fighting starts it only looks like a giant brawl without any kind of structure, and since the game deals with relatively low numbers of units it wont look as epic as the brawls in the Total War series where they're mostly chaotic because here the characters take turns to hit each other. You get 3 squads in which you can have max 5 people in them it's kinda strange that they would even be able to flank someone and quite fitting it all turns into a brawl. Your performance of the battles are entirely luck based because you never really directly command your units in battle. If you want them to heal themselves you gotta wait until they're bleeding to death before the option is even available. I thought this didn't sound so bad before I bought the game but in practice it ruins the ""tactics element"" of it all, if you could call it that.So basically you can't flank your opponents if you don't outnumber them and you cannot directly control your squadmates. This is a game where the player doesn't have much control over and you would probably have better control when trying to win at ♥♥♥♥ing slot machines! The control you do have is where to send your squads, vague pointers on how they should fight and who goes in what squad. Oh and by the way, you don't get to choose their equipment either. Poof, now a RPG element are gone too.Do I even have to say more? The story mayhap? When you meet (what the ♥♥♥♥ his name was) you befriend him and the story turns over to him for a moment while he tries to make his vassal state independent from another vassal state. Yes, this game deals in Feudalism (kind of) and you get to follow his struggle for his state's independence for a little while. He promises you that he will find your sister in the process but it have to be done methodically. The story isn't half bad I think and it would be really interesting to follow up on if only the game actually let you control the battles. It becomes increasingly difficult to control the outcome of the battles and you would probably lose quite a few battles because you simply cannot control anything that's happening during the course of it.Decent story and graphics, poor characters and art style and a bad gameplay. If you could control the game it would be alright but a game that cannot interact with the player isn't worth spending many hours of frustration on. And don't even get me started on the giant learning curve, why is it so big? Because no one tells you squat and the game is so unorthodox in almost every way. There's a stat that is different for each character that seems more like a characteristic. It changes with levels but what does it do? No, this game is hopelessly bad, don't even try it.			"

You dont even use your brain to advance in game just watch and click the attack button and game decides the skills for you. I tried several hours and read guides. In the end I think you dont play this game , you just watching what game decides for you. game is just not for every turn based, jrpg players, thats my point.And the last remnant should be labeled as VISUAL NOVEL not rpg or turn based rpg.  If you love VISUAL NOVELs you will love this game with minimal intercation in combat.			"

												Ultimately, Last Remnant is an interesting game with a flawed execution. Unique and fun combat and theorycrafting opportunities are ruined by a complete lack of transparency in game mechanics and statistics.Worth a look, but if you find reading guides in order to understand leveling mechanics and character maximization odious you probably won't enjoy yourself.

												Don't let the metascore fool you. This game is meant to be played on the PC! Even if you have a low-end rig (Pentium D), this game will run surprisingly well. If you have a mid-line or high-end rig it'll play better then it does on the 360.Awesome story, one of the finest soundtracks ever composed for an RPG, smashing battle system... easy to learn, difficult to master. If you like RPGs you WANT this title.			"

												Recommended BUT....This game is an odd one.  It's a JRPG complete with animal people, teenaged leading character, and a fairly good story once it gets started but it's got a pretty strange combat system.  It supports mouse/keyboard though it could have supported them better.  It also has a tendency to hide pretty important information on how the game works but there's now an excellent Wikia website that will fill you in on all the details you care to learn.The combat system is really the make-or-break feature for this game, IMHO, and it's very different from anything I've ever played before or since.  It's turn based but you get to have a lot of characters in your party (up to 18 eventually) so telling each one of them exactly what to do would take way too long.  Instead, you divide your team into squads then give general orders to the squad along the lines of ""attack with melee"" and ""stand back and heal"" then the members of the squad use their abilities to carry out those orders.Not all the possible commands appear every round, though.  The game will pick out four or five of them depending on the situation, who the squad's leader is, and other factors.  That will drive some folks crazy but I found it to be a fun part of the game as it forced me to think about what I could still do even though I didn't get to do exactly what I wanted.  It's a bit like being dealt a hand of cards then figuring out what to do with them instead of picking out the best cards from the deck every time.You're definitely given a lot of choices in this game.  Simply picking the most expensive commands and attacking whatever is right in front of you with whatever squads you throw together will work OK for a few hours but you'll never make it through the whole game that way.  You're going to need to think about what characters should make up your squads, how many squads you should have, which characters should lead, which characters to hire, which monsters to attack (genocide is NOT the answer), how many to attack at once, whether to send all your squads after one enemy squad or to spread out more, and so on.  You certainly don't need to master every aspect of the game to complete it but you do need to get good at most of them.  (Unfortunately, the game doesn't have a difficulty setting.)Character skill progression is a learn-by-doing system.  If you want Nora casting Cachexia by the end of the game then you'll need to let her do some poison gas spells instead of pounding everything with her hammer.  Character weapons are a major part of progression, too, which are advanced by finding components for your characters to use.  (The Wikia site is extremely handy for that aspect of the game.  Why the developers thought you would actually remember where you found some necrotic metal or which type of critter dropped a mystic fiend horn I have no idea.)I see a lot of reviews are complaining about grinding... uhh, yeah, you can ignore those.  This is one of the few JRPGs that will actually PUNISH you if you try to exploit the game by grinding!  You see, most JRPGs have fixed monster levels while the characters that get added to your party as you find them automatically adjust to the player's level.  So some people will sit back in the early parts of the game fighting the same monsters over and over until they are so high level that nothing can stop them.  In this game, the characters you find are fixed level but several of the monsters scale to your party's level.  That means the same tactic in this game will result in hiring weak characters against enemies that only a few members in your party can really fight!That said, the game CAN turn grindy after you've gotten all the characters you want but it's completely optional.  The game can be completed just fine with no grinding at all.  You won't be able to finish some of the most difficult quests but you won't miss out on any of the story at all.			"

												Strongly underestimated game (by big yellow metacritic 66 happened on store page), which is must be ignored to find: Fantasy world filled with lots of side quests, guild tasks and 70% places with no chance to visit during the main story. So it has something to explore, like, for sure!Pretty unique inderectly controlled battles, based on behavior commands and mostly on who you have assigned together as a union.Variative ""team building"" pushing you to find more (interesting, well suiting in team or just charming) characters and choose favorite to form unions at your command. And from that moment they are taking the union formations you find and set, follow leaders you pick, and evolving in the way you prioritize.Massive amount of characters, simply hiding behind side quests or a chain of events in classical jrpg style (makes feeling familiar with Suikoden back in the days).Antagonists script filled with meaning, intrigues and colorful scenes for you to encounter and discover.Must tell you the Cons, though...:Game is hiding a little bit to much. It is nice to discover something new on the Third playthrough, but it wasn't be criminal if developers discribe game mechanics deeper, so developing Combat or Mystic Arts do not feel that random on First playthrough.Main storyline... it exist, but it's bellow average for too many reasons. Many scenes feels typical with several character poor acting or looking outside their role.			"

												Let me just say off the bat, the story in this game is garbage.There are some great NPCs that make it bearable, but as it stands, the game's plot and narrative are not that good.Having said that, everything else in this game is incredible.The combat is simply amazing, at first things may appear to be random, but most of the work comes from you building a working party.Your party consists of unions, and your attacks in the battle are determined by who's in that union and what skills they possess.For instance, if you want a union to have the chance to cast mystic arts, you'd use predominantly mystic art users in that union.You can also turn off characters skills, giving you another level of depth to play with.Aesthetically the game is gorgeous, plenty of effects in battle and clean texture work, it's also runs pretty well on lower end PCs.When it comes to audio, this game is damn near perfect.The voice acting is surprisingly well done, save for the main character, but everything else is top notch.The real star of the game though is easily the soundtrack, there is nothing wrong with it, and the quality is probably the best I've seen this generation.In the end, if you can look past the story being so stale, then you have one of the most unique games on the market right now.I thank god Square Enix decided to port this game, it was decent on the consoles, but it really shines on PC.

												This JRPG is something I consider and underrated gem. Story 6/10The story is generic but not too generic to the point where it's unplayable. It has its moments but is dragged down by its predictability. There is a decent plot twist at the end but it doesn't help rate it any higher. Stories of unique mercenaries you hire are told through their conversations and related missions. Most of them do have an interesting background (Nora, Violet, etc.). But they could have expanded more on their stories which was dissapointing to say the least.Gameplay 8.5/10The heart of the game is in the gameplay. You can have up to 18 units in your team, split into a maximum of 5 groups called unions. Each character can learn various skills (with Rush being the only one that can learn every move except for Weapon Specific Arts) and their usage of skills gives them roles the field. However, you can only manually equip Rush with whatever he is able to hold.The others upgrade and request either weapons or components on their own (what they request is based on your Battle Rank and what path you chose for them) The combat system itself is turn based strategy. You have to be smart about what abilities you keep on and what commands you choose. You do not specifically choose what they will do in that turn but you can influence their decisions based on their path and what skills you keep on or off. The combat is very deep and doing a full in-depth review of it would take too long. Try the demo to see if it is your taste. HOWEVER, I must say that looking at various guides (especially the wiki for the game) is very useful in order to understand the stat gain system and its relationship to the Battle Rank system. You may be familiar with the stat gain system if you have played any of the SaGa RPGs (which makes sense because the developer also worked on the SaGa games as well)Graphics 7/10It is the Unrea Engine so the moves look pretty when they're the flashy moves. Sadly, it is also Square Enix's first attempt using the Unreal Engine so there are many texture pop-in issues (but they recover in a few seconds). The environments without Remnants are relatively bland compared to the areas where Remnants are visible. Music 9/10The music is great for each scenario. The fights in open areas is very energetic, the fights in closed areas have a feeling of suspense. The music also changes during fights to match the current morale of the team. If it is low, then the music becomes darker, if the morale is high, it makes you feel like kicking♥♥♥♥♥Overall, I give it an 8/10			"

But all in all if you like JRPG this game can be fun with over 20 hours of Dungeon crawling, monsters aggro dodging, and turn-based gameplay. Storywise, not so much.

All in all, a solid RPG that stands on its own without needing to be tied to the Final Fantasy name.			"

It may just be me saying this since I started with the Xbox360 version before this one, but either way the battles are tactical and interesting.... Oh, the story is meh.

												Fantastic game, loved it on Xbox and on PC even more. Like the Saga games, the mechanics are unique and poorly explained or not at all, and considerably more complex than a standard JRPG like Final Fantasy or Tales. But once you get to grips with it all, it's SO satisfying.It provides a sigificant challenge, in fact, if you don't understand the mechanics and play it like many people tend to play a regular JRPG  - i.e. lots of grinding - then it can become much more difficult, possibly overwhelmingly so. Essentially this is an ANTI-grind JRPG, but actually you can grind if you wish, you just have to do it in the right way. Thankfully there are a number of experienced and helpful players and a comprehensive wiki, so if you're prepared to spend the time to learn, then you'll discover one of the most satisfying JRPG's i've ever played. Story; the usual JRPG nonsense. The main characters aren't particularly interesting, but they aren't annoying either, a feat many JRPG's can't manage. But there's a huge roster of support characters some of whom are endearing and memorable.Gameplay - 9 out of 10Story - 6Visual design - 8Music - 8 1/2			"

												I went into this game like almost every game I play not knowing what to expect.  Holy♥♥♥♥♥♥I found a diamond in the rough.  Let me be brutally honest, the story isn't what makes this game.  However, it doesn't break it either.  I grew up with Final Fantasy so I saw this game and realized ""Aw shhit dawg, is this a final fantasy spin off like Bravely Default?"" Hell naw THIS IS BETTER.  The combat is just tactical warfare and is something new to the JRPG genre.  There are many side quests (which is what you'll be doing more then half the time) to find unique leaders to add to your roster.  Each leader is as stated, unique.  Spells, abilities, etc.  They all have voice actors and back story (kindof) and obviously interactive quest.  If you haven't played this and are big on Final Fantasy, I assure you, you will not regret buying this.Final Verdict - 7/10The game is technically endless.  However it has a boring story.  The combat is a 10/10 entertaining to watch in my opinion aswell.  Buy half off tho cause you might not like this game, as its not for everyone.			"

												I've actually got over 60 hours in this game but almost all of it has been played in offline mode.The downsides have already been pointed out by numerous people, but even so it can be a fun game as long as you don't go into it expecting to be able to do much besides the main story without extensive use of the wiki or walkthroughs as many sidequests have very specific, odd, or just plain ""wtf"" level triggers like having to find the right NPC as well as the actual quest trigger not always happening when you do talk to the NPC.This is most notable with recruitable characters. Many of them have a series of conversations and sometimes a quest to gain a stat boost for them, but if you aren't using a guide you'll probably never get any of them because the conversations very rarely show up unless you spend an inordinate amount of time entering a town, checking the character, then exiting the town and re entering to see if the next conversation trigger has shown up.Unlike most RPGs, extensive grinding will only hurt you in the long run because the rare monsters and many sidequest bosses ""level up"" as your battle rank increases, so the fights only get harder as you get stronger instead of easier like you'd expect. This is honestly a TERRIBLE design choice and I can't understand what the devs were thinking when they made the game this way.To compound this you can't give individual orders to your characters, you just throw them into groups and during fights each group has a few different options each turn which may or may not even be what you want. Have a group that's close to dying? They may not even have a ""heal yourself"" or ""defend"" option show up. Other groups will sometimes have a ""heal them"" option pop up but will rarely take their action in time to save a group with low HP and will end up wasting their turn.I could go on but I won't, because honestly I don't think it's worth it since there are many other reviews that explain the game's faults in detail. But I will say this, if you do decide to get this game then I HIGHLY suggest downloading the trainer for it, you'll probably need it to lower your BR if you end up fighting too many enemies and overlevel.

Story is honestly really boring.If you like Final Fantasy for the story, this game will be pretty disappointing for the most part.All that being said, I like this game. I think it takes a lot of time to learn but I enjoy it. Still haven't beaten it (even with 67 hours). By far my favorite part is building up mini platoons and getting attached to your teams.

												A surprisingly long and good RPG. After hearing so much about how the wiki is needed for this game, I found that while not actually necessary it's an enormous help and does help explain some unclear game concepts.I was unsure about the way battles work out, but after playing through a few found that they are really well done and fun to do. Even though they can take a while to get through, they didnt feel as much a chore as in most jRPGs I've played.The story is nothing really special, but the gameplay more than makes up for it to me. The only real complaint I have with the game is the poor dialogue, but I've come to expect that from jRPGs, so I managed to laugh through most cutscenes.Overall a very good game. 8/10.			"

												--- Controller Required ---I imagine this was one of the tags that Steam refused to let people put on games. After all, if you're selling games to people who don't have the hardware to play it, that's just fine. It's not like it should be mentioned in the system requirements or anything.If it is configured to run from the keyboard, they sure did nothing to make that clear.There's not even a mouse pointer!I know the PC is the Master Race, but why was it so neglected for so long?I hope the new underpowered game consoles will lead to the PC being the main platform everything's designed for again.Oh, I forgot. Corporations decided to start giving away smart phones and tablets.You know what? Nobody would buy any of that ♥♥♥♥ if they had to do it out of pocket!Hell, it boggles the mind people will buy consoles these days. About the only advantage consoles have over PC's is the lack of physical hardware configuration variability. And even then, they can solve that by working with a certain personal computer manufacturer!Mebbe if the console market starts forcing you to buy new consoles every coupla' years ...""Controller Required"" needs to be a tag on video games. That's all there is to it.The only good thing about this is I didn't pay bunches for it. The bad thing about it, though, is I doubt I actually got any game I'd actually play now.The interesting games, like this one, are ♥♥♥♥♥♥ ports. So ♥♥♥♥♥♥ it's giving me controller instructions in the tutorial!Seriously. What the ♥♥♥♥ is wrong with these people!?			"

												Three points to sell this game: 1) The cost is pretty decent, and there's a lot to do in this game (by my definition anyway), so if you can get into it you probably won't be disappointed.2) It has a neat battle system that isn't the most accommadating, but despite that it feels....I can't quite explain, just fulfilling, plus it has an option to turn on/off these reaction comand type things in battle (I've kept them on just because), so hey, the option is nice. And being a Square game there'll be some moments where you might want to grind, but with the rare monsters you can find here and there it isn't too time consuming. 3) To me, the story feels kind of campy. No real explanation why, but I like it regardless. I love the character design of the races, enemies in this game are intimidating as frick, and the main Bosses get freaking awesome and stupid. It's a round package of everything you love and hate about Square games, so odds are you'll get into a love Triangle with various aspects of the game, if you're a fan of light strategy RPGs and Square bs.

												It seems that SquareEnix tries to re-live the thriumph of its golden era but not so succesfully i suppose. Here is The Last Remnant a jrpg with turn based battles that feature some RTS elements. More in depth we have:GAMEPLAY: In TLR you get to control a youth named Rush. You venture in 3D invironments in towns and dungeons while the city and wolrd maps are simple images (kinda .. ""Naaaaahh"" to me). The enemies are visible on the screen and you can ambush them avoid them or get ambushed (you dont wanna do that). Well here comes the sad part! The battle system thought it seems quite promising it ends to be very boring one sided and soooo automated! Well its seems like the developers would like to make it extremely simple yet strangely difficult to win a battle. What do i mean? Here is the thing. When you enter the battle there is no option of escape!! The player has to choose between some automated commands like ""attack"", or ""back em up"" or ""attack with combat arts"". Seriously? All you have to be careful about is not to get flanked (amonst enemies) and all is great! i mean come on?! what happened to equipping magic or using items manually and stuff like that!? Many will say that TLR differs cos it is more like strategy when it comes to the battle part but i disagree! Even if it is that way its quite noobish! Unfortunately gameplay isnt its strong part!PLOT:The plot is quite classic yet very enjoyable with the classic fantasy world and its kingdoms. In the first intro we see Rush rushing into a battlefield while he searches for his freshly kidnapped sister! i wont do any more spoilers. Play it yourselves!MUSIC:The music part is one of its strong points i guess where its plave has its own music. It is very pompous and magnificent at parts and get you quite well in the moodGRAPHICS:Graphics are wuite detailed and ""clean"" with lots of colors and drawn and designed with creativity and talent! The only thing is that sometimes it gives me the impression that there is so much symmetry especially in towns! OVERALL:In general terms TLR is a game worthy of your time and money that every jrpg games must at least once experience!			"

												Before I start this review, I'd like to note that I had absolutely no idea that this game existed prior to blindly purchasing it over the Steam Summer Sale. With that said, I'll begin.The Last Remnant is certainly a unique Square Enix RPG. As opposed to following the formulaic ""3-4 party members in an HP and MP driven turn based battle"" system, this game tries to implement an original and somewhat unique battle system. The basic elements of a Square Enix RPG are there, but the new features in battle are also very important factors. These new features, however, can be very confusing and overwhelming upon first playing. The battle system still functions, though, and it's enjoyability boils down to the player's understanding of it. The writing is as you'd expect from a Square RPG: Over the top, and very anime esque. This causes the writing on some characters (Most notably, the protagonist) to be very cliche and predictable at times. The graphics are somewhat primitive, but aren't distracting in any way. From what I've heard, the soundtrack ranges from being stale and bland, to awe inspiring. It's really an open bag. My biggest complaint with the game is that it anticipates that the player uses an Xbox 360 controller. So much so, that the tutorial commands use 360 button inputs. However, this can be remedied with a very brief visit to the main screen settings menu. Overall, The Last Remnant is a game that I would recommend. I realize that I've been somewhat down on it in this review, but it really is not a bad game by any stretch of the imagination. If you're a fan of JRPG's and Square Enix, this is a game for you.			"

												It has some big flaws, like the fact that most of the characters' skill development can't be fully controlled, and how the game reacts to ""leveling up"" your party (for example, the fact that enemies' strength scale with your level, whilst the initial stats for optional characters don't, which implies that if you get them too late, they are worthless). Also it's pretty easy to ruin your characters by making some wrong decisions, making them more or less useless.Being unable to totally control which action everyone's going to execute adds some difficulty, which is good. The game has a really good atmosphere as well, and it managed to remind me much of the golden era of JRPGs. The battle system and formation setup are both fun to think of and relevant. They aren't just features to make the game seem complex and fancy.			"

												Hobbled on its initial X360 release by dreadful optimisation of the Unreal 3 engine, this PC port of The Last Remnant rights all of its console counterpart's wrongs and lets us actually see the shape of the game underneath.Which is, for my money, one of the most interesting JRPG titles Square Enix have published in some time. The combat is billed as an RPG/tactics hybrid but it's really more like real-time JRPG combat with a deck-building element. It's something like a more expansive version of Final Fantasy XII's combat, where you control a single party leader while several AI companions make executive decisions based on the orders you issue them. The difference here is that combat has both a 'micro' and a 'macro' component, where both you and the enemy are split up into several parties at once who move about a larger battlefield in turns and mostly engage other parties one-on-one. However, it's also possible to intercept enemy parties (or be intercepted) and to stack multiple parties against one opponent.It's not the most complex thing going, but it's one of SE's best attempts at marrying traditional JRPG encounter design to real-time combat, far more successful than something like Final Fantasy XIII.The story and characters are compiled out of mostly-familiar elements, but being freed from the constraints of Final Fantasy formula means that it feels a good deal less creatively exhausted than some of the lesser recent FF titles. As the game progresses you get given far more freedom to recruit more and different soldiers, edit party formations and tactics and generally shape the game's combat. The PC version also has Japanese audio available amongst other reasonably comprehensive config settings.			"

Many of them have a series of conversations and sometimes a quest to gain a stat boost for them, but if you aren't using a guide you'll probably never get any of them because the conversations very rarely show up unless you spend an inordinate amount of time entering a town, checking the character, then exiting the town and re entering to see if the next conversation trigger has shown up.Unlike most RPGs, extensive grinding will only hurt you in the long run because the rare monsters and many sidequest bosses ""level up"" as your battle rank increases, so the fights only get harder as you get stronger instead of easier like you'd expect. This is honestly a TERRIBLE design choice and I can't understand what the devs were thinking when they made the game this way.To compound this you can't give individual orders to your characters, you just throw them into groups and during fights each group has a few different options each turn which may or may not even be what you want. Have a group that's close to dying? They may not even have a ""heal yourself"" or ""defend"" option show up. Other groups will sometimes have a ""heal them"" option pop up but will rarely take their action in time to save a group with low HP and will end up wasting their turn.I could go on but I won't, because honestly I don't think it's worth it since there are many other reviews that explain the game's faults in detail. But I will say this, if you do decide to get this game then I HIGHLY suggest downloading the trainer for it, you'll probably need it to lower your BR if you end up fighting too many enemies and overlevel.

												--- Controller Required ---I imagine this was one of the tags that Steam refused to let people put on games. After all, if you're selling games to people who don't have the hardware to play it, that's just fine. It's not like it should be mentioned in the system requirements or anything.If it is configured to run from the keyboard, they sure did nothing to make that clear.There's not even a mouse pointer!I know the PC is the Master Race, but why was it so neglected for so long?I hope the new underpowered game consoles will lead to the PC being the main platform everything's designed for again.Oh, I forgot. Corporations decided to start giving away smart phones and tablets.You know what? Nobody would buy any of that ♥♥♥♥ if they had to do it out of pocket!Hell, it boggles the mind people will buy consoles these days. About the only advantage consoles have over PC's is the lack of physical hardware configuration variability. And even then, they can solve that by working with a certain personal computer manufacturer!Mebbe if the console market starts forcing you to buy new consoles every coupla' years ...""Controller Required"" needs to be a tag on video games. That's all there is to it.The only good thing about this is I didn't pay bunches for it. The bad thing about it, though, is I doubt I actually got any game I'd actually play now.The interesting games, like this one, are ♥♥♥♥♥♥ ports. So ♥♥♥♥♥♥ it's giving me controller instructions in the tutorial!Seriously. What the ♥♥♥♥ is wrong with these people!?			"

												Game is sometimes frustrating and maybe even a little unfair. Voice acting is pretty par. Story is honestly really boring.If you like Final Fantasy for the story, this game will be pretty disappointing for the most part.All that being said, I like this game. I think it takes a lot of time to learn but I enjoy it. Still haven't beaten it (even with 67 hours). By far my favorite part is building up mini platoons and getting attached to your teams. If I didn't adore my characters and squadrons, I would probably not play this game. "

												While it might feel odd at first, The Last Remnant provides an interesting twist on Macro-RPG combat mixing the ease of macro-combat, and the complexities of traditional JRPG character growth. The story is decent and combat is refreshing. Performance on the PC is absolutely stellar with neat little tweaks you can make to improve it's fidelity even further.The Last Remnant feels like a larger version of Final Fantasy Tactics (the one for the PSX, not the GBA), and helps reinforce the need for careful consideration of chararacter growth and equipment helps to make this little gem a ""grown up"" spiritual successor.

												The Last Remnant.One of the most underatted games of all time, and one of my favorite rpg's ever.Originally released on Xbox 360 to mediocre reviews, yet if you played through theterrible frame rate and texture issues then a true gem was waiting.On the PC version you can enjoy the game with most of the technical issues resolved.The battle system in this game is simply amazing, if you truly get into the game and facesome of the later bosses the wealth of depth and tactical choice is awesome. The fighs are turn based but instaed of controlling individual characters you control differentsquads consisting of numerous soldiers recrutted on your journey. As the game progressesthe squad limit rises with your level (Battle Rank) which means battles get bigger and betterthe further you get. This leads to some epic, amazing and huge encounters.The progression, story and side quests all fit into one of square enix's darker tales. While thestory isn't the greatest I've experienced in  a JRPG it's still very good. I love the lore and historyof the game world. If you want to do all of the side quests there is well over 100 hrs of gameplay(I must have at least 500 hrs on Xbox). It starts slow but stay with it.To put into perspective how highly I rate this game here is my top 5 JRPG's (in no order 'top 5' was hard enough)The Last RemnantDagon Quest - The Journey of the Cursed King (say no more)Final Fantasy XII (yes 12, a masterpiece and way ahead of it's time in my humble opinion)Grandia (my word what a game)Persona 4 (sweeeeeet)As you can see it joins some pretty good games on that list.Word of advise if you are just starting the game- grind for an hour or so early on or the first true boss willown you.Thanks for reading.

												Hobbled on its initial X360 release by dreadful optimisation of the Unreal 3 engine, this PC port of The Last Remnant rights all of its console counterpart's wrongs and lets us actually see the shape of the game underneath.Which is, for my money, one of the most interesting JRPG titles Square Enix have published in some time. The combat is billed as an RPG/tactics hybrid but it's really more like real-time JRPG combat with a deck-building element. It's something like a more expansive version of Final Fantasy XII's combat, where you control a single party leader while several AI companions make executive decisions based on the orders you issue them. The difference here is that combat has both a 'micro' and a 'macro' component, where both you and the enemy are split up into several parties at once who move about a larger battlefield in turns and mostly engage other parties one-on-one. However, it's also possible to intercept enemy parties (or be intercepted) and to stack multiple parties against one opponent.It's not the most complex thing going, but it's one of SE's best attempts at marrying traditional JRPG encounter design to real-time combat, far more successful than something like Final Fantasy XIII.The story and characters are compiled out of mostly-familiar elements, but being freed from the constraints of Final Fantasy formula means that it feels a good deal less creatively exhausted than some of the lesser recent FF titles. As the game progresses you get given far more freedom to recruit more and different soldiers, edit party formations and tactics and generally shape the game's combat. The PC version also has Japanese audio available amongst other reasonably comprehensive config settings.			"

												A highly underrated game.  Not sure how it escaped me for so long, but I'm glad I found it.  Familiar Square-Enix combat of the day but with enough twists to make it new and exciting.  Some people say the story is slow to get going, but I have rather enjoied it so far.   The main character is a little quirky and the voice acting isn't the best, but hey, it's from 2009 so you can't really judge it by today's standards. It's $2.50 at the moment, so you cannot go wrong.			"

The battle system is very unique and strategically rewarding... but it takes a while to understand beyond push button, read damage.The graphics are better than the 360 version... but there's still a noticable pop in on textures, and the cutscenes have a tendancy to tear on high resolution.The character banter is hilarious and amusing... in that ""so bad it's good if you don't take it that seriously"" way.Picked it up for I think $4... probably worth about $10 if you like JRPG's (and that's EXACTLY what this is...).

												I wanted to like this game, but it's too obtuse to play and have fun with respect to the combat system.  You need a spreadsheet to do the combat correctly, and simply grinding to attempt to become powerful will backfire and you'll be unable to effectivley fight, because you'll have made the monsters too powerful.Unlike every other JRPG in existance, grinding normally will cause you to have a failed-beyond-repair playthrough, rather than an easier time.The formation and union system is difficult to understand, and it's not the good kind of difficult, it's just aggrivating.  The game punishes you just for trying to play it and not sweat all the details it doesn't explain, but offers no remedy for this other than starting a new game.If you have a masochistic strain of autism I'm sure you'd love this game, but if you just want to have fun with a modern JRPG, this isn't the game for you.It's a shame they created a game which requires a walkthrough and multiple guides for the various subsystems it doesn't explain to any useful depth, because this game had a lot of potential.

												This is a really good game and the combat is well thought out. 66 from metascore is an understatement and this should be getting 75 or 80, so do not let that put you off. It would be good if I had friends playing online w/ me, as it is much more fun. At £3.19 (approx $4.50-$5 - not sure) this is a brilliant priced title. This is basically Square Enix's attempt at a RPG that isn't Final Fantasy XIV, and it has payed off to experiment a bit. I play Nintendo and I like FF and RPG's a lot, and this is one fit for any kind of fan. This is a good game, if you do not want to buy Final Fantasy XIV on steam for £20.00 or FF XII or XIII (which are both 15 years old). Note: the tutorials for the controls (they pop up anytime something new happens) are for Xbox 360 controllers. If you are playing with a keyboard and mouse, look up the controls elsewhere.			"

												AMD users beware strannge shadow effects.This is one of the most underrated JRPGs of all time almost entirely due to the obtuse combat system that injects some random variation amidst its tactics. But if you can look past that, The Last Remnant is one of Square Enix's best titles, incorporating the crafting and scavenging mechanics straight from Monster Hunter, a typical but engaging story with genuine character relationships that never try to oversell it to the audience, a protagonist whose motives are more quaint than ""saving the world"" and who is as genuinely likeable as he is out of place in a monarchist society, and the single greatest soundtrack ever composed next to Chaos Rings (that alone should be reason enough to buy it). The level up progression is visuably noticable in battle, with low level spells greatly increasing in ""oomph"" and flair with each upgrade, and the battle chatter really sells the vividity of each battle, especially during huge, multi-squad combat.Highly recommended.

												I personally did not enjoy The Last Remnant very much, but for $10, it is still a lot of bang for your buck.  The combat was a little unwieldy, and the movement was jerky.  I found the controller support rather nice, though!  And that music is just beautiful.  I love the sound effects, as well.  Everything audio-related is nice except the pauses between voice-overs and the lack of lip sync.If you are already a fan of similar games, this may be a nice bargain bin game for you.  If you liked .Hack//Infection, you will probably like how Last Remnant feels similar in regard to shops and the exploration of sectioned-off maps.  If you liked The Legend Of Dragoon, the battle system in The Last Remnant is similar though a lot more simplified and not quite as fun in my opinion.  The movement between sections of the world requires use of a boring map menu system that ruins the immersion and ruins any chance of the game offering exploratory experiences.Again, the game offers a lot of content and is a good buy if you want a time-waster, but keep your expectations low in regards to movement, dialogue, story, and looting.

												This... this game is so... EPIC. The charcaters and story are prety welldone IMO. The combat can get hard sometimes or just outright impossible to win depending on how you play, but i enjoyed it alot. The music is awesome. If you like turn-based games or a fan of FF games then i highly recommend this for you. 10/10			"

												This game. I'm still very new but this game has sucked me in, its a fun turn based along the lines of FF but in this game your party is split into units of 5 that take there turn together so the battles feel huge compared others of the same style. The graphics are obviously a bit outdated seeing as how its a 2009 release but I think it's still a great looking game with some Beautiful towns/citys. From the looks of it there are many, many things to be discovered and at the time of this review the game is $4.00, thats nothing for a game of this caliber. I think this game was originally an x-box release (due to the X-box prompts being default) but they did a great job on the PC version an example being that more then 1 button is linked to the main options (unlike some AAA Ports) you can use left mouse, spacebar, or enter as ""A button"" and backspace, Esc, or right click as ""B button"" Honestly my favorite part so I dont have to remember silly key bindings :DSo in all I have to give The Last Remnant a 9/10 and only because the camera can make me feel a little motion sick sometimes haha (But at-least you can control the camera!)

It's there to act as an obstacle between you and the plot. But in the Last Remnant, there is nothing worthwhile beyond the obstacle.			"

												October 11, 2016: Completely Revised Review. The first review failed to acknowledge the positives of The Last Remnant and rambled on the negatives far too much.(Note: I have already beat the game on normal and hard mode without cheats/changes to the game engine. Further playthroughs were altered for convienence and fun.) Upon entering the world of The Last Remnant, I came across an incredibly intriguing game. There was an entire fantasy world and multiple systems to uncover and understand. The beautiful world and atmosphere of TLR had captivated me; however, the game was marred by a complete lack of information for mechanics, a multitude of unpolished gameplay systems, and a shallow combat system that ruined the experience and credibility of the game. Even despite the flaws, The Last Remnant had succesfully conveyed a myriad of small details that made the game feel exhilarating. The crisp and powerful sound design bolsters the strike of a weapon and the destruction from a casted ability; my ears became addicted to it all while my eyes were graced by the gigantic damage numbers dished out by my units. Even more so, the OST of this game is absolutely superb. From the tranquil melody of Echoes of the Past to the heart-pumping Press to Victory, the composers from Square Enix demonstrate their mastery over music. As someone who is fond of fantasy armor and design, TLR has also solidly designed a memorable cast of characters. Regardless of any cliches or annoyance that comes from them, there's no doubt that they're distinct and recognizable from their cheesy one-liners to their small yet endearing personalities and backstories. Despite all these wonderful aspects about the game, I am pained to say that the gameplay has nullified the many positives I have for TLR. The combat is riddled with RNG, from choosing my commands, to the outcome of a skirmish, and even to my ultimate abilities, most of one's ability to strategize becomes reduced to constant dice rolls and enemy attacks that do absurdly little damage or completely wipe out a union. There is also no median of difficulty to be had in TLR either. It's either a dull cake-walk or a frustratingly difficult and cheap end-game playthrough.Even worse, many systems in the game feel overlooked and unrefined, such as commerce points, combat, exploration, customization, guild quests, and crafting. Ultimately, It is disappointing to say that this game is just a wasted potential. There's no doubt that it is an amazing foundation and base for a potentially grand RPG like no other, but it just falls short tremendously.To conclude, The Last Remnant is my guilty pleasure since it has accomplished visual and audio designs to near perfection, (especially for 2009!) but in the end, I'm just playing a beautiful board game with a tremendous waste of potential.

												The Last Remnant is a game of questionable ideas and fantastic gameplay. The plot is decent, the writing is horrendous and the main character is an idiot with retard strength. But if you can get past the story portions of the game, the game will reward you greatly for your time. I'm not even past the Disc 1 portion of the game and already sunk 25 hours while doing the side quests and searching for the rare monster fights, it is just that satisfying to run around and explore.The game relies heavily on explorating and grinding monsters for stuff. You cannot directly control what your team mates equip, but you can control what skills they use and if you get the resources they want, they will upgrade their own gear. You assemble your team in groups that attack together at the same time against other groups and give loose orders on what they do. Because of that, it is highly encouraged you disable skills you don't want your units to randomly choose.The grinding of monsters can get tedious, to the point where I would skip monsters to finish quests faster. The good news is you can save anywhere, anytime outside of battle, and even autosave after fights in case you forget. That alone makes the grinding bearable since you can take breaks without needing to skip monsters if you want to loot the area clean.Besides the story I previously mentioned, the biggest downfall to this game is they do not at all describe what the stats do in the game. If you get gear that gives +1 to sword, there is nowhere in the game that tells you how big of a boost you can get. Thankfully, people datamined the game code and found out the exact stats, so you can utilize that in the wiki website for The Last Remnant. Makes the game at least have some sort of sense. It plays like Saga Frontier (also made by SquareSoft) in that way where all you need to know is high stats are good, right? Maybe? Perhaps?If you want to play a tactical turn based RPG you can play for a long time, I recommend this one quite a bit. I got it on sale for $3 and was worth the price so far. I reckon it'll be another 50 hours before I beat the game. That be a lot of messing around, I tell ya what.			"

												I've heard a lot of good about this game and it was alright up until now. This game feels impossible to beat and I'm not far into the game at all. I'm at a battle where 1 of my 2 groups die in the first turn every time. The other groups only option is to heal and attack because it makes sense. One heals to full health, the other attacks to do something productive(don't want 2 heals when the first gives you full health, right?). This works for 2-3 turns but I always end up dying. Perhaps I could grind it and hope I get a really lucky streak of receiving low damage or something but come on, that's bad game design.			"

												The Last Remnant introduce you to many unique systems when it comes to combat, party management , crafting & loot. Non of them and I mean NON works right. At the beginning everything seems okay and understandable but at the moment you get in with the rhythm of the game, it leaves you alone without even explaining any necessary part of any RPG game like crafting for example. And you say to yourself: OK I'll get hold of it the more I play. But you wont. The game will be more complex and you'll feel lost. Sure you'll keep pushing forward finishing a quest after quest but you feel that there is something that you don't quiet get. When I found myself in this position I decided to read some guides in order to understand what I'm doing wrong. And then it was easy to realize that even the people who made those guides (that are mostly helpful) does not understand many sections of the game.Take me for an example. I'm 50 hours into the game. I haven't bought anything from any merchant. I haven't crafted a single item even though that I have tons of components. I don't know what does a characters class means. I don't know half of the stats that my characters have like love, luck or courage because there is no way to monitor them. The game is vague about everything it has and it is not willing to show you anything so you have to treat it like Dwarf Fortress and go and read pages after pages of info that the game should have taught you at early hours of gameplay (if it was a good game).Let me tell you about level design. If you are exploring one of it's small and peaceful towns or a natural place then it's okay. But the most parts you will be running through castles, caves & temples that are designed like a really boring and empty mazes. I was once into a castle to do a side quest. I miraculously managed to find my way to my target without a map with everything explored except for a small hallway near the end of the level (you always find the map in a chest somewhere). So after I reached my destination and finished the side quest the game automatically takes me out of the place back to where I started it. Then I got curious maybe I'll find something useful at the hallway that I did not explore. So I decided to get back to the castle battle the stupid respawned enemies and waste half an hour just so that I find a map of the place that I have no business in no more! This is how stupid the level design is in this game.One of many pointless ant totally worthless side quests was a guy telling me that he lost something and this ""Something"" has been broken into six parts and I have to search for those parts and bring it back to him! even a 6 years old would have the imagination to make a better side quests than these.I could spend all night writing about every single bad thing about this game from it's uninteresting pokemon-like companion (which is called mister diggs - lack of imagination again) to it's bad looking enemies with their repetitive moves to it's boring and disgusting grinding and leveling up system.I could tell you about everything that I encountered and diminished my enjoyment of the game. But I guess that is enough. You can still give it a try because it's cheap but I don't recommend doing it.			"

												The Last Remnant got an awfully bad rap from the critics, but that's only because most critics never played the updated, polished PC version which removes much of the Xbox version's annoyances (and because most critics are pompous ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s who evaluate a game based on all criteria except 'is it fun to play'). The Last Remnant is a jRPG which deviates from the traditional Square Enix style, in that your characters are grouped into unions, who basically do what they want and only obey general guidelines you, as the player, give them. The Xbox version suffered from several flaws, (choppy graphics, inability to recruit more than a handful of Leaders, and inbalanced level scaling), but the PC version fixes all that. In jRPG tradition, there's some annoying voices and narrative head-scratchers, but it is a game well-worth picking up!			"

												This game is falsely categorized, it lets you role play as one character with linear plot.... that’s an adventure not an RPG. Combat itself in the game is terrible, you choose from a set of skills that you know almost nothing about. As for the game explaining things, it will have tutorial pop-ups every time it invents a new phrase for the game to let you know how the battle is going, it doesn’t however explain how chests work and whether you can receive all the loot or only one. It doesn’t let you know how strong an enemy is till you fight it. There are uncommon monsters that if you fight them and die that monster then you can never encounter that monster again. (that specific monster, not that type of monster) There are lots of items that you can find in monsters corpses but the game makes it very difficult to know what any of the items do other than be sold to merchants for coins. The game controls are terrible, it looks like it was made for xbox but then was never finished being integrated into PC controls. The game has the 3rd person viewpoint camera barely move around on its own, and the only other way to control the camera is with arrow-keys. The game didn’t take the time to configure the mouse to be bound to anything, which is a waste of potential camera control. When you want to engage an enemy while getting initiative (slight damage bonus) you have to press 3 different keys! you have to press F or G to get your character to look at them, V to be ready for battle, then SPACEBAR to start the battle. The English and the Japanese dialog was poorly written; the English has the character constantly speak is phrases that seem irrelevant. The plot and character development was poor; the main characters see a winged beast at the beginning and the sister is kidnapped, but when they saw the enemy in that scene they realized it was hostile, then proceeded to calmly wait for the enemy to fly over and attack. After this you end up on a plain with 2 armys charging each other for no reason... then you meet a prince who agrees to help you recover your sister, but then just sits on the throne and provides info. There was also technical incongruities, such as the necklace that the main character wears around his neck disappears randomly from time to time. (this isn’t a glitch, its also not in cut scenes)Positives:-has Japanese as a dialog option-has relatively original plot (for better or for worse)-has appropriate background music...-has Kingdom Hearts quality of graphics			"

												Unfortunately this game is broken.  After 20 hours of play, I reached a point where I could not proceed anymore because of a boss that I was under leveled for.  Yeah yeah yeah, I could have used multiple save files, but the game really shouldn't let you steam roll through a dungeon only to have the boss be insurmountable.  Furthermore, if said boss is impossible, there should be minions to grind on in the vicinity, allowing the player an opportunity to grind and proceed.  This game basically locked me in a room with no way out, and because I didn't save outside of this area, I simply can't proceed.  You can argue it's partially my fault, and that's fair, but it is still very bad game design.  It's really ashamed because the story and graphics are actually quite good, and the battle system has some merits.  That said, I will still not be trekking back through to make up my lost progress.  Unless you are going to play this game using a guide or a wiki, don't bother with it.			"

												This JRPG is something I consider and underrated gem. Story 6/10The story is generic but not too generic to the point where it's unplayable. It has its moments but is dragged down by its predictability. There is a decent plot twist at the end but it doesn't help rate it any higher. Stories of unique mercenaries you hire are told through their conversations and related missions. Most of them do have an interesting background (Nora, Violet, etc.). But they could have expanded more on their stories which was dissapointing to say the least.Gameplay 8.5/10The heart of the game is in the gameplay. You can have up to 18 units in your team, split into a maximum of 5 groups called unions. Each character can learn various skills (with Rush being the only one that can learn every move except for Weapon Specific Arts) and their usage of skills gives them roles the field. However, you can only manually equip Rush with whatever he is able to hold.The others upgrade and request either weapons or components on their own (what they request is based on your Battle Rank and what path you chose for them) The combat system itself is turn based strategy. You have to be smart about what abilities you keep on and what commands you choose. You do not specifically choose what they will do in that turn but you can influence their decisions based on their path and what skills you keep on or off. The combat is very deep and doing a full in-depth review of it would take too long. Try the demo to see if it is your taste. HOWEVER, I must say that looking at various guides (especially the wiki for the game) is very useful in order to understand the stat gain system and its relationship to the Battle Rank system. You may be familiar with the stat gain system if you have played any of the SaGa RPGs (which makes sense because the developer also worked on the SaGa games as well)Graphics 7/10It is the Unrea Engine so the moves look pretty when they're the flashy moves. Sadly, it is also Square Enix's first attempt using the Unreal Engine so there are many texture pop-in issues (but they recover in a few seconds). The environments without Remnants are relatively bland compared to the areas where Remnants are visible. Music 9/10The music is great for each scenario. The fights in open areas is very energetic, the fights in closed areas have a feeling of suspense. The music also changes during fights to match the current morale of the team. If it is low, then the music becomes darker, if the morale is high, it makes you feel like kicking♥♥♥♥♥Overall, I give it an 8/10			"

												An odd game. Starts off rather cheesy and slow, but quickly becomes what Square is best known for: an engaging and wonderful story with interesting and likeable characters. The combat system is unique and takes some getting used to yet not to difficult to intuit after a few battles, though the RNG nature of it is a little vexing at times. All in all, a solid RPG that stands on its own without needing to be tied to the Final Fantasy name.			"

												Eh, why not. This game flew under the radar for a game made by Square Enix, but it's worth a buy on sale. Like any Squenix game, you can expect some long hours put into this. I do say that some quests and the world navigation takes a lot of time, but the battles are the best, if not the only, part about this game I truly enjoy. It may just be me saying this since I started with the Xbox360 version before this one, but either way the battles are tactical and interesting.... Oh, the story is meh. Kind of hits on some parts, but the actors themselves just don't feel in tuned with the game... Get it for the battles.			"

												Interesting game, with beautiful graphics and battle mecanics. However, i can't recomend this game since i'm using a PC and this game was made for consoles. All the information, hints, pop-up messages and etc, only indicates buttons for a console controller and i'm playing on the PC, so you can imagine the mess it is. You need to memorize the entire keyboard layout used by the game, and there's 3 different keyboard layouts, each one used for a specific event (one for battle, one for navigation, one for menus in general).Anyway, the game appears do be very nice, but the lack of customization for PCs makes the experience more frustrating than enjoyable. I'm already expect this kind of issue in japanese games (Valkyria Chronicles, and some others that i already played), but The Last Remnant really pushes this way beyond. "

												I bought this a long time and put it down cause I could get a handle on the control.  I decide to give it second chance and try to work though it by playing the first couple battles and rebinding my key but this port is hopeless.  Its bad enough that the default controls are complete worthless to anyone with less than 4 arms, (requires hand on wsda, and arrow keys to move and if you want toggle targets proper hand on mouse as well, as well key bound to everywhere else on your keyboard from esc to home.  Then you have to deal with the fact that all the on screen indicators are using X-box button Icons.  Once you get all that sorted I guess you go to the menu and do your own custom bindings.  Well that would be great but every time I bind one key another one unbinds for no apparent reason, I guess on an X-box controller you have the same key in multiple function in different menus/cases and the game cant seem to handle that properly or cant tell the difference between arrows, num keys and arrow keys unless you bind them in specific order, Im honestly not sure whats going.  Also continous screen tearing, no matter how I set frame settings.Game might be buried in history but anyone who comes across beware, X-box control is a must if you want to avoid a huge headache.

												The Last Remnant introduce you to many unique systems when it comes to combat, party management , crafting & loot. Non of them and I mean NON works right. At the beginning everything seems okay and understandable but at the moment you get in with the rhythm of the game, it leaves you alone without even explaining any necessary part of any RPG game like crafting for example. And you say to yourself: OK I'll get hold of it the more I play. But you wont. The game will be more complex and you'll feel lost. Sure you'll keep pushing forward finishing a quest after quest but you feel that there is something that you don't quiet get. When I found myself in this position I decided to read some guides in order to understand what I'm doing wrong. And then it was easy to realize that even the people who made those guides (that are mostly helpful) does not understand many sections of the game.Take me for an example. I'm 50 hours into the game. I haven't bought anything from any merchant. I haven't crafted a single item even though that I have tons of components. I don't know what does a characters class means. I don't know half of the stats that my characters have like love, luck or courage because there is no way to monitor them. The game is vague about everything it has and it is not willing to show you anything so you have to treat it like Dwarf Fortress and go and read pages after pages of info that the game should have taught you at early hours of gameplay (if it was a good game).Let me tell you about level design. If you are exploring one of it's small and peaceful towns or a natural place then it's okay. But the most parts you will be running through castles, caves & temples that are designed like a really boring and empty mazes. I was once into a castle to do a side quest. I miraculously managed to find my way to my target without a map with everything explored except for a small hallway near the end of the level (you always find the map in a chest somewhere). So after I reached my destination and finished the side quest the game automatically takes me out of the place back to where I started it. Then I got curious maybe I'll find something useful at the hallway that I did not explore. So I decided to get back to the castle battle the stupid respawned enemies and waste half an hour just so that I find a map of the place that I have no business in no more! This is how stupid the level design is in this game.One of many pointless ant totally worthless side quests was a guy telling me that he lost something and this ""Something"" has been broken into six parts and I have to search for those parts and bring it back to him! even a 6 years old would have the imagination to make a better side quests than these.I could spend all night writing about every single bad thing about this game from it's uninteresting pokemon-like companion (which is called mister diggs - lack of imagination again) to it's bad looking enemies with their repetitive moves to it's boring and disgusting grinding and leveling up system.I could tell you about everything that I encountered and diminished my enjoyment of the game. But I guess that is enough. You can still give it a try because it's cheap but I don't recommend doing it.			"

												The Last Remnant got an awfully bad rap from the critics, but that's only because most critics never played the updated, polished PC version which removes much of the Xbox version's annoyances (and because most critics are pompous ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s who evaluate a game based on all criteria except 'is it fun to play'). The Last Remnant is a jRPG which deviates from the traditional Square Enix style, in that your characters are grouped into unions, who basically do what they want and only obey general guidelines you, as the player, give them. The Xbox version suffered from several flaws, (choppy graphics, inability to recruit more than a handful of Leaders, and inbalanced level scaling), but the PC version fixes all that. In jRPG tradition, there's some annoying voices and narrative head-scratchers, but it is a game well-worth picking up!			"

												The graphics are really sparse and the voice acting is hit-or-miss. The music and the storyline are decent. The gameplay is alright, you have your dudes in ""unions"" and give them orders, but often can't micromanage what every guy does. Positioning is really important, so the gameplay does have potential, but the execution on that potential doesn't really do it for me. It's hard to know what to do or how to accomplish a lot of stuff without consulting a guide on the internet. Item use, plot progression, how to use unions, morale -- all this stuff is opaque and the game doesn't explain well.Also the battles start getting really hard, so you have to grind a bunch, which isn't something that I really like doing. This game has an obnoxious fan base of people who are really dedicated to a mediocre game.			"

You have to look at the door to have the leave option, and that combined with the camera issue can be a multi-minute task. Adding insult to injury, none of the control instructions are ported to PC. Now, this wouldn't normally be a dealbreaker. It is however a dealbreaker in games who's combat systems rely highly on knowledge of said controls. Would probably buy Duke Nukem over this.			"

												October 11, 2016: Completely Revised Review. The first review failed to acknowledge the positives of The Last Remnant and rambled on the negatives far too much.(Note: I have already beat the game on normal and hard mode without cheats/changes to the game engine. Further playthroughs were altered for convienence and fun.) Upon entering the world of The Last Remnant, I came across an incredibly intriguing game. There was an entire fantasy world and multiple systems to uncover and understand. The beautiful world and atmosphere of TLR had captivated me; however, the game was marred by a complete lack of information for mechanics, a multitude of unpolished gameplay systems, and a shallow combat system that ruined the experience and credibility of the game. Even despite the flaws, The Last Remnant had succesfully conveyed a myriad of small details that made the game feel exhilarating. The crisp and powerful sound design bolsters the strike of a weapon and the destruction from a casted ability; my ears became addicted to it all while my eyes were graced by the gigantic damage numbers dished out by my units. Even more so, the OST of this game is absolutely superb. From the tranquil melody of Echoes of the Past to the heart-pumping Press to Victory, the composers from Square Enix demonstrate their mastery over music. As someone who is fond of fantasy armor and design, TLR has also solidly designed a memorable cast of characters. Regardless of any cliches or annoyance that comes from them, there's no doubt that they're distinct and recognizable from their cheesy one-liners to their small yet endearing personalities and backstories. Despite all these wonderful aspects about the game, I am pained to say that the gameplay has nullified the many positives I have for TLR. The combat is riddled with RNG, from choosing my commands, to the outcome of a skirmish, and even to my ultimate abilities, most of one's ability to strategize becomes reduced to constant dice rolls and enemy attacks that do absurdly little damage or completely wipe out a union. There is also no median of difficulty to be had in TLR either. It's either a dull cake-walk or a frustratingly difficult and cheap end-game playthrough.Even worse, many systems in the game feel overlooked and unrefined, such as commerce points, combat, exploration, customization, guild quests, and crafting. Ultimately, It is disappointing to say that this game is just a wasted potential. There's no doubt that it is an amazing foundation and base for a potentially grand RPG like no other, but it just falls short tremendously.To conclude, The Last Remnant is my guilty pleasure since it has accomplished visual and audio designs to near perfection, (especially for 2009!) but in the end, I'm just playing a beautiful board game with a tremendous waste of potential.

												The Last Remnant is a game of questionable ideas and fantastic gameplay. The plot is decent, the writing is horrendous and the main character is an idiot with retard strength. But if you can get past the story portions of the game, the game will reward you greatly for your time. I'm not even past the Disc 1 portion of the game and already sunk 25 hours while doing the side quests and searching for the rare monster fights, it is just that satisfying to run around and explore.The game relies heavily on explorating and grinding monsters for stuff. You cannot directly control what your team mates equip, but you can control what skills they use and if you get the resources they want, they will upgrade their own gear. You assemble your team in groups that attack together at the same time against other groups and give loose orders on what they do. Because of that, it is highly encouraged you disable skills you don't want your units to randomly choose.The grinding of monsters can get tedious, to the point where I would skip monsters to finish quests faster. The good news is you can save anywhere, anytime outside of battle, and even autosave after fights in case you forget. That alone makes the grinding bearable since you can take breaks without needing to skip monsters if you want to loot the area clean.Besides the story I previously mentioned, the biggest downfall to this game is they do not at all describe what the stats do in the game. If you get gear that gives +1 to sword, there is nowhere in the game that tells you how big of a boost you can get. Thankfully, people datamined the game code and found out the exact stats, so you can utilize that in the wiki website for The Last Remnant. Makes the game at least have some sort of sense. It plays like Saga Frontier (also made by SquareSoft) in that way where all you need to know is high stats are good, right? Maybe? Perhaps?If you want to play a tactical turn based RPG you can play for a long time, I recommend this one quite a bit. I got it on sale for $3 and was worth the price so far. I reckon it'll be another 50 hours before I beat the game. That be a lot of messing around, I tell ya what.			"

												I've heard a lot of good about this game and it was alright up until now. This game feels impossible to beat and I'm not far into the game at all. I'm at a battle where 1 of my 2 groups die in the first turn every time. The other groups only option is to heal and attack because it makes sense. One heals to full health, the other attacks to do something productive(don't want 2 heals when the first gives you full health, right?). This works for 2-3 turns but I always end up dying. Perhaps I could grind it and hope I get a really lucky streak of receiving low damage or something but come on, that's bad game design.			"

Posted: September 25, 2016
												So I originally played the console version of this game, and got nailed by the game-breaking coding. Not a bug, just a somewhat infamously poor design choice that could easily render the game unbeatable halfway through. Hearing that that was fixed, I decided to try the PC version and get the game's full experience. And I just can't; the aforementioned flaw overshadowed the more important fact that this game is BORING. I like the story, but the presentation and setting are rather lackluster, alot of obvious questions are never asked, the pacing is weird, and the main character rivals Tidus for being just an annoying, foolish lead. Really, that highlights the most noteworthy aspect of this game; it's JRPG as you can get, in the worst way. Even as a lifelong fan of the genre, my favorite one, there are things that are just irritating in it, and this game seems to take them all and magnify them. Everything about the game feels so RANDOM. The damage you deal, and receive, jumps around tremendously, I mean by literal orders of magnitude. One guy, with the same attack stat, can do 30 damage, and the next one will do several THOUSAND, no lie, no hyperbole, that is what happens. You have no direct control over characters, instead issuing vague commands to character clusters and hoping for the best (good luck getting them to heal, it seems to be the hardest thing to do). And there is some requirement for you to command the battlefield itself, choosing which enemy units to hit, but with no rhyme or reason to the order of who gets to attack, you can often find yourself being intercepted when trying to attack a group of enemies literally three feet in front of you by another group of enemies 40 feet off. What? And while damage to the character groups is pooled, mostly, it is still possible for you to lose individual members of the group for no real reason, drastically hurting your potential. You have a morale meter in battle, which increases your damage and decreases the damage you take, but it always favors whoever is winning the fight, meaning the better side gets better and the worse side gets worse; in the end, what it means is that you absolutely dominate already easy opponents while getting creamed by powerful ones you might otherwise might have had a shot at. Increasing your party's power simply involves finding them random items from monster drops that they just keep and somehow use on their equipment, or occasionally carrying around equipment and hoping they eventually ask you if they can use it. There are no straight levels in this game, instead playing like Chrono Cross where every fight will probably give at least one character some minor boost to a stat, like 2 HP or something. However, leveling isn't much use, since enemies level with you, more or less. You also have this little guy who can mine for resources for you, but only so many times, and it's very random.It's very difficult to fully describe this game's issue without giving detailed explanations of every mechnanic, but let me sum it up; if you are not a fan of JRPGs, run away from this one, you will hate it. If you are a fan, ask yourself if these are the kinds of mechanics you like, where you basically require a guide to play effectively, everything is very random, and the game involves lots of repetivive grinding through the same tiny areas against the same 3 kinds of enemies for hours just to get certain drops or to do the 5th quest in the same location. I was hoping to enjoy this game all the way through this time, but I'm even less tolerant of it's problems today than I was 6 years ago. It's just too annoying and repetitive to play, causing controller-busting frustration over the game's predominately AI controlled combat acting really stupid. In a way, the best comparison I can think of is Enchanted Arms; both have servicable if predictable plots with typical Japanese tropes, both have unique combat systems to try and hang their hat on (and failing), and both are so plagued by mechanics and randomness that don't make any realistic sense and lack any reason to exist that it makes the games simply un-fun. If it had a traditional leveling system without monsters leveling with you, higher movement speed, higher drop rates, more info giving to you, less randomness and more control in combat, I could enjoy the game, even with it's flaws. But it's just too slow and plodding and annoying to enjoy the decent parts of it, and novelty of the combat system isn't enough to carry an otherwise mediocre-to-poor title. You better be a total JRPG fanatic to play this.			"

												Strap in, and get ready to wonder if you should stop playing, or see it through! If you're like me and you remember when RPGs were fun, get ready to have your favorite company disappoint you all over again! Even when they go back to a system that looked familiar and fun, Square-enix screws it up!With all the hope that Square-enix could be a good company again comes the reality that they've fallen apart, and simply cannot produce a good game since Square and Enix merged. I was a fan of both before, but I've tried since, to no avail. Last remnant was empty and blah. I played maybe 5 hours or so, and there was just no reason to keep going. With a completely bizarre battle system and an all-comtrived cast of characters...			"

												I expected ""The Last Remnant"" to be an intriguing game and with mechanics that would make the game original but i just noticed that this is not as expected.I played this game for 1 hour, more or less, and i already noticed tremendously ugly things from the very beginning.You see an intro where the guy is searching for his sister and all of sudden gets attracted by flowers and then he starts running like there is no tomorrow all of sudden, all of that to fall inside a battlefield where he sees a soldier that he thinks is his sister but has nothing to do with his sister, cause the description and the appereance you see in his flashback have nothing do with this girl nor the situation they were living.Apart from that, you see a game that goes with a classic clichè storyline and a very bad combat system that managed to be worse than Final Fantasy XIII.This review is moved by disappointment from the very beginning but i still need to go on with the game, let's see what it has to offer... but i have many doubts.

												i really wanted to like this game but i can't. i reached the last boss but i gave up, just saw a video about the ending and disinstalled it. SPOILERS-characters have 0 personality-the story is written by a special kid.. it revolves around the remnants but no info about what they are and what they do. they decided to give to everycity a remnant but apart being something cool to see they do nothing at all-incredibly stupid game mechanic (AVOID TO ACTUALLY PLAY to be able to finish it.... really??)-you can't control what your characters do in battle.. YOU ARE ALONE, RESURRECT THE OTHER CHARACTERS! NO! WHY ARE YOU ATTACKING?? -the story is so bad that i have to talk a bit about it..... at some point the BAD guy shows up and his name is THE CONQUEROR, just the fact that his name is a noun should be enough but at this point the special kid decides to give it all, for no reason the god emperor (another character that exists in this game only for 20 seconds purpose) knows that THE CONQUEROR is a remnant (it is supposed to be a surprise but the special kid decided to make all the character give hints about it almost as soon as THE CONQUEROR appears) and he orders everyone to obey to what he wants, there are also come very cool evil characters like the imba mage with a cool burned eye (of course with 0 background) that again for no reasons wants to help THE CONQUEROR to kill all the humans. why does THE CONQUEROR want to kill everyone? because people are abusing the remnants (it is unknown in what way they are using them since the only remnant used in the game is the gae bolg.. all the other remnants are purely for city decorations)-the BIG PLOT TWIST!!! the main character (which i forgot to tell you is completely brain damaged) is actually a remnant too! OMG...  too bad the special kid did it again by making HUGE hints about it from the first moment you meet THE CONQUEROR (like him appearing like a star wars jedi ghost to the main character's sisters and telling her that he is... the scene doesn't show what he tells her, probably that her brother is a remnant but most probably nothing important because she doesn't give a flying f*** about this revelation for all the game.. or the other scene when THE CONQUEROR tells the main character ""remember who you truly are"" or that other time when he tells him ""you should have regained the memory by now"" or maybe even when he tells him ""you should know what i am going to do because the mission to kill the humans wasn't originally mine"" you pick one-the subquests, nothing wrong with them, the only problem is again the game mechanic to unlock certain quests.. for example a quest with an unlockable character is only avaible if in the middle of the main quest (at a certain point you have to attack 6 enemy bases) after conquering each enemy base you go to this character and talk to him because REASONS! let me be clear.. you attack first base.. go to talk to character.. go back to attack 2nd base.. go back to talk to character.. get it? how clever is it? CLEARLY NOT A QUEST DOABLE ONLY IF YOU FOLLOW A GAME GUIDE-there are way more things to talk about but i am tired and you should have got the pointSpecial note about how i wanted to punch the main character everytime he sayd DAVE... ♥♥♥♥ing retard meets a lord of a city, that for no reason (are you still surprised that in this game things just happens?) decides to help him, and when he gets announced by his generals as the marchese david nassau, he promptly exclaims some♥♥♥♥♥♥things like ""nice to meet ya DAVE""			"

												Do you like RPGs? If yes proceed to the next question.Do you like grinding? If no you can stop here, you might need some patience and time to play this game.If you are expecting a A-RPG, do not be fooled this game is not that.Last remnant is a fantastic JRPG with a novel combat system that feels like a breeze of fresh air in this game industry where every game last 5 hours and is full of cinematics (there are plenty of cinematics in TLR do not fear). The combat system feels random at times until you learn how the system works, problem is this is going to take at least 50h and you are not going to have a grasp of all the things you can actually do. The story is alright, considering the main character is less charismatic than a potato and he is annoying as hell, but a mysterious and charismatic antagonist pays off.Pros:- Cheap.- Loads of content and beautiful areas.- Really nice visuals.- AoE synergies and group building.- Difficulty through the roof, that makes you build up some self confidence when you get to kill THAT ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ MONS-- er.-♥♥♥♥♥♥loads of upgrades to weapons and skills.- Customization of your units and characters make the game an experience every time you play it.Cons:- Main character annoying as hell.- Side quests blocking the full content of the game, especially in some cases when you needed to do a quest from Disc 1 in order to go into a new zone (e.g. The ancient runes.)- Guild rewards need you to kill some random monster that has a 0.01% spawn ratio.- Almost mandatory to follow a guide during your first playthrough.Veredict: 7 out of 10.

												The gameplay in Remnant is turn based... Infact, I kinda like the gameplay since it has a few things that normally turn based RPG's don't have.However the story and characters kills the game. You play as the main charecter Rush who's trying to get his kidnapped syster back from some unknown an♥♥♥♥♥ that kidnapped her. I don't have any problem whit this... Infact, this is a good setup for a deeper story. The only problem is that the story takes every chance to♥♥♥♥♥♥on it self and make you not like the game. So what is it that makes me not like this game? Well, it's rather simple. The main charecter losses his system, two armys fight each other... The king of one army decids to help Rush in his search for his system, becuase... Well, he's just doing it. Then we also have the main charecter who feels like everything should happen instantly. When the King of said army allows him to stay in his casstle then the first thing he says is ""I'm not tired, I want to go after whoever kidnapped my system"". I'm just happy that I got this in a Bundle since otherwise I'd be disspointet in both myself for spending money on this crap and the developers whom made the game.			"

There is no tutorial, the mechanics are only explained on the most basic level and if you really want to get into the deeper possibilities of the game you have to read the wikis a lot.The farther i got the more the game started to feel like a chore until i just now realized that i am having no fun at all and there is no reason at all to continue playing.

												The Last Remant is a game made by the well known Square Enix group, which is the main reason i purchaced it (despite the low rating). After a little bit of messing around here and there with the large array of video settings, I stepped off into the game and realized quickly that it was just another generic japanese rpg. Some overpowered guy has caputred some innocent girl and you (being the brother) must go rescue her. Despite the generic storyline, the gameplay is not bad if you like cluttered screens. A good 80% of the screen is filled with some sort of box telling you something (during combat). The tactical perspectives of the game (such as being able to flank someone in mid-combat for a boost to moral and etc) makes for great mechanics, however it is drowned out by not feeling the true immersion of a square enix title. I wouldn't recommend buying this game unless you do not mind generic storyline, low immersion, high clutterence titles.			"

												Do you like grinding?Do you like minimal control over your characters?Do you like almost no customization options for party members?Do you like a cringe-worthy story with cutscenes playing out like a complete amateur scripted them?Do you like poorly ported controls and optimization?Then The Last Remnant is the game for you.GrindingAlmost every part of the game requires some degree of grinding. Let me elaborate. You are advancing in the story. You just unlocked a new place to visit. But wait! If you do not re-visit the previously visited stories and kill every single enemy 3 times, you are not going to have a chance against the enemies in the new area! What is that? You just did that and are no longer having problems with fighting enemies in the new area, even if you aggro 5 groups at a time?I guess that means you can go fight the boss, right? Whoops, he instakilled you because your level is too low. If you exit the area and clear all its enemies 3 more times, the boss will actually only deal about half as much damage! That works every time!Coincidentally, the only parts that are not grindy or fetch-quests are essentially the tutorials and early side-quests, because they automatically teleport you to the area you are goign to, initiate the thing you are supposed to do, and teleport you back to the quest NPC to give you a reward, all automatically. Which is not really that good at teaching you anything, but at least you do not have to grind.  Control Every action you have in a fight will have a pre-determined combination of actions, depending on how many action points you have. Half the time, there is no option for ranged attacks, even if you are able to do them. When you are healing yourself with white majykks, all non-healers will stand by. If you use the option that allows you to attack AND heal, your characters will prioritize using items, unless they have no item skills, even if their magic is stronger. If you let them play by ear, which is supposed to let each character in a squad attack the way they want to, they'll just auto-attack without using skills most of the time, even if you have 100+ AP and their skills cost 7.ManagementThe only way you can customize any character except the MC (Rush Sykes) is by deciding whether you will let them take your loot to upgrade their weapons or not. Other than that, you can only tug them in the right direction by spamming commands that will increase a certain skill or attribute if used a lot, but that will unbalance your entire party and make them less efficient, since Legions normally have a mix of melee and caster characters.The rest of my points speak for themselves.

												 I often equate this game to the JRPG equivalent of a bad B-movie, which can be considered both a good and a bad thing, depending on what you’re expecting going in.Between the thin story and terrible voice acting just getting through the first few cut-scenes will likely be enough to push most players away from the game entirely. That having been said, if you do decide to give the game a shot, the terrible acting does let up a bit after you get about 10 hours into the main quest side of the game, and the story starts to pick up a bit even if it still follows many of the standard JRPG clichés.Gameplay-wise, The Last Remnant is very ‘hands-off’. The party system mechanics are actually rather interesting, allowing you to recruit members to add to your party and split them up into groups for combat, but it falls short due to the fact that you have no control over those recruits equipment or skills. Gaining new skills requires that a previous skill in the same ‘tree’ is used in combat to give a chance for a new skill to be learned or an old one to be upgraded but even that is left up to a modicum of randomness, unfortunately making the entire system an endeavor of patience and repetition.The battle system is likely where you will either learn to love the game despite itself or simply hate it enough to give up entirely. To put it simply, you have almost no control whatsoever. Instead you are given a series of choices based on various factors, such as party/enemy levels, active party skills, party/enemy/ally HP, etc. It is possible to lean the options in a certain direction by disabling non-useful abilities before entering combat so that they are not available as a choice, but even then you may still get turns where your mage-only group is given only physically offensive options.Once you get far enough to have 3 groups battles become a bit easier to handle. If you manage to stick around long enough to get to 4 groups, however, the combat system starts to shine a bit, adding in more potential tactics and a better balance for the battles. It’s really at this point that both the gameplay and the story start to pick up and become more fluid all around.I personally have enjoyed my time playing The Last Remnant, but I went into it fully expecting it to be severely lacking in some areas, and as such will be the first to admit that it is not for everyone. It takes a long time to actually get to the fun parts of the game, but once you’re there it’s… well, fun.It’s not epic or life changing, but if you want to play a JRPG that’s a bit different and have the patience to make this one work, then keep a look-out for when it goes on sale and give it a shot. Otherwise, you will most likely be better off passing this one up. "

												While the battle system is interesting, and certainly different than the usual affair for an RPG, it misses the mark... as does the rest of this game. The turn based battle system puts you in control of multiple ""troops"" who operate with vague and often times unpredictable mechanics. You would expect that since you are incharge of a small army, you would also have a good understanding of the terran, troop movements, ect. Wrong. You have no sense of space whatsoever during any point of the battle. This eliminates gameplay as sound strategy and makes each encounter a crapshoot with the player often times hoping for the best.As for the characters and story... there is none. The characters are souless and without clear motivations. Their relationships are never well established or developed. Essentially, everybody is just there and has a loose reason to be on this ""quest"". The story is choppy, full of glaring plot holes and is as ill defined as its characters. It gives no real sense of threat or urgency when it's time to go out and face the bad guys, nor does it explore why each character would be vested in the story's goals. You just have to do cuz there's nothing else to do... except side quests. Speaking of...The side quests are a bunch of repetative nonsense that feel tacked on to the story and service no real purpose except to be finished by completionists. (This is not to say that other RPG's do it better, but it contributes to the souless nature of this game. There is just no drive, interest or reason to really do much of anything.

												My very minimal time with the game will tell you that I did not like it very much. Firstly, although it is an old game, and animation awkwardness and other graphical issues are to be expected, one would have thought that these would be fixed when the port to PC was made, but I found no sign of that here. When I was introduced to the battle system, my honest thought was, ""Ugh, is the entire game going to play like this?"" to which more progress into the game told me it was. The battle system is rather confusing at first, and doesn't really get all that better with the explanations further inot the game as I found myself asking where the decisions where in terms of what techniques to use or who to attack with which individual character. Admittedly, since this game was from Square Enix, I was more or less expecting something along the lines of their other fare, which I did not find here. I'm really not the type that likes to control large groups of soldiers or particularly a fan of RTSes, which this game had enough of to make me not want to play any longer.I also wasn't able to get invested in the story right away, and could see that if I was feeling like skipping the cutscenes already, that I wasn't going to enjoy game over all.

												I could go into a long review about this game, but that would be impossible. There are many positives to this game, however I had to give up after three hours. Why? The protagonist has got to be one of the most annoying character Square Enix has managed to concot. Rude, abrasive, idiotic, childish and bumbling, there is very little redeaming about him. It got so bad that I just gave up on the game three hours in because I couldn't stand to listen to him anymore.			"

												I picked this up as a part of a bundle, expecting nothing much and it was worse off than i thought. The first hours of the game have you in a tutorial where you just follow commands. After I was done with that and finally got control of my own units, i spent about an hour grinding cause the game kinda didn't tell me how to trigger the next flag. The story is bland as oatmeal, with some voiceovers being really cringeworthy.But then to the meat of the game, the combat. Much to the credit of the game, they are trying something new, instead of controlling single characters actions you now control a group of characters (called a Union). The combat system is simple enough with a leveling system even simpler, use stuff and it eventually levels up. Although leveling up doesn't help you much since the game heavily relies on numbers and RNG, what those numbers might be I couldn't tell you, since the game in no way explains it. RNG is also a big factor, when against the same mob (as in reloading a save and actually fighting the same mob) the outcome of the first round was wildly different, ranging from killing a enemy union without getting hit to myself being one-shotted, this against exactly the same mob.The game looks pretty enough (if you can overlook som glitchy graphics) although most of the enviroments seems to be quite boring. The dungeons throws nonsense mechanics at you for no reason at all *door shuts down and you get to fight the same mobs you've been chomping like tic-tacs to get there*. In another dungeon there is a slow-down fog, it does nothing exept slow you down, so instead of wasting 5 seconds running down an empty hallway, you now get to enjoy the same empty hallway for a minute.All in all, the game reminds me alot of FFX, if you take away intresting scenes, combat and story.

												The Last Remnant is a unique title. It manages to have some of the greatest voices on the face of the planet and still manages to fall short due to its writing. The main character is voiced by Johnny Yong Bosch, so you'd think he'd be able to save the performance, right? Nope, the writing's that dry and cliched...though moreso the former than the latter.What does make this game worth recommending, however, is the gameplay. When I say that the title is unique, I don't mean because of the writing; games have had great voices and bad writing before. What makes this game unique is that it has a style of gameplay unseen since Chaos World back on the NES. Rather than controlling one character at a time and fighting monsters that way, you take several characters into a fight and control them as squads. This isn't a Turn-Based game, either, though it may look it...or not. This game is the type of thing that is hard to decipher from videos alone, but its more of a Tactical Turn-Based RPG, though I wouldn't go as far as to call it a Strategy RPG.This game also lends itself to an OK story, but there's enough here to keep one who is having fun interested for a while. The areas are large and open (and this is not a linear game), the customization is one of the more unique things I've seen out of an RPG, and the character recruitment process is slightly unpolished, among other things in the game, but the idea of having so many optional characters with histories and personalities is a nice touch. If the price is low enough (and this game can go pretty low, price-wise) then I'd definitely recommend checking it out, especially if your looking for a unique experience.			"

												So I'd gotten wind of this game by multiple peers who all claimed it to be the pinnacle of PC RPG's and sadly I have to find myself agreeing with them. Why I say 'sadly' it's due to the fact that The Last Remnant has left a void in me that not even it could fill; only create.There's really nothing to be said of great deal about the story of TLR. For the most part the entire storyline was rather predictible with some characters showing insight that could've been called character if they'd decided to act more upon it, sadly only a few characters recieve any amount of characterization, but again the entire story is generic to begin with, so it doesn't surprise me in the least.This leads me to the gameplay which I'm quite sad to say was extremely disappointing. While on the surface, any new player might look at the gameplay and see an extemely complex and quizzling battle system, the verteran would easily deny such. The combat consists of 'squads' in which you assign a formation to the squad and create who is in the squad. Sadly everyone but the main character is entirely uncustomizable and is only upgraded through fulfilling their needs when they ask (which again is out of the players hands). Battles that seemed to have a sort of strategy with positioning will not let the player decide where the squad stands or allow the squad to run backwards from the enemy. Almost every action in the battles is entirely randomly generated and while you can check what actions will take place with each attack, you cannot choose every action for your attack. For example, say you want the main character to use 'Blue Bird', you would have to check each option to see if he even has the CHANCE to use it. Oftentimes my characters obtain a completely game-breaking move but decide to use their weaker ones for no reason in particular. While I understand for the main character Rush, you can disable arts for him, to force him into using the OP skills it's simply not possible for the other NPCs. Oh also QTE's are the entire combat. Everytime you tell a squad to attack it has a chance of doing a critical offense/defense in which you have to press a single button/trigger to initiate a stronger attack/counterattack/dodge.I had brought up earlier how you couldn't customize your characters for squads and I'd like to reiterate upon that a little bit more. You cannot give them armor/equipment. You cannot choose their name/appearance. You cannot pick anything about them other than whatever preset the game has given you. While you can choose nameless soldiers, it would be silly to choose those over any of the commanders who are able to learn unique abilities and upgrade their weapons to a higher degree.Lastly many complain of the difficulty that is this game. I can say I breezed through every fight without much struggle. The game is extremely level-dependent and can scale enemies with the characters though not to a noticible degree. I will warn new players of grinding unless they find themselves in a quest to which they cannot complete, I've heard horror stories of those who grinded prior to getting party members and made the game neigh impossible. I will say that grinding/battling is one of the things the game has improved on. Grinding can be sped through, and gaining 10+ levels in 30 minutes is an easy task. Battles are also pretty fun since you can go all out in every battle since the end of every battle results in a completely healed party.P.S. Looking for quests suck and some quests can be skipped. I used a guide (to find questgivers, not spoil the quest) because I will not, WILL NOT, run around in stupid circles looking for a quest in every single city's five sections. Especially since as I've said certain quests are entirely skippable and certain quests will only unlock after doing certain storyline requirements. This means you can check all fourty areas for quests, do a single storymode quest, and then have to check all fourty areas again just in case. I just don't have that kind of commitment in me, and I don't think anyone else should put up with such shenanigans. All quests should have been found in the guilds at every city, there was no reason to do otherwise other than to♥♥♥♥♥♥people off.Overall I do recommend anyone looking for an RPG on the PC to check TLR out, sadly don't look forward for this game to fill your lust for customizable team building or strategy.

												Oh man... Where do I even begin. I have a very hard time liking this game, yet I still do not dislike it.There are so many great things in this game, that it often ruined due to things that could easily be evaded... BY THE PLAYER!PLEASE NOTE: That I have 41 or so hours invested in this game (Which is not that much) This is not that much of a Review. It is mainly for people, who is in doubt if they should buy this game. I have not completed it yet. I have, however, spent alot of time playing this and this is more a way to introduce you and give you tips, so you do not get this great game ruined, like I did.A Brief Intro:The game has really nice graphics and a really amazing world, for you to explore... And there is plenty of things for you to explore. There are many discrete places, which may hide a nice little treasure or a rare monster for you to kill, or capture. After each battle you can happen to loot a living monster/beast, which you can either harvest for rare components, or just keep it and sell it. Rare monster can be sold for alot. The nice enviroment is very Final Fantasy-familiar, but the game has this ""mature"" tone. I by that I mean it is more raw and real (IT EVEN HAS BLOOD :O) This very bright and big world is filled with all sorts of monsters. Note that monsters has their own 'Natural Habitat', so you will not find a Flying Flame Orb Monster in the sea, no you will find Fish-like beasts here. The same models are re-used often, just with a different skin. This is not bad in anyway, as the variety of monsters are very big. So you won't get bored of always meeting the same monsters, except for those damn spiders... Keep in mind the variety of monsters, is no way near how many different monsters the FF-series has. Yet enough and they looks insanely cool. At least most of them. There are huge giant dragon too... Who does not like to duel such a beast? And they look like Bahamut too.The combat is very different from anything you are used to. At least here in the western realms. You control 'Unions' which consist of up to 6 (Or 5? Sry can't remember right now) 'Units', that is basically small squad... or units... One unit can hold up to 5 Characters. Each units is offered options that they will then execute after all units have been assigned which options to perform (Attack, Magic, Heal, Ranged or just chill). These options/actions are only avaiable under certain conditions. Like you are not able to revive if enemy units are 'Deadblocking' you (Simply ganging up on you). It CAN be very difficult to understand and learn this combat system, which is part of why I have a hard relationship with this game. It can be extremely time consuming to set up each unit and assign them the correct roles. Units are also assigned which 'Formations' they should fight in. And there are many and plenty to choose from, in order to get just the right formation for a battle. This too can be hard to understand, but very rewarding when learned.It is partly open-world, or what you will call it and it filled my desires of a open world. Meaning that the 'World Map' which you often navigate through, holds many different locations, that you fast travel to. You never actually walk, unless you want to unlock new areas, or quests. From the World Map you pick which destination you need leave to and BANG you are there. Be it a dungeoun, forest, desert or one the many Cities. So lets say you venture to Drillmor (One of the first locations), from the World Map, then you will spawn in Drillmor and a huge map will be there for you to explore, with certain enviroments. Like Drillmor is grassy mountain place, while others are swamps, desert or old castles. These location are where you will do most of you quest, hunt rare monters or just grind exp. Cities is where you get quest, and is often build up of 2-4 districts, where you can walk around too. There are many NPC's and alot of different (useless, but pretty) decoration in every city. Very well made. Some quest are also done inside cities.There are many, many bosses in this game and that is nice. They each deliver their own challenges, some easy, some damn hard. It can be very difficult sometimes, to defeat a certain enemy. Yet with the right formation and tactics, these battles can suddenly turn extremely easy.Now how can I be annoyed after all these saucy and delicious things the game has to offer? I tell you, and I will it hard!I really hope that you read this, so that you do not experience this and only have a fun time with this game, which it is very able to deliver, if treated right.THIS IS NOT FINAL FANTASY! Yet you will recognize alot of familiar elements. I experienced playing and running through the game smoothly. Enemies were alright and some were tough. Bosses made tension rise at times, and sometimes I thought I would loose, only to have a great victory. I started feeling like I was a bit strong and might had grinded a bit too much (Which I had not, I just killed every enemy on my quests). Then BOOM! I kept running into one enemy after another that would annihilate my units fast and effective. It just kept happening and then I thought: ""Have I missed somthing? Like a dungload of quests?"" The answer was a big smelly YES. Yet I spend alot of boring time grinding, with no knowledge of the quests I had missed. I mean it was like 15 quests or something. Luckily I had still time to gather them all and finish them, but I had spent some time meanwhile, running around not knowing what to do, or where to go. Which destroyed that great new and exciting feeling I had, and quickly made me rant as I ran around in fantasy land. This could easily have been avoided.So I finished to quests, but that was not fun either, as one quest was nice and just as hard as I like it. Then the next stage of the quest would throw a dark mega dragon in my face that would KoS from miles aways. KO. Then I learned how important formations and the 'Arts/Skills/Magic' is. So I learned that, but once again, that WOOOAW-feeling had turned a bit thinner. Now I just want to finish this dung and get on with my life. I hate it so much, but still wake up and it is the first thing I turn on. I really like it, but I wish that WOOOAW-feeling had lasted a bit longer, and not had been ruined by my ignorance to the game. I HIGHLY suggest that you use The Last Remnant Wiki (google it) and spend some time to learn all these things and know when and where to get quests, so you do not get stucked somewhere. This is really a great game, and if you know what you are doing it will last until the end of the game. Use that website and learn all you can, without spoiling anything, like the story and such. Which is pretty good so far.-It can take very long to organize your Union and Units, wich can be really exhausting at times.-Very bad at introducing you to the mechanics, due to them being so advanced and new.-Many things has to be learned on the internet, or by being a magic genius.-Amount of enemy units can at times be very irregular. Sometimes 1, other times 3. Not that big of a deal.-Very easy to get lost and not knowing where to go next (except main quests. You always know where to go).-Extremely annoying Spiders... I really hate them and try to avoid them at any times. They are not tough, just annoying.All these CONS can be avoided if the player takes the time to prepare himself/herself for the game and learns a little bit. I highly advice to use the WIKI and trying not to read the spoilers.			"

												Certainly is underrated. Story is alright for a JRPG. Its full of traditional JRPG tropes so not too much new there. The protagonist is a sis-con/etc. However, where it becomes more unique is in party formations. This is like an RPG game with a heavier emphasis on setting up your parties to handle all threats. It is a different and welcome approach. Because of this, some fights can be much harder than they need be. You'll likely find lots of people complaining about the difficulty. But here is probably the greatest tip of all and it didn't take much to figure out. Yes some are hard, but they all have optimal strategies to make them work. It isn't luck of the draw. Luck only comes in when it comes to damage/resist totals. Overall instead of simple luck, it usually involves who you target first. If you are having trouble, try other combinations. I've had some tough ones become insanely easy because instead of focusing down one enemy, I focused another. Or instead of splitting up, I focused. The other big factor for this game is do a search on it for how to manually set the graphics/etc. Square - Enix did a pretty poor job. But there are wikis out there which will quickly tell you how to set the game up to look much better. It literally is a must do for anyone who buys this game. Read the sites, hack the ini, enjoy the game.It is a shame this title didn't get more refinement or better support from Square. Certainly is one of the more unique JRPGs out there. Play it in the Japanese dub if possible. The mannerisms and voices match much better. However, the English subs are sometimes grossly off the mark. If you know any Japanese, you'll notice right away when you come to a scene and wonder who translated it because what they are saying and what the text reads is not close.			"

												From Squeenix comes a fairly fun, non-traditional JRPG. The graphics, IMHO, are stunning, and the gameplay is simple enough to gain good control over if you simply pay attention to the tutorials that pop up when they are needed. One word of advice: in battling multiple foes, take out the ones that would flank you first. Honestly a very nice game, pretty decent story and full of painfully funny dialogue. I don't know if it's for everyone, but if you enjoyed Final Fantasy in its day and want a fantastic graphical update with a lot of fun mixed in, it's one to consider			"

												I really tried to like this game as I'm running out of decent games to play...but I just can't finish it.The characters/writing are atrocious. Quests are horribly uninspired and are rarely more than ""get to the end of the dungeon"". The combat is unique at least, but I can't say that I enjoy it. It seems as if customisation is meant to be a huge part of the combat, but I'm ten hours in and haven't found any way to meaningfully to do so. Every enemy dies to the same combat arts spam. The fights themselves have the appearance of being tactical affairs, but it's RNG heavy. Sometimes one of your units gets focused by 4 enemies and dies, leaving you with a lost fight. Short of that, the same ganging up on enemy units is always the correct approach. (At least up to where I made it)It is an interesting idea of a game, but it completely falls short in all areas.			"

												The Last Remnant is a game I'd recommend, however, only to a certain type of player. In this review I'll try to go over what I liked and what frustrated me, to try and give a clearer picture for those looking to buy.I should note, I finished with 95 hours played at BR45. This was also completing most of the side quests as well as recruiting all major leaders, I also did a small amount of rare monster hunting.I also edited files to give the game a larger FOV and reduced texture pop in, I high recommend doing the same before playing, you can find a guide detailing how here on Steam.Here's what I liked:The graphics, this game looks fantastic. The remnants are wonderful to view and the small areas of the citys you can visit are well detailed (this does not include the bland dungeons).The large amount of items, drops and weapons. If resource gathering, crafting and mining is your thing, TLR's got you covered. The game contains tons of different items and components. You can go down many different weapon tree's, crafting better version of each weapons, turning them into more deadly looking tools. There's a fair amount of rare and boss weapon drops in the game too.The variation of combat arts and mystic arts. These's are the ability's your characters will learn and perform. There's a huge amount, most look fairly wonderful to watch. It's also nice to assign certain Leader's to specialize in these area's.The music. This game has some fantastic music, tracks like Swirling Sands from the Great Sand Sea are a favourite.The menu's and IU. It's a fairly important part of an RPG, this game nails it. It's clean, slick and easy to use.Here's some things I didn't like:You can't manually select what a character cast during battle. I see what Square Enix was trying to do here, but it simply ended up with you turn different move's on and off before battle, just so your desired move was forced to come up during battle. It ended up becoming annoying more than anythign else.When you most need a certain command during battle, it won't show. Let's say I only have one Union left, I want to revive my other downed Unions, the game will at times, only give me attack commands rather than showing me something I really need.Poor character development. Firstly, Rush is out right annoying and the few characters who have likable personalities aren't explored, they're left to occational one liners.Battle's a boring at first. TLR is a hard game. Until you open up the better moves and are able to create more interesting Unions the battles feel alot like pressing the same button and watching a short cutscene until it's over. Now this changes somewhat later on. Anyone who's played Final Fantasy 13 will understand this very problem.I would say The Last Remnant is an aquired taste. The more I played it, the better and more interesting it's mechanic's and features got. Anyone who's interested in a challenging JRPG will want to give this a go. If you're looking for something more traditional, this may not be for you.If you're unsure my advise would be to YouTube some gameplay videos, flick over the different mechanic's on this game wonderful Wiki.

												Another of Square's fantasy rpg's. At first I was thinking this is just another Final Fantasy clone and guess what it really was'nt.. maybe a little!!!. You play the game as Rush, a young lad trying to save his sister ( there's a twist btw!!!) with the help of some friend's that join him along the way. The world revolves around some relics called ""Remnants"" that hold the balance of power and keep the inhabitants of the world somewhat protected. Now that's the games basic overview out of the way.. GaME PlaY - Good old fashioned turn based battle system, but with the added feature ""Unions"". Union's make several battle group's ranging from 2 - 5 character's in each of these that in turn each character from each group will get to attack, buff/debuff or heal as directed or @ random if ""play by ear"" is selected until your turn has ended fun fun fun !!! Now as I progressed through the game I could mine, collect, battle random monster's, puchase merc's to join my union's and even get the odd summon out!! etc etc then I got bored. There just was'nt enogh BIG moment's, most of my play through felt like one big side quest with additives of the main story chucked in hear and there.Conclusion : Boring game progression, Great battle system, not enough cgi (come on it's Square), graphic's are nice considering how old the game is...ohh and I forgot to moan about the fact you cannot change any of your union members gear/weapons, there changed @ random by the actual charcter's them selfs and most of the time there choices are poor.7/10.

												KUPO!When it first released for the Xbox 360, I was excited. Though it's price was steep and I decided to wait for it to drop. I waited MANY years for it to happen. I started to worry if I should regret the wait, but I bought it recently (Aug. 2014) and I KNOW it was a good choice to wait. It says that it's not compatible with Laptop systems, but I'm using an old Asus (mid year) 2012 laptop and it runs well enough for me to enjoy it. Al I had to do was sacrifice the graphics, which is fine for me. I have them set to the most minimal setting available. I am REALLY enjoying this title. If you like any of the Final Fantasy titles that have been released by Equare Enix (aka Squaresoft and Enix after they merged), I believe you will enjoy this tale. It's unique turn-based fighting system and it's progressive story make up for all the loss I had to give up to play (i.e. the graphics). I especially appreciate Sqare Enix's new system settings for this title. They allow you to adjust the game from the language text, language spoken, all the way through bindings of the controller, keyboard and mouse, and even allow you to adfjust the graphics and hardware settings. As a veteran player of over 20 Squaresoft/Square Enix titles, I give this one a 9/10 score :3Kupo!			"

												The Last Remnant is a unique title.  It manages to have some of the greatest voices on the face of the planet and still manages to fall short due to its writing.  The main character is voiced by Johnny Yong Bosch, so you'd think he'd be able to save the performance, right?  Nope, the writing's that dry and cliched...though moreso the former than the latter.What does make this game worth recommending, however, is the gameplay.  When I say that the title is unique, I don't mean because of the writing; games have had great voices and bad writing before.  What makes this game unique is that it has a style of gameplay unseen since Chaos World back on the NES.  Rather than controlling one character at a time and fighting monsters that way, you take several characters into a fight and control them as squads.  This isn't a Turn-Based game, either, though it may look it...or not.  This game is the type of thing that is hard to decipher from videos alone, but its more of a Tactical Turn-Based RPG, though I wouldn't go as far as to call it a Strategy RPG.This game also lends itself to an OK story, but there's enough here to keep one who is having fun interested for a while.  The areas are large and open (and this is not a linear game), the customization is one of the more unique things I've seen out of an RPG, and the character recruitment process is slightly unpolished, among other things in the game, but the idea of having so many optional characters with histories and personalities is a nice touch.  If the price is low enough (and this game can go pretty low, price-wise) then I'd definitely recommend checking it out, especially if your looking for a unique experience.			"

												Rating: 6.5/10Overview: Turn Based JRPGThe Good:+In any JRPG you will spend the majority of time in combat, so it's important that you enjoy it or else you probably won't enjoy the game. Luckily this game has an enjoyable and strategic combat system. Rather than control single units you command groups of units called unions. You can have a max of 5 party members per union and a total of 18 party members. Thus one of the first strategic decisions you make is whether  or not you should have a few large unions or many smaller unions. Each one comes with its own pros and cons. Within each union you can also set the formation which also grants certain benefits and weaknesses. I.e Higher strength vs lower magic.  In combat each union is given a list of commands depending on which party members you grouped together. When you engage with an enemy union ""deadlock"" occurs. Deadlock means you have to kill the enemy union before you can target someone else. However, you can break deadlock to heal/revive another union, however this  will mean the enemy will get an extra attack. Thus, it becomes very important to only break deadlock when necessary. In addition to this, there is also flank attacks, rear attacks, interference/interceptions,...terms the game does a decent job of explaining.  Who you attack and how many unions you send to attack is a large part of the strategy involve. Do you gang up on a single enemy union causing more damage but leaves you more vulnerable to flank attacks or do you target multiple enemy unions and hopes your party is strong enough to handle each one? These are some of decision you make during some of the tougher battles.There is also a morale meter in combat. The more you kill enemy unions, flank attack, interfere, and in general the better you do in combat, the higher the morale. A higher morale means more damage given and less damage taken. Conversely, the better the enemy does the lower the moral meter. Lower morale means more damage taken and less given. During some of the easier battles, moral doesn't play that big of a role, but when you start fighting boss enemies it's important to keep the morale as high as possible as it could be the difference between surviving an attack or having an entire union wiped out in a single blow.   You put this all together and you have a fun, fast and engaging combat system that can easily hold up throughout the course of the game. + Turbo mode option doubles the speed of battle. A great feature that speeds up gameplay.  + An option that turns off quick time events in battle and makes them automatic. During battle there are times when you have QTE granting you higher damage.  Again, a great feature to have. The only downside to this is that it has roughly  80% success rate.  + The game auto saves after every battle and every time you enter an area. I know it's not exactly a big thing but this feature saved me a lot of trouble during the course of the game. +The game is filled with interesting locations and characters. Each city feels different based on the geographical location. The areas you explore are varied, from subterranean caverns, sandy deserts to forests and swamps. Artistically they all feel great and fun to explore. + The game is filled with plenty of side quests and optional areas.

												Overall, I give the game a ""thumbs up"", but it will ultimately split players based on its quirky leveling and combat system.  There are a couple other design decisions that I thought were odd, but they did not detract from my enjoyment of this title.  The core of this game is all about the fighting, and you will do a lot of it.  The battle system takes some getting used to.  First of all, your characters fight in small groups called unions.  As you progress through the game, you unlock more characters, formations, skills, etc.  The bit that takes some getting used to is that the player does not necessarily give orders to individual characters, but only to the unions.  For the most part I did not have any issues with this system once I got used to it.  However, there were times when I needed to heal up and that option just was not available.  It was also a little frustrating when my super skills that can be used by some of the main characters would not come up during boss battles but would come up while fighting some weak creature.  The game itself does a horrible job of giving any real details about this battle system.  So much is really out of the player's hands.  Other than giving high level commands to your unions, the actual skills that are performed are up to the individual characters and can change based on the situation.  This seemed to work fairly well other than a few critical times when I needed to heal up a downed union, but this will drive some players bonkers.  Another odd bit about the battle system is the area of the fight.  You get to decide which enemy union your unions will be fighting against.  Sounds great until you see that the positioning itself makes no real tactical sense.  AOE skills may completely miss or hit all the enemy unions.  Unfortunately, the player really has no control over specific placement.  The other major leveling portion is weapons and crafting.  There are literally hundreds and hundreds of components, upgrade materials, crafting elements, etc.  The actual inventory system is terrible.  Keep that WIKI handy as it is crucial to find that one oddly-named item you need to upgrade your weapon.  Your party characters will also ask for items at times and it is satisfying to see their weapons change from low level into deadly works of art later in the game.  Be aware that for some items you need to first have to complete a quest to get the ability to farm that needed item off of a monster.  Story is overall fairly good and kept me interested.  Know that my time with the core quest was only about a quarter to third of my gametime.  The rest was doing optional content and we aren't just talking about a couple of zones.  There are whole areas and cities which can be missed.  Even some party characters will give quests which can be satisfying.  Graphics during the fight scenes are excellent with fluid movements.  On the other hand, characters moved stiffly during some of the cutscenes.  Completionists can expect a lot to do with all of the items to upgrade and quests to complete.  Most of this is good, but one of the most annoying aspects of the game for me was trying to get certain monsters to spawn for certain guild quests.  Monsters in the various zones spawn off of a set table (check WIKI) and this includes rares.  The issue is having to zone to the overworld and then back again just to get the desired monster to spawn.  It really gets tedious when the needed monster is deep in a labrynth.  It just takes away from the whole immersion and it made some of my play sessions tedious.I realize I gave some negative items in the review above but for the most part I really liked this game.  I would strongly recommend the demo first so you can see for yourself if it is something you would want to spend 100+ hours on.			"

												From the staff of Square Enix, The Last Remnant offers all the RPG excitement you have come to love with a few new tweaks. Play as Rush Sykes, you are on a mission to save your sister, and perhapes the ery world as well. Gather allies and command them in turn based combat as not just individual characters, but a unit as well. his unconventional approach may seem wierd at first, but after playing a bit, tends to grow on you as you build up your units and charge into battle in a story like no other.

												Sick of hack n' slash action games posing as the real deal? This is a great way for PC gamers to play a turn-based, strategic RPG, which unfortunately, has been a dying genre for the platform since the 90s. I don't like that it eschews a world map (a terrible trend in Japanese RPGs). However, some of the areas are vast enough to give the feel of a world map, even if you are just picking names of places to go. This isn't as good as Final Fantasy XII, the only FF that wasn't garbage after IX, but it gets the job done. The battle system could have offered more control, but it adds a different kind of strategy with who to target, and when to use what commands you are given the option to use. The texture pop-in of the UT3 engine is bad, and the cutscenes look like crap even after forcing v sync with a third-party app, but the towns and the remnants look cool. There are also many sidequests, and you'll probably need to do a lot of them because the boss battles can be rough.			"

												The Last Remnant is a game that, at times, will be unforgiving. The very beginning of the game, RNG can take you for a ride, and before you know it you have game over'd on the first fight. The combat system is unique, leaving unions to choose their specific attacks. This allows the fight to feel more real than having units spam the same move multiple times. The story isn't as expected, as the story seems to make one think how did it all happen the way it did. Overall, I would recommend this game not on the premise for the story, but for the unique combat system.			"

The battle music really gets your heart pumping for adrenaline, especially when youre troops are at high morale.One of my favourite RPG's of all time 8,5/10			"

												Rating: 6.5/10Overview: Turn Based JRPGThe Good:+In any JRPG you will spend the majority of time in combat, so it's important that you enjoy it or else you probably won't enjoy the game. Luckily this game has an enjoyable and strategic combat system. Rather than control single units you command groups of units called unions. You can have a max of 5 party members per union and a total of 18 party members. Thus one of the first strategic decisions you make is whether  or not you should have a few large unions or many smaller unions. Each one comes with its own pros and cons. Within each union you can also set the formation which also grants certain benefits and weaknesses. I.e Higher strength vs lower magic.  In combat each union is given a list of commands depending on which party members you grouped together. When you engage with an enemy union ""deadlock"" occurs. Deadlock means you have to kill the enemy union before you can target someone else. However, you can break deadlock to heal/revive another union, however this  will mean the enemy will get an extra attack. Thus, it becomes very important to only break deadlock when necessary. In addition to this, there is also flank attacks, rear attacks, interference/interceptions,...terms the game does a decent job of explaining.  Who you attack and how many unions you send to attack is a large part of the strategy involve. Do you gang up on a single enemy union causing more damage but leaves you more vulnerable to flank attacks or do you target multiple enemy unions and hopes your party is strong enough to handle each one? These are some of decision you make during some of the tougher battles.There is also a morale meter in combat. The more you kill enemy unions, flank attack, interfere, and in general the better you do in combat, the higher the morale. A higher morale means more damage given and less damage taken. Conversely, the better the enemy does the lower the moral meter. Lower morale means more damage taken and less given. During some of the easier battles, moral doesn't play that big of a role, but when you start fighting boss enemies it's important to keep the morale as high as possible as it could be the difference between surviving an attack or having an entire union wiped out in a single blow.   You put this all together and you have a fun, fast and engaging combat system that can easily hold up throughout the course of the game. + Turbo mode option doubles the speed of battle. A great feature that speeds up gameplay.  + An option that turns off quick time events in battle and makes them automatic. During battle there are times when you have QTE granting you higher damage.  Again, a great feature to have. The only downside to this is that it has roughly  80% success rate.  + The game auto saves after every battle and every time you enter an area. I know it's not exactly a big thing but this feature saved me a lot of trouble during the course of the game. +The game is filled with interesting locations and characters. Each city feels different based on the geographical location. The areas you explore are varied, from subterranean caverns, sandy deserts to forests and swamps. Artistically they all feel great and fun to explore. + The game is filled with plenty of side quests and optional areas. Completing many of these side quests allow you to hire specific characters for your party so it provides a good incentive for completing them. If you just stick to the main story you will probably miss over 50% of the game. +This is more than just a straight port to the PC.

												This game is amazing! The first thing you need to understand is this game is the fixed version. If you look for reveiws online they all talk about the Xbox and Playstation versions that were all a buggy mess. When they ported to the PC they added in all the content from both consoles and fixed the bugs and glitches.I recommend using a controller for the game as well (though it does work with keyboard and mouse but I found it more enjoyable/easier for me personally to use a controller). I used an Xbox 360 controller (built-in support for it) and had no issues whatsoever.The difficulty of the game is counter to almost every other JRPG made. The difficulty increases as you grind and level up so you can technically beat the game at lvl1 faster/easier than at lvl99+. The combat is turn based/auto-resolve where the only control over the fights you have is setting up the units in the groups and telling what style you want the group to fight as (attack/assist/defend/etc).The game part way in unlocks the ability to slow/freeze time to allow you to ""tag"" enemies so you can chain groups to increase the drop chance of items and increase the xp you get (bonus for the more enemies you fight at once).There is a New Game+ ****BUT***** it's not your normal New Game+ Mode. Instead of having all the levels, items and units you unlocked before you start over from scratch with only some things carrying over.Things that carry over as copied from the wiki article (http://lastremnant.wikia.com/wiki/New_Game_Plus)    All components    All formations    All magazines    Your current customization levels    All items that unlock arts for Rush. Rush will also begin the new game with the first art of the skills granted to him by the Orbs and Formulas. For example, carrying over the Evocation-enabling Azure Orb will grant Rush the lowest-ranked Evocation, Mystic Missile, at the start of the game.    Mr. Diggs' skill levels and digs count    All area mapsSo when you are close to finishing the game (it'll be pretty clear as you'll be able to craft really good items) DON'T CRAFT ANYTHING AND FINISH THE GAME IF YOU PLAN ON PLAYING NEW GAME+!

												basically only buy this if you're an experienced jrpg fanthe battle system is the strongest point of the game for me as its a really interesting mix of JRPG turn based combat with elements from strategy games. but i've also heard the exact opposite opinion from people who liked everything else in the game so much that they put up with the combat. so idk, maybe there's a little something in this game for everyone?the battle system is really fun and is full of a lot of interesting mechanics, but the game isn't exactly top notch at explaining it all. it took me 3/4ths of the game to feel like i completely understood the battle mechanics, and even then i found myself a little confused or frustrated at times. the battles sometimes feel very random but often times the only thing that decides the winner is your own strategypersonally i found the story to be really boring and unengaging, but not enough that it made me stop caring. there was interest in seeing where the story went, but i didn't feel like i really cared what happened. i just wanted to knowthe difficulty of the game is also skewed as ♥♥♥♥, there were boss battles that i had to retry over and over that were side by side with boss battles i felt were extremely underwhelming. maybe i was doing something very wrongalso 75% of the content of this game is sidequests. if that's your thing then cool but i found it very weird that there were entire cities and full dungeons that i wouldn't have known about if i hadn't stopped in at a town's pub. also a lot of the sidequests don't feel that special, it's often just going to a dungeon and getting to the ""end"" of it.i've said a lot of bad things about the game but it honestly is worth playing, especially at its price. i got a good 60 hours out of it and that's only with half the sidequests done. i really enjoyed creating parties and seeing what worked in battles and i really enjoyed the larger scale wars, even though there weren't too many. the story isn't that bad but i couldn't care less about the characters. idk. if you're big on rpgs with interesting battle systems i absolutely recommend this			"

												I think its safe to ignor the 66 meta score seeing how amazingly fun this game is. If youre not sure if you should buy it or not.... Just buy it. This is a great game and is best played with a controller.			"

												I TOTALLY RECCOMEND THIS GAMe TO ALL MY MASOCHIST FRIENDS. :VIn all honesty, the PC from the console version is a -huge- difference, and the PC version is highly superior, though some .ini editing may be a good idea to decrease the texture pop-in.			"

												This game is HARD. No proper explanation, no feedback from the battle system after defeat. You get beaten up a lot especially on your first play through. Ive bought this game 7 years ago and came back to it few days ago. It is still amazing , not as strong as some other games but nevertheless it is a gem. If you want a game that is easy go play any of the FF ( which I love for different reasons) 80% of this game you will spend on planning and thinking how not to get your head bashed in by a boss. But if you win - the excitment is real. I mean you feel you have achieved something. Despite all the negativity -  if you like jRPG - DO NOT OVERSEE THIS GAME !!!! it IS worth it!!!			"

												Last Remnant is a very complex and interesting game with lots of unique mechanics. The problem is that the game doesn't really tell you what those mechanics are or how they work. As a result, a lot of things will just seem random or abritrary unless you look things up in the wiki.If you do spend time on the Wiki, you can find out how arcana magic works, how people skill up, how to level your characters so that they change into certain classes, how to make sure your members learn special abilities and how to manipulate union formations to give the biggest bonus stats. It's also very easy to skip quests and therefore miss important items or recruitable players without using the wiki as many quests become unavailable after certain story developments in the game. However, personally, I found it extremely rewarding to figure out everything and create the optimum setup for my team. It really depends on if you want to invest the time and effort.The start of the game is pretty slow, as combat is very repetitive until you unlock more skill types to give you a variety of battle options. Contrary to what a lot of people seem to say, you don't have to grind whatsoever. You have the ability to slow time, making it rather easy to avoid the monsters on the field, and as monsters scale with your level it can often make it more difficult to grind. The reason people think this is because some of the bosses are very hard, but you're supposed to change your union formations to suit the fight.The music is very atmospheric, particularly the battle music, though it can sometimes be a tiny bit repetitive if you play for long periods of time. The voice acting is very good and it adds a lot in the battle when the characters yell things out while they fight, but you probably want to keep it in Japanese with subtitles. The English ones aren't that bad, just a bit cheesy.The game is quite old but some of the graphics are still amazing to me. Everything is really detailed and has it's own atmosphere. Melphina is probably still one of my favorite cities in any game - just stand on the deck and stare out at the waterfall-thing. It also makes battles a lot cooler, when you're fighting huge dragons and they're all look gorgeous. It was very forward for it's time, and even now a lot of games don't do it as well. As it's a console port, using a controller is much more smooth, and it's easier to hit the buttons during fast-paced quicktime scenes in battles using one. And, as most people didn't seem to know, you can skip cutscenes by hitting Pause/Break (where the scroll lock and print screen buttons are) and then hitting S (Not sure if there are specific controller buttons for this).

												As much love as I have for this game, I can clearly say this is one of the games that I will pull up when a friend asks me why I never tell them about obscure games made by high end companies. You should experience it. But if it's your last couple of bucks or you do not want to be cruelly punished for trying to defeat rare game as much as this. Stay away. This seems to be targeted to people who liked everything about final fantasy 12 but the gambit system and having full control over everyone. You have almost no control here, You're pretty much trusting the ai to use from a skillset you create for them to use, though those skills you can turn off, probably need to be on to grow. Go figure. Happy sails to figuring it out, or go find a guide that works, play the game in a linear fashion, or get trolled by the levelling system wondering why enemies aren't dying when they were when you left it. Let me give you a glimpse of what to expect.... Ever played dissidia? got to a high level and turned down your level and watched as everything became easier to do? That's how this gets, But you can't go back, and trading for a weaker party may not help. I say this, because it is comparable to copying answers on the wrong test. Everything that square excels at is pure gold here. And what they do not do well gets caught through the filter and is easy to spot. Most strategy games will have you building perfect moves and ideas to make the best attacks possible and use them in battle to your own benefit. This does exist, but there is no explanation whatsoever to how this works, and looking it up online takes away from the flavor of playing the game on your own, and it seems very futile without it. Strategy... Is and isn't here. Obvious options like strike from afar and stay back is normal for most strategy games, but they do not last here. You will end up putting them in the fray or getting them ambushed by using waiting as a strategy. This game is sheer punishment and one wrong turn or missed action could doom you, Autosave exists. Thank the PC gods.As far as strategy games go, this is comparable to why most games force you to select a loadout before you do anything, you can do this here, but since there is no clear sign to if your unselected skills will grow or not, I leave them on in sheer faith that they will do what is needed, and that leads you to counting mp and tracking commands to predict what moves will show, which works. Another thing that delves from strategy is how often certain individuals reassess the situation and with who and under what limits, Certain groups with high holds of hp will not see danger in not maxing out health and will get you killed. While others who may be useless in battle or offensively grief your unit, will always know when to reassess and who to heal to keep things fresh and alive. Furthermore, the system shines at learning as you go at times, as when you're on the ropes healing just over what you're getting damaged, you'll learn a new skill, and you'll get better at it or beat the opposition afterward. But the problem is that the game knows what it has to offer, and it does anything it can to ruin it for you. On overpowered bosses? part of the strategy is to die to preserve your unit hp without having enough available units to be overwhelmed by a per unit attack. That is beyond realistic, and is almost impossible to do if you have or learn a revive skill. So you turn it off. Hope the curse kills off one or more of your units, it'll kill the leader and everyone on the team will turn vegetable no matter their own individual rank or standing. So the Marquis will literally just sit there and die, not join a unit or anything, ironically they will last the longest because they retain the group's health pool. Keep all party members and take a critical group attack? Game Over. Take small groups into battle? A direct attack will kill you. Normally you would think, hey, I probably need to gain a few levels and learn some attacks. No, the game has a tiered level system less brutal than xbox, but is more rampant on you developing a strategy closely to luck and hopeful reassessment. You will not notice this until much later, or instantly if you are the thickheaded type to never put down a challenge, which is wholly enabled by a perfect auto save system. In its entirety, I can compare it to a fighting game, People watching you play will clearly see the holes and imbalances in the strategy and delivery in the game, and call how cheap it is at a constant beat, but when they ask why you still play it... my answer is more of wanting to see how much more obscene the curve balls are going to be, and when they're going to stop tearing holes through groups without fair reason. I'm sure anyone else looking for balance in the game will quickly pick up a guide and follow their lead to a balanced game and read through everything, spoilers included, to see when and where are the best times to defeat and complete enemies and quests. And I can safely say what a shame it is they weren't more introductive to newcomers to the genre as final fantasy is the normal mainstay of square, and even they made gambits a fair and eventually obvious system of priority and functionality. It'll take time to understand this game, and instead of the normal idea of overpowering enemies that wont take to strategy, You'll have to hoard equipment and hope that your allies take to it, and stop them from trying to snatch orange and yellow rare accessories just because. Which is a complete nuisance. When you get how this game works or when luck favors you, you will save over your game and have a breath of relief, because it's finally over and You won't have to sit curiously staring at the majestic enemy that can and did raze your team at every moment for no favorable reason at all. I love this game because I can see past this and ignore the fact that I can one shot bosses because a boss I almost defeated at rank 13 is practically impossible at rank 36. It sort of says, hey, the story is free, But the challenge is going to cost you. So when the game has given you a sound beating, you can go back to reading until you're annoyed, and return to try to grab the belt midswing, only finding out that this belt is now a sword and they hope you can figure out how to fight with one hand before... Too late, You died again.			"

												I actually gave this game another chance after having given up on it the first time through. Although I enjoyed it a lot more the second time around I still can't recommend this game. From the game mechanics to the presentation, eveything feels very clunky and unpolished. Pros:* Combat:It's still very much a traditonal turn-based JRPG in terms of combat although instead of just ganging up on one unit, you'll 1v1 everybody in order to prevent flank attacks which do more damage. There's an illusion that you're actually moving around like a tactical RPG ala Fire Emblem, but that's not really the case. There's also a morale system where you deal more damage if the battle's going your way, but I'm not really a big fan of it as I feel it's unnecessary and clunky.* Crafting:You're able to dungeon dive and kill monsters for components so that you can create new weapons or upgrade old weapons. Cons:* Shoddy camera:It zooms in when you're trying to look up and zooms out when you try to look down. I like my camera to be at a set distance and this made me slightly nauseous at times as I'm constantly zooming in and out as I try to look at something.* Story:I liked the game far more after I skipped all the cutscenes and ignored whatever Rush (MC) was saying. The story is whatever but Rush is very cringeworthy. * Gameplay:The game doesn't explain itself very well and I had to look up things a couple of times just to figure out what was going on. Why are orders random? What's this status effect do? I uninstalled the game after a boss cursed all my units and randomly instant KOed them and I couldn't heal or revive anybody.* No Exploration:Everything is an instance/dungeon so you pick among a list of choices on a map and teleport into that area.* JargonPersonal pet peeve. Raidlock? Deadlock? Unions? Why use such weird terminlogy? Engage / disengage and Squads / Unit is much more natural sounding.			"

												My reason for not recommending this game is technical - It is a bad port. It is not optimized for the PC.I have been to forums, trying out every suggestion to make the video and graphics better, as it should be since this is a 2009 game and my rig, though not the most powerful, still can hold its own.I have tried every graphics setting all the way down to low and none. I've lowered resolution to 1280x720. It improves performance, but only slightly.Slightly.My gosh, I mean seriously, there have been guys in forums stating that their rigs can run CRYSIS 1 and 2 fully maximized everything, and this game makes their gaming rigs cry uncle.What gives?I have one last trick that I can try. I will install this in my SSD hard drive. Hopefully it will make this game run silky smooth. But I'm not confident, as I have played another port (ENSLAVED: Odyssey to the West) in my SSD and I had cutscene loading problems.I guess its true, what they say - ports from consoles suck eggs 95% of the time.I want to like this game. Seriously, I do. I'm even willing to do the research in the wikis necessary to be able to play it the smart way. Its just dumbed down by technical reasons. Too bad.UPDATE: Keep ALL video and graphics settings to DEFAULT VALUES and it should run silky smooth. With this info, I change my recommendation from NOT Recommended to Recommended.Wooohooo!!!! Time to enjoy some Japanese RPG!			"

												If Final Fantasy XII was a franchise, then The Last Remnant would be Final Fantasy XII-2. Both produced by Akitoshi Kawazu, TLR shares a lot in common with FF XII: a fantastic medieval fantasy world, grind-heavy battle system which feels very rewarding for those who like it, a bland main character, and totally amazing soundtrack! The Last Remnant suffers from some graphic issues and a forgettable story, but where it shines, it truly shines. For you who like Final Fantasy, or generally a fantasy JRPG with good turn-based battle system, deep tactics and customization, and great music, The Last Remnant might just be the right game for you.And hey, it's pretty cheap now.

												I really like this game. This is an RPG game that does not have the regular leveling up system that most RPGs have. It instead has the Battle Point system that make's this games learning curve a little bit of steep. Pro:1. Diverse set of character's you can choose from2. Boss battle's are really difficult that the game forces you to think outside of the box and make's each battle exciting3. For an RPG, you don't need to think too much of stats allocation.4. The story is pretty good if you ask me. Cheesy. But good.Con:1. The protagonist is crazy and really difficult to like2. Repetitive monsters. The dev's were not creative enough to think of other monster's and creatures to fill the world. IMO3. Repetitive battles. 4. No love angle. The game hints on this but WTF, you can't pursue it. Oh, well.For it's current going price of $19, it's not a bad deal. I actually purchased this when it was on sale for $3 but believe me you will not waste that $19. Atleast if you like JRPGs like me.8/10			"

												Yes, buy and play this game. It goes on sale frequently. You can choose to quickly play through just the main plot or go for a very long, full completion.While I doubt that it was their intention to write their main character as so annoying as to drag the whole quality of the game down, I feel like the real complaint from detractors of this game is that the main character isn't socially normalized enough. I've met several people like the main character, though: loud, don't think deeply, altruistic, and self-censoring (re: ""Let's kick some A!""). I'd rather sit through an awkward character's screen time in the context of an engaging story than have a really targeted and over-designed main character whose only flaw is that they're too awesome for the world they exist in (ugh, it must be so hard for them).This game has a story that takes you through individual character storylines with quests that help provide cohesion if you let it, but, and this is the uniquely good part, you have the option to skip all of that. Just like you have the option to skip tactics and decision-making in combat, even going so far as to publicly write it off as wholly random or even just containing ""too much"" randomness. With the exception of the scenario of ""I want to choose exactly what every unit of every union in my army does at every moment"", other players' experience (first-hand knowledge of how the game's mechanics work together) demonstrates that there is actually a level of control you can achieve that approaches that but ultimately settles on a medium somewhere between the micro-managerial staple of other RPG games and no control. For me, I don't like the part of old-school RPGs where it's basically button mashing through a ton of menus with no risk of losing a fight. I like this game's system so much better because it only ever approaches that if you're fighting enemies that you seriously out-rank, and the game does a great job of providing difficult areas (an unlockable tiered end-game area) and monsters (they scale up).Furthermore, the main character being annoying has no bearing on the unravelling of the Conqueror's plans (It wasn't about conquering anything. It was about liberating all remnants.), the development of Athlum's independence, the fantastic descent into greed-fueled madness of Duke Hermeien, and the tragic storyline of the Conqueror's Seven. And, that's only the content from the non-missable plot in this game. In the missable plot, you get to meet and redeem those seven characters from the tight grip of the Conqueror's mythology and power.Now, does the game fall into tons of stereotypical jRPG story elements (re: tropes)? Undeniably. It includes mechas (Hermeien), main character amnesia, direct replacement characters (Emma), an every-man with a super-power (Rush), parents who are completely out of the picture of their young children's lives, a bizarre sense of fashion that tries to differentiate major characters without building towards some larger narrative, and a mascot (re: Mr. Digg) who looks like nothing else in the whole game. Are they really out of place in this game, though? I don't think so. If Rush's Talisman made him transform into a Remnant Monster (reminiscent of something mechanized), I probably would have felt it crossed the line into tripe. Or, if Emma and Emmy's characters had zero difference (other than the name).The game's best moments for me were near the end of the game when you can hear the many different voices of your characters in battle modified by the barely positive morale of that battle, signifying that you're on par with your enemies, making you realize you've amassed and trained a small army of awesome companions.In conclusion, if an ""Everyone's getting hyped!"" is good and a ""They caught us with our pants down!"" is bad, then I give this game a grade of: ""IRIIIIIIIIIIIINAAAAAAAAA!""

												With not exactly zounds of jRPG style games out there for pc Square's Last Remnant is a welcome addition to the platform. Albeit cursed on release by console reviewers coz of fps problems the game runs smooth on almost any modern pc.As for the game itself, it will not be a let down. The story is what we have come to expect from jRPG-s - a bit silly but grand and reasonably told. But the bread and butter of the game is the battle. Infact the whole battle system is much more complex than lets say the one in Final Fantasy. Getting the right skills and synergies going definitely will be a challenge. Actually the games ""general difficulty"" is rather hard and will keep you on your seat the whole time. We would have wanted to see some grander summon animations/CGI but all in all what we have in the game is sufficient.Lovely graphics, decent control, ok story a bit lacking in voice acting and summoning grandness I'd rate this game 8/10.

												This game is wonderful. If you like strategy RPG's, or RPG's at all, get it.  It's absolutely fantastic. The PC version fixes many of the graphic cut-in and gameplay issues that plagued the console release.I spent hours upon hours having a blast while gathering materials for weapons and doing the vast number of optional side missions this game offers. In fact, a massive amount of this game's content and characters cannot be accessed by merely sticking to the main plot.A challenging RPG that is great for people who enjoy item collecting.			"

												EPIC COMBAT SYSTEM: you don't control just one party, you control several parties at once on a battlefied against multiple groups of enemies. Gone is the traditional micro of turn-based combat; instead you direct each group to focus on magic or combat techniques and which enemy groups to engage - and then watch as both forces charge towards each other, resulting in interceptions, flanking, and morale swings. Late-game, the respawning normal monster combats become tedious, but the boss battles only get more EPIC.Gorgeous visuals: I was once stuck on a quest wandering around a giant desert for 2hrs or so - and I didn't care, because the sand dunes in every direction just looked so pretty.Immersive storyline of the kind SquareEnix is known for. Every character has a story.The only thing I would gripe about is the expensive crafting system. At least your party members will just ask you for any components you have that they could use - you don't micro their equipment upgrades, either.			"

												This is a surprisingly good XBOX360 port! I would strongly encourage a controller, unfortunately for those of us who'd rather just have some nicely adjusted controls, but it's pretty hard to do without. That said, the game itself has a delightfully interesting cast of characters - not just all boring animu girls and boys, believe it or not! The combat is rather unique and takes some getting used to, but is really quite interesting and fairly deep and complex - there are quite a few fan sites out there, so don't hesitate to read up a bit so you can get a good grasp of it. Altogether I would actually recommend this, as much as ports are usually lackluster at best. It runs great, plays well, and is a solid RPG.			"

												Best JRPG of the generation, lots of depth and the combat is great. The game is also difficult unlike most JRPGs and punishes you for grinding excessively and mindlessly attacking, one of my favourite things about the game is that the final boss becomes even more of a challenge depending on how many side-quests you do.It would have been nice to see the skill trees in game though, the game makes it difficult to plan ahead with your characters.

												kay...Im going to re-recommend this now that I have completely finished the game.Overall my thoughts..Its fairly decent and in ways i can see why people considered it an underrated RPG. It has a lot of highlights and from in somewhats I say it has the beginning elements of a battle style that is currently in final fantasy 13, only its heavily modified. Now to be fair, there are good things about this game and then there are some WTF moments because this kind of game..you don’t normally expect stuff like it.I shall try my best to not spoil any game play, but no promises..First off. This game is well worth the money and honestly, it is a game that, if you can get into it you can waste a good 80+ hours on. If I had spent my time maxing out my characters then I could of done this but I decided to go the casual route because it would take far too long for me to invest time into the characters.This game is also is about 13GB on your drive so expect a huge chunk gone when you install it. Not that size is a problem, it makes up greatly for its long story line as well as its ability to visually please those people who think graphics are a major concern. So yes, this isn’t FF7 style graphics or anything, its more on the lines of FF13 despite this game coming out before it.As for game play the over world is rather enjoyable. There are many animations that go on within the scenery depending on location and in someways it can make you sit there to watch the view. I do wish they added the option to take pictures because some areas of the game is very nice and worth looking into for projects or hell even a background on a PC.(yes i have done this.)Moving into the main aspects of the game, The lead character is..well..like most other RPG characters I see nowadays, being that hes slow, an idiot at times and makes you want to slap him through your monitor because hes so...eh..but more onto the game play, unlike most other console style RPGs you actually get a ton of characters to play with. You can have up to 50 max, 18 in battle, but there are restrictions.Battle mode is something you shall be in often as everything is centered around it. This game unlike other RPGs does not really have an minigames, but instead they give you a ton of side quests to do, however more on this later. Main point on the battle mode is that its entirely based on 1). your health 2). your morale and 3). luck.. So basically anyone with luckhax, you may enjoy this game greatly. Also just because the game was made in 2008 does not make it a bad game at all.One thing I loved (and will be downloading later) is the Soundtrack.. I found it rather addicting, especially when you are over-leveled in battle at times. The music keeps you active, pumped and ready for more fun as it keeps being dumped upon you time after time. If anything the most memorable thing would be the soundtrack in my opinion, but again it is just my opinion.Controller support for this game is fantastic. Not only that it naively supports the PC keyboard and mouse(not that I recommend) but it also supports third party controllers especially for big picture mode which is win. XINPUT is also supported so xbox controllers are available here as well.On a minor note. the game actually runs fine on Linux for you WINE users out there. Didn’t bother testing controller support, My controller was undetected with big picture mode but worked with every game, even games that are designed only for the xbox controller.Now, for the bad side of things.1. Grinding. You start off the game rather slow, and it seems easy at first but then your hit with enemies that are completely BS at times especially the bosses because they often get more than one turn and near the end of the game you actually have to watch out because they gain the ability to attack up to 10 times in a row killing you entirely. But yeah, grinding in this game			"

												TLR feels like a classic Square RPG between the Final Fantasy 6 and 7 era; at least as far as story and world goes. Take a completely fantastical storyline, a slightly irritating yet identifiable character, a supporting cast of twisted backstories and unusual concepts, and throw in some menu-based face smashing with just enough strategy to keep you scratching your head. It's a game that's 50% story and 50% bursts of strategic challenge in the form of difficult boss fights.My only complaint is that, like any typical CRPG-like, the grind through the dungeons can get tiring, but the story is well worth it.The system is unique, favoring macro strategy over micro. Your control over your party is limited to who you attack and how, but the choice of which specific attacks, battle order, and timing comes down to the AI and stats. This sounds boring but is actually engaging and uniqueIn the end TLR feels like a lovechild of Tactics, Final Fantasy 6 and 7, and Ogre Battle. Not a bad thing.			"

												Un excellent RPG des maitres du genre sur console Square Enix. Un produit rare sur PC, qui joint RPG et tactiques pour fournir de grand moment de plaisirs.Great J-RPG game by Square-Enix.The story got some nice elements - there also a few cliché and some of the usual plot twists - but the overall is great.The game has some tactical and stragegic choice as you not only lv up the member of your team, but you must chose which skill learn for each of them - the more you learn, the slower they progress, so the less action of that skill you learn.You need to chose for them their behavior (simple A/B/C choice when they grow their weapon) by improving their weapon - which require component to loot (mobs / reward / digging).But the most important part is the squadron. You have a limited number of characters to deploy on battle - and a maximum number of squad. Up to you to decide the number of character per squad (up to his maximum) as well as the squad formation and where the member are in each squad formation.As each formation have pro and cons, it's important to know when to use one.Plus you don't chose your squad action as you like. The actions avaible is a guidline determined by the computer depending on the squad Action point, his member skills, his HP/ buff / debuff (as well as the other's squad) and his position on the map compared to the friend / enemy squad.Add special ""limit break"" skill, pincer attack and a gestion of moral squad by squad as well as team by team affection your action and their succes, and battle can get quite interesting.Sadly, as most JRPG, you got a lot of grinding and hidden quest.The good point is : the hidden quest (who are often harder than the main quest, especially at the end of the game) are the only one really needing grinding and providing real hard fight. But they gave overpowering reward.All in all, if you like JRPG, don't miss it (it could do with an HD version by now, true)			"

												Despite what my playtime says I've enjoyed this game for roughly 30hrs. If you're hankering for an interesting JRPG with a new battle mechanic then you'd enjoy this. Fights are done with multiple groups per side and you use flanking and teaming up to destroy the enemy monsters. Looks quite nice too.			"

												The Last Remnant: The Salt BringerSeriously this game has made me so happy yet so mad, the sheer fact my old 360 and this PC have remained intact over the fruitless years of trying to conquer this game (With the physical strategy guide, mind you) is proof enough this game is worth playing.Synopsis:You start the game as Rush Sykes, who's sister, Irina, has been kidnapped. You venture off to lands unknown to find her, meet up with some people who think your parents (famous scientists btw) are amazing people. These new allies not only help you find your sister but eventually place you both on a gigiantic pedestal of world changing proportions, facing down enemies beyond that of a teenage boy who has yet to say a single curse above the occasional ""damn."" Also, character development, plot, twists of plot, and other RPG centric stuff occurs.Review:Yeah yeah, we get it. ""The combat system is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t."" Well, Square saw you wanted a ""Final Fantasy""-Esque game without the convoluted self-serving plot, and a new combat system, and you very well F!^&#!%! got it. Yes, it's randomized based on your weapons, party members, remnants, etc. But it adds a new difficulty to the game that all you weeaboos and achievement whoores have yet to appreciate. As an RPG fan, and even as a FF fan, this combat system makes me rage, quite a bit honestly. But, when you finally beat that one spot, the one you've been stuck at for ages, it's like a long awaited ♥♥♥♥♥♥. It is just fulfilling and makes you dizzy with delight... then you find another boss immediately after who wrecks your♥♥♥♥♥♥and sets you back to square one.Now you may ask; ""well if that's how you feel, why reccommend it you masochistic prick?"" Because it's difficult, because it's a mixture of chaos and control that's amazingly frustrating and we all hate ourselves that much to force ourselves to commit to something that might give us a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ heart attack when you finally get to the end of the game, just to get your♥♥♥♥♥♥stomped in because your remnant never f!^@%#^! showed on the f!&#*@^ action wheels... <Insert Pant-Like breathing>.. Honestly, the story is actually quite phenominal if you're willing to murder yourself over it, the characters are well developed by the end and it's a difficult task to beat, but we all need relentless challenging. So go kick some ""A."" enjoy some of the frame drops (that can be quite hilarious at times) and most of all, find a way to kill Mr. Dig and his nightmare eyes.			"

												With not exactly zounds of jRPG style games out there for pc Square's Last Remnant is a welcome addition to the platform. Albeit cursed on release by console reviewers coz of fps problems the game runs smooth on almost any modern pc.As for the game itself, it will not be a let down. The story is what we have come to expect from jRPG-s - a bit silly but grand and reasonably told. But the bread and butter of the game is the battle. Infact the whole battle system is much more complex than lets say the one in Final Fantasy. Getting the right skills and synergies going definitely will be a challenge. Actually the games ""general difficulty"" is rather hard and will keep you on your seat the whole time. We would have wanted to see some grander summon animations/CGI but all in all what we have in the game is sufficient.Lovely graphics, decent control, ok story a bit lacking in voice acting and summoning grandness I'd rate this game 8/10.

In fact, a massive amount of this game's content and characters cannot be accessed by merely sticking to the main plot.A challenging RPG that is great for people who enjoy item collecting.			"

												This game is certainly one of the MOST UNDERATED games of all times. I first played it on Xbox 360, there were a lot of issues with textures and frame rate, I even lost control of my army once. But as a true warrior I continued to fight those issues and believe me it was well worth it. Even if I never got to complete the game (was stuck on the same boss for several months), it was already one of my all time favorite because of the combat system.And then, the PC version came out. They fixed most of the issues and mad the game a bit easier, but still hard as hell for people who are new to this kind of combat and leveling system. I was able to complete the PC version thanks to those changes and thanks to my prior knowledge of the game. If you like challenging combats and managing multiple squads against enemies that are at least as strong as you, this game is for you.			"

												I'll start with the cons: the protagonist is a whiny kid who I couldn't care less about, the characters are almost all cookie-cutter with almost every action they make utterly predictable and the story unfolds so slowly and makes so little sense that I stopped even trying to follow it and just fell into a ""so they want me to go here"" mentality...Now having said that the pros:The gameplay is excellent and it's a lot of fun. The reason I had so much trouble following the story is that I'd spend a 1/2 hour on a story mission and then 20 hours doing other things. Training skills and upgrading weapons is an almost never ending task and you can lose yourself in it... I eventually had to tell myself enough and force myself to carry on the storyline. Equally you can lose yourself in the intricacies of so many aspects of the game. Weapon choice, formation, which characters to take and what squads to put them in: there are so many options with so many equally good choices. Many games claim to give you the option of how to win, this one really delivers.My view of this game is that the developers put great effort into the innovative gameplay and astonishing depth of detail of the mechanics but almost none into the characters themselves or the story which impressively manages to be both utterly boring and overcomplicated/confusing. It has the feel of a game developed by a statistician: all numbers and no heart. That said it's still a lot of fun and I recommend it to anyone who enjoys RPGs but, if you are like me, you'll probably find yourself getting angry that this is only a 'good' game and not the 'great' game it could so easily have been.[rant]Now to let off some steam:David- the protagonist that never was.  He's cool, already got good reasons to be fighting without needing to insert cookie-cutter motivations and would have been an original choice: the little-boy-lost character is common, the subornative-lord fighting to regain his kingdon's independence from a benevolent neighbour is totally unique in my experience.Torgal- the 'tall dark stranger'. His story also happens to be far more interesting then anything Rush gets up to... Khrynia- OMG WTF. Anyone who doesn't know what that means will hate her with a passion, anyone who knows but doesn't speak them as acronyms will hate her with a passion and anyone who does will rightly feel that she's an insult taking the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of them and will hate her with a passion. Which is a shame because, other then being the irritational equal of young Anakin Skywalker, she's actually quite interesting.Bristly Dragon Mane- proof that someone is a serious sadist. I had about 6 characters need this component and each one needed 6-12 of them... so that's about 50 BDMs in total. At 15% drop chance that means I would need to defeat 333 dragons. Even reloading before a dragon fight until you get the desired result it's going to take a huge amount of time to get what you need. Surely all those respawnable rare monsters dropping rare cores could have been put to a purpose rather then this inane dragon massacre...Accessories- such an enormous choice of accessories, with so many great options all doing slightly different things helping you tailor your 1 character to his goals... the other 17 you control are just gonna do their own thing and occaisonal borrow something you have, if you're lucky. Surely something like Skyrim could have been used: giving allies equipment that they can choose to use if they feel it is beneficial but no, you might have 10 immense accessories sitting doing nothing in your inventory and the chances are you'll only be able to give away 2-3 to your allies.... ARRGGHHBattle Menu- there isn't one... there is no way to exit the game once you start a battle except by finishing it, either by winning or losing. If you are called away or run out of time you'll need to CTRL+ALT+DELETE, if you've bitten off more then you can chew CTRL+ALT+DELETE, if you've been unlucky and something has happened you can't recover from CTRL+ALT+DELETE.... A really good game doesn't allow you to realize you are going to lose then prolong it for the next 5 minutes as you see all your allies die slowly... and .... inexorably ... bringing... you ... to ... GAME OVERI could keep going but I think that'll do for now[/rant]			"

												Having just finished it, I can say this game is interesting. Instead of playing with a party, you end up building a small army to fight. It has some peculiar ideas, but not the best execution of them in my opinion, gets very repetitive if you are going for completion. It is still a good jRPG, though far from contender to the best titles out there. I would give it a 3.5/5.Some of the members of your army make no sense being there, and there is very little story when optional team members are concerned. Speaking of story, it makes a bit of a jump here and there, and it is not the greatest at making sense. I did find it enjoyable enough to make me sit through to the end still, though you will need to ignore a plot hole here and there eventually.Most of the content you can see as artificial padding, in the form of the guild tasks, that make you reenter already done dungeons many, many times to find a specific random mob, hated those, and the upgrade system not allowing you to downright give items to your teammates required to upgrade their weapons, so you had to go back and farm them again and again if you care about your teams progression, very annoying. If you don't care, get ready to be pestered about it, because your team asks you for the things they need, over and over and over again, every time you go back to the world map you spend 5 minutes just skipping the dialogs of them asking.The battle system is a nice change from normal jRPGs. You don't directly control your characters, you organize them in units, and then give the unit a general purpose, like ""use mystic arts"". Then, some of the unit member may use a magic, while others will just regular hit, and it is random who will do what, you can train them in different classes to increase the likelihood they will do what you want, but it is no guarantee. Also, even random battles are challenging, since after each one your party automatically recovers, so there is no excuse to not go all out. The bad side is that the toughest battles end up relying too much on RNG to win.Instead of levels, you have a battle rating, and this is one of the bad things about the game. They give you a general battle rating, and enemies scale according to it, but each one of your characters has a BR as well, and they do not tell you what it is. Some stats are hidden like skill progression, and class changes possible and requirements, and some stuff that appear in old towns that makes you either have to use a guide to know of, or visit everywhere after each story step which is annoying and takes quite a bit.Also you have no control over your teams skills, and sometimes they make the worst possible decisions when leveling up. For instance, I read a lot about this skill called ""Cachexia"" and how it is essential to kill the optional bosses, and although I had 9 members of my 18 member army capable of learning it, and with magic of it's level, just one of them chose to learn it, and only while doing the dungeon that leads to the final boss. I did grind quite a bit trying to get it, but after failing to do so I ended up having to do everything without it, making it all a lot harder.Overall, I would say get this game during a sale and it is worth it, and give it a play, if only to check it's battle system in the very least, or try to do a quick story playthrough ignoring most sidequests. Don't get too much into micro managing though, or you will need to spend a lot of time on the wiki to try to do things right.			"

												10/10This is one of the best games i played in last 10 years. Innovative and fun battle system, nice FF type story, interesting characters and most important of all, not easy. If u just wanna finish the game without getting achievements and doing all optional stuff ( like getting  all characters u want and upgrading weapons to the max and killing all the optional bosses) game is pretty challenging.If u want to finish game 100% u will need around 200 hours and u will need patience, luck, hardwork, nerves of steel and most importantly walkthrough. That is perhaps only bad side of this game.No learning curve and gazilion of things and quests that are missable. And if u miss them and finish disc 2 u will not be able to obtain best weapons or even be able to access some optional  areas with strongest monsters and best drops on disc 4.If u truly wish to play this game to its full potential u should read guides that will explain what to do and what not to do and how to do it. For example, when u start game, the game  explain u how to chain monsters and   benefits of chaining, what it doesnt say to u is that by doing that u lvl fast but your stats dont increase as fast as your lvl. And in this game monsters u encounter are scaled to your lvl.So basicly u end up with lvl 50 characters who are weaker than lvl 30 character of someone who didnt chain. I had few of my friends quit this game, because they chained a lot and after  some time they  couldnt even kill normal monsters let alone bosses. In short great game, read guides, dont chain monsters and even if u despise guides and walkthrough at least read  list of things that u shouldnt miss before advancing to disc 3 ( i think )			"

												This game is surprisingly good. For an RPG game its a well thought out game with all its features and battle system. If you want a game to spend many hours into it then look no further; it took me over 70 hours to beat this game for the first time and that's leaving a good chunk of the side missions left untouched. Picked this game up when steam had it on sale for $10 making it a great deal. Battle system took a little bit to get used to. But once you play enough you will get used to it, and it is nice being able to initaite encounters rather than random encounters happening as soon as you take a few steps. So yeah good game, story isn't too bad but it could have been so much better I think. Yay for being able to have Japanese voices with subtitles as an option! If you have an xbox ccontroller you can use that and it would probably be a little more comfortable than using the keyboard, oh and if you don't be sure to change  the settings to keyboard buttons!

												The only X-box 360 game I EVER owned that I never finished (due in part to pure rage), now ported to PC with more features (and less lag). It's what I'd describe as a Tactical-RPG, with turn-based elements relying on planning and forethought. Instead of single units (sending a lone unit out into a fight becomes and obviously poor idea), you have a ""Union"", a group of units you have mixed together to suplement each other's strengths and weaknesses. Level grinding is HIGHLY recommended, and so-called ""side-quests"" become a necessity if you want any kind of gear that will stand up to the main story's OVERPOWERED bosses.			"

												From the team that brought you the SaGa series comes this tactical JRPG with more than meets the eye. Technical hurdles from the 360 version are not apparent in the PC release (other than occasional texture pop-in) And I experienced screen tearing, and with no ingame v-sync option, I had to turn on v-sync via my Nvidia control panel.Whilst this game isn't for everyone, those that fall in love with it appreciate its deep micromanagement, lengthy battles and challenging bosses. Artstyle reminds me of Final Fantasy XII and the lengthy side quests and atmosphere remind me of Final Fantasy XI.A stellar soundtrack too, brilliantly composed.100+ hours of content. And exploring and unraveling its mysteries can be deeply satisfying... if you're able to put in the time.			"

I've no idea how fans of the original got by without turbo though.The story was sadly full of gaps and could have been padded out so much better. It was nice to see an openly in love gay main character / side character  (people will debate this, people are idiots).Overall a good way to pass the time, plenty to do and see, lots of extras to find if you are more of a completionist.I just wish there'd been an option to have turbo battles with super slow quick time events - would have been best of both worlds.

												Pretty damn nice game. This gem didn't get the marketing you'd expect from most SE games, so it flew under the radar with a lot of people. But this gem has a fabulous story. Game mechanics are in part hidden, meaning there's actually a lot of different factors that influence your battles which are either never explained, never shown, or both. You'd think this to be a deal-breaker, but it isn't. It's still fairly easy to understand combat and get through the game, without fully understanding all of it. Understanding simply gives you the freedom to really tailor your strategies to your preference.But the one main point is most definitely the story, which is very good! Definitely worth playing once, quite enjoyable playing three times.The game was made with english voice acting in mind, so picking english will have the sync with the mouths down just right.			"

												Overall a fun game and a solid port from the xbox 360. While the game does allow for the use of keyboard and mouse it is almost required that you use a gamepad for this game. While the gameplay is fun and reminescent of other such JRPG's there are a few flaws some of which include texture issues with the cutscenes, jerky walk animations from NPCs and the dialouge and storytelling leave a lot to be desired. Overall 7/10.			"

												Romancing Saga team strikes again, in a different title.Expectedly experimental and wild, thrilling if you know what you are doing.The randomness might cause some fraustrations(although it is consistent with all other saga series), but it can also come across as exciting turnarounds.It is your game if you are not a Jrpg fundamentalist or any other kinds of RPG fundamentalist.

												This game is surprisingly good. For an RPG game its a well thought out game with all its features and battle system. If you want a game to spend many hours into it then look no further; it took me over 70 hours to beat this game for the first time and that's leaving a good chunk of the side missions left untouched. Picked this game up when steam had it on sale for $10 making it a great deal. Battle system took a little bit to get used to. But once you play enough you will get used to it, and it is nice being able to initaite encounters rather than random encounters happening as soon as you take a few steps. So yeah good game, story isn't too bad but it could have been so much better I think. Yay for being able to have Japanese voices with subtitles as an option! If you have an xbox ccontroller you can use that and it would probably be a little more comfortable than using the keyboard, oh and if you don't be sure to change  the settings to keyboard buttons!

												The only X-box 360 game I EVER owned that I never finished (due in part to pure rage), now ported to PC with more features (and less lag). It's what I'd describe as a Tactical-RPG, with turn-based elements relying on planning and forethought. Instead of single units (sending a lone unit out into a fight becomes and obviously poor idea), you have a ""Union"", a group of units you have mixed together to suplement each other's strengths and weaknesses. Level grinding is HIGHLY recommended, and so-called ""side-quests"" become a necessity if you want any kind of gear that will stand up to the main story's OVERPOWERED bosses.			"

Whole game has a challenging difficulty and its not for those that like to easily breeze thru game, it requires grinding to increase your stats,learn new skills and enhance existing ones. Combat is uniqe and takes some geting used to since you dont control directly what each character does but thats what i really like about it. Story is great. Overall, anyone who likes challenge in thier RPG game,I would recomend to try this one.			"

												I put quite a bit of time into this game(Circa 2009) trying to upgrade all characters I was using in my party before finally beating the game. Alot of times this game seems at odds with itself, leveling can cause issues due to the game attempting to rectify ease of difficulty that can arise from overleveling, but I was overleveling from the constant grind, attempting to get certain rare creatures to spawn in certain zones for equipment upgrades. I wish there was a follow up game with more polish. I was one of the fortunate souls who did not attempt to play this on the Xbox 360, and opted for the PC version which apparently was in a better state upon its release. The game is not without its bugs, and issues with settings as framerates go bonkers without any reason. The gameplay is rare in which you have teams of characters who work together to fight the enemy. Sometimes this system worked out, sometimes it became muddled with confusion. I would liken it to something similar to Bahamut Lagoon on the SNES which I recommend people play if they enjoyed this game. Although BL leans towards strategy games of the time. There are some areas where a fight essentially relies on trying it over and over and getting by purely on luck. These certain events were a letdown in many cases. There were alot of very poor rpgs being made at the time of this games debut and in general during its console generation, and it was a breath of fresh air in its attempt to add something to a genre dying from lackluster gameplay, visuals, and repetition, Hopefully we will see a game soon, likened as a spiritual successor or inspired by it.

												The Last Remnant is one of my favorite games of all time. I'll admit, it doesn't have the most interesting plot ever. Actually, it's pretty mediocre. There's a lot of characters but 95% of them are not memorable. The world is relatively pretty and well done, with a good amount of variety and stuff.So what do I like about the game? It's combat system. It's unique and I have never ever found anything similar to it to this day. It's easier to see for yourself so I'm not going to describe it. All I'll say is that it takes a lot of time to master it and killing the secret boss won't be easy at all. Have fun!			"

												I've been a fan of the Final Fantasy series for years (specially III and VII). Although it's not Final Fantasy, The Lst Remnant is a pretty good jrpg. The story is great, the graphics and animations beautiful. I found it kind of clumsy without a controller (movement ""wasd"" and mouse, action battle triggers arrows, etc.). With a XBox 360 Controller the game is really very playable and easy to learn. The combat system is excellent and hard to master. The only thing I would pehaps change in the game is the ability to handle the equipment of your party (you can only control the equipment of the main character). Instead of it, the party members ask you to go around the world to find specific materials or for some weapons you have not equiped.Bottom line. A must have for all jrpg game fans. It was worth every cent I spent on it.Graphics: 98%Music: 95%Voice act (Japanese): 100% <- It's well deservedPlayability: 86%Overall: 92%			"

It instead has the Battle Point system that make's this games learning curve a little bit of steep. Pro:1. Diverse set of character's you can choose from2. Boss battle's are really difficult that the game forces you to think outside of the box and make's each battle exciting3. For an RPG, you don't need to think too much of stats allocation.4. The story is pretty good if you ask me. Cheesy. But good.Con:1. The protagonist is crazy and really difficult to like2. Repetitive monsters. The dev's were not creative enough to think of other monster's and creatures to fill the world. IMO3. Repetitive battles. 4. No love angle. The game hints on this but WTF, you can't pursue it. Oh, well.For it's current going price of $19, it's not a bad deal. I actually purchased this when it was on sale for $3 but believe me you will not waste that $19.

												Excellent game in my eyes, Though I wish I could have more control of my characters in combat. The auto commands are actually pretty well implemented, making the system it's own style rather than a burden to get around.  The Plot is interesting and you really feel like you're part of the world rather than the world being tailored for your exploration.  Alongside that, you have a say in how you want to structure your character based on what skills you use.The customization of this game really shines in creating unions.  Not only can you structure your own parties, but you can also hire other characters to fill in the ranks for when story characters enter and leave throughout the game.My only nitpicks are I wish I could control each unit in a union directly, but that's nitpicking, andthat they had a bestiary to see where to farm drops, also nitpicking.

You can choose to quickly play through just the main plot or go for a very long, full completion.While I doubt that it was their intention to write their main character as so annoying as to drag the whole quality of the game down, I feel like the real complaint from detractors of this game is that the main character isn't socially normalized enough. I've met several people like the main character, though: loud, don't think deeply, altruistic, and self-censoring (re: ""Let's kick some A!""). I'd rather sit through an awkward character's screen time in the context of an engaging story than have a really targeted and over-designed main character whose only flaw is that they're too awesome for the world they exist in (ugh, it must be so hard for them).This game has a story that takes you through individual character storylines with quests that help provide cohesion if you let it, but, and this is the uniquely good part, you have the option to skip all of that. Just like you have the option to skip tactics and decision-making in combat, even going so far as to publicly write it off as wholly random or even just containing ""too much"" randomness. With the exception of the scenario of ""I want to choose exactly what every unit of every union in my army does at every moment"", other players' experience (first-hand knowledge of how the game's mechanics work together) demonstrates that there is actually a level of control you can achieve that approaches that but ultimately settles on a medium somewhere between the micro-managerial staple of other RPG games and no control. For me, I don't like the part of old-school RPGs where it's basically button mashing through a ton of menus with no risk of losing a fight. I like this game's system so much better because it only ever approaches that if you're fighting enemies that you seriously out-rank, and the game does a great job of providing difficult areas (an unlockable tiered end-game area) and monsters (they scale up).Furthermore, the main character being annoying has no bearing on the unravelling of the Conqueror's plans (It wasn't about conquering anything. It was about liberating all remnants.), the development of Athlum's independence, the fantastic descent into greed-fueled madness of Duke Hermeien, and the tragic storyline of the Conqueror's Seven. And, that's only the content from the non-missable plot in this game. In the missable plot, you get to meet and redeem those seven characters from the tight grip of the Conqueror's mythology and power.Now, does the game fall into tons of stereotypical jRPG story elements (re: tropes)? Undeniably. It includes mechas (Hermeien), main character amnesia, direct replacement characters (Emma), an every-man with a super-power (Rush), parents who are completely out of the picture of their young children's lives, a bizarre sense of fashion that tries to differentiate major characters without building towards some larger narrative, and a mascot (re: Mr. Digg) who looks like nothing else in the whole game. Are they really out of place in this game, though? I don't think so. If Rush's Talisman made him transform into a Remnant Monster (reminiscent of something mechanized), I probably would have felt it crossed the line into tripe. Or, if Emma and Emmy's characters had zero difference (other than the name).The game's best moments for me were near the end of the game when you can hear the many different voices of your characters in battle modified by the barely positive morale of that battle, signifying that you're on par with your enemies, making you realize you've amassed and trained a small army of awesome companions.In conclusion, if an ""Everyone's getting hyped!"" is good and a ""They caught us with our pants down!"" is bad, then I give this game a grade of: ""IRIIIIIIIIIIIINAAAAAAAAA!""

												Absolutely amazing game! The art style is almost a complete replica of the art style of Final Fantasy 12. Although the way you can avoid battling monsters in the game is similar to FF12, the combat system once in  battle is entirely different. Even if you buff up a single character's damage as much as possible, you can still be royally beaten to death. Strategy is a must in the battles. Flanking systems, methods of offense instead of straight skills, and random during-attack extra damage inducing button input all are brought to this new game. Spent 12 straight hours playing it for the first time. Although the combat system is a bit confusing at first, you figure it out relatively quickly over the countless battles you'll be put into. 100% worth the buy and play.			"

												9.4/10So... I have played this game when it was on the Xbox 360 and one major improvement is that now you have a new game plus available after the battle with the last boss. over all this is an absolute blast tons of replay value and the price is amazing. if you like RPG that are a bit out of the ordinary battle systems and some what of an open world theme you will love this game. if you have not played this game I strongly recommend this game. the reason for the above rating is while this is a great game there are some.....issues. During battle you have unions. You issue orders (somewhat) to them. If it is an order to heal or support the others sometimes when union A is order to help union B and union B heals them selves but takes damage again the union A's orders are changed and they do not heal union B. this is just one type if issue i have run into issues with the battle system. I would understand the change in orders if unions stayed healed and what not. Graphics could use some work/ touch ups. Character hair, armor, things of that nature.still overall give this game a try.			"

												A lot of fresh and unique RPG elements, and super-complex mechanics (so complex, in fact, that you won't understand even half of them unless you consult the wiki). Overall, it feels extremely ahead of its time, and a great reference for Tactical RPG lovers.I thoroughly enjoyed this game, and it's a shame that the tactical combat system wasn't used by Square Enix for any other games since. Would love to see something similar in the future.Although the extra content becomes very repetitive after a while, the main story is quite interesting and the setting / mythos is compelling.Absolutely recommended.

												I have no idea how to describe the game as a whole, but here are some things that I like and dislike about this game.Pros:- THE BATTLE SYSTEM!-Interesting characters along with a story and personality for alot of them.-A near infinite amount of strategic customization/elements (unions, arts, equips, characters)-Enemies! Lots and lots of enemies! (Rare ones too!)-The graphics! (They're all sparkly)-You can summon bosses during battles-Bosses are not just your typical 4 vs 1 beat-em-ups but are basically an army vs an army.-Side-quests!Cons:-A near infinite amount of customization (When you get alot of members, they're always bugging you for stuff)-Mountains upon mountains of materials.-The learning curve (However there are wikis and guides out there to help with the basics)-A main character that doesn't think :/I highly recommend this game, because while it does have its good sides and bad it is not a game to miss out on. The battle system is one of the most interesting mechanics I've ever seen in RPGs and the pros more than make up for some of the faults of the game (which is mostly the learning curve).Score:french toast / 5			"

												A new (relatively) classic of JSRPG's, The Last Remnant has all of the aspects a good Squenix strategy game should have.The combat is easy to learn and rewarding when mastered. Some people may have some issues at first if they haven't been paying attention, or are mashing a single command for an entire battle, but along with the customization for weapons and skill progression system, it makes combat a worthy endeavor in any case. The story is good as far as I've seen, the protagonist is kind of.. well typical, but typical of many RPG's you just have to enjoy the ride through the main story and enjoy the world around it. Solid 7/10, worth trying, enjoyable new take on turn-based combat from a favorite studio.			"

												This game is unique among it's genre. Not only does it stand out with the number of people that take part in one active battle, it scales enemies based on a BR system, instead of a level system. BR is kind of like your overall level for everything you have accomplished, so like your basic skill level for the game. Instead of scaling of stats, it scales of player's skill, in a way. It has a great story and will take you on an adventure. The only thing I didn't like, was the english voice acting. It was subpar. The Japanese was decent, but the translations came off as corny most of the time. There is many side quests that are extremly hard as well as the difficutly jump for the last boss on the main story.			"

												Pros: The storyline is great and solid. Definetly something you would expect from a Square Enix game. I could play this game for hours due to the interesting storyline. Cons: The gameplay seems to be missing something. At times I have no idea what is going on and sliently hope that I am not losing. This game causes my laptop to overheat and crash, even with a fan underneath. Though, this may be due to my laptop being older (HP Pavilion 6).  So players with ""older"" PCs may need to take precautions (fans, running limited processes, decrease brightness, etc). Word to the wise: Use a controller for this game (either an XBox or PS3).It might take a little time to set up, but will save you a major headache later. The controls are set up for consoles (for which it originated from) rather than the PC.			"

												The Last Remnant is definitely an interesting game; innovative battle style that I have never seen before, making gameplay actually quite fun.  I don't have a whole lot to say that others haven't said better, but this is what I think:Pros:- Rush's cheesy lines cracked me up.  It was like... well the writers were trying to be cool so he uses a lot of slang that cracked me up.  - While this was no Final Fantasy, the character detail and graphics are great.  I love a game where you can look closely at a character and see their clothes in great detail.  - Battle is fun, and when you are not having a super tough time you can watch a movie, or read a book while you are waiting for the battle to get over.- Voice acting was pretty goodCons:- Without a controller, playing on a keyboard is terrible.  You can absolutely tell that this game was originally made for the 360.  - Story is a bit basic, though admittedly not a huge turnoff for me.- I am not 100% sure that rare enemies return once you see them.  This kind of sucks, because they often tear me a new one, and I have to get experience before I come back to play.  - Some of the game functions are very dynamic, but they are also very confusing.  All in all, I really like this game.			"

												A refreshing change in gameplay. Although the game does start slow and somewhat hard, it progresses to be on a perfect pace on gameplay with the story progressing on an equal scale, making for a perfect blend of a gaming experience. The gameplay mechanics is based off of randomly generated moves based on what you already know, and is changed based upon who you target. Your playable characters are grouped into parties that will be affected in different ways depending on who is in it. What affects the group? In general, the type of combat preference your characters have, the formation you have the group in (You'll see soon enough in the game once you can recruit multiple members into your parties), and finally how many people are in a party. You can have multiple parties.Speaking of the story specifically, it is well written, but is by no means a master piece, but as I had said, the story the game brings is fulfulling and is more than enough to please you.Gameplay specifically, as I had previously mentioned, this game starts out slow and somewhat hard. Grinding is not exactly mandatory in this game, but is somewhat appreciated if you refuse to fight boss battles over and over. The game really wants boss battles in this game to live up to it's name. And in the beginning of the game, boss battles are excepionally harder than most fights you will encounter.Also, a REALLY IMPORTANT note to make, all boss battles are preceded by a cutscene of varying length, usually more than a minute or more in length. This is important to mention because CUTSCENES ARE UNSKIPPABLE, meaning that if you fail a boss battle, you will have to suffer watching the same cutscene over and over. Hence, grinding is somewhat a real recommendation early on in the game. If you are finding yourself in this loop of a boss battle failing, I reccomend going back and grinding a level or two and consider upgrading your equipment and changing your parties' formations. Also, shift tab is reccomended if you can't stand the cutscenes. This is probably the only problem you will have with this game.^Tl;dr: Grind if you hate time passing you by without making progress.Also, another note worth mentioning is that this game has a New Game+, which means that after you beat the game, you can play through it again retaining all your arts you learned as well as components you use to make items in the game.Although if you plan to play New Game+, you should SPLIT ALL UNNEEDED ITEMS before the final boss. You lose everything in material things but components, you even lose your gold. *Any gold you get in New Game+'s start is based on how many quests you did. Although, a perfect thing to be mentioned is that this game might not be for everyone. But with everything in mind, this game is by all means a decent thing to buy, especially consideing its low cost on steam.*Can skip cutscenes with an xbox controller, onlyAlso, a note worth mentioning, this game is fully xbox controller compatible, and the game is automatically set to think you are playing with an xbox controller. Change the controls first thing you get into the game, unless you want to be forced to by invonvenience^^^^^^^^^ TL;DR: I RECCOMEND THIS GAME, GRIND IF HARD. GAME IS STILL GOOD.			"

												I love this game.  It's one of the best JRPG's (if not one of the few) to grace the PC.  The combat system is a real change-up compared to most JRPG's as it makes you think strategically about your battle parties and the best way to utilize your men, especially in boss battles.  The story is fascinating and there are plenty of side quests to keep you entertained as well.			"

												JRPGs were a holy grail of console gaming in the 8 and 16 bit days. In the 32, there were classics of the genre like Eternal Arcadia, Sakura Wars and Grandia II. Oh, no Final Fantasy? Haven't played once since the Sony monopoly began, which was why this, as one of Square-Enix's cross platform (initially Xbox 360 exclusive) JRPGs was so enticing. I longed to see what they had in store for me. HIronobu Sakaguchi was gone, but I had Lost Odyssey and Blue Dragon, both excellent if not old fashioned games. Sadly, Last Remnant (Last? What is it about JRPGs from this pedigree exhausting the same thesaurus entry?) ran terribly on console. It's release on PC has greatly alleviated these problems, but alas, something about the game leaves me cold. It plays great and has a unique combat and character system, yet ,,, the last remnant of what I onced loved about the genre has dried up. Next stop, Xenoblade and Last Story (there we go again!) for Wii. Here I come.			"

												an awsome JRPG. it got some awsome features and they have added stuff that many people doesnt know what do (not even the wiki's). it got a good turn-based combat system. some awsome characters. the game can be boring if you grind to much (which you may need to if you dont fight to many enemies and just rush through the game). it also have crafting in it. crafting is (sadly) the only way to get some of the best weapons in the game. it got some annoying stuff to. you cant customise your allies equipment. they have to ask you for stuff (which they rarly do). but if you are looking for a good turn-based JRPG with a good history then you should buy this			"

												Despite a rather low metacritic score (66), I still find the gameplay rather infectious, and easy to get into. However, there is talk about how the PC version's difficulty is much higher than that of the consoles, so expect a challenge.If you didn't know, The Last Remnant is a squad turn-based game, I guess you could call it. Since you give orders to a squad of up to 5 characters, instead of individually. Many might find this irritating, but I see it as a nice change from regular turn based combat.Good graphics, good dialogue, and good gameplay. Overall, a great game.			"

												This game is SquareJP's finest work this generation. The story, whilst being somewhat generic is a shining example of how you take a generic concept and make it more than that. In this game, you do not control a few singular characters, instead you have 'unions' which you form with a key character acting as a general so to speak, with bodyguards and special units in the union. You can have several unions depending on your battle level which allows for some jaw dropping gigantic battles against hostile unions. The traditional japanese roleplaying elements are heavily modified, with RTS style tactics of engaging and 'deadlocking' enemies in a close combat fight whilst your other unions move around to flank them or intercept enemies who are trying to flank your unions whilst they are in a deadlock. All of this is controlled with a sleek, stylish interface and battle controls identical to a traditional JRPG and is very easy to use whilst having respectable depth. If you think that the game is an actual RTS in the way it handles, and are put off by it, don't be because it isn't. This is a fantastic example of how you can merge two genres together whilst catering to everybodies tastes.At £7.99, this game is more than worth it, and is a no brainer in a sale. I'm not even a huge JRPG fan at all, and other than Final Fantasy 4, 7, 13 and Lost Odyssey, I have never played any other ones and I have to say this one is easily the best. If like me you were left with a sour taste in your mouth after the latest, awful Final Fantasy games, The Last Remnant is a breath of fresh air, a fantastic new IP and proof that Square have not lost their touch.9/10			"

												The Last Remnant is a fantastic game. I have spent over 60 hours playing it (my profile may say 40 but I've spent some time playing offline). If you like strategic but fast combat, this could be the game for you. There are tons of sidequests that give meaningful and useful rewards and many different characters that you can use in combat. For a JRPG, the story is not very strong, however it does have some interesting concepts.The game can be complicated at times, with complex character progression as well as difficult concepts such as battle formations, but once you gain an understanding of these concepts the game can be very engaging. The Last Remnant Wiki will also help a lot.Overall I'd give this an 9-9.5 out of 10. The game is very addictive and has great graphics (for its time) and good voice acting for the most part, but I believe you can choose to listen to Japanese voices if you like. An Xbox controller is highly recommended for this game, but not required.Anyway, I obviously really like this game if you couldn't already tell from how much I've written about it. I've enjoyed all 60 hours of my game time and I bet you would too!			"

												For being pretty much the only actual full console JRPG that got moved onto PC, it's pretty good. It's definitely a love or hate game, but there's a reason for that. It's graphically impressive still for a game that released in 2008/9, offers really fun combat and pre-battle strategy.The Last Remnant is unnecessarily complex. If you attempt to play through this game normally, even reading all hints, tips, and tutorials the game gives you, you will never fully learn or understand the battle system. It's a really cool battle system, in fact my favorite turn-based combat system, incorporating a little (dumb) use of RNG. This should be a fatal flaw of the game design by not telling you all the basics of a JRPG game, but it's fun if you figure it out. I had to reinstall and try this game three times before it clicked.Things you should know before considering playing this game:1: This is the Dwarf Fortress of JRPG's in complexity so you will probably need to read the whole game wiki to FULLY understand and prepare your unions/parties/units2: If you are too low of a battle rank, the game is hard. If you are too high of a battle rank, the game is hard. If you grind, you will get punished. Basically, if you reach a point where a battle is super hard, you've either ♥♥♥♥ed up or you're just not high enough level. The game doesn't give you a clear idea of which it is.  By ""grinding"", I mean heading to an open field with monsters and clearing it all out just for the sake of grinding. If you're on your way to an objective or on a quest, do fight.3: If you HAVE to battle, DO NOT BATTLE A SINGLE MOB AT A TIME. Battle Rank raises depending on the amount of battles you have, not experience from battles. Try to get every single possible mob in one chained link, then initate the battle. If it's too hard with all those monsters, do one by one anyway.If you didn't read everything I typed above this line of text then do not play this game.TL;DR it's an extremely complex game that offers zero explanation of it's systems because there's no tutorial or visual presentation of information, but the high points are addictive and very fun.

 An engaging game providing many hours of entertainment for those into strategy and JRPG The last remnant, while being a relatively old JRPG and slightly complicated understand, is a game that not only has a good story line with fairly well made cutscenes but provides that optimal amount of challenge as well as a non repitative way to grind in order to beat a challeging boss or complete a chapter of the story. Pros: - Good storyline- Well done up cutscenes- Fresh concept to rpg team building and combat- Many hours of gameplay- Good replayability(New Game +)- Good spread of characters allow for many hours of trial and error  Cons: - Xbox control based tutorials make it hard to learn to play at the start- Certain concepts like upgrading weapons for your team are extremely hard to understand- It can become really hard to find or farm for certain items towards the later half of the game- Some wrong decisions in game can really cost you 8/10 A good game that you will come to love after giving it a chance and reading some online guides.

												It's a fairly good game, entertaining enough so far. It seems to have fairly decent depth, the world seems moderately vibrant, the combat is complex (perhaps a tad much) and the animations and graphics are solid. There's two big gripes I have with this game, one being a lack of aesthetically impactful design in terms of music. The music is bland and barely memorable. Not much more to be said for it.The other gripe is that the game is a tremendously lazy port, to the point where all instructions show an Xbox controller button rather than a keyboard key. Rewriting the tutorials would've done wonders, but instead, players are forced to look up and perhaps even jot down all the important keys. This is particularly painful with the battle mechanism of critical calls, something akin to the action commands from Mario & Luigi and Paper Mario. The screen will show the A, B, Y and X buttons or the Right Trigger, and you're supposed to figure out what to press without any appropriate visual cue. (In case you're interested, it's the arrow keys for the A, B, Y and X buttons, and space bar for the Right Trigger)Other than that, the game seems rather promising and I hope it will continue to deliver.

Everything goes on a general world map where you can select stages and cities. The battle system is some kind of chess board, where every piece is a group of characters (party) and depending how you move every group, you will get better results on battle.It's a very good game, totally recommended, specially if it's on sale.

												Wow, what an adventure.To get to the nitty gritty, let me focus on a couple of parts of the game: the battle system, the story, and the ending.The battle system:The battle system of this game is unique and definitely improved the game in my opinion. If you are unfamiliar, you have multiple squads under your commands that attack in sets. If you've played Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic, it is somewhat similar, but much more smoothly executed and on a much grander scale. The battles feel huge in certain cases, and it really adds to the experience in that it makes it feel like you're fighting a war right off the bat, rather than just skirmishes.10/10The story: The story was very engaging, and this characteristic is largely why I prefer RPGs to other types of games. Though it has a couple of predictable plot twists, the world is immersive. The side quests definitely add to the story and add to the immersive-ness of the world, as well as providing tangible advantages such as recruiting valuable characters and the acquisition of powerful weapons. There were a couple of problems, such as the ending feeling rushed, but I'll get into that in the next section.8/10The ending: The ending was absolutely the worst part of the game. I think it's odd to feature the ending as a part of the review, but I felt very strongly about it. This game can be split up into two fairly individual parts (to the point where one could have actually been a sequel). The second half of the game felt rushed compared to the first part. I felt like, where the story had a comfortable and reasonable progression in the first half, I felt like I was barrelling through the story when I went at the same pace for the second. At endgame, the game really just kind of feels like it skids to an emergency halt. The final boss is scaled in difficulty to the progression of your character, which is nice, and the final boss did take me a few tries, but when I did actually beat it, I was for some reason a little disappointed. The ending cutscenes did give me a feeling that I was finished, but the satisfaction wasn't really there. For the reasons that the ending was sort of abrupt, but well written, I give the ending a6/10Overall:I highly recommend this game, overall 8/10			"

												My reason for not recommending this game is technical - It is a bad port. It is not optimized for the PC.I have been to forums, trying out every suggestion to make the video and graphics better, as it should be since this is a 2009 game and my rig, though not the most powerful, still can hold its own.I have tried every graphics setting all the way down to low and none. I've lowered resolution to 1280x720. It improves performance, but only slightly.Slightly.My gosh, I mean seriously, there have been guys in forums stating that their rigs can run CRYSIS 1 and 2 fully maximized everything, and this game makes their gaming rigs cry uncle.What gives?I have one last trick that I can try. I will install this in my SSD hard drive. Hopefully it will make this game run silky smooth. But I'm not confident, as I have played another port (ENSLAVED: Odyssey to the West) in my SSD and I had cutscene loading problems.I guess its true, what they say - ports from consoles suck eggs 95% of the time.I want to like this game. Seriously, I do. I'm even willing to do the research in the wikis necessary to be able to play it the smart way. Its just dumbed down by technical reasons. Too bad.UPDATE: Keep ALL video and graphics settings to DEFAULT VALUES and it should run silky smooth. With this info, I change my recommendation from NOT Recommended to Recommended.Wooohooo!!!! Time to enjoy some Japanese RPG!			"

												One of the best spins on a turn-based battle game! You control a mini army that grows stronger with every battle along with making great strategies and actively taking part in the action itself. If you want a challenge, this game fits that request.			"

												If Final Fantasy XII was a franchise, then The Last Remnant would be Final Fantasy XII-2. Both produced by Akitoshi Kawazu, TLR shares a lot in common with FF XII: a fantastic medieval fantasy world, grind-heavy battle system which feels very rewarding for those who like it, a bland main character, and totally amazing soundtrack! The Last Remnant suffers from some graphic issues and a forgettable story, but where it shines, it truly shines. For you who like Final Fantasy, or generally a fantasy JRPG with good turn-based battle system, deep tactics and customization, and great music, The Last Remnant might just be the right game for you.And hey, it's pretty cheap now.

												I really like this game. This is an RPG game that does not have the regular leveling up system that most RPGs have. It instead has the Battle Point system that make's this games learning curve a little bit of steep. Pro:1. Diverse set of character's you can choose from2. Boss battle's are really difficult that the game forces you to think outside of the box and make's each battle exciting3. For an RPG, you don't need to think too much of stats allocation.4. The story is pretty good if you ask me. Cheesy. But good.Con:1. The protagonist is crazy and really difficult to like2. Repetitive monsters. The dev's were not creative enough to think of other monster's and creatures to fill the world. IMO3. Repetitive battles. 4. No love angle. The game hints on this but WTF, you can't pursue it. Oh, well.For it's current going price of $19, it's not a bad deal. I actually purchased this when it was on sale for $3 but believe me you will not waste that $19. Atleast if you like JRPGs like me.8/10			"

												So many people hate on this game, but personally I enjoyed playing the game. I would have been nice to be able to save whenever, especially seeing as how you are sent back to the main screen and forced to reload your last save after losing to bosses or big battles and have to do it all over again. This could be easily fixed with an autosave feature. I do love the combat system, where most of the hate is coming from, and the interesting storyline.			"

Every time I play this game I get so obsessed its not even funny, but this game is mint. Story is sorta cliche but it has its twists and things. The best thing is the combat, the whole system is amazing and I honestly cannot see why no other game ever did anything like it. Such a unique experience that keeps me coming back every damn time and I spend endless hours of my life on it.			"

												Start of the game is little slow and takes time till you get more party members that you can use,but after that game kicks off. Whole game has a challenging difficulty and its not for those that like to easily breeze thru game, it requires grinding to increase your stats,learn new skills and enhance existing ones. Combat is uniqe and takes some geting used to since you dont control directly what each character does but thats what i really like about it. Story is great. Overall, anyone who likes challenge in thier RPG game,I would recomend to try this one.			"

												I put quite a bit of time into this game(Circa 2009) trying to upgrade all characters I was using in my party before finally beating the game. Alot of times this game seems at odds with itself, leveling can cause issues due to the game attempting to rectify ease of difficulty that can arise from overleveling, but I was overleveling from the constant grind, attempting to get certain rare creatures to spawn in certain zones for equipment upgrades. I wish there was a follow up game with more polish. I was one of the fortunate souls who did not attempt to play this on the Xbox 360, and opted for the PC version which apparently was in a better state upon its release. The game is not without its bugs, and issues with settings as framerates go bonkers without any reason. The gameplay is rare in which you have teams of characters who work together to fight the enemy. Sometimes this system worked out, sometimes it became muddled with confusion. I would liken it to something similar to Bahamut Lagoon on the SNES which I recommend people play if they enjoyed this game. Although BL leans towards strategy games of the time. There are some areas where a fight essentially relies on trying it over and over and getting by purely on luck. These certain events were a letdown in many cases. There were alot of very poor rpgs being made at the time of this games debut and in general during its console generation, and it was a breath of fresh air in its attempt to add something to a genre dying from lackluster gameplay, visuals, and repetition, Hopefully we will see a game soon, likened as a spiritual successor or inspired by it.

												The Last Remnant is one of my favorite games of all time. I'll admit, it doesn't have the most interesting plot ever. Actually, it's pretty mediocre. There's a lot of characters but 95% of them are not memorable. The world is relatively pretty and well done, with a good amount of variety and stuff.So what do I like about the game? It's combat system. It's unique and I have never ever found anything similar to it to this day. It's easier to see for yourself so I'm not going to describe it. All I'll say is that it takes a lot of time to master it and killing the secret boss won't be easy at all. Have fun!			"

I'll still reccomend this. If it's more stable for you, even better.But yeah, be warned... it crashes. other than that, I really have nothing bad to say about this game, except it was more than what I expected.I'll probably come back and update my review on this when I go back to play it some more.It seriously looked really good, and I really enjoyed myself....until it crashed.

												Since this is my first review of a game, please give me some leeway for a bit of naivety. It will happen, I'm sure, because I probably have bias towards or against some things in the game. Now to get on with the actual review.The Last Remnant is a game that I was skeptical about picking up at first. It happened to be on sale for $5, and I saw a few good reviews, so I decided to buy it, and I am so very glad I did. I love strategy games, and this turned out to be one of my favorite strategy games I had ever played, quickly knocking others down on my list.First, the story: in terms of details, it's pretty good; ideas, the same description; in fact, it has a rather unexpectedly in-depth story for what I expected, as of some of SE's games recently (I looked at a few; the story in each drove me away). It takes you into the world and explores the Remnants, which are mystical/magical objects that randomly appeared out of nowhere on the planet and, when bound, can be used as anything from a weapon to a tool and just about everything in-between. However, this is just a subsection of the story, which has (as far as I have played) covered politics, war, rogue elements, many details on the Remnants, scientific researchers, and i actually forgot the end of the list because there were enough parts that I ran out of attention span while typing this. It can be a bit wild in progression, as the story-based events occur only when you go to the right areas, but the quests and tasks (which are basically the normal ""side quests"" and ""fulfill-and-reward"" ideas) also add to the information on the world. A few quests even explore personal areas on certain characters, and each character that is involved in at least a side quest has been carefully built. I was very impressed by all of these details, and from what I have read, I'm not even halfway through the game.Next, the gameplay. Okay, so the first thing I'm going to say is this: there are way too many controls. Your battle controls, field controls, menu controls, and critical controls are many, and some of them overlap in weird ways. For instance, it appears that this game was set up to be used on controller, as you control sight/movement in the field with what is the keyboard equivalent of thumbsticks. Also, what you would think are the same controls in each area of the game are not. They may be bound to different things, i.e. camera movement controls in the field are camera/menu controls in battle (which, it is weird to move the menu and catch sight of your view moving in the same direction as your menu cursor) and a few other things. However, they are not impossible, and once you settle on a comfortable set for you, it doesn't take long before the controls seem natural, no matter how mixed up they seem at first. Now that I'm finished bugging out about that, let's move on to the rest of the gameplay. The Last Remnant uses a combat system that is unique in that I can't remember another game like it. I'm sure there was, but I'm at a loss to which it is. Anyways, you control unions (groups of fighters assembled before battle in preset positions) in a tactical battle setting, which is to say that although you take turns, where you wanted to go and what you wanted to do with each union may not happen. In the battle, unions move throughout the field and engage enemy unions in various forms. You also have to deal with morale, which increases and decreases according to your success in battle. I'll leave it to the game for an explanation, but suffice to say that it is an interesting fight, and no two engagements seem the same.Now, on to other details. The music is quite good; a heavy beat gets you pumped for a fight, and the music changes depending on morale during battles, which in my case either sent me on a murderous rampage or had me fighting desperately for my life. It grabs you and drags you into the fight like no other music I've heard before, similar to the way that the Final Fantasy series often did in the past (case in point: 4-7, at least in my opinion). The characters develop a lot more than I suspected they would. I thought they would be plain soldiers with backgrounds and a bit of development, but they also develop some of the characters you get from sidequests, giving them background information, personalities, and putting much  emotion into the way they act. I find that I absolutely hate to lose units in battle, not just because they are useful, but also due to the emotions and their personalities that have burnt themselves into my mind and heart, and losing one means I lost a friend in the game. When that happens, well, take how you would feel if someone KO'ed your friend with a punch to the face when you were right there with them and apply it to the situation. That's my personal twist on the characters in the game, and I don't care whether you think I'm insane or not (I am, by the way :} ).In conclusion, the story is pretty good, the music is epic, the battles are engaging, and the only cons you really have to deal with are the occasional slowdown at the start of a cutscene (due to high processing required and extreme details being applied, has occurred few enough times that I can count them on my hands) and the exceedingly rare random close out (happened a grand total of 3 times for me so far, two of them I'm pretty sure were because my computer was doing updates, the warning and the actual restart caused the game to close out). In my humble opinion, this game is 10/10. I love it, am addicted to it, and will never say otherwise. ^_^			"

												The Last Remnant has been one of the few games which I can replay and experience it differently even though the story is the same (bar one set side quest options). I originally played this game on the Xbox 360 so I'm used to the game mechanics, however I have to play with a controller on this steam version as the controls for the keyboard are difficult in comparison as the buttons aren't as straight-forward. The game doesn't have steam achievements.Game: Overall, the plot of the game is pretty straight forward as you get reminded or can talk to NPCs to tell you what you need to do. After completing several story points, you are almost able to fully explore the world from near the start of the story, adventuring through the different areas and unlocking other towns. Some are mandatory for the story to progress but others are optional. Side quests pop up after most story events, so revisiting towns and cities are a must if you want to complete them all.Battle System:This is a hit or miss for everyone. I know plenty of people who dislike the battle system due to controlling a union of people but not being able to control each and every single unit. At first it is confusing as not many games use this style but after getting to grips with it, it is extremely useful and conserves time. Since it's a turn based game, imputting the attacks takes long enough to decide as unions so it's literally a godsend that we don't control each character exactly. The camera angles of the fighting keeps you involved in the fight as it follows those whose turn it is attacking/supporting/on standby. Another way this game involves you is by using a critical trigger. It requires you to press the button when the ring encloses over it. By doing so, not only do you bump up your allies in the turn system but also improve the critical chance of your attacks as well as a chance of synergising the last allies attack to a better one if you have enough Action Points(AP). Battles have frontal attacks (deadlocks), side attacks (flanks) and rear assaults which can give your parties edge in a battle but enemies also have the ability to do the same.Unions:You can choose who you want in your party by either completing their missions and buy there services in the guild or talking to one of the soldiers in Athlum (when you are given permission). Certain characters are required for side quests to appear. Unions are made up of a maximum of 5 units. These units/people are chosen by you and can be arranged in different formations to suit their opponents or roles before battle. Different formations have different abilities, strengths and weaknesses so it's fun to play about with what works best. Apart from your character/Rush Sykes, you aren't able to equip other units personally, if you have a weapon and they want it, they'll ask in the map screen if they can take it off your hands. However, they also ask for materials to improve their weapons as well so hunting items down is a good way to increase the strength of your parties. The stats in the game aren't really explained about, neither are class roles but are mostly straightforward apart from their trait stats.Skills: There are multiple arts which can be learnt such as combat, magicks, lotions etc. When learning specific ones, you are able to disable the use of other skills, enabling the one you want to learn more likely to pop up as an option in battle. I've seen a lot of people say the moves all look the same but I disagree with this. Sure, some have the same energy build up but the actual attack performed is different in some way.Visuals & Sound: Originally on the 360, my game was glitchy and laggy most the time. The steam version is much better, there are still glitches at times (like capes spinning about) but the smoothness of the animation at full visual capacity is quite good for a 2008 made game. The detail can take a few seconds to load in though. The voice acting for the game is okay, not the best voice acting but also not the worst. I'm a sucker for Square Enix soundtracks, so the music accompaning the game is quite beautiful and helps set the situation of the game. Within battle, the music can change depending on moral, turns or how close a union is to dying.Other notes: Sovani. Are. Awesome.			"

												... It's a JRPG... the only tactics you need is to grind. Boss is too tough? Grind random encounters to level up more. Don't have enough money to buy something? Grind random encounters for money. Can't get past a door? ""Grind"" the dungeon by spam the OK button at every corner of the dungeon.Last Remnant is unfortunately one of those games that you want to give them props for trying something new, but you can't really bring yourself to do it because they went in circle and ended up right where they started with the same old.Still one of the few JRPGS for PC that is somehow good			"

												I feel that TLR does not deserve its 65 metacritic rating. That being said, if you dislike JRPGs, this wont change your mind.The world is nice, the music is fantastic, the characters and story vary from laughable to pretty decent. My only real complaints are as follows;1) Upgrading your characters is wierd. You have no control over what they upgrade, so theyll take items they need after a battle, which sounds cool, but most of the time I would have 30 of the item they suddenly wanted. They should have made NPCs take that junk without having to have a mob drop it when they need it.Due to the wierd way you upgrade your characters, youll have to spend quite a bit of time farming drops, or at least I did. Luckily the combat system is great. The main problem with farming too much is; youre trying to upgrade your character, and the more you level the more difficult mobs become.The characters also harass you until you give them what they want, like a drug addict....you got any of that fly oil Rush.??. *sniff*2) Certain more rare items require magazines, which are dropped from doing guild quests, which arent tracked, so you have to make sure you know what youre doing before you go out. 3)  The max number of units is 18 in a group of 5 (5 per group) WHY in the world they made it 18 characters instead of 25 I cannot fathom. 4) You can miss quests simply because you progressed in the main story, that was just terrible!5) There is a late spike in difficulty. The game goes from a fun challenge to soul crushingly difficult at a certain point. My reviews are always super negative, I enjoyed the game, there are just some odd issues with it. Worth buying!

												The good: Interesting world and art direction, deep systems for upgrading/developing characters, lots of unique characters to recruit, an awesome battle system that lets you play out larger-scale fights, a large amount of sidequests that net meaningful rewards (like recruitable unique characters, or access to previously inaccessible areas of the map).The bad: The complexity of how things work makes it hard to grasp without external help. Also, the story is weak.Overall I'd recommend this game for people who enjoy turn-based JRPGs but want to try something different. The way this game plays is like nothing else I've tried and personally I enjoyed it a lot.			"

I gave it a shot once when I purchased an Xbox 360 and I fell in love with it.  The soundtrack, envireonments, unique combat system, phenomenal.  It truly is a great game to get invested into and its challenging to boot.  I love it and recommend it to folks who love an RPG thats different than the rest.			"

												Pretty damn nice game. This gem didn't get the marketing you'd expect from most SE games, so it flew under the radar with a lot of people. But this gem has a fabulous story. Game mechanics are in part hidden, meaning there's actually a lot of different factors that influence your battles which are either never explained, never shown, or both. You'd think this to be a deal-breaker, but it isn't. It's still fairly easy to understand combat and get through the game, without fully understanding all of it. Understanding simply gives you the freedom to really tailor your strategies to your preference.But the one main point is most definitely the story, which is very good! Definitely worth playing once, quite enjoyable playing three times.The game was made with english voice acting in mind, so picking english will have the sync with the mouths down just right.			"

												Had my doubts that this game would turn into a final fantasy style game at first and was not looking forward to it at first... but starting the first combat sequence, it becomes very addictive.althought nobody will die even if you lose that certain squad or two but definetely you wiil feel the dropin firepower when you lose an entire squad. Apart from the combat sequences, this game boasts a beautifulstory line that makes you curious to what happenes next. The map in game are also wide and open, more then not you will find yourself lost in a certain part or going in circles (looking at  your Crypt) and you will take a while to realise it since you dont know where to go in the first place. This game has beautiful in-game locations like towns , fields and mountains. definetely would recommend this game to all who enjoy turn-based strategies			"

												Spectacular game that keeps you engaged with a very interesting squad-based ""rts/rpg"" hybrid combat system. Great storyline to follow, great graphics, well executed cutscenes. Good sense of overwhelming power from opponents, unsurmountable odds faced and beaten. One thing I would have to make sure to mention to anyone who purchases this game and plays, check and DOUBLECHECK that the ""autosave"" feature is on in the options or you may end up losing a LOT of progress. It's not on by default. Would rate it about a 9/10.			"

												This game is a beautiful and ambitious tweak to the JRPG formula.  A compelling. interesting story, coupled with above average voice acting and an interesting battle system culminates in one hell of a good time.  It does have its weak points, including the obscure nature of how to find some items required for leveling and a general sense that the game isn't giving you all the stats required to make inform decisions.  However, all in all, The Last Remnant delivers a great experience.Oh, and when it gets a bit sloggy 3/4 the way in?  Just push on through because the rest of the story is one to hold out for.If you loved FF, Tactics, and strategy, I highly recommend the title.  Great game, wish we'd see a sequel.			"

												What can I say about this game.It's a breathe of old school RPG goodness to those of us old enough to remember old school RPGs. The game is nice to look at, battles are enjoyable and challenging and the music is just beautiful.However it isn't for everyone. The game is challenging and the leveling system will put off most. The HARD mode lives up to it's name and is for none but the most hardcore. The Battle System is challenging to understand at first, fairly easy to get once you do understand while remaining difficult to completely master.But if you're looking for a good JRPG to while away the hours, this is a good choice.

												The game seems pretty cool so far. That said, it hates my laptop... i5 hd4000 graphics are able to play it reasonably well, except that every now and then it does odd things like randomly turning the screen black and making you log out of windows and back in to be able to  see anything on screen again... extremely frustrating... im going to have to put it on my gaming system to try it now with my 280x gpu and see how it reacts to that. Its a shame though since this game is one i wanted FOR my laptop.so far, ill recomend it as i think it ONLY suffers from not liking intel graphics, but the play style is kinda cool... its like a squad based final fantasy game, which is a bit of a new take on things. From what little ive played so far, the story seems like its pretty promising also.			"

Everything goes on a general world map where you can select stages and cities. The battle system is some kind of chess board, where every piece is a group of characters (party) and depending how you move every group, you will get better results on battle.It's a very good game, totally recommended, specially if it's on sale.

												Wow, what an adventure.To get to the nitty gritty, let me focus on a couple of parts of the game: the battle system, the story, and the ending.The battle system:The battle system of this game is unique and definitely improved the game in my opinion. If you are unfamiliar, you have multiple squads under your commands that attack in sets. If you've played Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic, it is somewhat similar, but much more smoothly executed and on a much grander scale. The battles feel huge in certain cases, and it really adds to the experience in that it makes it feel like you're fighting a war right off the bat, rather than just skirmishes.10/10The story: The story was very engaging, and this characteristic is largely why I prefer RPGs to other types of games. Though it has a couple of predictable plot twists, the world is immersive. The side quests definitely add to the story and add to the immersive-ness of the world, as well as providing tangible advantages such as recruiting valuable characters and the acquisition of powerful weapons. There were a couple of problems, such as the ending feeling rushed, but I'll get into that in the next section.8/10The ending: The ending was absolutely the worst part of the game. I think it's odd to feature the ending as a part of the review, but I felt very strongly about it. This game can be split up into two fairly individual parts (to the point where one could have actually been a sequel). The second half of the game felt rushed compared to the first part. I felt like, where the story had a comfortable and reasonable progression in the first half, I felt like I was barrelling through the story when I went at the same pace for the second. At endgame, the game really just kind of feels like it skids to an emergency halt. The final boss is scaled in difficulty to the progression of your character, which is nice, and the final boss did take me a few tries, but when I did actually beat it, I was for some reason a little disappointed. The ending cutscenes did give me a feeling that I was finished, but the satisfaction wasn't really there. For the reasons that the ending was sort of abrupt, but well written, I give the ending a6/10Overall:I highly recommend this game, overall 8/10			"

												The game seems pretty cool so far. That said, it hates my laptop... i5 hd4000 graphics are able to play it reasonably well, except that every now and then it does odd things like randomly turning the screen black and making you log out of windows and back in to be able to  see anything on screen again... extremely frustrating... im going to have to put it on my gaming system to try it now with my 280x gpu and see how it reacts to that. Its a shame though since this game is one i wanted FOR my laptop.so far, ill recomend it as i think it ONLY suffers from not liking intel graphics, but the play style is kinda cool... its like a squad based final fantasy game, which is a bit of a new take on things. From what little ive played so far, the story seems like its pretty promising also.			"

												I really love it. The battle function is hard to understand at first but when you understand it, it becomes fun. The story is as good as SE's other series. It's a bit like Final Fantasy but not actually it. You can have a bit freedom to do quests and fighting monsters especially with the parties and their formations. You don't have to control must as it like ordering and you're the commander.The graphic is beautiful and have good detail and I really approve of the soundtrack. I don't know why but I love the one at the title menu very much.			"

												Very fun, but don't expect to grind your way to victory. Or understand... anything.The combat mechanics, the effect your abilities have, predicting just how much damage certain statistics will cause... who the hell knows? There is such a learning curve, you likely still will be unsure by the end of the game. Charcter suddenly doubles in power, because you forfilled a random hidden requirement for a random hidden skill? Yup, why not.  Been trying to level grind, only to find that it leveled up all the enemies in the game, plus gave them new equipment, while you are still flailing around with a toothpick? Guess you are in for some problems.I find the whole thing insanely fun, and I spend 80% of the game unsure as to what I am doing. I randomly find i've gained new special abilities, which will randomly 1-hit kill somthing one minute, and do virtually nothing the next. Charcters will automatically upgrade their items seemingly for giggles, although there is actually some bizzare formula at work. Apparently.And then there is the insanely un-predictable squad combat system/synergy bonuses. Just roll with it.Stupid fun. Just don't expect to 'get' it.			"

												From what I have 'played' the game seems quite good. However, the 21 minutes I actually spent on the game, only 5-10 of these minutes were actually spent controlling a character/battling. The other time 'played' was cutscenes...never ending cutscenes full of import- ah f♥♥k it, imma go make coffee, this is boring. If you're fan of JRPG's, get it. The battling system is like pokemon or final fantasy and as stated, the gameplay is rare. If you're a fan of watching cutscenes, this is the game for you! Saying all this though, I will give the game some more time in the future as I am reviewing after only 21 minutes, and see if anything changes.			"

												The tactics present are quite refreshing from the standard grindy RPG. In fact, you have to carefully plan each battle and NOT grind, otherwise, the enemies will overpower you down the road. The game has a tarnished history from the poor introduction on the Xbox, but, I recommend it as this gem has been polished for the PC!			"

												This game is fairly linear, but has an environment immersive enough to keep interest.The game get difficult rather quickly and it cannot be easily fixed by grinding, so a level of strategy and knowledge of game mechanics are best to succeed.There are many unique and you can get attached to your favorites easily and so many sidequests, you feel that you must be a completionist before finishing the storyline.It was worth the many hours playing.

												Un excellent RPG des maitres du genre sur console Square Enix. Un produit rare sur PC, qui joint RPG et tactiques pour fournir de grand moment de plaisirs.Great J-RPG game by Square-Enix.The story got some nice elements - there also a few cliché and some of the usual plot twists - but the overall is great.The game has some tactical and stragegic choice as you not only lv up the member of your team, but you must chose which skill learn for each of them - the more you learn, the slower they progress, so the less action of that skill you learn.You need to chose for them their behavior (simple A/B/C choice when they grow their weapon) by improving their weapon - which require component to loot (mobs / reward / digging).But the most important part is the squadron. You have a limited number of characters to deploy on battle - and a maximum number of squad. Up to you to decide the number of character per squad (up to his maximum) as well as the squad formation and where the member are in each squad formation.As each formation have pro and cons, it's important to know when to use one.Plus you don't chose your squad action as you like. The actions avaible is a guidline determined by the computer depending on the squad Action point, his member skills, his HP/ buff / debuff (as well as the other's squad) and his position on the map compared to the friend / enemy squad.Add special ""limit break"" skill, pincer attack and a gestion of moral squad by squad as well as team by team affection your action and their succes, and battle can get quite interesting.Sadly, as most JRPG, you got a lot of grinding and hidden quest.The good point is : the hidden quest (who are often harder than the main quest, especially at the end of the game) are the only one really needing grinding and providing real hard fight. But they gave overpowering reward.All in all, if you like JRPG, don't miss it (it could do with an HD version by now, true)			"

												Despite what my playtime says I've enjoyed this game for roughly 30hrs. If you're hankering for an interesting JRPG with a new battle mechanic then you'd enjoy this. Fights are done with multiple groups per side and you use flanking and teaming up to destroy the enemy monsters. Looks quite nice too.			"

												This game is an amazing JRPG with a quite unique combat and leveling system, and it was released on PC in a time when there wasn't that many JRPGs on the platform. I haven't really put the hours into the PC version, did finish it will every achivement on the Xbox 360 back in the days. Graphics: Unreal engine makes this game look beutiful and the character models and monsters look real good, some enviroments look a bit ""cheap"" but a game thats now 7 years old it looks sweet.Story: A bit ditzy and hard to follow at times but it's pretty standard JRPG stuff in hereGameplay: I love it. Combat can get tedious but it's so fun to level your units the correct way and do all the side quests and such. Thats why I play JRPGs , for all the things around the main game :)Sound: Voiceacting on most important conversations and a lot of the voices are fitting for the characters. Sound effects and music is AAA qualityConclusion: 9/10 , one of the best JRPGs on PC. I'd even go so far to say this is better than FF 13 series.  If you see this in a sale and you like JRPGs, pick it up ASAP.			"

												652 hours do not lie.If you enjopy JRPGs, this is THE game you must own.Yes the voice acting is corny, sure graphics are not superb looking anymore.The game and the graphical design however, is great.Strategic and involved combat and weapons systems along with a pinch of randomness that is just enough to have you screaming at the screen that your peons are doing it wrong.If you like a game where you can sit down (several times, cause this thing is emmense) and immerse yourself in the gameworld, this would be a good candidate.To get the full experience, reading the manual or researching a bit on the wikia is strongly recommended as the games hides a lot of information from the player.

												Kind of like the older final fantasy games with a updated graphics and combat system. Honestly if facing purchasing this or FF VII for pc. I would go with this. It looks better and plays better. If I had to give any cons, it starts very very weak. They just throw you into the game without explaining much of anything until nearly 2 hours or so in. There is a lot of game play here though, and you progress from a small single party ot controlling several large parties in battle. There is also a lot of content for completist in this one as there are many items you can collect that require vast amounts of farming and loot stacking to get. (they aren't required to complete the game pretty much entirely optional)  "

												The Last Remnant, it's a fairly fun RPG. It's not the traditional style of turn based RPG's because there's more random/luck as well as strategy involved, I would recommend this solely because of the unique battle system they have in place. It can be frustrating at times of course, but this game is definately worth the buy. You get a sense of ""hunting"", looting, treasure pickups, and so on and so forth. Pray to RNGesus however, for luck and good health.			"

												This game is confusing at first. It's also difficult until you figure out what you're doing. The voice acting can be terrible, and it took awhile to get into the story. At the current price of two and a half bucks though it's totally worth it. The combat system is neat when you figure it out and it plays like a game of chess only you have a partner that you can't control their moves. It's not for everyone, but for such a low price it's worth giving it a shot and looking past the flaws.			"

												I've seen a lot of dislike for this game, but in my opinion it was a pretty fantastic game. The Last Remnant had a great story line, and a unique and interested battle system. The idea of squads instead of individual units is something that added the feel of actually controlling a small force instead of just a party of adventurers. And the morale system, while tricky and can work against you, led to shifts in battle in the same way they might happen in real life. Overall it was a lot of fun to play, even if the PC version was harder than the Xbox hard version.			"

												ok so i know little about JRPGs and only have a few hours but what i do know is so far its just FF sub plot missing girl boy goes to find girl,that being said its still a good story and game combat is well done but limited the squad bases give it a one up makes you think which i for one like. Only one big CON that sticks out is YOU HAVE TO SAVE EVERY 10mins or if you get to a new part in the story cuz if you die with out saving your ♥♥♥♥ and have to do it all over and back at your last save. there are no auto saves this may be a jrpg thing i dont know but when i end up some where i was 1hr earlyer i just stop playing kills the mood have to replay everything all over, it is a some what chilled game i dont feel rushed when playing i can just play killing monsters does feel good charcters you meet are kinda tranparint not really much to them thou im saying this with  my time played. in all its still a great game if have a the skill and temperment its for you even with the save thing i still want to play and that means some thing its worth the price and is cheap right now just play it and see if you like it even with the sale its easy on your wallet this my not be the best reveiw but i hope it helps in some way ill edit this as i play to help with any unsertenties.

I bought it because it had ""Square Enix"" on it thinking it will be something like Final Fantasy. I played what seemed like only a few hours but it was not what I wanted/expected. 6 years later after seeing it for 3.50, I said what the heck. Going in with low expectations already, i was blown away at how wrong I was about the game. Now not the best game I've ever had the privelege to play but I can see it recieved more crap than it should have. 6 years ago the thought of playing with 25 characters was rather daunting; certainly a break from the tradional.

												Great game by the same makers of the Final Fantasy series. It has the best battle system I have ever played and the story is a fantastic adventure. A slight problem with this game is the framerate suffers in batt;e but it isn't a big issue. You are able to play the game you want as there are a ton of optional quests, a plefora of monsters to kill for rewards and more! "

												This game is confusing at first. It's also difficult until you figure out what you're doing. The voice acting can be terrible, and it took awhile to get into the story. At the current price of two and a half bucks though it's totally worth it. The combat system is neat when you figure it out and it plays like a game of chess only you have a partner that you can't control their moves. It's not for everyone, but for such a low price it's worth giving it a shot and looking past the flaws.			"

												I've seen a lot of dislike for this game, but in my opinion it was a pretty fantastic game. The Last Remnant had a great story line, and a unique and interested battle system. The idea of squads instead of individual units is something that added the feel of actually controlling a small force instead of just a party of adventurers. And the morale system, while tricky and can work against you, led to shifts in battle in the same way they might happen in real life. Overall it was a lot of fun to play, even if the PC version was harder than the Xbox hard version.			"

												ok so i know little about JRPGs and only have a few hours but what i do know is so far its just FF sub plot missing girl boy goes to find girl,that being said its still a good story and game combat is well done but limited the squad bases give it a one up makes you think which i for one like. Only one big CON that sticks out is YOU HAVE TO SAVE EVERY 10mins or if you get to a new part in the story cuz if you die with out saving your ♥♥♥♥ and have to do it all over and back at your last save. there are no auto saves this may be a jrpg thing i dont know but when i end up some where i was 1hr earlyer i just stop playing kills the mood have to replay everything all over, it is a some what chilled game i dont feel rushed when playing i can just play killing monsters does feel good charcters you meet are kinda tranparint not really much to them thou im saying this with  my time played. in all its still a great game if have a the skill and temperment its for you even with the save thing i still want to play and that means some thing its worth the price and is cheap right now just play it and see if you like it even with the sale its easy on your wallet this my not be the best reveiw but i hope it helps in some way ill edit this as i play to help with any unsertenties.

												A game which the developers (Square-Enix) decided to experiment with not only a new engine, but also a revisioned combat system. The graphics are beautiful and detailed for the year it was released; however, the optimization of the game leaves much to be desired. Don't allow such a minor inconvenience deter oneself from playing this beautiful game: the story is both emotional  and deviant to the company's typical big, bad company/opposing mercanary force, the characters are quickly developed and are easy to identify with, and the amount of optional content will allow for longer retention.To summarize, if it's a somewhat challenging game that one seeks with a clever plot and intriguing characters to maintain interest, then this is the perfect game.(Also, the price is a steal)			"

												Gameplay wise this is honestly my all time favorite JRPG. The game gives you control of up 18 characters at a time from a pool of hundreds, most of which have their own unique story line and a quest associated to them. Every character develops in their own way and loosely follow a unique leveling tree. However probably the best thing is that every character has their own individual weapon tree, class tree, skill pools, and leveling patterns, but you see NONE of them and they are constantly changing, the more you use a character the more they grow. The game adapts to how you play, depending on how you use a character that character develops to follow how you use them. If you go out and grind endlessly to make your party stronger, enemies will in return grow stronger to match your party, as a result the game constantly challenges you. It also has a pretty good story line, I am currently holding off on finishing the final sequence to finish the last of the side quests but I can say I was/am definitely emotionally invested in the story line. It doesn't have the GREATEST story, but it's definitely not just a mediocre story. It also has a stupid amount of side quests, I have 126 hours sunk into this game and am basically at the end of the game yet I still missed 2 side quests. All in all 10/10 and I plan on playing the game through again on hard mode with a new game+ when I beat it. Best $10.00 I've ever spent. If you do decide to get this game let me give you a few quick tips (things I wish I had known/was glad I knew) that I'll try to make as unspoilery as possible. (they probably won't make any sense until you reach said point in the story, but try to keep them in mind)Every available side quest becomes unavailable as soon as you enter the area called the Aqueducts.You can't defeat the fallen if you set foot in Underwalt, making an entire area of the game unavailable.Talk to the Duke of Ghor after every time you clear one of the bases.

												9.4/10So... I have played this game when it was on the Xbox 360 and one major improvement is that now you have a new game plus available after the battle with the last boss. over all this is an absolute blast tons of replay value and the price is amazing. if you like RPG that are a bit out of the ordinary battle systems and some what of an open world theme you will love this game. if you have not played this game I strongly recommend this game. the reason for the above rating is while this is a great game there are some.....issues. During battle you have unions. You issue orders (somewhat) to them. If it is an order to heal or support the others sometimes when union A is order to help union B and union B heals them selves but takes damage again the union A's orders are changed and they do not heal union B. this is just one type if issue i have run into issues with the battle system. I would understand the change in orders if unions stayed healed and what not. Graphics could use some work/ touch ups. Character hair, armor, things of that nature.still overall give this game a try.			"

												I have no idea how to describe the game as a whole, but here are some things that I like and dislike about this game.Pros:- THE BATTLE SYSTEM!-Interesting characters along with a story and personality for alot of them.-A near infinite amount of strategic customization/elements (unions, arts, equips, characters)-Enemies! Lots and lots of enemies! (Rare ones too!)-The graphics! (They're all sparkly)-You can summon bosses during battles-Bosses are not just your typical 4 vs 1 beat-em-ups but are basically an army vs an army.-Side-quests!Cons:-A near infinite amount of customization (When you get alot of members, they're always bugging you for stuff)-Mountains upon mountains of materials.-The learning curve (However there are wikis and guides out there to help with the basics)-A main character that doesn't think :/I highly recommend this game, because while it does have its good sides and bad it is not a game to miss out on. The battle system is one of the most interesting mechanics I've ever seen in RPGs and the pros more than make up for some of the faults of the game (which is mostly the learning curve).Score:french toast / 5			"

												A lot of fresh and unique RPG elements, and super-complex mechanics (so complex, in fact, that you won't understand even half of them unless you consult the wiki). Overall, it feels extremely ahead of its time, and a great reference for Tactical RPG lovers.I thoroughly enjoyed this game, and it's a shame that the tactical combat system wasn't used by Square Enix for any other games since. Would love to see something similar in the future.Although the extra content becomes very repetitive after a while, the main story is quite interesting and the setting / mythos is compelling.Absolutely recommended.

												From the team that brought you the SaGa series comes this tactical JRPG with more than meets the eye. Technical hurdles from the 360 version are not apparent in the PC release (other than occasional texture pop-in) And I experienced screen tearing, and with no ingame v-sync option, I had to turn on v-sync via my Nvidia control panel.Whilst this game isn't for everyone, those that fall in love with it appreciate its deep micromanagement, lengthy battles and challenging bosses. Artstyle reminds me of Final Fantasy XII and the lengthy side quests and atmosphere remind me of Final Fantasy XI.A stellar soundtrack too, brilliantly composed.100+ hours of content. And exploring and unraveling its mysteries can be deeply satisfying... if you're able to put in the time.			"

												If Final Fantasy XII was a franchise, then The Last Remnant would be Final Fantasy XII-2. Both produced by Akitoshi Kawazu, TLR shares a lot in common with FF XII: a fantastic medieval fantasy world, grind-heavy battle system which feels very rewarding for those who like it, a bland main character, and totally amazing soundtrack! The Last Remnant suffers from some graphic issues and a forgettable story, but where it shines, it truly shines. For you who like Final Fantasy, or generally a fantasy JRPG with good turn-based battle system, deep tactics and customization, and great music, The Last Remnant might just be the right game for you.And hey, it's pretty cheap now.

												I really like this game. This is an RPG game that does not have the regular leveling up system that most RPGs have. It instead has the Battle Point system that make's this games learning curve a little bit of steep. Pro:1. Diverse set of character's you can choose from2. Boss battle's are really difficult that the game forces you to think outside of the box and make's each battle exciting3. For an RPG, you don't need to think too much of stats allocation.4. The story is pretty good if you ask me. Cheesy. But good.Con:1. The protagonist is crazy and really difficult to like2. Repetitive monsters. The dev's were not creative enough to think of other monster's and creatures to fill the world. IMO3. Repetitive battles. 4. No love angle. The game hints on this but WTF, you can't pursue it. Oh, well.For it's current going price of $19, it's not a bad deal. I actually purchased this when it was on sale for $3 but believe me you will not waste that $19. Atleast if you like JRPGs like me.8/10			"

												My reason for not recommending this game is technical - It is a bad port. It is not optimized for the PC.I have been to forums, trying out every suggestion to make the video and graphics better, as it should be since this is a 2009 game and my rig, though not the most powerful, still can hold its own.I have tried every graphics setting all the way down to low and none. I've lowered resolution to 1280x720. It improves performance, but only slightly.Slightly.My gosh, I mean seriously, there have been guys in forums stating that their rigs can run CRYSIS 1 and 2 fully maximized everything, and this game makes their gaming rigs cry uncle.What gives?I have one last trick that I can try. I will install this in my SSD hard drive. Hopefully it will make this game run silky smooth. But I'm not confident, as I have played another port (ENSLAVED: Odyssey to the West) in my SSD and I had cutscene loading problems.I guess its true, what they say - ports from consoles suck eggs 95% of the time.I want to like this game. Seriously, I do. I'm even willing to do the research in the wikis necessary to be able to play it the smart way. Its just dumbed down by technical reasons. Too bad.UPDATE: Keep ALL video and graphics settings to DEFAULT VALUES and it should run silky smooth. With this info, I change my recommendation from NOT Recommended to Recommended.Wooohooo!!!! Time to enjoy some Japanese RPG!			"

												Overall its a pretty decent JRPG, I recommend it, but it has a few defaults that makes it hard to give this a good score.- One of the worst leveling/grinding mechanics, all kinds of experience be it for skills/stats/# of items needed is all hidden to the player and there is no explanation at all on how any of it works. Basically, the more you fight, the more your rank increases, which makes you gain less stats increases and enemies scale up the higher your rank is. So the game mostly penalizes you for grinding/fighting a lot. There are ways around this but nothing is explained in the game, its up to you to go on the Internet (if you start this game I highly suggest you go read some faqs before playing, IT'S IMPORTANT, YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED)- The items farming is pretty tedious too without any help from the game and the RNG system which felt worse than FF12, especially when you have to do it for 18 characters instead of your usual 4-5 characters. Can't beleive it was worse on the xbox360 version.- Storywise, I thought it was well made overall, but for many it will feel cliche JRPGish, the story was missing a little depth, it is pretty short compared to all the sidequesting this game has, Expect something like 35 hours for the main story and all the rest takes around 100 hours of gameplay maybe more if you didn't read the faqs like I told you and you like to complete everything in the game. Those endgame quests/DLC are brutal if you aren't prepared. "

The Wikia page. If you hate ""cheating"" nor have the patience to experiment - don't buy this game. But if you like exploration mixed in with stress-free strategy (no time limit for turns, hooray!) and like the idea of planning ahead to build a power-party. this game is for you.

												I had written a brief and unhestitatingly positive review of The Last Remnant a long time ago, but now that I've finally finished the game, I feel the ned to scrap it and replace it with something a little more detailed and a little less glowing.  This is a beautiful game with a great story and fascinating lore.  The game mechanics are... original at least, though I doubt everyone will appreciate having to choose from a list of not-quite-randomly generated commands in battle rather than having full control.  The game is marred, however, by the simple fact that there's so much in it... and most of what's in it is fluff.  It's a completionist's nightmare, and the only game I've played that I thought would benefit from some major streamlining.  Check my play time - that's one playthrough.  I didn't even do everything; there was a lot that I missed and some that I deliberately skipped because I just wanted the game to end already.  The many monster-hunting mini-quests quickly become a source of irritation once you realize that the monsters you're after aren't guarenteed to show up even if you're looking in the right place.  The mini-quests involving item collection and upgrading your equipment and your party's equipment aren't much better: the incredibly complicated crafting system includes hundreds of different components you may need, and the game offers no clues on where to find them - some can't be acquired at all unless you're carrying a certain unique item.  What I'm getting at is, play it if you're a Squenix fan - you won't be disappointed - but for the sake of your own enjoyment, resist the temptation to do everything, and be prepared to refer to Wikia frequently.And now for the punchline: there's a new game plus mode.  You're hilarious, Squenix.			"

												Such a great game. You may require some tweaking to get some graphics and controller settings to work properly, but once you do you'll find a beautiful game with a great combat system. It is fun to play and can be challenging. The story is interesting and it has that sort of open Final Fantasy XI-ish feeling to it combined with with the option of selecting Japanese voices of good quality with subs. Not to mention it's available on PC with all the advantages that implies.I most definitely recommend it.			"

												a really addicting game, and u can really feel that its from square enix, battlesystem is kinda like the one from final fantasy 13 with walking monsters on the outer world, and the turn based combat battles when u come near them. also the semi sad story, and who wuld have known, the semi bi/gay main character who gets hit on multiple times from different male npc's, really felt like im in final fantasy 13 again with vaan. now for the haters nope i aint hating on gay people, just pointing out how similar those games are in my opinion.quests are kinda boring, its almost always the same, go to x kill y.fights on the hindsight are very good and challenging, in a special way i wuld say. because ur characters get special moves yes, but it feels like they just use them as they want, u cant really controll them.so for jrpg fans and people who like final fantasy i wuld highly suggest to buy this fine piece,because i already have allot of fun with it.

												My main type of games I love to play are jRPGs with different areas to explore, side quests towards the middle/end of the game, and a variety of equiipment with magical elements to equip and use on bosses, monsters, and the like.Now for this game. At first I was skeptical that I'd like it. I'm not a strategy game type person - this game is not like Risk strategy, more like Final Fantasy Tactis strategy. This game is thrilling, there's a lot of people to meet, levels to get up (Battle Ranks), side quests to do, and different places to go. Granted this isn't a jRPG, but it is a highly fun RPG that is completely underrated. The amount of content and playability will have you guessing what will happen next, what ties are going to be broken (if any), and who you can really trust. If you like looking for a variety of items to craft better equipment or weapons, this has a lot you can craft. "

It's a bit like Final Fantasy but not actually it. You can have a bit freedom to do quests and fighting monsters especially with the parties and their formations. You don't have to control must as it like ordering and you're the commander.The graphic is beautiful and have good detail and I really approve of the soundtrack.

												Very fun, but don't expect to grind your way to victory. Or understand... anything.The combat mechanics, the effect your abilities have, predicting just how much damage certain statistics will cause... who the hell knows? There is such a learning curve, you likely still will be unsure by the end of the game. Charcter suddenly doubles in power, because you forfilled a random hidden requirement for a random hidden skill? Yup, why not.  Been trying to level grind, only to find that it leveled up all the enemies in the game, plus gave them new equipment, while you are still flailing around with a toothpick? Guess you are in for some problems.I find the whole thing insanely fun, and I spend 80% of the game unsure as to what I am doing. I randomly find i've gained new special abilities, which will randomly 1-hit kill somthing one minute, and do virtually nothing the next. Charcters will automatically upgrade their items seemingly for giggles, although there is actually some bizzare formula at work. Apparently.And then there is the insanely un-predictable squad combat system/synergy bonuses. Just roll with it.Stupid fun. Just don't expect to 'get' it.			"

												""7.0/10""+ Rich graphics, memorable symphony music, unique/massive scale fights- Zero character growth, battle commands are random, sidequests are grindfestsA beautiful mechanically sound game that brings in an interesting battle system into an otherwise predictable jrpg plot. The Last Remnant caught my eye from the get-go with its visuals but dulled me back to real life with its  nuanse of storytelling and smaller-than-it-looks worlds. You play as Rush, a stubborn and small-minded individual out to save his sister and the world from destruction (How different!). What saves the narrative is a union-based system that gives you a commander-shouting experience. Rather than control each member, you're giving directions to the union as a whole and letting them decide. It gives the game a unique flair and really, Steam should list ""Strategy"" as its 2nd or 3rd tag. Without a proper setup; having a healer, disabler, tank, area of effect abilities, you'll be left scratching your head, getting smashed from some of the more formidable story bosses. Thankfully Steam gives you an emulator-esque experience, letting you save at any point in the game as long as you're not presently in a battle. This means you can rewind and plan accordingly. Thin your numbers out with more unions and flank the enemy? Bolster two-three unions for a direct assault? Focus on moral boosting units and leader special abilities? Acquiring more party members is also a treat as you'll be entering towns and recruiting people from various guilds. Getting the better party members requires you to do sidequests... and boy are some of them lengthy. Despite an engaging battle system that keeps you interested, it also has flaws. For one the commands are random. If you want a unit to do something specific, chances are it may not show up. Heal this union? No, sorry, I'll heal this other one. Use our special union ability even though we have enough mana? Maybe next turn. It's discouraging as well as prolongs otherwise 20-30 seconds fights into 2-3 minute charades.

												I absolutely love this game and stand by it. I have put probably about 300-400 hours into this game (not on steam, but mostly on xbox). I bought it on PC because it is a superior version which does allow more specific choices for characters and doesn't punish you for grinding.I Think the battle system and character progression system is great, but not for everybpdy. Your characters will grow depending on the commands you give in battle, the commands you get to choose from in battle are limited, but are always swayed by the choices you have made for that group of characters previously. Instead of having 6 focused characters, which you make specific choices for growth, like in the usual JRPG fare, you have 20 characters and make general choices in combat that indirectly affect the character's growth. It means that all the choices you make will have an impact, so you have to be mindful of what abilities you want a group to have.The battles are both challenging and engaging and unlike other JRPGs I've played. The fact they are large scale is really enjoyable, and you can also speed past them if you'd like. If you really want to enjoy it, you will need to use the wiki for it. There are details which appear as random in this game, but are really a number of complex factors that create a coherent, if unclear, system.The game's content is mostly sidequests and completely optional, and are amongst the most rewarding challenges I have faced in most JRPGs. I always feel like there is more I could do and more progression I could make, creating powerful and interesting combinations of characters.I thik this title is greatly misunderstood and underrated because of the sub-par Xbox release, but is really a unique JRPG gem and will shine through if you have the time and interest.

												I got this game on a whim during a sale, because strictly speaking Square Enix owns at least 1/3 of my soul. I wasn't overly disappointed with TLR. The graphics and controls are pretty top=notch for the game's age, and the difficulty scales well. I did have problems with some tougher bosses based on hiring new units and the way the 'leveling' system works. (Some of my units were woefully underpowered for several fights.) That said, the combat system (controlling several parties) is intriguing, and I'd like to see SE revisit it with a little more traditional RPG leveling system in mind. My only true gripe about this game is something that ALL developers need to take to heart: Skippable. Cutscenes. Even in NG+, the cutscenes are unskippable, and they are LONG. Have popcorn while playing. Overall, I'd give this game a 7/10. Cutscenes notwithstanding, the story can feel a little forced at times, and sometimes hard to follow, and honestly a little boring at points. The combat and gameplay in general are good enough to play through at least once.			"

												If you like side quests and a long RPG game then this is the game for you.  The leveling system with the battle ranks is interest.  The only thing I miss is more control over units develop and equipment but this is all part of the experience.  If you know how the game works you can influence them fairly well but it took me a while to catch on.  May need another play through to really experience it the way it was meant to be now that I know what I'm doing, but it's can be such a long game that I don't think I'll get the chance.I recommend before you start a serious play through do a little research on character development and weapon upgrading and you will probably enjoy it a whole lot more the first time through.  Myself, I've had some frustrating moments but think I'll be able to get through to the end.			"

If you're the type who loves to personalize and minmax their army, this game is great fun. I admit it can be a bit frustrating fighting the system since much of it is out of your direct control but it's still interesting.If you're the type to just run through the skip the optional stuff, you can do that too since the game has a dynamic difficulty based on your Battle Rank. Basically, the more you grind, the harder the game gets, so you aren't punished for rushing through but the game doesn't really get much easier if you grind.It's a great game and you can get it for incredibly low prices during the sales.

												The Last Remnant is definitely an interesting game; innovative battle style that I have never seen before, making gameplay actually quite fun.  I don't have a whole lot to say that others haven't said better, but this is what I think:Pros:- Rush's cheesy lines cracked me up.  It was like... well the writers were trying to be cool so he uses a lot of slang that cracked me up.  - While this was no Final Fantasy, the character detail and graphics are great.  I love a game where you can look closely at a character and see their clothes in great detail.  - Battle is fun, and when you are not having a super tough time you can watch a movie, or read a book while you are waiting for the battle to get over.- Voice acting was pretty goodCons:- Without a controller, playing on a keyboard is terrible.  You can absolutely tell that this game was originally made for the 360.  - Story is a bit basic, though admittedly not a huge turnoff for me.- I am not 100% sure that rare enemies return once you see them.  This kind of sucks, because they often tear me a new one, and I have to get experience before I come back to play.  - Some of the game functions are very dynamic, but they are also very confusing.  All in all, I really like this game.			"

												I'm actually conflicted about this game. I dislike it for the battle system, lack of story, lack of summons, and poor player actions and guestures lol. I've played many games by SEA and usually end up in a completely positive way. Last remenent was just....so so. Put it like this I beat the game with out knowing I was finishing it up... I didn't like how you would have to grind for many many hrs to pass some bosses.  The game does have some heart in it, and had some real potential it just seems like midway threw them doing the game they where like ehhh F it lets just end it here with no explination of Rush and his connection to the Conquor (SPOILER*******) it just leaves it as oh he was a remenent too. It did keep me busy and slightly entertained thats for sure, and thats what a game is supposed to do. Will I play it threw again??? I may in a few years.			"

												TLR is even better than I hoped.Battle mechanics:Makes you feel like a commander in the battelfield rather than the main character of a story, which is kinda refreshing and truth be told not that different from traditional RPG battle systems, since you select attack and see if you hit, miss, or get a critical hit, good thing that in TLR criticals(offensive and defensive) depend on you so you don't just sit back and watch the battles.Class system:It's both a good and a bad thing, is so huge that you'll be surprised, I was at least. but there's no reliable way to track progress and predict it accurately.Your main character can become whatever you want him to be which is always great, using whatever weapon you want which is a bonus, giving him different attacks depending on what you choose which is unusual, and feeling like he is trully becoming proficient instead of just a regular guy learning skills, what is there not to love about that?The world itself I find it lacking, you can visit few places. but even on the city itself what you see, find or the people you talk to is too limited.Side quests feel dull, specially when you accept and get teleported in and out, it feels wrong to me not going myself to do something I said I would, and not having a record of things that need doing in my main menu is annoying.All in all it's a great game, love the visuals, the voice acting is great.

												Not your usual Square Enix game. I believe that Last Remnant was only for the Xbox, so as you know it not many people know of its existence due to the fact that all their other games were on the Play Station. It has a really unique style of combat. I have never seen anything like it before. The learning curve of the system is really high. At first you will not understand what is going on at all. After a while of playing though and you start to get familar with it though, its really rewarding and fun. If you like the Final Fantasy series this one would be a great pick as well.			"

												The Last Remnant: The Salt BringerSeriously this game has made me so happy yet so mad, the sheer fact my old 360 and this PC have remained intact over the fruitless years of trying to conquer this game (With the physical strategy guide, mind you) is proof enough this game is worth playing.Synopsis:You start the game as Rush Sykes, who's sister, Irina, has been kidnapped. You venture off to lands unknown to find her, meet up with some people who think your parents (famous scientists btw) are amazing people. These new allies not only help you find your sister but eventually place you both on a gigiantic pedestal of world changing proportions, facing down enemies beyond that of a teenage boy who has yet to say a single curse above the occasional ""damn."" Also, character development, plot, twists of plot, and other RPG centric stuff occurs.Review:Yeah yeah, we get it. ""The combat system is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t."" Well, Square saw you wanted a ""Final Fantasy""-Esque game without the convoluted self-serving plot, and a new combat system, and you very well F!^&#!%! got it. Yes, it's randomized based on your weapons, party members, remnants, etc. But it adds a new difficulty to the game that all you weeaboos and achievement whoores have yet to appreciate. As an RPG fan, and even as a FF fan, this combat system makes me rage, quite a bit honestly. But, when you finally beat that one spot, the one you've been stuck at for ages, it's like a long awaited ♥♥♥♥♥♥. It is just fulfilling and makes you dizzy with delight... then you find another boss immediately after who wrecks your♥♥♥♥♥♥and sets you back to square one.Now you may ask; ""well if that's how you feel, why reccommend it you masochistic prick?"" Because it's difficult, because it's a mixture of chaos and control that's amazingly frustrating and we all hate ourselves that much to force ourselves to commit to something that might give us a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ heart attack when you finally get to the end of the game, just to get your♥♥♥♥♥♥stomped in because your remnant never f!^@%#^! showed on the f!&#*@^ action wheels... <Insert Pant-Like breathing>.. Honestly, the story is actually quite phenominal if you're willing to murder yourself over it, the characters are well developed by the end and it's a difficult task to beat, but we all need relentless challenging. So go kick some ""A."" enjoy some of the frame drops (that can be quite hilarious at times) and most of all, find a way to kill Mr. Dig and his nightmare eyes.			"

												Wonderful game to playthrough the first time with a very exciting story with twists along the way. There are tons of side quests some which are stupidly challenging and require a lot of grinding and work to achieve. Personally i wasn't expecting this and was a pleasant surprise as a previous warcraft player it really feels like you achieve something after the grind. The battle system feels a little random at times however it does not affect the gameplay too much. Overall a very exciting game and one i have enjoyed very thoroughly in a long time.			"

												9.4/10So... I have played this game when it was on the Xbox 360 and one major improvement is that now you have a new game plus available after the battle with the last boss. over all this is an absolute blast tons of replay value and the price is amazing. if you like RPG that are a bit out of the ordinary battle systems and some what of an open world theme you will love this game. if you have not played this game I strongly recommend this game. the reason for the above rating is while this is a great game there are some.....issues. During battle you have unions. You issue orders (somewhat) to them. If it is an order to heal or support the others sometimes when union A is order to help union B and union B heals them selves but takes damage again the union A's orders are changed and they do not heal union B. this is just one type if issue i have run into issues with the battle system. I would understand the change in orders if unions stayed healed and what not. Graphics could use some work/ touch ups. Character hair, armor, things of that nature.still overall give this game a try.			"

												Kind of like the older final fantasy games with a updated graphics and combat system. Honestly if facing purchasing this or FF VII for pc. I would go with this. It looks better and plays better. If I had to give any cons, it starts very very weak. They just throw you into the game without explaining much of anything until nearly 2 hours or so in. There is a lot of game play here though, and you progress from a small single party ot controlling several large parties in battle. There is also a lot of content for completist in this one as there are many items you can collect that require vast amounts of farming and loot stacking to get. (they aren't required to complete the game pretty much entirely optional)  "

												I've been a fan of the Final Fantasy series for years (specially III and VII). Although it's not Final Fantasy, The Lst Remnant is a pretty good jrpg. The story is great, the graphics and animations beautiful. I found it kind of clumsy without a controller (movement ""wasd"" and mouse, action battle triggers arrows, etc.). With a XBox 360 Controller the game is really very playable and easy to learn. The combat system is excellent and hard to master. The only thing I would pehaps change in the game is the ability to handle the equipment of your party (you can only control the equipment of the main character). Instead of it, the party members ask you to go around the world to find specific materials or for some weapons you have not equiped.Bottom line. A must have for all jrpg game fans. It was worth every cent I spent on it.Graphics: 98%Music: 95%Voice act (Japanese): 100% <- It's well deservedPlayability: 86%Overall: 92%			"

There is absolutely no need to grind at all. I can easily see myself sinking another 100-200 hours into this game.			"

												I had written a brief and unhestitatingly positive review of The Last Remnant a long time ago, but now that I've finally finished the game, I feel the ned to scrap it and replace it with something a little more detailed and a little less glowing.  This is a beautiful game with a great story and fascinating lore.  The game mechanics are... original at least, though I doubt everyone will appreciate having to choose from a list of not-quite-randomly generated commands in battle rather than having full control.  The game is marred, however, by the simple fact that there's so much in it... and most of what's in it is fluff.  It's a completionist's nightmare, and the only game I've played that I thought would benefit from some major streamlining.  Check my play time - that's one playthrough.  I didn't even do everything; there was a lot that I missed and some that I deliberately skipped because I just wanted the game to end already.  The many monster-hunting mini-quests quickly become a source of irritation once you realize that the monsters you're after aren't guarenteed to show up even if you're looking in the right place.  The mini-quests involving item collection and upgrading your equipment and your party's equipment aren't much better: the incredibly complicated crafting system includes hundreds of different components you may need, and the game offers no clues on where to find them - some can't be acquired at all unless you're carrying a certain unique item.  What I'm getting at is, play it if you're a Squenix fan - you won't be disappointed - but for the sake of your own enjoyment, resist the temptation to do everything, and be prepared to refer to Wikia frequently.And now for the punchline: there's a new game plus mode.  You're hilarious, Squenix.			"

												A seriously underrated turn-based strategy RPG.The combat system isn't hard to learn, but is super in depth if you want it to be.Customization is somewhat predefined, however, it still leaves you plenty of room to create your own set of unique unions.They hide quite a bit of information from you, specifically the class system, class requirements or even the material locations for your weapon upgrades.The biggest flaw is the Battle Rank system, as it determines the difficulty of the game, but isn't equal to the strength of your group, but the number of battles that have been completed.The Last Remnant is certainly a more difficult game then your average RPG.If you can deal with it's flaws, i would certainly consider giving it a go.

												Although this game is old these days , but this one is still fun to play.it have battle system that is quite different from any JRPG out there.Storywise , gameplay itself is quite time consuming which is a typical for JRPG games.Overall this game is a good game to play , good story , vast amount of character , nicely done ;)			"

												The Last Remnant is one of those JRPG's you will never forget. How come? Because that turn-base combat is enough to rip your hair out in frustration, and that you'd need therapy when the credits roll. Also, them side-quests. So many of them. It has many faults, but this is one of the games I genuinely love and wished that it has a bigger fanbase (AND A SEQUEL). Pro-tip: never play it on hard-mode on your first playthrough. You'd shoot yourself in the face.			"

												I just want to say that I love this game very much. The graphics, the music, the tactics in battle. Even the way you level up your characters. But sadly there is a dark side to this happy tale and that is the fact that the game seriously heats my computer up to insane levels moreso than any other game in my library. Now one might think, ""You better clean the dust from your computer and get a decent coolant system!"" The problem with that is that it is cleaned out, and my cooler system is good enough. Other, more intense games raise my temperature maybe ten degrees while this game raises it over 30c quite rapidly. I've looked all over the inernet for a solution to this issue and while I've seen many people complain about the overheating CPU issues over the years, I saw no solutions.Hopefully when you buy and play this wonderful game you will not face the same fate I did.

												This game is surprisingly good. For an RPG game its a well thought out game with all its features and battle system. If you want a game to spend many hours into it then look no further; it took me over 70 hours to beat this game for the first time and that's leaving a good chunk of the side missions left untouched. Picked this game up when steam had it on sale for $10 making it a great deal. Battle system took a little bit to get used to. But once you play enough you will get used to it, and it is nice being able to initaite encounters rather than random encounters happening as soon as you take a few steps. So yeah good game, story isn't too bad but it could have been so much better I think. Yay for being able to have Japanese voices with subtitles as an option! If you have an xbox ccontroller you can use that and it would probably be a little more comfortable than using the keyboard, oh and if you don't be sure to change  the settings to keyboard buttons!

												The only X-box 360 game I EVER owned that I never finished (due in part to pure rage), now ported to PC with more features (and less lag). It's what I'd describe as a Tactical-RPG, with turn-based elements relying on planning and forethought. Instead of single units (sending a lone unit out into a fight becomes and obviously poor idea), you have a ""Union"", a group of units you have mixed together to suplement each other's strengths and weaknesses. Level grinding is HIGHLY recommended, and so-called ""side-quests"" become a necessity if you want any kind of gear that will stand up to the main story's OVERPOWERED bosses.			"

												I loved this game on the XBox 360 and am now greatly enjoying the improved PC version. It really is better this way. I think the main reason why it captures my attention much more effectively than other games (Western and Japanese RPGs both) is that it actually provides a challenge, but without being needlessly frustrating. Nevertheless, I wouldn't warn inexperienced players away from it. The unusual battle system takes some time to get the hang of, but personally I love it. The story and characters are great, too, although the protagonist will make you roll your eyes a lot especially during the first third or so. To round off the experience, there's an excellent soundtrack.			"

												Engaging story, deep gameplay and TONS of content make this a must for any JRPG fan. My hours reflect roughly only half of what I've really played, and I've skipped all DLC bosses and a couple of quests.The combat might not be everyone's cup of tea, but I thought it was well executed and customizable.Keyboard/mouse controls do feel a bit awkward at the beginning but you'll get used to them pretty quickly.Very solid experience (and dirty cheap as well!) but a walkthough/game guide is a need IMO.

												Yes, this game has a lot of flaws. The level up system needs some work and story is forgettable. Nonetheless, The Last Remnant adds an interesting twist to the RPG genre. Instead of having three or even five members for a party you can have up to 18 members that you can control at a time. Battles feel like actual skirmishes and it's extremly satisfying flanking an enemy from all sides. The game difficulty can spike up after some story events and it can seem more annoying that challenging. Nonetheless I was able to clock in 200 hours. I enjoyed this game thoroughly and I think you will too.			"

												2 technical issues   1)  Volume  controls do not affect the main page. Every time you start the game, every time you have to get to a load screen the music volume will goes up to its 100% until you make a selection. Gets tedious if you Play while others sleep.  2) Having software loaded for a n52te would not let the game grab control of the 360 controller. I have no idea why and it did not matter if i unplugged and restarted the pc, It would not recognize the controller until I removed the software.As far as gamplay goes it is pretty nice. Not a lot is explained up front, but there is a manual to look at to help you get started (if you prefer to just dive in without websites and guides). I did manage to pick up things pretty quickly from the mini tutorial at the start. Keyboard controls do not seem instinctive to me but that could be from my preference for the belkin over the past few years. But it plays very well with a controller. I'm not very far into the game yet. But I find the experience pretty fun. The most noteworthy being a completely random crit styled system that comes from the Gunblade (final fantasy 8) crits from pulling the trigger at the right time. In this game the function is expanded on to give multiple buttons (ABXY & right trigger). Except the queue is visual not auditory. You control group behavior not each individual in the group though with 5 options and the ability to see who will do what with each option before confirming you can somewhat affect how the move will go.  The main theme in fights seems to be to not let your party get surrounded. So be aware of that when you start early on if you attack middle groups you may find yourself making fights difficult for no good reason.			"

The story is really interesting and the characters are really lovable once you get around to hearing their backstories. I haven't fought any of the super bosses yet.

												It's a good game. Great story but the game eolves with you, the strongeryou are the harder the fights. It's very easy to get stuck in a fight you are not ready for and have to start a new game, but i still give it 4 out of 5 stars.			"

												The voice acting is horrible, but the story line seems pretty neat so far.  Has an absence of random battles, which is one of the things that contributed to Chrono Trigger being my favorite RPG of all time.  The battle system is really fun - and makes it to where you can die with relative ease.  Manual-controlled timed counter-attacks are also a really fun implement, keep you focused and involved during the battles.  I notice choppy frames, probably due to the fact that it's console port - I've heard of/seen screen tearing issues in ports before [original gtaiv 1.0.4 comes to mind], supposed to be an issue with the games running over 30fps on PC, but I'm no genius on that matter.  But it has a great feel to it, easy to get into, towns have a real old-school interaction feel to them which I like, and so far there seems to be a lack of wandering around a world map - you instead choose quick travel destinations on the map, whether it be a dungeon or town.  Maxed out, it looks beautiful for being almost 5 years old, and in the end just makes me wish I had FF7 redux, but oh well!  Worth the $3-$4 right now during the sale, for sure.			"

												The Last Remnant, Truely a beautiful game. The Combat system is on par with Final Fantasy games but leaves a degree up to the AI to pull off, Examples will include, Mystic arts: Allies will use Mystic arts to attack, if none are known they will attack normally. The Game is treuly a beautiful masterpiece, a very welcome edition to my JRPG library, AND I HAVN'T EVEN BEAT THE FREAKING GAME. I'm only 9 hours in but the game is difficult to a point i find it challenging but not difficult that it leaves nothing for you to do during certain bosses. The combat system could be explain better in game then what it was, and the story does lack slightly from what I have (No romance for you JRPG romance nutts) and does have a few plot holes from what i've played. But this is truely a beautiufl game and I recommend PIcking it up.			"

												A fascinating game. If you like JRPGs this one will most likely not disappoint. Even if the standard Final Fantasy isn't your thing, this game might still be interesting.The characters are interesting so far, and break some of the old tropes (though some do remain as well).If I had to compare this game, I would say it has a very similar feel to Final Fantasy Tactics, especially Tactics Advance. It's got similar party managing. That said, it's more classic JRPG combat and not tactical stategy like Tactics. You also don't have much say in other characters than your main one. You can't choose their equipment or what skills they learn and such. This can either be a blessing to some or a con. I would personally like more customizability to the characters, but so far as I've noted and what I predict, the party system is going to become quite deep and involving, if you want.Combat has a nice element of twitchy QTE put in between the standard turn-based fighting. It can be somewhat challenging to land those criticals, but they are very rewarding (especially later on when you can get insane Teamwork-chains). In case you don't want to sit there with your fingers ready to press the right button all the time, you can also turn the critical QTEs automatic, which probably works similar to how the auto-trigger works in FFVIII.The story is so far interesting. We'll see how it develops.Recommended to fans of JRPGs and other turn-based RPGs.			"

												Last Remnant - exactly what the FF series should be like by now. FF XIII? Fal'Cie, L'Cie, and playing dress-ups with Lightning? Thanks, but no. The game has it's flaws, no argument here (feeling more like a budget title from Square because of lack of marketing, which is a pity) - and some are more serious than others, I admit. On top of that, it takes a while to get at least a bit familiar with the battle system, but man... is it satisfying when all the pieces come together in a boss fight :) Like a well-thought-through game of chess.The learning curve is something else alltogether. Want a druid in your group? Too bad, your unit just became a hunter. How about a warlock? Sounds neat, right? Tossing Mystic Arts around and obliterating enemies like nobody's business. Well, tough sh*t, you just got yourself a ninja. This is not a game for control freaks. A lesson I learned all too well with this game. And I'm thankful for that.There are tens of characters to pick from, across over 50 classes available, who may, or may not listen to what you want them to be. You do the math. With 18 characters on the battlefield, it really feels like you command an army to be reckoned with. And even with that number.... I was left with wanting a little bit more. Last Remnant feels more ""alive"" than anything I have ever played from Square Enix. Characters upgrade their weapons based on what they are ordered to do in battle, and just ask you for components. No time to grind for Vulture Rawhide that Nora has been bugging you about? Well, she will be stuck with her inferior hammer for the rest of the game. Your choice. This is how in-game fighting incentive should work. I don't want to fight monsters just to get enough EP to teleport the hell out of a zone... believe you me.Last Remnant (2009) looks way better than Lightning Returns (2014), and, from what I have seen playing the latter, is definitely more in-depth. Unless you like playing dress-ups, which, truth be told, is not this game's strongest suit. There's so much more to tell about this game, both positive, and negative (more summon options!), and I feel I just scratched the surface. Buy it, play it, EXPERIENCE it. Or don't, and let the world be swallowed by the misuse of remnants.Again, your choice. "

												Spectacular game that keeps you engaged with a very interesting squad-based ""rts/rpg"" hybrid combat system. Great storyline to follow, great graphics, well executed cutscenes. Good sense of overwhelming power from opponents, unsurmountable odds faced and beaten. One thing I would have to make sure to mention to anyone who purchases this game and plays, check and DOUBLECHECK that the ""autosave"" feature is on in the options or you may end up losing a LOT of progress. It's not on by default. Would rate it about a 9/10.			"

												This game is a beautiful and ambitious tweak to the JRPG formula.  A compelling. interesting story, coupled with above average voice acting and an interesting battle system culminates in one hell of a good time.  It does have its weak points, including the obscure nature of how to find some items required for leveling and a general sense that the game isn't giving you all the stats required to make inform decisions.  However, all in all, The Last Remnant delivers a great experience.Oh, and when it gets a bit sloggy 3/4 the way in?  Just push on through because the rest of the story is one to hold out for.If you loved FF, Tactics, and strategy, I highly recommend the title.  Great game, wish we'd see a sequel.			"

												Really nice TJRPG, where you control not a character, but a union (called as troop, squad, division, etc based on the leader of the union). You can change characters' weapons and the wield style (firm grip, dual wield, etc.). Skills available will change based on this. Characters' class will change gradually based on weapon type, skills and stats. Can be challenging when played for the 1st time with no knowledge of class, union system (had to go back and grind some levels to beat some bosses on my 1st playthrough).  Totally worth of purchase.			"

												I got this game from a Bundle, and it is for sure one of the best games of the bundle.The visual art and music is very similar to Final Fantasy games. Everything goes on a general world map where you can select stages and cities. The battle system is some kind of chess board, where every piece is a group of characters (party) and depending how you move every group, you will get better results on battle.It's a very good game, totally recommended, specially if it's on sale.

												Wow, what an adventure.To get to the nitty gritty, let me focus on a couple of parts of the game: the battle system, the story, and the ending.The battle system:The battle system of this game is unique and definitely improved the game in my opinion. If you are unfamiliar, you have multiple squads under your commands that attack in sets. If you've played Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic, it is somewhat similar, but much more smoothly executed and on a much grander scale. The battles feel huge in certain cases, and it really adds to the experience in that it makes it feel like you're fighting a war right off the bat, rather than just skirmishes.10/10The story: The story was very engaging, and this characteristic is largely why I prefer RPGs to other types of games. Though it has a couple of predictable plot twists, the world is immersive. The side quests definitely add to the story and add to the immersive-ness of the world, as well as providing tangible advantages such as recruiting valuable characters and the acquisition of powerful weapons. There were a couple of problems, such as the ending feeling rushed, but I'll get into that in the next section.8/10The ending: The ending was absolutely the worst part of the game. I think it's odd to feature the ending as a part of the review, but I felt very strongly about it. This game can be split up into two fairly individual parts (to the point where one could have actually been a sequel). The second half of the game felt rushed compared to the first part. I felt like, where the story had a comfortable and reasonable progression in the first half, I felt like I was barrelling through the story when I went at the same pace for the second. At endgame, the game really just kind of feels like it skids to an emergency halt. The final boss is scaled in difficulty to the progression of your character, which is nice, and the final boss did take me a few tries, but when I did actually beat it, I was for some reason a little disappointed. The ending cutscenes did give me a feeling that I was finished, but the satisfaction wasn't really there. For the reasons that the ending was sort of abrupt, but well written, I give the ending a6/10Overall:I highly recommend this game, overall 8/10			"

Gameplay is great and challenging, which some may not like trying to get started. Weapon/Armor upgrading great and the game has great replayability. Graphics are still pretty good, especially for a game released 6 1/2 years ago.  Best part, I caught this on a winter sale a few years ago  for $2.49.

												Start of the game is little slow and takes time till you get more party members that you can use,but after that game kicks off. Whole game has a challenging difficulty and its not for those that like to easily breeze thru game, it requires grinding to increase your stats,learn new skills and enhance existing ones. Combat is uniqe and takes some geting used to since you dont control directly what each character does but thats what i really like about it. Story is great. Overall, anyone who likes challenge in thier RPG game,I would recomend to try this one.			"

												I put quite a bit of time into this game(Circa 2009) trying to upgrade all characters I was using in my party before finally beating the game. Alot of times this game seems at odds with itself, leveling can cause issues due to the game attempting to rectify ease of difficulty that can arise from overleveling, but I was overleveling from the constant grind, attempting to get certain rare creatures to spawn in certain zones for equipment upgrades. I wish there was a follow up game with more polish. I was one of the fortunate souls who did not attempt to play this on the Xbox 360, and opted for the PC version which apparently was in a better state upon its release. The game is not without its bugs, and issues with settings as framerates go bonkers without any reason. The gameplay is rare in which you have teams of characters who work together to fight the enemy. Sometimes this system worked out, sometimes it became muddled with confusion. I would liken it to something similar to Bahamut Lagoon on the SNES which I recommend people play if they enjoyed this game. Although BL leans towards strategy games of the time. There are some areas where a fight essentially relies on trying it over and over and getting by purely on luck. These certain events were a letdown in many cases. There were alot of very poor rpgs being made at the time of this games debut and in general during its console generation, and it was a breath of fresh air in its attempt to add something to a genre dying from lackluster gameplay, visuals, and repetition, Hopefully we will see a game soon, likened as a spiritual successor or inspired by it.

The game does get progressingly difficult and certain decisions can just ruin your playthrough by making it so much harder to progress.

												really cool story and very good graphics for the time especially. strange combat system but fun when you get used to it but also kind of repetitive and tedious. i got so fed up with it i took like a 4 month break after i got close to finishing it. anyway i finally finished it on the first day of the new year and it was very satisfying i loved the world, the races, and the characters.sometimes it gets confusing on where to go because theres no quest markers for the main questline or anything like that nor is there a quest journal for the main questline. all the side quests go in that journal instead.VERY DIFFICULT by the way lots of the battles require multiple tries and tend to be very lengthy and challenging i probably broke my keyboard twice in frustration			"

												I'm only a couple of hours in at this point, but the PC version is a much more solid game. Thumbs up! If only Square Enix would spend more time on thier other ports.. Get it while its on sale! Game runs smooth and with your video cards AA and V-sync options, the game will look nice and clean. The batle system has a real learning curve. From what Iv'e read dont expect to just LVL grind and be overpowered. The game will scale with you. check out some of the guides for tips. Cheers!			"

												Overall 9/10If you like J-RPG’s, you must have this. The Last Remnant was one of the first genre releases by Square Enix back then in the early days of the X-Box 360 and long before Final Fantasy XIII got criticised for its linearity and lack of freedom, this game remembered the classics strengths of the genre and despite some of the typical flaws will always be one of my all-time favorites. The story uses the most common of tropes, when teenage hero Rush starts on a journey to save his kidnapped sister and stumbles into a larger narrative about the war of nations and ultimately the fate of the world. Despite the characters following archetypes we all have seen before in similar games, they are all fleshed out enough to be relatable. You will not just handle a small party of 3-4 heroes, but a small army of up to 18 characters. These can be recruited out of a much larger pool during the course of the adventure and lots of them are rewards for optional side quests or hidden missions. This is where the main fun lies, building and optimizing your army, you will have to arrange them into different groups, that will act as unit on the battlefield. That means a lot of actual gameplay happens in the menus before you actually engage an enemy. If you are fond of this kind of fumbling, you will love this game, if you however prefer a more action oriented approach, this might be frustrating. The battles themselves won’t give you too specific control over your team’s actions, but are still full of important decisions based on relative positioning and timing. Downside is, when your army is fully staffed everyone’s attack will be displayed individually, dragging even random encounters quite a bit (at least 1 minute per fight).Worth mentioning is, that you probably want to use a gamepad (ideally the X-box 360 controller) since the mouse keyboard optimization is horrible. You will also run into some brick walls along the way, where you will need to think carefully on how to approach. Specifically there is a very challenging sequence of 3 consecutive boss battles in the middle of the game, that you can get trapped in between. But again all this will shake things up and you have to do some work in the menus, re-shuffle your unions, re-align your formations and things might look brighter the next try. The general freedom between story progress and rewarding exploration will keep you playing for a long time if can muster the patience for the drawn out random encounters and the time spend in menus. The overall world structure, character design and storytelling is close to Final Fantasy XII while the battle system draws more from Final Fantasy Tactics. Not the worst references and therefore a must pay for any JRPG fan.Pros:- deep tactical combat- large amount of optional content- lovable characters- strong story with a great villainCons:- uneven difficulty curve- long duration of random encountersEdit: I want to clarify one point that I see frequently brought up in negative reviews. Yes, the finer mechanics of leveling are not explained well in game and external lecture is recommended, but if you normally play, follow the story and do side quests when they become available, you will encounter a smooth difficult curve. However, if you want to min-max and if you want to brute force encounters (that normally would scale) by keeping enemies weak (at a low Battle Rank) while your party is high, then you need to avoid fighting as much as possible early on. So yes, getting the most powerful party possible can be achieved by manipulating the systems and you need to read-up the internet to know how. But again for regular play this is not necessary, the game wants you to overcome difficult encounters by optimizing your tactic and setup, which works perfectly fine.			"

Feels like an MMO at times, with all the monster hunting and exploring you do, but thankfully most of it is completely optional, so you can play through the story at your own pace.I definitely recommend it, even to this date. If you're looking for an immersive experience and like the Romancing Saga series, then this is for you.			"

												Probably one of the best games I have played. The combat system is fairly unique and can take a little bit of getting used to but once you understand how it works it is absolutely the most polished and exciting combat system in any jrpg. The story is kind of cliched in parts but it is fairly engaging and the depth of the side quest, upgrade, and weapons systems is better done than many. That said it is a jrpg, you will grind, you fight unfair battles that will make you want to kill all living things within reach and you will forget to do something important that will stunt one characters growth in game but it is all worthwhile. I would be remiss in not recommending this game (on pc) to all who enjoy a good game that can suck you in for hours at a time.			"

												I played for 6.5 hours straight in the first sitting which is rare since I've gotten to the point where I have so many games if I don't immediately love it I try something else.Combat seems simple but gains complexity, lots of characters, you can gather materials for upgrading, side quests, open world exploring, and rare monsters to find.  Story doesn't seem bad either.  Gives me a FF12/FFX vibe.Definitely recommend for anyone who likes FF or JRPGs.Edit: After quite a bit more playtime I wanted to mention this game is very hard at parts and its not obvious how to improve your party.  You have a 'battle rank' but that isn't equivalent to a level.  Someone BR 65 can struggle at the same parts as a BR 30.  A lot of the boss fights come down to simple luck if you get your random 'special skill' or not.  When the game gives you a warning that you won't be able to leave if you save somewhere make sure to use a new save slot.			"

												It's a good game, no doubts but it isn't perfect. The story is ok, you  can find a lot of places if you are patient to explore everything you can. The combat system is cool and it requires a lot of strategy and the fact that you can use a lot of characters in one battle make this game a concentration of skill and tactics. There are many different and interesting quests and is a game very enjoyable. The problem is about the gdr itself becouse the characters have a lot of customization but the customize themselves automatically achieving objects. It can be ok but the problems comes when you acquire the objects but they still don't need them and the game doesn't allow you to give them back when they need them so, even if you still got the objects they need, anyway you have to farm the objects again and it's so frustrating. All in all is a good game.			"

												It is a fun game. it has a weird leveling and combat system that i say would turn off people who are more used to more popular RPGs like final fantasy and while it has a nice story, the pacing is a bit off to me and not very fluid. However, the combat system is very unique and can lead to various gameplays and strategies. for a 2009 game, the graphics are very good (but then again, graphics never really matters to me). i never played the xbox version but it has been said that the PC version is a lot better.the bad thing about this game is that they basically don't tell you about anything other than how to fight enemies. it has so much more than that like the upgrading and the leveling system. that leads to people, like me, to resort to outside help like wikis to play them or people just quitting the whole game because they cant figure anything out. if you play blindly and succeed, then i salute you. all in all, i would love to see more of the world and its people and its battle and leveling system expanded. i recommend the game for people who love turn-based RPGs, nice character design, great lore and/or strategy in RPGs (which i would say in a turn-based non-SRPG games are pretty rare). although this is a minor point, i would not recommend the game for people who like to control their party members individually as the battle system can get pretty random unless you set up correctly and for people who cannot stand the phrase ""LET'S DO THIS!!!!""7.5/10			"

												With all it's flaws, this game is still one of my top 5 favourites. First of all it's challenging. If you are doing a full gameplay with all side quests and all, it will take an effort to get to the end. You MIGHT have to grind but I didn't feel it necessary. And even if I wanted to grind a little, and I didn't want to waste too much time, I sped the battle up, and it wasn't such a painful experience.Second of all the characters are awesome. They are all unique, with different characteristics and reasons to fight. I found it really nice that I could choose who to play with. And a lot of them have a special ability which one might consider to get, since it will not only look awesome but it also helps in battle. Just look up the wiki and see how many unique and special characters and abilities this game has. One can't even get every one of it by playing through once!No matter if the story is linear or the desert is so f*cking big that it takes half an hour to walk from one side to the other. You will probably never spend there that much time anyway. When I finished the game and it told me that I can  actually replay the whole, I was sure that I will visit this world again, and this time I make it count that I get every little secret it has in store for me.All in all it's an amazing game. Play it if you are up for the challenge and would like to hear a story about the magnificent world of Remnants!			"

												This game hits all the points on the checklist of JRPG's that a company like Squeenix would cling to. Unfortunately the whole thing is a clunky jumbled mess. The grindy portions feel grindy, the story portions fee forced and disconnected from the rest of the game, and it feels as though they chose mechanics then made (very poor) excuses as to why these mechanics exist.Pass on this game even though I'm sure it will be under $5 in a Steam sale.

												The game tries so hard to be a squd-based strategic rpg. An nearly gets it done at least halfway. Which basically means that the base system is good - you can find / hire new units, put them in a squad together and then give them positions in different formations depending on their function. You can even costumize the different units pretty well, in regards of abilities and equipment. In combat you then choose overall orders like ""attack enemy with magic / physical abilites"" etc. Overall the system is a bit similar to Fire Emblem.But that is where the bad stuff happens. Actually the game never bothers to tell you anything. Not about how the specialization, itemization and development of units works. Not even what the different orders for the combat do. That is where the game just becomes a bad joke. At some point I got three options for hitting the enemies with physical abilities. All costing the same amount of ability points, but I had no clue what order makes what unit use which ability. For a game that wants you to micro so much of the units, their equipment and their skills, you have practicall NO controll over their behaviour in combat. Another example: At some point I decided to do a pure healer squad for backing my fighters up, since they got ganged by AoE-attacks during a hard fight. So I put a few magic users in a squad, told them to only use their healing abilities and let them wait in the background to heal the others. Which was utterly useless. Only like every 3 rounds I got the option to heal the other squad, which was pretty dead at that point. BUT was I happy to notice that my healers had the possibily to smach the dragons skill in with their puny staffs.Also, of course you don't know what enemies you fight before you encounter them. So in the same area there can be a group of 2 units which you can one-hit. Then the next encounter is a disguised mini-boss, who summons elite squads every round and hit all your squads every time it attacks. No jokes, those monsters stood right next to each other.Also I can and will not give thumbs up for a game that just continues to crash when you attempt to change the graphic options. That is just flat out ridiculous.			"

												This game... I really can not understand how this game could get so many positive reviews. It failes at so many levels. First of all it features the most annoying male protagonist ever. And that really isn't a good start for a game when the character you start the game with is causing you pain just listening to him.It also features a horribly random combat system. Not just is the order in which characters and enemies got to take an action random. Also the actions a character has available at his turn are down to randomness. You desperately need to heal? Well, you can only pray that in the next turn the game gives you the option to heal as one of the available actions. I lost a lot of fights not because of doing anything wrong, but simply because the random number generator decided to not give me the option to heal when I would have needed it. Terrible design. Another prime example of terrible design would be the leveling system. It's probably the most counter-intuitive leveling system ever featured in an RPG. Rule number 1: the less you fight the easier the game is. Getting a higher battle rank in this game is NOT a good thing. It will make basically all encounters harder up to the point that some become outright frustrating thanks to the randomness of the combat system.The easiest way to play this game is to just run through the areas and avoid fighting as much as possible...I never finished the game. The combination of meh story, painful main character, and the terribly random combat system extinguished my interest in completing the game fairly quickly.I really can not recommend this game to anyone. Both gameplay and story fail to deliver.			"

												Not the worst JRPG you've played, but it's the most frustrating and annoying of them...-Keyboard+mouse controls... looks like people who ported the game saw K+M for the first time in their lives, gamepad is strongly recommended.-VERY limited control of your units. Every turn you have 5 random options to chose from and thats it. You might have no option to heal when you're desperately in need of it and you might be screwed even if you have it cause you can heal with ITEMS or MAGIC or both and you will get the one which isn't so powerful.-No matter what, your weakest union WILL be gangraped 99% of the time, every monster on the field wants their blood.-Monster AOE spells are overpowered beyond belief, even the weakest monster in the area (~same level as you) can onesot your party in 1 turn. Lets say normal monster attack hits for 100, singletarget ability hits for 300, AOE ability hits for 300 every unit in your union, which will result in 1500 damage on 5ppl... Some BIG monsters can AOE multiple unions and erase your party in a single spell... and they will cast it FREQUENTLY.-You can't surrender, so if you're trying to beat a very strong rare enemy and it destroys half or your units on the first turn... you must watch the other half die, sometimes very slowly.-You CAN'T skip cutscenes. After some cutscenes you will be immediately thrown into battle, and if you lose it... load your save and watch 5+ min cutscene again.-You can equip only your main protagonist, others can only request some components and RARELY items from your inventory, so you can sit on a pile of top gear and no ability to use it. It's not a huge minus anyway, cause all you have is main/offhand weapon and 2 accessory slots.-Though locations are pretty unique and well done you will be forced to visit them over and over again if you want to complete sidequests or hunt for rare monsters for the guild. Every quest teleports you to corresponding location and teleports back to tavern IMMEDIATELY after it's completion.-The world and lore are really interesting, but the story feels like it's written for the 12 y/o. This ""flaw"" can be seen in almost every Japanese game (atleast in my experience) and can be forgiven.-Battle system is pretty good for a JRPG, but it's very annoying that you can't skip battles with weak monsters when revisiting old locations.I'd give it 6/10, but put a huge red FRUSTRATION WARNING on it.

												I've never played any of the other games this one is ""based"" off of, such as Romancing SaGa. After playing this for a bit, I never will. I did not enjoy this game at all. This is very much a game that you NEED (and I honestly mean that it is required) to read a how-to-play guide before you ever get started. Partly because the party/control/gameplay system is ridiculously convoluted at first, but also because there are inherently backwards gameplay things you absolutely need to know before you start.For example, battle rank (BR). BR is basically determined by how many enemies you kill. It's not like EXP though, from what I understand, because (from what I've read) it more or less keeps track of the number of times you enter combat, and not anything related to the toughness of the monsters you kill. You want to keep BR as low as possible, since your characters get better stat increases at low BR, and the enemies will scale with you, potentially even causing you to be out-leveled at later stages in the game.This is idiotic. Why the flaming crap do they fill areas chock-full of enemies that you can beat, and then say ""Nuh-uh, you'll regret it later"" and ""You're doing the smart thing and attacking enemies one at a time!? HOW DARE YOU, NOW YOU MUST SUFFER!"" Plus, this is not explained to you at all. Of course, neither is 98% of the rest of the game.The combat is weird, and strangely hard to follow. You will assign your unions (squads of units) to attack certain other enemies, but when the attack round starts, the unions run at each other in this pre-scripted ""action"" scene that makes it really hard to mentally place where they are actually running to. It's hard to explain, but immediately noticeable. Honestly, this game would be way better if they cut out the cinematic crap and just gave you a flat overhead view of the battle.Not a fan. I played it for maybe 10 hours, and was lost and frustrated for 10.6 of them. This game has no direction, no tutorials, and completely illogical gameplay mechanics. If you feel like studying guides for 5 hours before playing, be my guest. I choose to play something actually fun, and actually challenging without resorting to cheap tricks like withholding information.			"

												When the words Square Enix and RPG go together great things happen, unfortunately The Last Remnant is proof that even the best in the business can get it wrong.  Despite solid potential in the form of an excellent storyline and brilliant characters, the game is let down by an awqward progression system and a difficulty curve that is so inconsistent, a visual representation would look like a bowl of frustrated spaghetti.The Last Remnant follows an intriguing storyline, vividly brought to life through brilliant character acting and the very best quality voice acting.  The excellent production allows the player to really connect with the characters and experience the feels of story to the fullest.  Unfortunately, the ridiculous jumps in difficulty negate this by forcing the player to spend great lengths of time struggling to progress, ultimately destroying the rhythm of the story.  Impossible chain boss fights are sudden and deny the player any chance for recuperation, so much so that even multiple save files will not save you (hue hue) from hours of punishment.  Add to this the long, arduous random battles which can accumulate into hours of necessary grinding to rectify the tardy and deceptive progression system known as 'battle rank' and any enjoyment quickly fizzles away.The main point of interest in The Last Remnant is the battle system.  The player controls several parties of characters in the form of a turn based strategy with real time combat elements.  This is not particularly effective as the player is limited to a pre-determined set of attacks depending on the situation, inevitably replacing strategy with luck.  The real time combat elements have been cleverly integrated to sway the tide of battle if executed correctly and play a major role in determining the outcome of each fight.  Outside of battle the gameplay is fairly limited in terms of exploration and despite there being plentiful completionist content and a strangely addictive appeal, the majority is simply empty dialogue followed by a re-run of previously visited dungeons.Overall, The Last Remnant shows promise but quickly succumbs to its flaws which hinder the game from ever competing on the same level as it's better known stablemates.  If you are an RPG enthusiast with a high tolerance for frustration then you may be able to enjoy The Last Remnant.  If not, you would be better off looking elsewhere.3 subligars out of 5.			"

												This is a game for players who love sidequests. The game is maybe 80 percent side quests and 20 percent story. There are the usual side quests of tracking down rare monsters and building new kinds of weapons. But there are also other kinds of side quests, such as collecting herbs for a scientist. The combat system is unique and original- it's not like any other Square Enix RPG you might play.It is an immersive game that requires a high time commitment. A lot of the dungeons take a good long while to get through. This is offset by the ability to save wherever you want anywhere you can bring up the menu. The game accepts input from a keyboard or a USB controller. I've used both and found that in spite of twelve to fifteen keys being available for use, I only ever use five of them (besides my number pad).The characters are mostly developed through battle. It's a little easier to tell what they're thinking when they vocalize in Japanese. The voice acting is original and accurate. There's a weird little frog man with orange skin and a high pitched voice. There's a bulky white whale person with a deep, gruff voice. And there's a female knight who doesn't take any crap from anybody. It feels like an old Super Nintendo game with better graphics. Highly recommended.			"

												The Last Remnant. JRPG ala final fantasy buatan square enix yang diport untuk xbox360 dan PC windows. Sebelum Final Fantasy XIII dirilis untuk PC, mungkin The Last Remnant adalah satu-satunya JRPG dengan grafis modern di PC.Cerita (7/10)Biarpun mungkin terlihat sederhana, namun cerita TLR sebenarnya cukup rumit bila kita memainkan semua side quest yang diberikan. Seperti asal usul suatu tempat dan runtuhnya kerajaan kuno. Semuanya diberikan sepotong-sepotong. Kalau kita hanya mengikuti alur cerita mungkin akan terasa banyak lubang di cerita ini.Gameplay (8/10)Gameplay TLR sangat unik. Tidak hanya 3-4 karakter yang bisa jadi anggota party kita tapi sampai 18 karakter! Eksekusinya cukup mudah berdasarkan union yang terdiri hingga 5 karakter. Kita bisa mengelompokkan union mana yang melakukan combat art (serangan fisik), mystic art (serangan mystic) support atau healing. Penggunaan formasi juga berpengaruh dalam menghadapi boss tertentu. Grafis (4/10)SIsi grafis cukup menyedihkan. Dunia dalam TLR sebenarnya sangat indah dan detail, sayang sekali penggunaan Unreal Engine tidak maksimal. Hal paling menyedihkan adalah saat pindah scene ada jeda 2-3 detik untuk loading texture. Sangat menyedihkan.........			"

												Oh boy, where do I begin. While on steam I have only logged in a bare minimum of time, I seriously no-lifed this game when I borrowed a friends console. This is perhaps one of Square-Enix's crowning triumphs, which is ironic since they did it as an offshoot idea under the name of one of their mini-producers. This game brought a unique twist to turn based combat rpg by combining some strategy as well as seperate squads and heroes. The storyline was long (as to be expected from anything Square-Enix is involved in) and very satisfying. The graphics were gorgeous, and after the ending I felt many emotions, the 3 main ones being triumph at victory, sadness for having come to the end of a long journey, and an unsatable desire for more! My only complaint for this game is that the pc edition is literally the console version slapped onto a computer, so everything (and I mean EVERYTHING) is set up assuming you have a controller. For this reason I recommend getting a controller to play this with just to make life easier. Even with this minor setback though, on a scale of 1-10 I can willingly rate this a 9 maybe even a 9.5. I had hoped for a sequel, but alas it seems that will not be.			"

												Archetypal three-out-of-five star game. Probably at least 100 hours to finish everything, but the constant re-use of dugneons and areas fosters a ""why bother?"" kind of attitude.The writing and story fall dead center into the average of what you'd expect from a smaller-budget JRPG -- it poaches and steals from every trope you can imagine, leaving no stone unmolested. Even the moldiest old concept is trotted out a few dozen times throughout the storyline. So if you've seen and liked it in a JRPG before, you'll probably see it again in The Last Remnant, just this time in a worn-out-STD-infected-completely-trashy kind of way,In some ways this game makes me want to hire a skywriter to tour Japan and paint the heavens with a simple message: ""<Blank> did <insert bad thing> to my <blank> is NOT AN ACCEPTABLE STORY."" Because somehow, even in 2008, Square Enix appeared to believe that their customers could be hoodwinked into giving hafl a damn about some characaracter whom we were just introduced to 2 seconds ago, and the bad thing that happened to her. If you find this kind of lazy writing to be offputting, I implore you: stop reading right now, back out of this game's store page, and never let its pixels illuminate your screen again.The art direction is okay, and the graphcis are decent for a game first released fairly early in the Xbox 360's lifespan. It runs well on a modern PC. If you hate the way Unreal Engine 3 games look, you'll probably hate the way this game looks.The combat system is fairly atrocious. It wants to look complex, but anyone with half a brain can figure the ins-and-outs within a short period of time and turn the game into a mindless slog from start to finish. Also, 52353253242345 unwanted fights while backtracking. And believe me, there's some backtracking in this game.I freely admit that I didn't beat this game. I actually enjoyed it a lot of the time, and might finish it one day. But that's just because I'm into this terrible-but-enjoyable kind of game.Recommended to hardcore must-play-everything gamers, serious JRPG fans, and the mentally disturbed.			"

												The Last Remnant was part of an experiment by Square-Enix to make two new Japanese RPG IPs with the Unreal Engine 3 side-by-side with the development of Final Fantasy XIII. In my honest opinion, this experiment was much more successful than the experiments they made with Final Fantasy XIII itself.Final Fantasy XIII gave almost no player freedom while The Last Remnant allows players to make choices. Final Fantasy XIII had no towns and thus lost its sense of a cohesive and defined world while The Last Remnant has multi-sectioned town hubs ala golden-era Final Fantasies and tends to reward going off the beaten path. Final Fantasy XIII has a combat system that relies mostly on auto-battle with occasional 'paradigm shifts' and healing while The Last Remnant has a legitimately challenging combat system, even for vetern JRPG players. Lastly, Final Fantasy XIII had a story needlessly convoluted by invented words with no proper explanations to define them that essentially boiled down to 'we're cursed, we don't know why, let's pad out 40 hours talking about it amongst ourselves and then kill God' while The Last Remnant's story is more focused and explains itself better, allowing for a much better experience than looking up words in an in-game encyclopaedia.That said, the main character, Rush Sykes, annoys me in this game almost as much as Tidus from Final Fantasy X, but the mechanics in this game really save it from me placing it in the same category as FF X, which I hate immensely.

												I don't understand this game. Why is it trying to keep you away, from a truly epic ending, by any means necessary?Annoying main character, that i only liked once, in the very end of the game. Forgettable sidekicks/companions, expect for a few, particularly Dave, he really reminds me of King Cailan, from Dragon Age, and i'm glad he didn't die, in some ""epic"" plot twist.Cheating. Yup, i said it. The game cheats. I don't have a problem with a tough challange, but i hate when a game is either buged, or so ridiculously keen on punishing you, that it resorts to dirty tricks.Some say this game is like Dark Souls. But that game requires skill, this heavily relies on luck, not skill, or tactical foresight.Repetitive luck-based battle system, backed by repetitive music, and aimless wandering around the map, to connect all of this.After some point, i realized, the only reason i start this game up, is because i want to be done with it as fast as possible. I rushed and exploited my way through half of the game, to be done with it.Would i start a new game+? No. Why would i? To grind through the same linear story, and risk the possibility of a brain aneurysm? No thank you.You might have more luck with this game, than i had, but i definitely recommend reading a few guides before starting. So go ahead, the beautiful scenery, and climactic ending, might be worth the hussle.5/10			"

												Where to start?TLR Is a prime example of a unique and interesting idea executed poorly but even so, It's still a decent game if you can ignore all of the issues.The isn't much beyond your typical JRPG style here and this is both good and bad. Firstly the music, oh my dear god what fresh hell is this? It's as if square have taken the old school way of ""Just repeat 5 seconds of music over and over"" from their old FF titles and thrown it in to a modern (at the time of release) game.There's really no variation in it. The battle music is the same no matter the enemy or the area, it is always the same and after a couple of hours you get so damn sick of hearing it. Every area has its own music while exploring but don't expect anything memorable or creative because these little pieces of music are the same five seconds stuck on a seemless loop that quite frankly drives me insane to the point where I had to turn the music volume down to 0.The voice acting is about what you would expect from any square game really. The voice actors were quite clearly ripped from older titles and some random anime by the sounds of it, the dialogue is cheesy (Who doesn't love a bit of cheese?) and you hear the characters talk in combat too. That in itself is a neat idea but that dialogue is as repetative as the music they are talking over but luckily square give you an option to disable the combat dialogue all together, thanks square.The combat is the unique idea that was executed poorly. It could of been so much more than what it is. You feel like you can do so much but the reality is you can't really do anything at all other than sit there with your fingers crossed hoping the enemy you encounter will have an option for you to use a specific attack.You group your characters in to units, you attack with a single unit by selecting an enemy unit but you have no controll over what attacks the characters in said unit will use which is pretty damn stupid when in order to ""Level up"" it's the ""Gain expereince by doing"" approach so the more you use a skill, the more powerful it will become.That's awesome and all but doesn't have much merit when you have no control over what skills are being used in the first place. You have to wish that the enemy unit you have selected lets a character use a specific attack. Healing in this game is also pretty redundant to be honest because if you want to heal a lot you have to break off from your engagement. You'll get max health back but then an enemy unit will ambush you in to a ""Raidlock"" which means you take more damage and the enemy unit does more damage making all of that healing you just did completely pointless.Why have I given this game a thumbs up even though I have all these issues with it? Because it's still fun.The world they drop you in is interesting, you can tell there's a decent amount of lore there but you'll never learn any of it. It does feel like an old school JRPG in a modern style with a unique but somewhat pooryl executed combat system. It's cheap as hell so I say give it a go and if you don't like it? Steam refunds are a thing.			"

This is especially true for a certain spectacular duel between one of the Heros and one of the Villains about 2/5 of the way through the game, and I do mean it when I say 'spectacular'!Would certainly now place this in the category of 'Greatest RPGs of all time', but it is definitely one worth playing if you want something out of the ordinary.Note to those who prefer the Japanese dubs: Although a Japanese game, this was originally made in English, while the PC version does have the Japanese dub, it was done after the English was completed and so does not match the cutscenes very well. The English dub isn't bad though.			"

												Thanks to Warutaru, I don't need to ask about keyboard settings. While the graphics are not as fluent as all other Square Enix games, I do enjoy the game. I'm iffy about the battle system, but I can get used to it like I did with Kingdom Hearts. I did have a problem with the keyboard gameplay since I didn't really know which key is which, but I don't have that problem anymore. The game is really good. I do like it and I do reccomend it. I just need to make sure not to try and fall asleep during a battle again.			"

												A rather entertaining game of fantasy squad warfare with incredible depth, Last Remnant is marred by only two things. First, the main character is simply obnoxious. Second, where the game informs you of some basics, it does little to explain much of its mechanics. This makes the depth occassionaly impenetrable and more of a liability than an attraction as you may be left wondering why certain abilities are available in some situation but not other or what the various special effects mean.

												Great improvement from the 360 version with better optimization and less bugs. Loaded with secrets and has a Suikoden-sized cast of party members. The PC version works great as long as you force v-sync and use JP dub with subs because the english voice acting is awful. The combat is... ""unique"", to put it nicely. Early on it is frustrating because it feels slow with small squads and later it feels frustrating because your units like to do stupid things if you don't micro between fights. So basically, combat is uniquely rage inducing and worth playing just for that. Combat scales based on your average level except for certain storyline bosses. Difficulty is all over the place but usually challenging when you expect it to be. Overall this is a decent JRPG/strategy game but definitely not for everyone.			"

												The easiest way to tell if you will enjoy this game is to take this simple test, stop reading if you answer ""no"" since this game is not for you. Do you like JRPGs? Do you enjoy a difficult challenge (really stressing the difficult here). Do you enjoy  unique combat systems and large casts of characters, several of which have very detailed backstories. If you have answered yes to the aforemented, buy this game, now. No seriously do it, its one of the most enjoyable and simultaneously frustrating games I've ever played (due to its difficulty). The main selling point in this game for me was the battle system, you fight with large squads in a 3 dimensional battle zone where numerous variables often mean the difference between victory or defeat. With the game having a maximum of 18 player characters in a single battle, in up to 5 squads, its understandable to see how it can be a confusing and complex battle system where sometimes you are not given the options you want when you want them, this can be handled with tweaking abilities before a fight as I learned later on, but it is an incredibly complex battle system which is well beyond anything Square Enix or any developer I'd wager has done. The story is the typical serving from Square Enix, although much more like their older titles (as in focused on single story and world but giving you lots of free reign to explore and expand the story with relevant side missions). The general premise for the game is hard to explain, and for that I'd refer you to the game itself as it is told quite well and it evolves as you progress through the game, one thing leads to another etc. The music is good as are the graphics for this title, with only some details being loaded delayed (could be my end). The voiceacting and dialogue is a mixed bag, with sometimes it being well scripted and logical, while other times it is random and idiotic (sometimes in a good way). In summary I give a full recommendation, its  one of the true JRPGs on steam at this time, if not the only one. It isn't for everyone, however if you are a JRPG fan, and have the time to sit down and dive into the masterpiece which is The Last Remnant, I fully recommend it.			"

And while it's not a very good PC port... it's on the Unreal Engine - an engine that anyone can blow wide open.			"

Posted: March 1
												Just...No.This game looks pretty, has a pretty positive rating, and has an interesting battle system, but that same battle system is also what killed any interest I had for this game.In the game, when you win a battle, you have a chance for something called your Battle Rating (BR) to increase in level. This sounds good, but just wait.The game alters the difficulty based on your BR. This is especially true for bosses, who can become impossible to defeat if your BR is over a certain number. Meaning that, if you decided to go out and grind a little, thinking it wouldn't hurt, you may very well be doing away with any chance you had at defeating an upcoming boss.How do you make the game playable? That's simple: You avoid every battle that you can possibly slip past. No random encounters, no mobs in the field, nothing. You can't even grind unless it's in certain parts of the game, and at certain times, unless you want to risk ruining your chances at progressing. That keeps your BR at a low number, which means bosses become 'easier' (I say it this way because, really, they're still ridiculously overpowered). ""But this game has so many positive reviews!"" you might be saying, as your cursor hovers over the BUY button. That would be because most of the people who have played this and beaten it are either 'hardcore', don't know the difference between a poor design choice and a good one, or are just masochisitic. You can sink eight hours into the game, and find yourself unable to even beat a single random encounter, simply because you wanted to level up your party members.Unless you've got some sort of demented craving for an overly difficult game, or you're seriously wanting to spend money on something you may never play, my advice to you is this:Stay. Away. If you value your sanity, you'd do well to give this game a wide berth. It's not worth spending hours trying to even understand how or why this game is even out on the market.			"

Like a Final Fantasy game, the art is great, especially the character designs, even if the animation falters a bit.  I guess the developers were still getting used to the Unreal Engine.  That's totally forgiveable, though.  But the gameplay is just boring & awkward.  I could never bring myself to finish it, & not because it was difficult.  Take from that what you will.			"

												It's Final Fantasy; same gameplay, same mechanics, same character design and a typical Final Fantasy storyline. If you like Final Fantasy, then you will probably like this.As is typical for Final Fantasy games, all in-game controls are shown as controller buttons rather than as mouse or keyboard buttons. This game was meant to be played with a controller. Not being able to just click on what I want to do and having to scroll through options one at a time instead is too much for me to bear, but I suspect this type of control is fine to those who find Final Fantasy games enjoyable in the first place.There are a lot of cutscenes and I don't think they can be skipped (at least I couldn't figure out a way to do so). If you aren't into the story, then the cutscenes could be a chore for you. They were for me, so I won't be returning to the game.			"

												Square Enix's attempt to mix deeper turn-based JRPG combat with a new intellectual property and story.As such it only fails the second half.The outcropping of standard JRPG combat to fit combat concepts in to the rather mundane grind of the average SQE game. Long range vs. Short range, morale, party formations, and enemy flanking are a few examples of this attempt.The game doesn't fail its execution of those mechanics, but it does fail in preventing the usual JRPG combat from feeling repetitive and exhausting. Enemy encounters are won differently from other SQE titles, but fought the same within the game, and as such becomes as samey and boring as the games it tries to differ itself from.Lots of hidden uncalculative stats and functions operating in the background, only serve to prove how ashamed it is of it's combat and micromanagement, which is unfortunate.The story is♥♥♥♥♥♥ and the japanese VO is weeb-level laughable.

												Oh SquareEnix... are you ever going to come up with an original idea that DOESN'T suck balls? Seriously wtf is going on in this game? The battle system is so arbitrary, it makes no sense... I make a choice and the outcome is never the same twice. When I want to fight, I expect to do just that... not die. Every time you think you're making a good desicion the game thinks otherwise and punishes you for it... Like oh, you thought you had an opening? Well now the A.I. decides to randomly flank you and realize you were coming even though their backs are turned.... unreal.The plot is also non-existant... so if you're interested in playing for the story, think again, this game has nothing of value. Go around doing random fetch / rescue quests and recruiting super deformed characters that can't fight because they're given vague battle instructions from team leaders that can't distinguish their asses from their elbows. ""Stay Alive"", ""Fight for your Life"", ""Protect yourself"", ""Use Spells"", ""Fight them...maybe"" ... yeah great command list.This game is not for any one really, your patience will be tested to it's limits with this pile of donkey♥♥♥♥♥♥			"

Из всех опций вам дают лишь небольшой набор, и шанс выпадения определённых действий напрямую зависит от класса главы отряда.

I sat there for a good minute trying every button on the entire keyboard, and none of them worked.So here's an even further list of beefs:> No rebindable keys> Extremely intrusive Depth of Field which hides all details except for what's in the dead center of the screen, and even then it's extremely aggressive use means you can only see parts of whatever character is in focus> No graphics settings> Framerate caps in combat> Voice acting sounds like it was recorded in a bathroom. To test this, I went into my bathroom and attempted to mimick the voices of the few characters I heard. No surprise, I sounded exactly like the characters.> Unskippable cutscenes> Completely impossible to play without a gamepad			"

												Ok, this is a tale about saving the world. It has an anime flair, and it is a tactical RPG in the sense that when you fight you have to use tactics and not simply mash an attack button. The graphics are nice, the music becomes annoying after awhile, and in general combat can become repetative.The biggest complaint that I have with this game is that the combat system is simply not explained at all. The game relies on synergy between teammates while they are grouped in squads, you do not get to pick exactly what skill your character will use, it is dependant on how many action points they have and who their teammates are and what skills they have to use. This means that fights can seem random and when you think you can win a fight with a certain skill, it may not be available. The factors deciding who does what in combat are simply not explained in game and make much of the strategy and tactics that this game really does well pointless. Better than Final Fantasy combat though.			"

												As much as i\'d like too, i can\'t really find a good reason to recommend this game. Last Remnant brings some interesting ideas on the table, but also have some very serious flaw that drags him down. The unions battle system doesn\'t really deliver the strategic feeling it should; too much RNG screwing up battles, sometime in your favour, sometime not.  You can\'t command action freely for every member; RNG will decide if you get a good command or not. You can\'t decide when and if the QTE for critical strikes will trigger; RNG will decide if you get a chance for a damage increase or not. Same thing for the special attacks that certain characters can use. Heck, you can\'t even freely change any of your party members equipment! There is simply no excuse for this, it\'s just bad design. For the majority of the game, the outcome of every battle that is not faceroll easy will be decided solely on rng dodges, rng parries, rng crits, rng special commands, and so on. As a result, you will not find any form of satisfaction within the gameplay, not even when you win. As for the rest:Video: visuals are nice considering the release date, but level design sucks, with the same halls and corridors that repeat themself over and over. Every location has it\'s flair of course, but just one, with almost zero variations within it. Animations works fine within battle and in most of the cutscenes, outside of them tend to be kinda crappy and unrealistic. The game also presents some technical problems: costant screen tearing (you can turn the vsync on editing the .ini file, but it will not work regardless) and texture-popping are the most noticeable. There are some partial fixes around the web, though.Audio: OST is good but without any kind of personality. Also, many locations have shared music. Narrative: the story is nothing special - but good enough to grab your attention \'till the endgame, even if some part of it seemed like rushed, some almost absurdly so. Characters are generally well designed, but the protagonist can be very, very annoying at times.________________If you are searching for a jrpg with an unique feeling, and you are capable of keeping your cool even after dying again, and again, and again just because of bad luck, then maybe you can consider to buy this game. The price is low afterall, especially on sale, and the title can keep you busy for a lot of hours. If not, then it\'s probably better to spend your money on something else.  "

												If on offer and very VERY cheap pick it up maybe to waste some time, but honestly if your buying from steam just buy the FFX / X-2 bundle instead , FFX is so far superior to this its not even in the same league. Quick e.g. you have a union that you give an objective to like 'back them up' or 'keep up your hp' then they try to do it, great idea in theory but the game consatntly decides your not allowed to do something and wont give you the option, for e.g a union with 5 guys in it, 3 can heal, full AP not silenced , health flahsing WILL die next turn and no option to heal.  Unfortunately this happens a lot and really wrecks the game. I let my brother play it as he's an easier going person than I, i'm not so forgiving for annoying pointless crap with no reasoning behind it, and coming from the same company that brought us FF is just unforgivable.TL:DR = buy FFX instead, much better game.

Even so, it does not detract enough from the game that you can't enjoy it. Everything is done well and it is certainly an enjoyable game, it is just that the combat gets very repetitive quickly. Catch this on sale unless you can afford something better like FFXIII-2. Otherwise, this game isn't too bad, maybe a 7/10 at best.			"

												Graphicstyle and combat in this game are alright, in fact, they are pretty good. Story seems fine as well, however... Early leveling in the game is just horrible. You can't fight more than 1-2 monster group(s) at same time or you'll get killed way too easily and have to start over from your last save - the thing is, monsters on the maps are usually very close to each other so you cant even start a fight with just 1 - and sometimes 1 monster on map has up to 3 groups of monsters.Also, I don't like the camera or controls.At the moment, I wish I hadn't bought the game, but i will play it to the end when I have time and see if my opinion changes.

												It pains me to write this review. I am a big fan of square enix and of the games produced by them. When I saw this title on steam, i thought 'ah, cool. An rpg by one of my favorite video game companies.'After playing for about two hours, my initial reaction was completely turned around. While the game does have 3d animation comparable to the time it was produced, the remainder of the game is sub-par from what I have seen of other titles by square enix.The battle system is extremely boring and repetative. While it is easy to learn, it doesn't make sense. Instead of controlling a single character or issuing commands to multiple characters, you issue orders to squads, or ""unions"" as they are called in the game. And the types of commands are limited to the circumstances of the battle, but are limited to [basic attack], [special attack], [magical attack] and even more rarely [heal]. Once you give the orders, the characters are pretty much left to their own devices, attacking whichever creature they so choose and in whatever fashion they want, which can and has in my case not gone in favor of a winning battle. Not being able to plan and strategize a battle plan with all your characters makes fights far more difficult than they should be, given all that you can input in the commands.I could have seen past the battle system if the storyline and/or voice acting/dialogue were good. Sadly, that was not the case either. I felt like I was watching a really poorly written anime. The main character, who is perhaps 15, I am guessing, meets an important nobleman and suddenly becomes part of the army, fighting shoulder to shoulder with top level generals and no one raises a fuss. The characters seemed very stiff, almost no emotion going into the dialogue. The bad guys are easily spotted and are cliche'.Overall, I am dissappointed in this title.			"

												Disinteresting and unchallenging trash-mob combat with insane difficulty spikes for boss battles which necessitate massive grinding to overcome.  Unfortunately the leveling (Battle Rank) system is far from transparent, leaving you at a loss for how to best improve your characters.  One should not require the wiki to understand a basic game mechanic.Storyline seems good, but the horrible battle system and poor difficulty scaling make this one game I will not be seeing through to completion.

												I really did try to like this game because of all the positive reviews it had. Most of the characters are forgetable, in the story. The villians do not represent themselves in any fashion as to why they wanna conquer the world. Seems a bit cliche. I never understood how the main villian keep recruiting more people for his cause so I can kill them too. The six bases with the 8 bosses? They were all people that I -just- met. They insult me and I kill them just like everyone else this guy solicits. Why is there no characterization?I was reading that an article on how the JP and NA markets value different aspects in a game and maybe that's just the problem. I am too american to enjoy this game. Maybe someone else might. GL if you decide to buy this. :(			"

												I ordered my 20-men army to murder a frightened bandit who didn't want to fight, and learned how to read and love as a result.  I then used his hipbone to craft a belt buckle for a quest given to me by a woman whose husband was probably the bandit I had killed.			"

												Oh dear god.  I thought RPG games on PC were supposed to have interaction, where you felt like you were actually playing the game and had some control over events.  Not this game.  It's a Japanese style RPG, which means lots of waffle and pretty graphics, but minimal input from the player.  If I really wanted this kind of thing, I'd put a DVD on, rather than this.  If you like turn-based battles, nice animation, and loooooooooooooong cut-scenes that you can't skip, please buy this game.  Otherwise, don't.			"

												I so wanted to finish this game, but it's seriously broken and flawed. Combat is difficult across the board, and you'd think with a JRPG that the more your grind and the more powerful your characters become the easier battles will become : NOPE! That's not true with this game and it's infuriating.Added to this, the battle system is sadly random and I found myself winning bigger fights by shear luck - if I died in try #1 I reloaded and during try #2 I suddenly was able to summon or cast a ultimate spell, or I'd just manage to win more quick-time-events and block an attack, where sometimes by blocking you can do an insta-kill. But, like I said, it's 100% random.The most inexcusable thing to me, was that I found my level 50 group had the ability to summon big monsters who would act as a tank for us. So I had a boss battle which I could ALMOST win at level 50 and I decided to grind a bit to get to level 57. Suddenly, my level 57 group could no longer summon, and the bosses I was fighting at level 50 could suddenly perform completely different and way more powerful attacks than what they were throwing at me before, essentially making my MORE POWERFUL group of characters LESS EFFECTIVE and at more a disadvantage.Encounters are limited to maybe 12 different creatures, mostly spiders and wasps, the odd dragon here and there. Don't even bother trying to fight the rare monsters (usually a spider or wasp with a different colour and name) because you'll do 1million damage to them without denting them.I wanted to finish this game, but I just ended up rage quitting.

												I havent played many games of this nature but I know a dumb game when I see one. The combat is confusing and not fun. The map part of the game along with the walking part is not refined and makes you explore the entire map in its non-refined state. This is one of those rare games that I can't force myself to finish.			"

												♥♥♥♥♥poor game, right from the start after you get you make your own group you are joined by the AI to help you but you are forced to battle with other groups...best thing is that they all gank you and your computer-controlled ally does not give a ♥♥♥♥ about you. It just wants you to die slowly while it turns its back on you. This is completely unavoidable other then by chance the enemy groups ignore you and go after the other computer controlled ally groups. So your only option is ""Heal me"" while you get beaten to death....right near the start of the game...what the hell is this? Ive done pretty much everything up to that (even though its almost nothing you can do) except painfuly grind on the trash enemies in a small cave because the combat is sooo sllooowww when all you do is press one button, only because there are 3 other ally groups with you which you cant control so you have to wait for them to attack 12 times or so before you can press 1 button to heal yourself and wait another 2 mins....AND THIS IS ON TURBO MODE...SUCH JOY! *facepalm* "

And here's why:The plot is complete garbage with so many holes, inconsistencies, unexplained parts, and head scratching ""wtf's""The supporting characters are ok, but barely fleshed out and merely serve as meatshields, the main character is absolute trash, cliche Japanese hero who is an idiot, brash, doesn't think anything through, yet is mysteriously gifted with ""awesome"" powers.There is no ""clear"" leveling system and stat increases are sometimes randomly awarded after battle.The combat system is a cool concept but terribly unbalanced causing for most of the fights to be super easy, or a boss fight where you get lucky or get one shotted.Maps are needlessly large yet somehow still linear and empty.NO CUSTOMIZATION, I mean seriously, homeboy MC is wearing casual Friday outfit when fighting a fire breathing dragon...Overall 1/10 It just isn't worth the time, there are a hundred other games like it that are better. Try any Final Fantasy Game if you want similar combat/story type, try Bladestorm 100 Years war if you want similar larger feel/raid battles, try Dynasty Warriors if you want a good game.			"

												Weak visuals, bland music, poor writing, and an almost entirely unexplained mess of a battle system make The Last remnant nothing more than a chore to play. The areas of the world are small and linear, and you will find yourself travelling back to them time after time. The UI in battle is both confusing and intrusive; the UI outside of battle is little better. The story is mildly interesting but doesn't provide enough of an incentive to suffer through the rest of the game.There's a reason The Last remnant is a bargain-bin title; don't waste your money when there are far better titles available.

												Overall a great looking game but not very fun and not a compelling story. Might be someone someones cup of tea but I just couldn't get into this at all.  It may have had to due with the terrible English dubbing and the copy paste story line. Sad to think that the same company that resurrected tomb raider and came up with life is strange made this.  "

												Grind, grind, grind, grind... grind a bit more. Very much a typical JRPG, Squenix flavoured, this time round, in a passable PC port. Strategic (yay!) but occasionally obscure combat (boo!), some iffy Unreal3 texture pop-in and a fairly shallow loot system makes for a not so memorable game.Still, got it for under £3 so I can't really complain too much.

												Horrible console port for mediocre game  Want change key bindings or mouse sensitivity no problem just save game, quit to tile screen menu where you can access most options, change something, load game test changes and repeat until it will work like you want it.You playing using keyboard - don't worry game will show you on screen what key on gapepad use to do something, want to know how to do this using keyboard? easy just save, go to tile screen check keys, look for what was just introduced and find appropriate key, load game test it and you are good to go. Pure pleasure! :)About gameMain character is unlikable from the start and this alone make it hard to enjoy when you don't like character you controllinggameplay is slow and boringwalking on maps are very clunky, controlling camera and overall feel are like from decade ago, pretty horriblelevel design are bad, repetitive, empty and uninterestingbattles are very chaotic and almost automatic at the same time, probably intention was to make it dynamic but it is hard to see whats is going on on battlefield when on every attack everybody running from different directions, camera changes and in the end you don't know what is going on and who is where. There is some very limited strategy in battle but because of whole  ""dynamic"" system it doesn't really matter that much and battles itself after a short while gets boring and very repetitivevisually isn't stunning but it is console port from 2009 so hard to expect something good looking Story/ dialogues and voice acting are also very mediocre, whole idea about kid/ teenager easily get to army and fight side by side with generals is very naive and childish, look like poor story for kids.Creatures design are actually quite good, shame that engine and console limitation crippled character artists on that :/			"

												How to combine a round-based rpg with a strategy game? Not like this, for sure!After 65 hours I still don't understand the combat-system. Sometimes I can't heal my groups, becaus it doesn't give me the option and sometimes I've got like 3 different heal options (same for magic).Character level things up like love, friendship or loner (or whatever) and I've got no clue what it means. People will tell me that this all is on my part, because I didn't look that stuff up, but I shouldn't have to do that. This is a game not a book and if you can't make a system people can find out themselves, it's probably bad.The story and characters are so lame, I don't remember anything. I didn't finish it, but I can tell already that it's the same stupid kind of story like in a Final Fantasy game.			"

												No mouse cursor.  Clicking and the scroll wheel works, kinda, if you think of the wheel as up/down keys.  No excuse for releasing a game on PC if you can't be bothered to add even basic mouse support in the opening menu and config screens.  Quit the game in annoyance without ever starting to play it.  Checked on forums, and this is just how this game works, not some bug I'm running into.  WTF Square.Do everyone a favor and do not support this kind of shoddy PC support by a developer--especially a big name developer.  Do not buy.  Then, look into anything else released by that dev to make sure they aren't doing the same with other games, and don't buy those games if they are.  Finally, be very public with very negative reviews for the bad behavior.			"

												This game isn't even worth the ♥♥♥♥ing 9 dollars it costs...you try to build a party at a guild...then you go into a certain map, and that party is NO WHERE TO BE FOUND! So you take on these stupid quests with townsfolk...you end up in a dungeon with said townsfolk...with your party NO WHERE TO BE FOUND. Beating side quests seems impossible. Where did my ♥♥♥♥ing party go once I assigned them at a guild? WHERE?! Is this one of those games you have to grind for hours in a low level area to be able to take on side quests? I mean where is my ♥♥♥♥ing party!? I assigned them at a guild! WHY AREN'T THE IN MY PARTY?! Don't play this. It's only a few years old but the graphics seem circa 2001...there is only voice acting during cut scenes...the rest you have to READ! Imagine, an xbox360 game where you have to read the ♥♥♥♥ing quest dialogue...pathetic.Edit: I found out how to take the party you create into a map...but that didn't make the experience much better...this game requires old school exp grinding to make it anywhere. I find myeslf dying from one group of regular monsters...despite fully understanding the combat system. It's just a really unbalnced game. I ground for hours to beat ONE rare boss mob in an early cave area. Still impossible to beat it. I understand the combat....my characters are well leveled. This game got very good reviews when it was first released...I have a feeling the company that made this game paid handsomely to get these positive reviews...something big companies are known to do.Dated graphics for a 2009 release, minimal voice acting...strange unbalanced combat system...zero phsycis, Completely linear, Trite, cliche story...forgetable characters, mandatory exp grinding and a whole host of other problems. Androgenous heroes. ♥♥♥♥, the females in this game look more manly than the males...I don't need a ♥♥♥♥ing lesson in androgeny. Square Enix, has lost their luster...and then some. When the company was Squaresoft...they were shining. This game is a clear example of how Squaresoft sold out. Don't believe me? Pay the 9 dollars yourself and find out.			"

You can sorta guide your guys to do something but it won't always happen. Also if you level up too much you're gonna in for a big problem later on when you fight those powerful bosses.

Idk maybe it's just a bad port but no matter. Welp I wasted money on it since I won't be playing more, at least it was on sale at the time I guess . . . yeah no still not worth it when working on a very small budget for gaming.			"

												Alright, I have only played a miniscule amount of time on this game, but there are quite a few things that stand out immedeatly.  First, the voice acting is just horrendous. Beyound bad.  Second, the layout of gameplay, by which i mean how you read and try to understand the battle mechanics is so F***KING skewed that it just looks like a bunch of windows and HP stats placed randomly in the field of view during battle sequences.  You can figure out what the informations means but it is in such a disaray that it makes it annoying to interpet.  Graphically it looks nice and pretty. Runs very smooth and have not had one issue with performance or optimization.  But how you view and play this game and by how east the battles seem to be so early on just does not sit well with me.  It feels like they took the time to flesh out the graphics but rushed through the search for voice actors and game layout with special mention of hud information.  Just seems jumbled to me.			"

												I've played and beaten this game on xbox multiple times and have gotten mostly through the PC version. This game is seriously flawed. The only reason that I'm recommending it is because it's fairly cheap and does have its upsides, but I'd still wait until it's on sale. Pros:-Interesting and numerous sidequests.-Interesting concept-Great battle music-Lots of arts-Some cool animationCons:-Battle system is extremely random, if you play the same fight twice you can get absolutely destroyed the first time and completely slaugher them the second time doing pretty much the same thing.- Punishes you for leveling up (strangley enough the surest way to beat this game is to avoid fighting as much as possible)-Punishes you for trying several weapons (you will wind up downgrading your nimble/mighty arts unless you stick with those types of weapons.)- Characters and story are pretty generic and boring.- 99% of important stats and exp happen off screen.- The game does not teach you how the battle system works, you need to look it up and study it.- Morale system doesn't work well, if your winning by a landslide this just makes it easier, if your getting beaten down this just makes it worse, and some enemies will constanly lower morale gauge regardless of how you are doing.- Area attacks and some status ailments are horribly broken. Area attacks basically do normal damage times however many units you have in a union and may even hit other unions. This will often oneshot you and they use them VERY often. Some status ailments in this game are easy to deal with (silence, burn) while others are pretty much a death sentence (poison, curse).All in all this game isn't amazing and somtimes it feels like the bad outweighs the good but you might like it so it may be worth dropping a few bucks on. Still wait for a sale though. Also if you do get this game make sure you turn on autosave, it's not the default setting and you really need it.			"

												This JRPG has one of my favorite battle systems in any JRPG. It's not perfect, by any means but it's very fun to be able to recruit a mercenary army and go to town on an entire squad of enemies while still having a turn based style system.I'm not really a fan of the Battle Rank system which doesn't make much sense. Basically, the enemies in the game scale based on how many strong monsters you kill, so grinding actually hurts you. So does... killing pretty much any mobs apparently, unless they are incredibly weak. That said, it's interesting to have an RPG that -encourages- speedrunning instead of requiring you to grind a lot!It also has one of my favorite JRPG soundtracks with some incredible battle and area music. The game would be a lot more boring without its stellar soundtrack adding some personality to the areas.These days the graphics look a little dated. The art design is somewhat generic, with many of the enemies having a stereotypical look to them, though I do like how many different sentient species there are in the game's world. The character design is hit or miss, though some of the characters do look pretty badass. Hint: It's probably not Lord Davide.The storyline is just enough to make the game interesting, but isn't amazing. The main character, Rush, behaves really weirdly like he has the personality and impulse control of a 10 year old, which can break suspension of disbelief. There are more interesting and cooler characters in the game though, like Davide's generals and Emma Honeywell. The overall story about the Remnants isn't explained too well, and the Remnants end up feeling like big Macguffins with no rhyme or reason to their existence.			"

												- Great fighting system- Great story- Great graphics- The ability to create new weapons, items, and attacking parties gets you really involvedGreat game, story, and customization system but be careful not to stray if you don't want to make getting through dungeons later in the game to be impossible.

												This here is one of the 'lost' JRPG's in my opinion. It's a great game from the makers of Final Fantasy, yes that's right they make RPGs Other than FF. The interesting thing in this is two fold, first it's on the Unreal Engine, not a in house engine. Second it's M rated for blood. Now the blood is pretty old school, especially by todays standards. We aren't talking dismemberment gore here, just people get hit and blood splashes out of a non-existant wound. The graphics aren't horrible, they were good when it was new. The interesting mechanic here is the combat, it's turn based but more strategic than just waiting for your turn. The gameplay is actually quite a lot of fun, and in typically JRPG fashion the story is convoluted and extremely long, with lots of little hidden things to find around towns, cities and caves. Overall, if you're a JRPG fan, I recommend giving this a shot if it's at a price you like. HOWEVER, there is one IMPORTANT catch, this game uses one of those awful 'keep up' leveling systems from what I've been told, the higher you level up your characters the stronger the game becomes, your true 'power' comes from the skills you obtain and they can be obtained in many cases at any time. Like most games as complex as this one, you're better offer doing a lot of research before you even start to know exactly what you should do and how to go about it, NOT pursuing certain things right away and trying to power level your character ever will really really hurt you. The old enjoyable act of running around leveling to gain an edge is ruined with this design. Now if you don't enjoy old school RPGs and like a game that keeps pace with your level, this should be your thing. If you like old school RPGs though where you level up and eventually feel like a super Hero, this might be a struggle. You NEED to follow a guide that explains everything, because becoming powerful is about keeping your level low while doing everything to enhance your skills. You also have to recruit nearly an army, since in this combat is between squads of characters and not one on one.			"
