												Millenium isn't a bad game, but with all the RPG-maker games out there, why settle for middle-rate RPGs ?The gameplay is very classical and won't be a surprise. The settings are nice and detailed but there is a lot of stock RPG-Maker characters in the background. The drawings of the main characters are nice but aren't consistent with their 2D-sprite (the main character wears a kimono in combat and a sleeveless dress out of combat).There is a lot to customize (difficulty, randomness of the encounters, guiding arrows) and this is cool. Now, what prevented me to finish this game ? First and foremost, the scenario. It's just incredibly stupid, with caricatural characters and cheesy lines. What's the main motivation of the heroine ? She saw squirrels helping each others... I swear I'm not making this up.And I hope you're not allergic to giggles because you'll see a lot of them.Here's an example :- This forest looks so scary. We should head back home.- Come on. You're a guy, you shouldn't be afraid. *giggle*Yes it's that bad.I could have overlooked this (with gritted teeth), but the dungeons are also far too long. And the numerous quests ? Fetch quests that have nothing to do with anything (find a cute dress for a random girl, find 10 grapes for a random guy...).In the end, I see what people could like in this game. But it clearly isn't my style.			"

												Just to let everyone know, I have played the non-Steam version of this game a couple of times and so I base my review of Millenium on that experience.Play it; there is no other way to say it. If you like old-school rpgs and have been craving for the 2D goodness, this game might be for you.The most annoying (and probably the only) issue with the game (series) is that when you will import your savefile to MM2, your player will be downgraded to Level 20 if they are higher and any promotions and enhancements you have given your character will be reseted to mainitain game continuity or something.Some people dig it, some people don't. I belong to the latter category.PS: If you want to test the game before purchasing it, there is a demo available at Aldorlea.orgPPS: If you have an old save file lying around (like me), you can use it to quickly get some hard to get achievements. :-D			"

												This game goes back to the good-old days of 16-bit RPGs. If you like that old style of gameplay and graphics you'll feel right at home. If you're expecting a modern game, you might look somewhere else. As for how it compares to the SNES RPG classics? I'd say it's surely no Final Fantasy VI or Chrono Trigger. Though it holds itself pretty good compared to the likes of Breath of Fire (1), Lufia (1) and Dragon Quest V. If you like those games, surely give Millennium a chance!Strong points of this RPG:- Great environment design. Large dungeons and interesting overworld, towns etc- So many secrets to be found! Go exploring like in the good old days!- This game was made with heart, and it shows!			"

  Introduction            	Millennium - A New Hope a beautiful RPG Maker game. The story follows Marine a girl how refuses to accept her fate as a peasant. She decides to fight back and challenge Lords of Mystrock. There is not much to say about the game elements in Millennium - A New Hope, all of the games mechanics/elements are all great and solid. This is a basic stand JRPG, there is not really any catches or massive differences. The only thing that I didn’t really care for in this game is the fact that the NPCs are very bland and generic. If you are a big fan of the typical old-school JRPGs Millennium - A New Hope is a game for you.  Pros                Well-made RPG/JRPG Great price Awesome assets Controller support Tons of content for the price Awesome music Interesting story    Cons               NPCs feel very generic  Lots of dialogue seems unnecessary  Typical RPG Maker game Limited graphics option     Conclusion                 	Millennium - A New Hope is a beautiful old school JRPG that has the typical gameplay that everyone loves. The NPCs dialogue is very bland and generic, but the story is very interesting and will pull you in. The best part of Millennium - A New Hope is the fact that this game is so cheap. It’s a great value and I would highly recommend picking up Millennium - A New Hope, especially if you enjoy old school JRPGs.-HiPFiRED   If you liked this review or want to see more recommended games, be sure to follow our curator group: Follow Original Curator GroupCheck out the Original Network Groups.

												This was a fun little game that I enjoyed greatly.  The story is a simple one of a girl trying to come up with a way to change things in the world.  The characters are entertaining, the dungeons have interesting designs and the battles are fun.  It's a good start to what looks like will end up as a very epic adventure.Pros:+Lots of hidden stuff.  There's quests to find, and random stuff to use all over the place if you just explore.  Seriously, just try and grab anything that looks like it can be picked up or looted, chances are good you get something from it.+Really nice music in all the areas.+Multiple difficulties and neat options to suit everyone.  Love that you can choose types of encounters even.+Can save pretty much anywhere, defiitely always a bonus.+A reasonable amount of challenge without needing a lot of grinding.  Even in the beginning when you suck and it may seem you can need it, this is balanced nicely with baskests that give experience to be found.+A lot of neat character interactions.Neutral points:&Especially in the beginning, gold is rather rare.  This can be annoying because you don't have many skills to heal, but it also can add some challenge in having to explore and make what you use really count and to think about what you buy and find spots where you can get rest for free, etc.  It also really made the point of the fact that these people are truly poor which helps really set the tone of how important Marine's quest is.&You only get a total of four party members, so not a lot of customization, but it's also a very solid party and that helped ensure no need to catch characters up who join later or caused certain characters to be relegated to never be used.Cons:-It is the first of a series, so while this is a fun game, it's also more of a start of a bigger story than a complete plot.  It would be better to think of this as the first episode of a larger game and to keep in mind that if you enjoy this one, you'll definiely want the rest.-At some points, it was almost too easy or too difficult.  If it was hard, that was usually something I had missed, like finding a weapon for Benoit so he could actually hit for some damage, but some of the stuff that was supposed to be a challenge was far easier than I expected it to be even on the highest difficulty.  So definitely don't expect an immense challenge outside of a couple of boss batles, but it's also definitely not a walk in the park unless you play on lower difficulties.-It is pretty short, even on hard it is possible to complete under 10 hours, but a first playthrough is likely to take more around 15 hours to beat and 20 hours to find all the extras if you want all the achievements.All in all though, I do recommend this game.  It has all the right elements to make for a fun RPG			"

												This game must have done well as a high school project.  Based on the writing and overload of anime/rpg tropes I assume that's what it was made for.  I don't know why there are at least 5 of these Millennium games out there, but I think I have a pretty good idea why only one made it to Steam, and I'm quite surprised that it did.This review is technically incomplete, because I haven't finished the game.  Everything could change, but I doubt that I'm going to get there.  I've been playing for 12 hours and have only obtained 4 out of 5 main characters.  That's not a measure of judgement in itself, but I am bored enough to say that I probably won't play much more.  Nothing is compelling me to play more.Scale: 1=despised 2=negative 3=could go either way 4=positive 5=lovedGame design: 4/5 As an RPG, this game does well in it's mechanics.  It's got some interesting methods to power up your characters and lots of variety for weapons and enemies.  The game play itself is actually quite commendable.  ... Except for the random jumping portions and other unseen elements, but you can't win them all.Tone: 1/5 Here's the clincher for me.  This game is more of a first time fan fiction to JRPGs.  All these comments towards the immaturity of the writing of the game is because nothing happens for any reason.  Or at least for any understandable reason.  What's the conflict?  Big kindgom won't help struggling country side and wants them all to starve to death.  Solution?  Peasant girl is moved by squirrels helping each other and think that humans need to act more like squirrels (?).  Every one is sure to help each other and get along if only she can become leader of the kingdom in its next election.  The twist?  Democracy has failed!  The election is rigged.  Plus no one would want to vote for her anyway, but that's not really addressed.  Luckily the land has an anciet tradition for such times: ""Martial Law"".  When elections don't go the way you want, find a posse and beat the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of people until they listen.  If the game was trying to be ironic this would be great, but the sad music and dry story telling tell me it's trying to be heartfelt and inspiring.  Personal skew: 4/5 So the story sucks, does this ruin the game?  Not for everyone, sure, but the story is a major part of JRPG's and is especially important to this reviewer.  What made me stop playing the game is the inane dialogue that happens every scene.  I'm tired of clicking through a dozen text bubbles filled with 1 dimensional character banter complete with *chuckles* and *looks away sadly* remarks everytime a task is finished or started.  The characters aren't characters, they are tropes: ignorant, carefree, stubborn leader; sarcastic sidekick; cowardly tagalong; etc. and nothing in the miles of dialogue actually develops character or gives motivation.  I only know that the characters have these personalities because the other characters say so.  The cowardly tagalong seems quite reasonable to me.  I was suprised to learn  that the main character was ""energetic"" and carefree until she got sidekicks that obsessed about her every idea and action.  Even the quests that every new character demands develop nothing for the characters or story.Some people do like this game, and that's fine.  Hardcore fans are probably more geared toward gameplay.  Newbies probably appreciate the warm and simple storyline.  Maybe something changes later that will actually grip me to want to progress, but I don't want to risk another 10 hours on such a low possibility.			"

												Having just finished the Millennium series of RPGs, I thought I'd go back and review them one-by-one, in order, to see what they got right and wrong.Millennium: A New Hope is the first installment of a series that starts from very humble beginnings and blossoms into a wide-ranging story about class struggle, the power of friendship, and getting back up after you've been beaten down.Aldorlea Games' releases over the last few years definitely appeal to a specific kind of audience. They deliberately go mid-market and target gamers who long for retro RPGs, and to that end, the Millennium series are some of the most polished you'll find around. Despite being made in RPGMaker, all of the games stand out due to their story, similar gameplay mechanics, secret rooms and hidden challenges.The storytakes place in the land of Myst, with a teen named Marine coming home to discover that her father has fallen into a coma after being struck by a rock thrown by guards from the kingdom of Mystrock. The rulers of Mystrock erected a wall to keep commoners out, and as a result, the latter's quality of life is greatly deteriorating. Having become fed up with the situation, Marine opts to collect a cabal of warriors and take part in ritual leadership by combat in two weeks.A New Hope definitely seems like the most expansive of the installments (up until Battle of the Millennium), as it goes out of its way to introduce several large provinces and many different locations, including underground caverns and futuristic complexes. The combat system isn't necessarily as varied as some of the later games, but it does do a good job getting players up to speed on turn-based mechanics, as well as the use of magic and spells cast by Jeanne, a fairy who lives in Marine's earring.Honestly, the best way I can describe Marine is that she's an annoying kid who does things through sheer force of will. Most of the situations in the game (hell, in this entire series) are motivated by Marine having a hissy fit and complaining when reality gets in the way of her goals, and the people she argues against reluctantly conceding when she becomes stubborn and belligerent. Not to mention, a large amount of humor is mined out of the fact that it looks like she's talking to herself whenever she speaks with Jeanne (who no one else can see).The whole aspect of what exactly Marine is going to do if/when she becomes the leader of Mystrock is never really addressed, as the narrative is constantly funnelling you through different setpieces and areas in order to get accustomed to the bizarreness of the gameworld (after all, robots, orcs, assassins and fairies are all present here, making it a mishmash of standard RPG races).The most satisfying part of the storyline are the companions you meet along the way, ranging from a hand-to-hand master (Hirada) to a griffon tamer (Jezebel) to an albino crocodile hunter (Karine), all with their little quirks. You don't get much of a chance to see them grow beyond their initial roles, but they do progress quite nicely in future installments.Difficulty isn't very high, and despite the presence of ""epic"" animal bosses who can be found in various caves and rooms throughout Myst, they rarely pose much of a challenge, especially if you've grinded levels out and obtained the ""promotions"" from churches that greatly boost your stats. There's also a ""rush"" battle option that greatly alleviates the tedium of random mobs if you're grinding or are overleveled.That's not to say it's all great, though. There are still problems with no minimap in any of the installments (which is one of my common frustrations with RPGMaker games in general), annoying enemies who can easily pop status effects on the party near the beginning of the game and a reliance on manually saving if you don't want to unintentionally get screwed over by spawning far away from a town or a church.There are also a lot of sequel hooks that get set up, so much so that the only thing that was missing as a big red siren flashing ""This is important"" whenever certain characters appeared. NPCs like Gravitron and Merline have ""I am future party member"" status written all over them. Conversely, the villains are all one-note caricatures who seemingly have no depth or development whatsoever beyond the standard mustache-twirling.However, those negatives are minor in the grand scale of things. A New Hope is a solid, entertaining RPG with a lot of bang for the buck. The fact that you can carry all your gear, weapons and skills over to future installments (broken as they may be) is the icing on the cake.For more reviews, visit my Curator page, Alex's RPG Recommendations!

												Overall, I really enjoyed Millennium - A New Hope.  It's a solid RPG with a good blend of challenge, interesting characters, story, secrets, large dungeons and a bit of humor.   If you hate RPG Maker games, you won't like it no matter what I write here, so keep that in mind.  For the rest of you, I'd say there's a lot to like in Millennium.  The game itself is a 5 part series, so keep that in mind when buying it.  If you're thinking about the Millennium series, you should start with this one (obviously).  You're then allowed to export your characters (with their inventories) to the next game after beating it.  There's at least 20 hours of gameplay here, I think I finished it in hard mode at about 25 hours.  I normally never play games on hard mode, but I did with Millennium and I enjoyed the challenge and extra achievements.  There are a number of interesting and challenging achievements for this game.  There are 24 secret rooms scattered throughout the world, 40 quests (both main and sidequests), and a lot of hidden things. Combat is fun and challenging.  The boss fights are pretty epic and there are optional tough ""animal kings"" for you to fight as an extra challenge after beating the main boss.   Level design is well executed.  The secret rooms are challenging to find and some of the dungons are HUGE with lots to explore.  Luckily, there is an option to have arrows occasionally point you in the right direction if you wish.  Unlike some other Aldorlea RPGs, you get the option to have enemies visible on the map instead of random encounter pop-ups after so many steps.   The plot is solid, if not ground breaking and keeps you on track.  I would say the plot speeds up and becomes more complex in M2.  The music was enjoyable as well.I only have a few complaints that are pretty minor.  Early in the game, gold is pretty rare!  You'll need to be a bit careful with your purchases.  The economy is tight so don't expect to buy 99 of every healing item, etc.   My only other complaint is that there is an achievement for beating 30 quests with the last character you recruit for your party.  In order to get this achievement, you need to actively avoid completing any quests for most of the game and then come back to them after beating the main boss.  This is a bit anticlimactic.  If you don't worry about this achievement, it's not a problem, however.  Other than that, it's an excellent RPG that's well worth your time.   If you're on the fence about this game, there's a free demo from Aldorlea's website that lets you play the full game for an hour to see if you like it.I hope this review gets you excited to try the Millennium saga!

												I played the non-Steam version of Millennium for the first time almost five years ago, and I've been hooked since then. The combination of a strong story, well written characters and addicting gameplay grew quickly on me. Thanks to the different difficulties, visible / invisible monsters option and guiding arrows the game is well accessible to beginners. The in-game tutorial helps, too. Actually, this is probably one of the biggest strength of these games - no complicated installation, no shortcuts learning, you just start it and play immediately. At the same time, it offers quite a lot of challenge. The battles are classical, i.e. turn-based. But since action order is affected by characters' stats and these changes with difficulty, the battles play quite differently in different modes. In the Hard mode, you really need to know what you are doing and to use spells and equipment to your advantage. Usually, the stuff found in secret rooms and optional areas is very handy. Overall, the tuning is very good and the game rewards you well for knowledge and exploration. If you feel a need for ""grinding"" you are doing something wrong. Plus, levels and money only transfer to Millennium 2 up to a certain limit, so the game doesn't force you to spend too much time levelling. Speaking of exploration, there are many well hidden secret rooms and some other special things to find. Quests are various, some of them are even ""chained"", i.e. missing the first one means missing all the subsequent quests. Some players will probably find it too ""hardcore"", but I like the challenge. Maps are well thought out, with lot of optional areas and stuff to find. Once again, exploration pays off in Millennium. Another important part of the gameplay is jumping. In some parts the game plays a bit like a platformer and you can jump over rocks, chasms and so on. With a special equipment you can even reach otherwise inaccessible areas and that's where the real fun begins. Characters are well written and lifelike, with Marine ""stealing the show"". She's just so passionate and stuborn. Quite the opposite of Benoit, which ensures quite a few hilarious dialogues. Visuals and music are also of high standards. Especially the artworks are beatiful. To sum it up - I certainly recommend Millennium. It's a great game, and it's also the first part of great series. In other words, a good game to start with...			"

Plus has very good options on showing where enemies more or leave them invisible.

												I think this game is really good for its price. I got a lot of time out of it and I actually had fun. While the story is your run of the mill ""be the hero and do the good thing"" story its still nice. One of my favorite details is gold is sparse because bears and ants dont have coin purses, so you have to sell the loot from killing♥♥♥♥♥♥to get money. My real complaint is how limited it is. If this wasnt limited to the RPG maker engine it could be so visually wonderful and there could be a lot more going on with the world. Overall its 10 hours of game for 6 dollars. ITS BETTER THEN THE ORDER 1886! SHOTS FIRED, SO TOPICAL!			"

												Millennium - A New Hope is the first part of a series of 5 games. The story continues over all 5 parts. It is a typical jrpg.I liked the idea of having a fairy living in the left earring, which always comments various things or heals you during battle. I also enjoyed the animal sounds of the cow, the sheep or the dog if you try to talk to them. Lots of little things you notice when you play the game.When you play on easy in story mode and with help cursor on it is quite easy. I prefer my jrpgs easy, otherwise they can become a terrible grind. This game can be set to easy, so you can enjoy the story.			"

												Millenium is very nice game if you enjoy old schooll rpgs. There is lot to discover and option to turn on visible encounters so you can avoid most battles if you want. Grinding is not requred to complete the game even in hard mode so most of the gameplay is discovering new stuff.Start of the game is little slow as you control only one character and money is very tight. Later on you will get new members. By then the game really starts to pick up.  You can find some fantactical locations in dungeons, most music tracks are very good and banter between team members can be pretty funny.There is lots of optional stuff like secred rooms and sidequests. The main quest is a bit short as this is only a first part of the series. I will propably get next one in the series once there is a sale. You can import your save file to the next game so there is incentive to find everything.Very solid RPGmaker game  7/10.			"

												I've been playing the entire Millennium series several times since the first part was released and loved it from the start. There's this young girl, determined to change her fate against all odds, and the story is well told, so that you feel with her the injustice that happens to her and her family. The main quest of the game is to find people who are willing to fight alongside Marine and I've always been curious about what the next character will be like, what abilites they are going to have. Their strenghts and skills are very diverse and it's fun finding out how to use them best and what they can do.Also in their personalities the characters are very different, which is typical for Aldorlea games. Each one of them is special and I loved reading the dialogues between them.The gameplay is very well balanced. You can choose the difficulty mode that suits you best, and an ""ordinary"" player like me can do perfectly on normal mode. Fighting in that mode isn't too easy so that one would get bored, but also not annoyingly hard, and grinding isn't necessary at all, which is something that I appreciate.Being granted the choice whether to play with visible or invisible encounters is a great feature too and increases the replay value a lot in my opinion.What's typical for Aldorlea games as well is the big variety of equipment. You often find great stuff in secret rooms, but also get to buy good things. It's so much fun to find new weapons and enjoy seeing the difference they make in fights, as well as other special accessories. A big (albeit totally optional) part of the game is finding secret rooms. I love and hate them. It's always satisfying to find one, but it can become just as frustrating when missing one or more. There are also a lot of side quests to do, some easy, some quite tricky. So this is a game where you shouldn't just rush trhough, but take your time and explore thoroughly. Then it's fun to figure out how to solve those quests.As for visuals, I find the maps very appealing and beautiful. What's special in MM is that there are maps where you can only walk left and right and jump up and down to other platforms. I like that, it's different from common maps. Also you do a lot of crazy jumps to reach places, that's awesome. The character artworks are probably the most beautiful of all Aldorlea games, they are simply amazing.The music too is wonderful for the most part, at least to my taste. All in all I very much recommend this game to all people who love old school RPGs and are not biased against RPG Maker games. "

Old School Rebelion of the Youngsters!Millenium is a game created with the Tool RPG-Maker, it shows but the game is a lot of fun to play. The game is challenging and with a nice story backdrop. This is the first part of a several part game series. The game can be played in different difficulty settings and it might be reasonable not to run it for the first time on hard level.Even if you are not into RPG Maker created games this one is one of the great jewels of the RPG Maker games with some difficulties, challenges and a lot to discover. Some hints for having a great delight during the game:Search every barrell, crack, box or sometimes even prominent lying stones, beds and cabinets there is a lot of stuff hidden around.Don't sell yet all of the ""treasure"" stuff, you'll be needing it in a latter game as money resource.Try to get Expertises early for your characters look at the strengths in status and train them up first!Don't be thrifty with baskets, orbs and other stuff that might help your party later, by the way in the later games your parties level will be demoted again - so don't put too much time into running through all the levels.Pro:Nice story and good backdrop, you'll really might get set up with all those high and mighty type of people in Mystrock.Great and complex game created with a tool that has some restrictions.Nice customized sound and artworks.Con:Might get too much because of some naivity issues of the heroes. But that is a minor thing... this game was created to catch this kind of style, so it's not really a con - just saying.I recommend this game.It might not be perfect, but it's a good waste of time anyway. Watching Marine, Benoit and their friends grow is fun. Finding stuff in unexpected places, sometimes really powerful tools in chests that are hidden in places which are easily overlooked. This game actually is promoting exploration, and searching - you'll find a lot of freebies that will help you along during the game.			"

												I first came across Millennium - A New Hope back in 2009 when i read an insteresting review on Gamezebo.I decided to try it and it didn't let me down.You play as Marine, a young girl, that after a tragedy hit her family, decides to challenge the aristocracy of Mystrock and bring the change everybody in Myst needs.The game is a turn based RPG that features invisible or visible enemies, mouse control and different difficulty levels. Also, animal kings ( they drop rare goodies), secret rooms, many side quests and interesting battle strategies.If you want to play a fun game and enjoy it, Millennium is one of them.			"

												Considering I have completed the main story of this game, the fact it can be run in 10 hours or less in hard mode and that I have the next installments and STILL keep coming back to this one at 40+ hours. I can surely say the developers at Aldorea Games know what they're doing when it comes to making a rich and enjoyable rpg. I've only played it on hard mode so I can't say much for the others but assume the easier modes make the game a lot easier and more enjoyable a stroll through the story. Hard Mode is what I suggest to anyone whom is familiar with RPGs and enjoy strategic battles. This game offers a wide variety of side-quests, achievements and other hidden goodies that I still hae yet to fully find that make this game all the more playable. The story is quite different for most rpgs, though being it's only a snippet of the full game's story, being an episodic series I can't say much. For a meaer 5.99 this game is a challenging adventure and worth the price. I definitely recommend it to any rpg fans out there looking for a game with some meat to it aside a linear stroll through the story.I give it a 7.5/10			"

Initial Thoughts: 10 Hours (see below)Keep in mind I'm playing on hard.This is possibly the most poorly balanced rpg I've ever played. The battles are horribly slow unless you turn on a menu option to increase the speed of the animations to 150%.  It seems neither Marine nor Benoit have enough useful skills to properly combat enemies. The most useful skill Marine has is ""Call Jeanne"" which summons a fairy like creature that can attack multiple enemies and heal to great effect. This in theory could overpower a player if it weren't possible for enemies to kill a character before you can summon the fairy and give it a command. I often found myself summoning it using it to heal twice then letting it attack. Some enemies are also totally immune to it's attack (I just used to to heal in those instances). Items, gold, and even the use of skills is at a premium here. You have to be extremely careful not to run out of healing items, revival items, and SP (Magic) restorative items.This situation is exasperated by the lack of gold to buy such items with and the limited areas provided to restore health and SP. I swear when I started this game it took me FOREVER to get to an area with a bed that let you ""free-style sleep"" to fully restore. When I found one it was located fairly deep in a town and was real annoying to get back to between grinding. (I've stricken something here because healing items are actually a bit more prevalent if you use the monster meats dropped to heal). SAVE OFTEN is something you hear sometimes with rpg's this game takes that to another level. I'd recommend saving every 10 steps pretty much and running away from many battles. Every time you get a game over the game displays a screen that has an old mans face on it and the text ""You need to try harder"". Eat me game.  Steam overlay doesn't work. Screenshots don't work with F12. (At least F12 only pauses the game here I've seen some Rpg Maker titles bind it to load last save or reset).  I used an Xbox360 controller to play. The D-Pad does not work and the analog is far to sensitive while navigating the menu. This is an rpg, the D-Pad should work. I've actually fallen asleep 3 times playing this game. I'm not critical enough to simply call it boring, but I might say it's pretty boiler plate as far as rpg's go. I wouldn't recommend this game to anyone else. Now excuse me while I get back to playing it. "

												I can't tell the difference between what's a secret path and what's a legitimate map glitch.  The music, which is already pretty bland, has managed to not trigger during scene transitions three times now.  And I managed to nod off during a pointlessly labyrinthine dungeon looking for grapes.I guess as an RPG, it does what it says on the tin, but it's a very (and that very has 20 syllables in it) paint by numbers one.  There's not a lot of charm to be had in the time I've spent with it.  And it's so hilariously boring.  If you've ever played an RPG that tasked a simple youngster with an epic quest, you've already played a better version of this.And for god's sakes, there's already four sequels.  So I'm not expecting any sort of satisfying conclusion to this game.			"

												This game has a weird mix of acceptable art and really amateurish graphics of varying, often not very matching styles.It also has an odd mix of a versatile interface with many features like mouse navigation (unusual for older RPG Maker games), but then the mouse navigation feels odd with the cursor moving slow and sluggish and things generally not being as snappy as you would expect and the interface also feels slightly messy.It also starts off with an acceptably engaging intro, but then throws you into a large map with absolutely no indication about what you should be doing, not even an obvious pressing quest that catches your immediate attention - which makes it lose the initial momentum built up from the intro.Generally it just seems like it might have been born out of a good, grand vision, but then suffered from many many uneven bumps in its execution turning it into a quite mediocre game. If the developer went back to the drawing board and figured out all the small but many details wrong with it, I think it could be easily turned into an enjoyable niche game - but as it is, I wouldn't recommend it.

												These comments are based on my playthrough of the game before the Steam version became available.Game 1 of Aldorlea's outstanding 5 part Millennium series is definitely an ""old school"" rpg ---- and what a pleasure that is, as this beautiful game with its fantastic story proves over and over. This is one that fans of this sort of game absolutely must play, and if you happen to be unfamiliar with this type of game (or Aldorlea's games), it would be a great introduction to a particular style of rpg (Aldorlea's) that is unmatched.Lots of choices get you going and capture your interest immediately. You can play at virtually any level of difficulty (with/without tutorial, with/without directional arrows, visible/invisible enemies, etc. ---- you choose how to play). Then just let the flow of the story take you along on a ride that is exciting, fun, and captivating. One of those ""just one moe thing"" types for sure.The characters, the exploration, the side quests, and the treasures to find are all nicely combined to hold your interest throughout the game. And now, with 52 Steam achievements, that means another playthrough for me.It's a great first game in a magnificent series, and I can't wait for the rest of them to arrive on Steam. Highest recommendation.			"

												Love the concept of this indie rpg. The storyline was great and it had a rather good battle system. But you know, somehow, difficulty levels are quite aummm unusual in this game. I cannot for the life of me defeat one of the animal kings and I am sure I chose the NORMAL mode, also took me a while to understand what the  orb colours meant as well as I found characters to be completely useless at times. But, honestly, it was a  great storyline, dont know why it is split into 5 parts. It would have been lovely to just buy the whole package and be done instead of part 1 - 5. However, it you are looking for something with enjoyable characters and storyline with about 12 hours to complete then you can pick this up. Also it is inexpensive as well so hey, why not...			"

												Recommending this is kind of a mixed bag.  You're gonna love it or hate it. The graphics are decent, for the type of game.  The sound isnt bad, but it isnt great.  You'll tire of it pretty quick, but those of us that  played the FF I-V series got got tired of that sound pretty quick, too.  Also, the music is repetitive, quickly.  The game responds better with the keyboard, you have better control of the characters than you do with the mouse. So who's gonna like it:  The people that played old school, top down, 2d RPG's.  Like Ultima, Dragon Warrior, or Final Fantasy (before Sony got a hold of it).  Menu driven stats, items and equipment.Who's not gonna like it: Anyone that doesn't like the RPGmaker genre of games.  Those that didn't like any of the above mentioned games, JRPG's or those that cringe at the idea of devoting 30+ hrs to a video game.  So, yeah, there you have it.			"

												This is just another dull generic RPG Maker game. The bar has been raised with many better quality titles here in 2015.The only highlights about this one is the use of custom graphics which makes the game look quite nice for this tired old engine.Otherwise this is your typical stale grindy turn-based RPG which seems to lack a run button?Expect long boring forest areas and generic battles. This is truly one of the most boring and slow paced RPGs I've played.Maybe RPG maker games are your thing, but their are so many better turn based RPGs to choose from on Steam such as Grandia 2, Celestian Tales: Old North, or Final Fantasy 3 to name a few.This game goes on sale for a very low price sometimes, but I would still suggest you spend your money elsewhere.

												Millennium - A New Hope is the first game in the 5-episode Millennium game series. Do not purchase this game with the expectations of it being complete at the end, for the final conclusion of the story as mentioned above is stretched out over 5 seperate games.Well, I certainly was not expecting this. Put it this way, I love RPGMaker games, a lot. But, they have to have that story, and certain feel to them for the game to actually hook me and keep me interested long enough to see it through till the end. Millennium - A New Hope, did just that, and so much more. I usually get bored early in, or lose interest. That's mainly due to a boring story, or the game feeling empty and neglected, like not much effort was put into it. But luckily for me, with this one, that was not the case, at all. When it comes to the gameplay, menus, battle screens, and so forth, Millennium - A New Hope works like any other RPGMaker game. Except, it had a few features that I wish were in most games of this genre. These features include difficulty settings, guiding arrows to point you in the direction of the main quest, and my personal favorite, a quest menu, which many RPGMaker games seem to lack. All of these features prevented it from feeling like you're endlessly running around trying to figure out where you were supposed to go, or what you were supposed to do. They also give you a choice for a few of these features, if you would like them enabled or not. So if playing it ultra-hard and figuring out where to go by yourself is more your style, then the game allows you to choose that. Also, achievements, yay!While the above mentioned features helped in making it not seem utterly pointless, I can't fully describe what this game did to keep me interested long enough to see it through till the end, and even earn all of the achievements. Hell, I wasn't even halfway through the game, and already wanted the rest of the series. The game hooked me within the first few minutes of playing, and within a few hours I was completely sucked in and focused on finishing it. Don't get me wrong, the game isn't perfect, it had its flaws for sure, but doesn't every game? A few things irritated me along the way, like some of the dialog. The amount of *giggles* were more than any person could handle. It got really annoying at some points. Some of the areas and especially dungeons seemed way too long and tedious at points aswell.  Something else that seemed a bit ridiculous was the main motivation of the protagonist's quest, and thus, the storyline. She gets a wild epiphany after seeing squirrels help each other. You heard me. Squirrels. The story itself seemed meaningful. I'm just really scared that since there are 5 games in the Millennium series, that it will get tedious, and boring. Now, with all that said, I'll end this review by saying, this game and it's particular genre is not for everyone, but if you're a fan of the RPGMaker genre, or you're looking for a good game to start off with to get into the genre, then Millennium - A New Hope is definitely a good choice.

												In general I don't like too much episodic RPG but this is one of the few exceptions, mostly because it is as well developed as most ""regular"" RPG I've played. One of the reaons I like and follow Aldorlea is that they are pretty good at making games that will give your money's worth and this is no exception. Millenium is a solid tale with an interesting main plot and a lot of sidequests for the wanderer. I think the sidequests are a bit too difficult sometimes, though. And I still prefer the stand-alone RPG overall, but the contents and good production values of this title manage to make up for it. 8/10.			"

Each part is as good or better then the previous one.Its storyline is really great and sometimes you can identify yourself with one of the characters, Marine has a stubborn personality yet she is cheerful and funny. Suddenlly gains great responsibility and is about to do the hardest but still the most needed quest of her entire life.lots of secrets to uncover, hard fights to overcome, lots of places to find and explore, lots of things to do :pit's very easy to love this game.it was one of the best indie games of the year when it was released some years ago, to me for good reasons.for the ones that love this kind of games, try it, you will love it.

												I'm not sure if I should recommend this game or not. It's pretty much exactly on the edge...Pro:- The graphics (for an RPG Maker game) and music are good.- You can select how the random battles are handled and if 'quest markers' should be displayed.- There are a lot of exploration rewards that aren't generic healing items/gold.Contra:- The story is poor. There's not one interesting NPC in the whole game. The main 'conflict' isn't engaging at all.- The dungeons are dragged out way too much. It feels like the designers decided to make the game longer simply by creating lots and lots of meaningless (and empty) maps.- The dialog feels very padded by companion comments. There might have been a chance to give them more depth, but that chance wasn't used.- The side quests are cryptic and feel very random. Same goes for finding the secrets.It's not a horrible game at all, but it fails to leave a good impression after my play through. The game isn't challenging (except for the animal kings) and the boss fights all follow the same boring tactic. If this game wants to be an 'old-school RPG' it didn't do its homework very well.If you have played a lot of JRPGs and love them, this game will be not a total waste of time, but there are much better games in the genre out there. Get it on a sale or from a bundle.			"

												For years I have been looking for a classic JRPG similar to the console epics of the 1990's. I was a particular fan of the Phantasy Star franchise. To me this game has all the right elements. It is quaint & quirky, the dialogue tends to ramble on (I think that is a cultural thing with Japanese inspired/created games). There is the classic story of the fight against injustice, the pastoral start & the gradual discovery of advanced technology. 'Farming' of experience, items & cash is all possible due to zonal re-spawns, there is a minor 'platformer' element aesthetically but this will not frustrate the unskilled as there are no  death drops. The music is great, the maps are huge, the difficulty is well balanced and customisable and there are non-linear side quests. Its difficult to see how anyone can legitimately criticise this game. It is a really good long play, particularly if you are 'casual' like I am though I am sure you can try to race through it if that is your thing. The price is unbelievably low, do not just buy it, buy 2 and give one a freind. A rare treat & excellent value even at 10 times the asking price. Five stars!			"

												A wonderful start to a story of determination against the odds; a young girl trying to make a better life for family and friends against prejudice and bureaucracy. scenery is beautiful and there are quests and hidden rooms throughout the story. there is humour in the story as well. the game allows the player to chose which game mode and the choice of visible or invisible foes. music is appropiate to the overall story. love the swamp and the crocodiles. This first episode introduces 3 characters plus the main one (and a special friend) and sets the path for the next editions. To get the overall feeling of the story it is best to play the whole series. Would recommend to those who like a challenge and a good story.			"

												Non joué sur steam.   Eval° en français puis anglais / not played here review in French and EnglishUn fermier qui en a marre d'être exploité se rend à la capitale, mais à la porte, on lui jette un rocher, il est gravement blessé. Marine sa fille, en colère, décide de rassembler 12 guerriers pour participer à la bataille du millénaire contre l'équipe du gouvernement. Il y a une chaîne de montagnes, attention au vertige! Une chasse au crocodile dans les maréés OBSCURS m'a fait très peur, quand la bête se rapproche. Des orbs vous donnent des stats en plus. Vous pouvez être guidé (les fléches indiquent le chemin direct pour la quête). Des personnages bien dessinés, certains sérieux, d'autres drôles comme Jack et James, l'un porte une peau de loup et l'autre tente de séduire Marine. Il y a une féé qui se loge dans.. et un vieux qui m'a fait penser à Agecanonix. La musique est entraînante. Marine saute beaucoup, c'est drôle. Vous en aurez pour votre argent.A farmer, fed up with high taxation, goes to the capital city to complain but, once at the gate, we throw a boulder at him, he’s badly injured and will rest at home. Marine his daughter will be upset and full of will and determination to recruit fighters for the government showdown to hope to win. There’s a mountain rage you need rods against vertigo. You can choose to be guided (arrow shows the straight way). I was terrified during a crocodile hunt in dark swamps, it gave me goosebumps as the beast drew near. There are 4 kinds of orbs to increase your stats. Good characters: tough guys like Hirado, Jack and James who are dummies with poor jokes whom one wears a wolf fur and the other tries to seduce Marine to no avail!   A funny old man reminds Agecanonix and a fairy who’ll stand in your earring! Entertaining music. There’s much of jumping. You’ll have for your money.			"

												I've been looking through Aldorleas games for a long time now on their website and thought I should start at the beggining, since they have so many games.I was expecting Millennium it to be like most of developers first games and not be incredibly good, honest. I thought it would be all standard RTP and have little substance, I was very very wrong. Millennium really suprised me, from the very start it was awesome! There are so many great features to this game so i'll break it down a little bit. Graphics - Great use of space on the maps, Aldorlea didn't just plonk everything down randomly , some real thought has gone into the placement and planing of maps, the towns give a great feeling of size and depth. A big mistake lots of RPG's make is to make a village in the middle of no where and set every house 3 feet from their neightbour, while convienient for the player it's not realistic. Millennium rarely makes this mistake. The character art is amazing, I love the style and that they have steered clear of the standard anime-esk facesets that lots RPG games of late have been using. Sound - The music is great too! I don't usually enjoy the soundtrack when I'm playing an Indie RPG is all seems the same, Millenium has really done well with it's music. I'm not sure if it was custom made for the game or not, but i've played so many RPG's and I havnt heard it before. GameplayI think having mouse support is something that more RPGs should be using, When you're relaxing with a new game and it's getting late no one likes to be huddled over their keyboard getting hand cramps :PThe comat is well balanced, and being able to call a fairy for heal and deal damage for you during combat is a great idea I havn't seen before. The interation between player and NPC's is really well written, I didn't get an urge to just pound the keyboard / mouse to skip the NPC dialog, It was really enjoyable to read. StoryWithout giving away the story for anyone who is about to start playing, All I will say is Awesome! you will not be disapointed.Now I can't throw all this Positive at you without giving you a critisism The mouse pathfinding isn't great! thats it, that's the negitive. :D "

												It's a rather short, if fun little RPG. Those who might be put off by the length should remember that it's the first entry in a series of five separate games. Another thing to note for players keen on immersion are jarring moments when the 'tone' of the game becomes very humorous and tongue-in-cheek, almost to the point of self-parody. This contribues to the game's charm, but it can be irritating to some.			"

												Millenium is the first of a set of five ""volumes"" in an epic RPG arc that is poised to shake the world upon which it is set (which is normal for such things). The inciting incident is the serious injury of Marine's father. Marine isn't exactly ready to take up his cause, but finds herself swept up into doing so by adventures not completely of her choosing. Sometimes being a helpful young lady can lead to all sorts of powerful things. (No, not the bad type.)I believe at the start she is still around 14 at the oldest, but the scope of these games might be long enough that she may well fall in love with someone she meets along the way.Gameplay is fun, and the cards look nice. It is also one of the better-made RPGMaker-type games I've seen. Beautiful, and has a rich back-setting.Even better, it is the tale of someone stricken with poverty rising up to take on the rich and decadent (and if not evil, completely uncaring). That is likely to appeal to some.			"

												A very mediocre RPGMaker RPG. I can't say anything overly positive about it as nothing really stood out as good. But, there were a couple of negatives that did. - Uneven difficulty. I kept fluctuating between being too overpowered and being too weak. [This was entirely due to one area in which you had to traverse through twice, this area inflicted a status ailment on your entire party in every battle. This ailment caused reduced accuracy (and among other things, but the accuracy was the most notable) which made battles infuriating and tedious. You could avoid or run from these battles but I would not say that is great design if you're almost forced to avoid every battle.]- Dialogue. It's very bad and most of it is from the main character. Ugh.Unless you're a hardcore fan of RPGMaker RPG's, I'd suggest avoiding this one. [If you do enjoy these kinds of games, I do think it will scratch enough of your itch.][Edited to elaborate on a couple of points and fixed a couple of words.]			"

												The start if beautiful for a 2D RPG some people in a small village some animals, some hidden things, not much to buy. The feeling at start is nice. You find after many barrels little helps. The starts make fun, many are on the fields working many things to get on the first 5 maps and still need to come back later for later you can even found your first of 24 secret maps if you are lucky or test every corner. Then it go the wide world. Some ways are in the first game not avaible not even for a little sneak how hard it gets there or just take a preview look but its fine, its enough to explore and find on the first map (one of the 8 animal kings (i think everytime on the Manga Toriko only that few have secret incredince) or 2 other well hidden stuff.  So there is many to find in the game, for beginners are there green arrows and you can make the most enemys visible. There are many items to find what i like even if there could some be a bit better and more change from other weapons, most there are only chaning 2-3 basics and only few but its okay you can find other things that make you stronger (items, orbs, pillars, techniques) you only need the money and the right ways to find. Money you get only few in mid and end game, thats relastic but sad, little bandits in some early areas would be not so bad. The guide of the game is great but could have some more details like all items with little numbers and what there to get or ingame a map/ compass that shows you if you have 100 % of the map reached, but that is only low critic points. What i dont like was in some fights you cant escape you cant load save games or get in the menue, but thats really still not important points. The game is great, you need to collect a group of warrior and start here to get the first 3 of them, it feels like King Arthur collects his mens for his table. The main game is not so long if you go straight forward but its a challenge on all modes at the end even if you find all 22 of 24 usefull secret rooms, many orbs, good weapons and co or increase the levels of your techniques. There could be a bit more story about the people but i love it enough, there could sometimes in the rookies more animals/ life or some more details and other places too or rooms where only 1-2 be in but that no one interest for real. I am happy to start with the 2nd of 5 parts in some days. The comic is short but nice work and the wallpapers are a nice gimmick too where you see the work for little details. The developer is friendly and helpful if you have requests about what to do, where to get important stuff or which items/ways are useful and which enemys are better to handle and he is still there for changing parts to make the game better. Give the game a chance. The enemys are fine, many things like blending, bleeding and nice different enemy types, even if there could be some more :) Enjoy some hours, find the incredible hidden items, finish the 40 quests and be one part of 13 warriors against the rich and unsocial Lord Dragon and his followers. I personally give this game 9.5 of 10.0 points for me. Look a lets play maybe you have interest to invest 10+ hours to find many things and beat/complete the game!			"

												If you enjoy RPG Maker games, this one should not disappoint you. Story is rather simple and naive: there are two coexisting places - powerful, rich kingdom and very poor village, that suffers from crop failure, which may cause dead by starvation to many of its residents. Is it realistic? Not really, it's typical fairy tale. Story never explains how the kingdom is so rich and from where they take food supplies (since, apparently, not from village, because they don't care about poor harvest). The protagonist is a teenage girl, who try to change the whole system. She want to run in the elections, but she know, she wouldn't win standard way, so she decide to use other rule - she want to challenge the best warriors from kingdom. To do that, she herself need to collect a team of powerful friends.You can control your character via mouse or by just keyboard - I decided to go with the second option (since it felt more organic), but it has caused me problems few times - I could not get in to certain locations or collect items that were right before me. You have map with the most important places. First few locations are rather simple and easy to navigate, though the later ones are far to complicated and disorienting. If I hadn't use a little help and activate arrows that may guide you (which is kind of a cheat, I guess), there were few important things that I would never find otherwise. Combat is not well balanced - in most of fights you don't even need to use your special skills to win. It's bad because there are few more challenging fights at the end of the game and if you hadn't experiment with your skills before, you may miserably fail.Pros:+ very good graphic+ interesting characters+ a lot of locations+ nice music+ leaves you curious about the next partCons:- combat is not well balanced- keyboard controls does not always work well- it's very hard to find yourself in bigger and more complicated locations (even if you have arrows to guide you). If you need to go back for something, it will be ages before you find yourself- combat isn't rewarding - you don't get many special items and if you suddenly find yourself in the last location with the final boss and you did not have money to get prepare or you just didn't buy enough things... Well, you're pretty much scr*wed, since going back is really a pain.			"

The characters are one-dimensional, as if a 13-year old wrote the story. For an RPG maker game done by some kid, this is impressive. But to charge six dollars? I've seen better games for free and a better soundtrack. The fact it made it on to Steam worries me.			"

												Where do I even begin... I got this game on sale, it's been a while since I've gotten lost in an RPG, so why not, right?Certainly, this is no Dragon Age, but I didn't need it to be. The art style looks closer to Chrono Trigger, which is why I originally picked it up, and for the most part, it kinda is, though I haven't actually played CT all the way through, I'm fairly certain that it also doesn't have actually photographs providing backgrounds for 16 bit foreground scenery... it's a little jaring... I'm only 8 hours into the game, which may or may not be half way, depending on who you talk to. At my rate of progression I'm probably only like 3% done, but I've managed to do 8 quests, only one of which appears to actually be putting my toward my final goal.My biggest problem is dying. I'm not sure how the system works but sometimes I die and I go back to the menu, the helpful old man on the screen tells me I need to try harder. Thanks. Othertimes it lets me keep playing right where I left off at the cost of 10% of my gold. I don't get a choice in the matter, it just happens. I mean, I like the fact that I can keep going from where I left off, because traveling through the world is a nightmare and a half, but that's also why I'm saving every few minutes, so honestly, I'd rather just not lose the 10% of my gold. I'm sure there is a reason, it's just not clear for it.The battles ossilate between way too difficult and way too hard. Some encounters I don't have any issues, some get my KOed pretty quickly. Same baddies. I found out that the dragons hate the black orb, had a cut scene leading up to a mini-boss? Which I took out in a single move. Spoiler alert. I guess. I do like the artwork, I mean the character drawings are fun, even if they appear over top the enemies I'm fighting so I don't know how many there are. The game also does a great job of not letting me go where I'm not suppose to go, unless it's into battle in a location I'm not suppose to be where suddenly I'm just totally KOed without warning. Yes, I am writing this after giving up and dropping my controller to the floor. To be fair, I died three times in a location I'm going through because I have no healing supplies, and I'm far enough in that I don't know whether it's worth heading back or not, but the enemeies all do enough damage that you have to heal after every battle or die... oh, wait, I'm dying anyway. I don't understand why some stuff costs SP and other stuff doesn't... when the other stuff is limited on how many times you can use it. This was a fun little distraction lately, but there's so many little nuances and hidden secrets I have a feeling that I'm not going to make much of an effor to finish the game at this point.			"

												Millennium - A New Hope is a game obviously made with the RPG Maker tool. That said, if you enjoy the old RPG games from SNES era you may enjoy this game. One can tell, that the creator has put some work into this. However, it is, in my opinion, just not enough work to justify a price of 6,00 €.The story is nice but nothing too special. One of those ""let's go out and save the world"". Although I actually liked the idea that the main hero wants to make the world a better place to live in instead of rescueing it from some kind of doom. What broke the hole atmosphere for me, was the main character repeatedly breaking the fourth wall each time when she says that she just has accomplished another quest accompanied with some stupid applause. Also the music does not really help to maintain atmosphere. At first it seems quite well chosen but it gets repetitive very quickly even to a point where you just cannot listen to it any more. This is very sad, as the choice of music is one of the most important thing for this kind game.Also destroying any credibility is the main characters jumping skills. At times she would jump off or on cliffs in the mountains where normally living beings would just break every single bone. Not to speak of her wall jumping skills with lava right beneath her. Keep in mind at this point that your main character is a teenage girl who had never really left her home village.What also has been a huge drawback for me were the dungeons. At first, these seemd to be very well planned. They are kind of big with a lot of ways and things to discover. However this gets rather tedious in later dungeons, as the treasure only repeat themselves and the enemies get more and more status changing attacks which quite often can only be healed with the specific item which can definitley never been found in the dungeon where you need it the most. So, after a while you find yourself hoping to find the quickest way through the dungeon and not discovering, as there are almost no real interesting things to be found and the normally quite easy ennemies are too strong all of a sudden because you cannot cure your status changes.There still are many things to do in this game (quests and secret rooms) but your main way of getting XP to level up is monster grinding. Which, although it works 'on the fly' as the dungeons are so big and labyrinth like is tedious as already described and in my opinion a bad choice for a game design. The most entertaining and rewarding way to level up you char is always a mix of quests and monster slaying.This all said, I want to stress again that this game is not worth it's price. There are many other games out there, created with the RPG Maker which are completely free to play and which designed far better. Just to mention three: ""Unterwegs in Düsterburg"" and ""Vampires Dawn 1"" and ""Vampires Dawn 2"". Although all of them are, as far as I know only in German. However, all of these are better than this one here and do not cost anything!I'd like to say 'though that it seems that Millennium - A New Hope seems to be the first game of a series. So, the creator has probably learned from mistakes and might have changed things in it's sequels. And should I find them for free (legally) or as a bargain anywhere I might give them a try.			"

												Game feels like an animation movie - about a small girl who tries to make her best to change the world.Game features a whole world with lots of different characters, very relaxing game play filled with different interesting objects, quests, tasks. I would specially admit greatly painted intros, interesting overall level design.			"

												This game does not support anything but 4:3 ratio screens. If you have a 1080p monitor (or anything not from the 90’s) you’re out of luck; you must either go out of your way to figure out how to force the aspect ratio to not stretch to fit the screen or deal with the stretching during gameplay. If you manually (there is no in game option) change the settings from fullscreen to windowed mode then the window is unplayably small.There is no options menu at the start, no keybinding, no support for anything other than keyboard (unless you manually change the .ini file to enable a mouse).I can't comment on gameplay, because I couldn't bring myself to look past the abhorrent laziness in development that slaps you in the face just in the few first seconds of starting the game.Sure, it's a cheap (inexpensive) game, but does it really have to be cheap (low quality)?

												A classic jrpg, with impressive map and character models. Combat system is well made, but skills option could be richer.Music is nice and enjoyable.As always Aldorlea Games has proven to give out a very quality jrpg games, therefore I can recommend this game to everyone who are in this type of games. However since it was a bundled no more that 7 times, I suggest waiting for big discount or when it is bundled again.			"

												Horrible game. It's an average rpg but the difficulty is ridiculous. I played on normal and could not do a thing. Once you leave your home town, where you are one shotting bees, you instantly become ridiculously underpowered, forcing you to run from almost every enemy you encounter, because one of them could easily defeat you, but you are facing 2-4 at a time. Leveling up and buying gear seems to have little effect, if you are lucky enough to do either, as you don't collect much gold and are unable to kill monsters, so right off the bat you are stuck. The characters skills are useless too for the most part, and because they barely have any skill points at all, you can't even use them more than a few times. And when you try to fight something, 4/5 attacks your characters will miss. You can't depend on items either, because you will blow all your money on potions and the likes to attempt to stay alive.I made it as far as I did from saving every 5 steps and hoping I didn't encounter any monsters. Eventually though, your patience will run out and you will say screw it, it's not worth it.Oh yeah...and don't equip the Dark Glove, cuz you can't unequip it, thus your stuck with a low stat item for the whole game.

												I picked this up on sale with a few other games from Aldorlea - and all I can say is I'm mega unimpressed with the games they churn out...*PROS*-Nice tilesets/mapping (for the most part)*CONS*- Inconsistency in style/color palette makes the game look very mish-mashed at times.- AWFUL dialogue - like...I literally wanted to poke my eyes out reading it.- The story is convoluted as hell - within the first 30 minutes it's just like...what? There's some town where rich people live, you're sent to deliver something while your dad is injured - a fairy falls into your earrings and instead of returning home to your sick/dying father you decide to compete in this town's elections...? I just didn't get what was happening.- Battle system is boring as hell. I mean, sure it's the default - but it feels like next to no thought was put into battling/skill use etc.There are lots of RPGMaker-based games that deliver an amazing experience - this just isn't one of them.

												I may revise my opinion later, but as of now, I'm not a fan. The game itself is okay, but I absolutely hate games with time-limits built in. I don't like being forced to rush and not get everything done that can be. That's just not a good thing. I'll probably go back and play it some more and see if it gets beyond that point, but as of now I can't recommend this to anyone.			"

												Played and finished this one before it hit Steam, and didn't really like it.  It is the first episode of a 5 episode series and feels that way - the story is just an introduction and some adventuring to get the starting few companions.  Which is all well and good, but it is padded out into a 15-20 hour game through humongous maps, and you still don't feel like you've accomplished much towards the end. Wasn't a fan of the story either, but that's far more subjective.  I have a feeling I'm just not part of the target demographic or something.It doesn't help that items required to complete many of the side quests can only be acquired by going to one hidden location at the right point in progression through the story.  If you find the location too late, or don't visit it enough, you'll end up finishing the game with uncompleted side-quests in your log. I did like being able to see enemies in dungeons instead of having random encounters every couple steps that can be annoying in some JRPGs.I haven't played Millennium 2 yet, so perhaps the series improves greatly from part 1, but A New Hope didn't leave me with much desire to continue to the next one (not with my backlog, lol.)  So no, I wouldn't recommend this game.  Instead I'd advise you get Book of Legends from the same devs, which while more expensive, is a self contained story and which I enjoyed a whole lot more (I've reviewed that one as well.)			"

												I wouldn't recommend this game. In fact, even though I got it on sale, I still think it was a huge waste of money, and I paid little more than $2 for it.The writing and plot didn't draw me in at all--it felt school-aged, cliche, and trite. Marina was annoying, and Benoit was absurd. I don't know about any of the other characters, because I honestly didn't bother to play that long. The dialogue alone was enough to make my eyes want to bleed.This game has all the makings of a classically annoying RPG: a soundtrack that drives you nuts (seriously, why are women vocalizing together in the beginning town stages???), enemies and bosses that have some obnoxiously overpowered attacks even on normal and easy modes (oh, you can paralyze, bleed, and blind me? That's cute; thanks for that), and a story that failed to capture my interest even in the smallest measure.As for the grinding and battling, it left a lot to be desired. Enemies can wail on you 'til kingdom come, and you don't get a lot of gold to get healing items or characters with high enough SP to afford to continously heal more than 3 or 4 times. Even with the items you find or occasional rest area, it's not enough unless you want to spend all your items on healing instead of armor and weapons. Fun fact: most of the monsters I fought don't drop you a single piece of gold. All I can say is I most definitely am NOT buying anything else from this developer, no matter what the sale price is.

												An rpg maker game. Graphics are the same as every other game made with the same tools, music is amateurish and the combat is laughable. You get the monsters standing in front of you - twitching to imply they're attacking. Your party members are presented as avatars and are not otherwise visible. A fantastic game to get 3 cards from and then to delete it with passion. While writing this review I noticed there's a limit that you have to play the game at least 5 minutes before posting a review so I'll waith for the first card before pushing the ""Post review"" -button.
