												I think Magicka is probably the best mage-game out there. With its amazing sense of satirical humor, Magicka really does bring out out the laughs very often. The game also has an amazing blend of gameplay, music (which I must say is very good for most Paradox games), and graphics, which really is great for the environment, but especially for the Magicks. I think the only con for this game is the optimization, which makes the game run dreadfully on potatoes. And majorly, the bugs, probably the biggest downside to this game, makes some areas almost unplayable. However, the support from Paradox is very good and really puts the game up-the scale.			"

												When you start Magicka you don't know what you're up to. Cast your first spell, destroy something, kill yourself, burn down a house, melt cheese or just grill some sausages. This big adventure will require skills to learn to cast spells as fast as you can. This is only way to survive sometimes. On top of that you'd rather be smart to find the weak points of many different foes who will come across your journey. Having  troubles passing through an area? Just call some friends and they will help you in a fight or just cast the wrong spell on you :p. Well Magicka is a unique game without vampires ;-).I recommend that you also read the e-book : The Ninth Element. It is well written and fully in sync with the humour of the game.Some DLCs will give you a very hard time to defeat the bosses but that's where you should call your friends for online adventure.			"

												At first glance Magicka will look like a fun button mashing experience to have with your friends. If you look further you will see that there is more enjoyment to experience from Magicka than you could ever see from the trailers and screenshots. Magicka has created something that no game had ever done before (at least not well). From just a combination of buttons you can create powerful spells that bare strategy behind them. Of course there are a number of downsides and bugs to this game that when overlooked barely interfere with the gameplay at all and will usually result in a laugh. Make no mistakes, this game is for pure fun and joy.If you are looking for a game to play with your friends then look no further because this game is precisely what you need. You are getting a lot more fun out of this game than the price would intend you to believe. At such a low price you get hours of gameplay excluding all of the tremendous amount of downloadable content. Magicka is a co-op game that brings out the evil inside you and your friends. You can be on your way to defeating the infamous Grimnir when out beaming behind you is a beam of arcane from your companion aiming directly for you. Magicka really brings out the troll in most people and with countless of opportunities to kill you your friends will never get bored killing you and reviving you, killing and reviving you, killing and... yeah.For the serious competitors that don't like the limitations that Magicka: Wizard Wars gives you but are still interested in the humor and game mechanics of Magicka then the pvp or challenge modes will prove to be very effective gamemodes. As stated before Magicka has a very diverse field of strategy. For example someone will be coming at you with some fire so you have to quickly decide to cast a fire shield onto yourself to become immune to fire and then come at them with the most unexpected attacks in order to win a player versus player match. Challenge mode also includes some strategy and competition. Once you die in challenge you're done for and must start from square one. This means you can compete against your friends and see who is the greater wizard.Now I bring you the bugs, glitches and problems this game faces. The bugs in this game are usually hilarious to see happen to someone you are playing with and usually funny to watch when they happen to you. These are the small bugs that don't affect you in a huge way when playing Magicka but through your playthrough it is not unlikely to come across a big glitch that will require you to restart the game and have you go back to the last checkpoint. Another thing that could be considered a problem in this game is it's massive amount of downloadable content which could possibly be a deal breaker for you if you just hate paying just a bit extra for a full package. What I must reassure you with is the fact that none of the extra content is required to feel whole although it is a bit depressing when you look at your robes and see a horde of robes unable to play with. When it comes to actual level and gameplay dlc Paradox have done something I must praise them for. When playing online only the host needs the downloadable content in order to play it so essentially you could play every dlc level without ever paying a cent.This was the first game I had in my library and it's what got me interested in steam. So as someone who has had their lives changed (or ruined from the access to almost every modern pc game developed) I say buy this game whenever you get the chance. If you're interested in humour, magick, wizards, co-op, being a troll, strategic moves, unstrategic fails, using powerful combos that wipes everything off the screen causing you all to go back to the start of the game, competition or vampires that think no one knows that they are vampires then I highly recommend to try this game out regardless if you're a loner and can't find anyone to play it with.

												Updated Review.One of the most fun spellcasting systems I have ever seen! Knowing what to cast in what situation has never been more satisfying. The concept itself of combining elements to make spells had me sold, and the game itself managed to value that potential. The freedom of doing whatever the ♥♥♥♥ you want whenever you want is amazing. No ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t mana bars. No crappy skill trees. No cooldowns. Pure, unaltered, raw power, scaled with your skill level. Some DBZ style♥♥♥♥♥♥here.There are downsides though:- arrowhead did one of the crappiest netcodes in existence. Crashes happen. Connections don't. Hosting doesn't work most of the time. Multiplayer is such an amazing experience, be it Adventure, Challenge or Versus and crap like this stands in the way. If you can overlook that, this game is easily a 88/100, but with the crappy 1998 multiplayer, the score is rightfully dragged down to 74.- latency in this game is on steroids for some reasons, probably bad optimization- too few people play, and because of the crappy matchmaking system you need to know people's numbers and have friends that play- they pump out a ton of DLCs, something that I hate on principle- the devs aren't really fixing much. They're adding more stuff and grabbing lodsemoneh- limited to a max of 4 players per game (and I think having way more would've been so much fun; game is not made for this)The PROS:- the combinations you can do with those 8 elements is mindblowing- so much fun in all 3 modes: Adventure, Challenge and especially Versus if you are at a high skill level and monsters are too weak- skill level can be INSANE. One guy can take out 100 other wizards and 1000 mobs, without getting a scratch.- single player is a lot of fun: comedic story, fun missions, DLCs aren't bad, they're just short- various robes you can put on, with various abilities- at high levels of play, the PVP aspect is balanced, but at low-med levels, you can spam a few spells and always win since people don't know how to counter them- Versus mode is LODSA fun at high skill levels- huge skill roof- great physics and offense-defense mechanics- intuitive effects of your spellsI recommend it a lot, especially if it's on sale. About the DLCs? I'm not sure. Having the base game is enough imo, the DLCs are really worth it for the extra robes that you can have fun with.GET YER ROBES ON			"

AT A GLANCE(Full review follows below) Game Name: Magicka Original Release: 2011 Genre Tags: RPG; Action; Innovative; Lighthearted; Fantasy My Overall Grade: A- Estimated Playtime (Campaign): 9-20 hours Multiplayer Aspect: Optional Recommended To: Established fans of the genre; Those intrigued by the genre; Novelty seekers REVIEWMagicka is a very enjoyable game. Fun, funny, and challenging... it makes for a very amusing experience. The standard campaign is relatively brief, but there is a lot of DLC content. Some of it is cosmetic and can be ignored, but much of it provides actual content and you will likely want to pick it up to get the full experience. Magicka also makes for unique and enjoyable multiplayer gameplay, if you find some people to play with. As I alluded to, the innovation inherent in the main gameplay mechanics is the primary reason that Magicka is something worthy of being in your library. There isn’t much else quite like it, and absolutely nothing of the same caliber.  You have to rapidly press certain button combinations to cast various spells while simultaneously controlling your character and aiming in an isometric view. It is pretty unique and intense. I personally found it more comfortable with a controller, but it also works well with a standard keyboard and mouse set up.And while the exciting gameplay is definitely the soul of the game, it is also quite funny and charming too. The art style is very fitting to the mood of the game; and although the graphics aren’t the best, they feel appropriate. With the addition of the mumble language, silly plot, and hyperbole of blood/gore, the jovial nature of Magicka becomes clear. This lighthearted atmosphere synergizes well with the unique gameplay to create an experience that is incontestably fun.The key feature of the game being the innovative gameplay mechanics, I recommend anyone looking for some variety check it out if they haven’t already. I highly recommend playing with other people though; it’s much more fun and much less frustrating (since you can revive each other).Also the Versus and Survival modes are pretty fun, especially since the game supports local-coop (as in sitting on a couch with your friends, as it was in the old days).Follow my curation page to see more of my recommendations!

												This is one of my favorite games ever. Having said that, the learning curve is steep, but the game is flexible enough that everyone tends to develop their own style. It has a very simple magic system that lends itself to plenty of emergent complexity. The campaign is full of cultural references as is all of the DLC, making for a quirky and entertaining overall bundle. The challenges are hard enough that I still haven't beaten all of them on my own, so the game has content for all skill levels.			"

												This game is just simply awesome. Dialogs are just hilarious, just try to ask every NPCs a thing, you won't regret it. There is a lot of sci-fi/fantasy references in all the game. The story is really funny too.The solo mod is fun, if you wanna talk to every NPCs and try to follow the story but i prefer to warn you, if you try to play with friends, it's nearly impossible to stay alive. And that's the fun of the multi, you have the friendly fire so you can cast spells to push your friends on the ennemies, or in the gaps. But don't worry, they can use resurrection's spells on you ;)The mechanics of the games are awesome too, you have 8 elements of magick and you can combine them into an infinite possibility of spells.I highly recommend it, even if you can only play in solo.11/10			"

												How I've managed to go so long without finishing Magicka is beyond me. This is a truely amazing indie title that is still top notch even after all these years. To begin with the controls are fiddly but once you start to memerize your combos for spells it becomes second nature. While the game is very fun playing solo, it's meant to be played with your buddies, you can blow each other up, electricute, all sorts. There is hours upon hours of fun to be had here. The story mode is a good length, twelve chapters and each one consisting of 3 or 4 different levels with each of them having their own boss at the end.I would be surprised if 99% of Steam user's don't already own Magicka, but for that 1%, go out and buy it. This is a joy to behold.			"

												Fun action isometric game, where you can joyfully/accidentally kill each other or yourself in up to 4-players co-op.If you are looking at Magicka 2, try this one (if you missed it).Good+ Fun / Humor (most critical part of game, which makes it really good)+ Local and 'Remote' Co-Op (not so many games with real Co-Op these days)+ Good story (not much of a 'story', but you will not be bored)+ Unique approach to spell casting (you should mix elements yourself to find ultimate weapon)+ Challenges and PVP arena (nice addition to overall picture)Good? Bad? Who knows?+/- A lot of DLC (while DLCs are good, they are not free :( )Bad- Bugs / Crashes (especially in DLCs during multiplayer)- No SteamPlay support (Windows only)Bottom line: get it during sale with all DLCs pack (base game worth full price for sure)			"

There are a lot of levels and spells to discover , secret rooms and easter eggs , staffs , guns and achivements. Its a decent game , the only bad thing is the amount of DLCs on the storepage.

												Magicka is one of my favorite games, and one of the few that does a good job making you feel like a wizard.The Good:The crown jewel of Magicka's design is its spell creation system.  It was not the first video game to allow you to design spells by selecting the path, area of effect, effects, and intensities.  The Elder Scrolls: Arena had that in 1994, and there may be earlier examples I don't know about.  It may be the first to allow you to create spells on the fly.  It is also noteworthy for having no limits based on a mana pool or cooldowns.  Instead, the main balancing forces are enemy resistances and the destructive power of your own spells.  It's very easy to make a mistake and kill yourself or your allies.Magicka is also well known and loved for its voice acting.  Everyone speaks a mix of broken Swedish and jibberish.  Vlad is an over the top Romanian vampire in denial.  Death and Fafnir also sound great.  I would love to know what sort of processing they performed on their voices.Magicka has one of the best soundtracks I've ever heard.  It's bombastic, complex, and memorable.  Unfortunately it may be hard to appreciate with it often being drowned out by the sounds of the chaos around you.The Bad:Magicka is very buggy, even by modern PC gaming standards.  Crashes and hangs are common.  Weapons and staves, which may be unique, frequently clip through the map and disappear into the void forever.  Players lose connection in online games often.  The DLC is even worse.  The Stars Are Left has an unpatched bug on the last level, where if you don't pass through the doors in the order the developers expected you to, not only does it crash, but it corrupts your save so you have to start that DLC over.  The fact that is still unpatched is shameful, by the way.Difficulty does not scale based on the number of players.  The main game isn't that difficult to get through solo, but some of the DLC is very hard without a full party.  I found the final fights in Dungeons and Daemons and The Stars Are Left to be impossible to solo.			"

												The 76 metascore is the result of what Magicka was when it came out: A hidden gem executed okey-ishly and with some bugs. But that's way too far from the game Magicka is today...Which is one of the best Local-Multiplayer/Co-Op/Versus games in all of Steam. I was a late buyer so I got to skip all the supposed bug-fest, but let me tell you this: Right now, Magicka is a blast to play with friends. Be it local or online multiplayer, co-op campaign or versus or survival, with keyboards or with controllers or any mix of all of the above. Aside from the super-robust level of multiplayer options, the game's campaigns (main and all of the DLCs) are amazing. The main campaign is filled with easter eggs, little details everywhere and stupendous and magnificent narrative comedy. I'll be frank and admit I haven't finished most DLCs yet (as I wait until all my buds can get together to finish them in one sitting), but I can tell you that The Stars Are Left, The Other Side of the Coin and Dungeons And Daemons are worth every penny.The quality for your money also applies for multiplayer-oriented DLC, which is cheap and adds lots of cool themes, robes with different stats and abilities and weapons that range from The Doctor's Screwdriver to Ak-47s and of course a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ amount of staffs.The gameplay is a bit hard to explain as there are truly no games like Magicka: Top down isometric spell casting & mixing shmup with always-on friendly fire is the shortest way to put it. The long one is: You see your wizard from a top-down-with-an-angle perspective, you can cast 8 elements: Fire, Life, Electricity, Water, Cold, Earth, Arcana/Death, and ""shield"" which gives any combination of elements a defensive use of sorts. All this elements are on their own very weak but once you combine them you can get deadly creative. From mini-volcanoes that light enemies on fire and explode when touched to steam-compressed mines that send foes (and friends) flying away Team Rocket-style to Death-electric beams that freeze to freaking Meteor Showers to casting Death Itself (whom kills someone on-screen at random).Now remember that the game has always-on friendly fire. Yup, it's a madhouse.If Mario Party destroys friendships, Magicka will obliterate blood-related family ties. But in the nicest, funniest and best ways.As a lover of couch co-oping, well-executed games, friendship, and... well, games in general, I urge you, TRY MAGICKA. It's very unlikely you'lle ever regret it.Unless you have no friends, of course. Being burned/electrocuted/bombed-away/exploded into tiny pieces accidentally on purpose is not as much fun when a complete stranger does it.			"

												I don't think I've ever been so in love with a video game before...It's buggy, horribly optimized, and suffers from such bad models and animations that they make a joke of it (traveling through landscapes that showcase herds of sheep-facades propped up in the pastures, or riding upon noble steeds who seem to be from the finest wooden toy horse stock), and you won't give a damn about any of it.  The multiplayer is nearly impossible to set up and laggy almost to the point of unplayability once you do, but it's such vibrant, stupid and chaotic fun that you'll ignore such minor negatives in favor of the grander scheme of bumbling wizards.The innovative magic system is profoundly complex and joyously destructive to experiment with, and there's a very scientific glee involved with working out your trademark spell(s) or finding the coolest combinations to solve a particular problem.You'll also learn to develop a newfound respect for such veterans of the wizardry craft as Gandalf or Dumbledore...  When you recognize just how much obscenely destructive force you have at your unwitting fingertips, it's always impressive when you DON'T manage to disintegrate/melt yourself and everyone in a 4-mile radius when attempting to do something.While the game is fun enough on its own and the writing is of absolutely stellar class, with actually funny wit and some really quite unexpectedly subtle jokes and twists, this game excels at multiplayer.  Yes, the horribly-irritating-to-get-started multiplayer.My deepest recommendation is to play this game with 3 friends, preferably with none of you knowing your wizard staves from your rump bristles.  Idiocy and a vast array of destructive weaponry often lead to the best of times, and ignorance of your own strength is the perfect excuse for ""accidentally"" slaughtering everyone on your team.The game starts you off with a resurrection spell, and as with all spells and magic in this game there is neither a mana cost nor a cooldown of any sort...  And you'll be very happy that it is this way, as roughly 98% of player deaths are either self-induced or from friendly fire.  Or some wonderfully flashy combination of the two.Indeed, the greatest danger you face is not the foe in front of you, but rather your overeagerness to simultaneously shock, burn, freeze and meltingly explode the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ into his primary colors.  Positively philsophical, really.I have never for a moment regretted purchasing this game.  Indeed, my saddest moment was when it finally ended...  for the second or third time.  Along with all the DLC missions.			"

												There are not many games out there, that make a great wizardry game. They include basic spells with no creativity, no humor, and those ANNOYING magic bars! But, There is one game though, that is very different. Magicka offers fantastic creativity with your spells, as you have 8 elements to choose from: Water, Fire, Earth, Cold, Arcane, Lightning, Shield, and Life. And out of all those elements you can do 5 elements at a time to do spells at people, offering great creativity in the game. For example, you can combine Earth 3 times, and then you can do 2 fire, or Water and Cold and Water and Cold/Ice,Ice,  or Arcane And Water. Some elements don't mix like Lightning and Earth, but can combine 2 for 1, such as Water+Fire=Steam. The game also allows you to combine different spells together in order to make... ""Magicks."" Magicks are combinations of spells to make ""Different"" that are bigger and better, such as... ""Summon Death, Meteor Shower, Summon Thunder, Teleport and more!"" The game is full of humor in cutscenes and gameplay about violence, logic, references and silly stuff that happen all the time! Finally, the game has NO MAGIC BARS!!!!!!!!!!!!! YEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEY!!!!!!!!!!! Finally a mage game that doesn't have magic bars! Screw swords and hammers used all the time! Spam Meteor balls, Chain lightning Goblins, use Force Powers on Evil vampires, and EVEN MORE WITHOUT LIMIT!!!!!! The game has fun single player and multiplayer, offering co-op and fun at the same time. But the game is sometimes full of bugs such as going out of the map, character glitching, and others. The game is fun and I recommend it to people who like to push the limit with magic, have comedy and epic wizardy at the same time. So now guys i got to g- OH SHOOT!  You fell into a hole! Don't worry, remember the safe word is Banana!			"

												This game really can't be taken seiously, with all of its references to other movies and games, and dry comedy  THIS IS SPARTA!!!! .  Just got an Assualt Rifle in a fantasy game, somehow.  Comedic story-telling aside, Magicka's elemental magic system ironically has a facinating science behind it, with many combinations of the 8 different types of Magic (Lightning, Water, Life, Arcane, Cold, Fire, Earth, and Shield). The game allows you to mix together different spells to form more potent and lethal spells (Water+Fire=Steam, Water+Cold=Ice), as well as enchant your weapon, cast upon yourself, or create an area of effect. With a ""Magicks"" spellbook, the game allows you to increase your speed, confuse an enemy, or summon a thunderstorm, and many others. The game also rewards and punishes you for different enemies, as you can electrocute enemies doused in water or wearing metal armor, or freeze wet enemies, or burn tree spirit golem things.I enjoy playing this game, and would definitely recomend or even buy Magicka for a friend.TL;DR, mix spells and burn things to the ground. Ice+Ice+Ice+Ice+Earth = ONE HIT K.O.  "

												I once thought about being a wizard, then I bought MAgicka and killed all my friends over and over because that's how Magicka defines teamwork. The game consists of combining things like rocks and fire and stuff to make magic attacks that you kill enemies with, but killing your friends is more likely because friends are usually dumb and get in the way of your attacks so they deserve it. buttmunches. You get 8 elements because any less would make you a subpar wizard. you can buttonmash up to 5 of them together, then either cast on yourself, cast in front of you, or just cast everywhere because aiming is for casuals and tryhards. In addition to this, you pick up books because this is like a library sort of, in that you pick up books. The books have element combinations in them that can be used to make spells that do different things than usual. for example. you combine earth, ""arcane"" element and fire and shoot a fancy meteor fire rock bomb with death magic attached. Then you type those three elements again and cast them with space instead of shooting them, and it turns into the ""haste"" spell and makes you all fast like that gonzales mouse on looney toons. Then there are lots of things and it turns out vlad's lying don't believe him he really is a vampire.Also the game is funny because they make references to everything like Zelda and 300 and everything else you could make a reference too.

												This is an amazing game! Finally a game where you can use your imagination to create different spells to suite different situations whether to freeze your opponents or set them on fire, why not combine ice and fire into steam and boil them to death!It has funny dialogues and an interesting story line. However, the only draw back is the amount of bugs present. It is not well polished even after all the patches it is still buggy and crashes alot. I wish the developers would have fixed the game instead of abandoning it to create a sequel! But when you get over the tremendous amount of bugs and crashes you will find a very fun game.			"

												Magicka, follows in the tradition of a really cool top-down RPG. As a D&D RPG it does not disappoint, and the graphics are crisp, detailed and very well done. I thought going into this game it would be more cartoonish; Thankfully, I was completely wrong. The dialogue is what you would expect of a quality RPG, the learning curve is designed to make the game accessible to gamers of all stripes, and the story is interesting. All in all a value bundle. My only real con for this game, is the sheer amount micro-transaction DLC, such as; Individual sets of armor. Is this really necessary. The developers made a quality game, does it need to be micro-transactioned all to hell too? Other than that, pick it up if you like RPG's, you should have a good time with it.			"

												Note: This game been tried out and reviewed in Steam offline mode or on Consoles.This game is a surprisingly good and addictive game.It comes down to that you're basically a wizard character with an arsenal of 6 elemental spells you can use at any time.But that's just the tip.the spell casting system in this game is unbelievably clever. Allowing you to combine different types of elements to create new spells - the manual totes that there are thousands of possibilitiesThe game does seem kind of difficult to start and may be frustrating, but once you get the mechanic down, it is just plain fun worth the time & It has an online co-op where you can battle with up to 4 friends and even combine spells with themMagicka is at its best when you an at least one buddy are prepared to go on a satirical journey through a mock RPG land and laugh.This game is not designed to be overly challenging or serious, colors but fun. And it succeeds with colors.			"

												While writing I realised I made a rather large review, for the short version check my conclusion at the end.This without a doubt is the best wizard game i have ever played, sort of unfortunatly. I have always wanted a wizard game where you feel powerful, being able to destroy hundreds of enemies with unparraled power, but the problem i have always encountered is mana bars, a system I have always despised for reasons I wont go into here, or in the case of some games (Lichdom battlemage) being aimed for challenge.Here is where Magicka comes with no mana and is aimed for fun and funny moments. It uses its element systam allowing you to make your own spells, while also allowing more designed Magickas like Storms or summoning Zombies. Its all I could have asked for, and is great fun and is actually funny.Here comes the problems, it is designed for co-op with 2 to 4 players and enemy encounters dont change in anyway between the two, this means that riding solo is insanly difficult, also it is really easy to die due to its chaotic nature, its balanced in multiplayer with players being able to infinitly instanly revive buddies with no real reprocussions, single player you get one revive between checkpoints which are stretched out between many large enemy encounters. This leads to you needing to use overpowered robes (Sort of like choosing a new build) or cheesing the game solo, especially the final boss who is tanky, gives you little room to move, and has a insta kill black hole attack which sucks you in. But I still went on to complete the game by myself because it is that good.If you have any interest in a wizard game buy it, and try to get your friends to play since that is the superior experience, but even with all its flaws in single player it is still worth getting.

												If you want a game that takes itself seriously, this isn't for you.If you want a game that you can enjoy to the fullest on your own, this isn't for you either.Granted, while I usually do prefer playing games with friends, Magicka was really far from what my expectations of it were, and more often than not feels like a bit of a wasted potential for something that could've been really interesting in several ways. That said, I suppose it might just have been better that they didn't try to make this serious.Nevertheless, with my complaints aside, Magicka manages to make any group of friends have loads of fun for as long as the story lasts, and the whole element combination system is really, really amusing to use, moreover with other people to do it with. I can't praise the comic relief ""plot"" or the presentation much, but for what it's worth, I don't really regret buying it!			"

A few observations...Pro:- combat system is unique- the game has humor- the various dlc offer adequate content at an affordable price (thanks to bundles/sales)- killing your friends (accident or not) is always fun- lots of references hidden within the gameCon:- one achievement was broken (now removed - that's a good thing)- minor issues with connectivity			"

THEN THIS IS THE GAME FOR YOU!The point of Magicka is that you're a massively over powered wrecking machine in disguise. Well, its fairly obvious actually but that doesn't stop the more rowdy enhabitants of this typically generic fantasy world trying to ruin your day. Its quite litterally YOU Vs THE WORLD and for once its not you who's totally screwed. Magicka utterly refuses to take it's self seriously. Any hint of seriosity was burnt, stamped on and fired out the window at high velocity. This game is jampacked full of refrences, jokes and randomised hillarity.Overall rating: *****			"

												I played both Magicka 1 and Magicka 2, and I'd simply recommend this game better. This is good for players with a good muscle memory. Magicka 2 is more noob friendly, and its watered down a lot. In this game you must know how to spam. Really you can't just spam whatever you must know exactly how to spam or else you'd be healing enemies. I like combining Steam and Lightning or Ice and Lightning in this game. You cannot do that in Magicka 2.This game requires a good strategy after a certain chapter! You can't just go and spam spells anymore. Some enemies appear having a weakness agains one or two elements and you really need to use it. In magicka 2 you just use Death + Fire aoe to win. No brainer.Humour is great, you're op, you can die of your op-ness, story is better than in M2 etc.The only cons I FIND annoying are-Multiplayer laggy as hell in versus(or in general)-Spell icon appearing/conjuring feels a bit unintuitive, but this is fixed if you know what you cast actually.-Graphics feel a bit outdated ( But really who the hell cares?)-It feels better done than magicka 2..

												Lots of games punish you hard for being a wizard. At the start of the game, you get your one or two spells, and then you have to pretend you're a fighter or run away useless.This is not one of those games. In this game, you actually feel like a wizard. The only consequences for letting off as many of your most overpowered spells as you can is that maybe one of your friends gets caught in the blast. But you're a mother effing wizard, so resurrect the poor sucker and keep going.There is a story, but the game doesn't really expect you to pay attention to it. You're a murder hobo on a quest to save the world by killing whatever happens to be in your way. But that's not the point of the game.The point of the game is the magic system. It's by far the most unique way of handling magic I've ever seen. It takes a bit of getting used to, but once you get the hang of it it is supremely satisfying to let of a huge string of different spells in quick succession, subtlety tweaking your spells to suit the situation.Or you could just spam QFASA over and over, if that's your thing.Final note: the game is really designed to be played in co-op. You can play single player, but you're missing out on the full experience.			"

												Where to start, where to start...The insanely intricate magic system that offers a crazy amount of different spell combinations? The quirky humour that is cram-packed with references to popular culture and everything geek? The endearing colourful graphics that turn every second of looking at this game into pure joy? Or maybe the never-ending challenges, be it through several great DLCs or the long list of fun achievements? Because yes, this game, unlike so many, offers achievements that are actually that, real achievements that are either painfully challenging or simply extremely fun to get.Yet of course, while Magicka offers all that, it only truly unfolds its full potential when played with others. Personally I enjoy co-op most (accidental, yet sometimes not so unintentional, killing of your friends guaranteed thanks to friendly fire), but versus mode as well offers a good deal of entertainment.There is literally no excuse not to get and enjoy Magicka if you like video games and most certainly a bunch of good laughs.

												Magicka is a game were you play as a wizard, but not like every other magic game. Instead of having a few set spells. You are in control of eight elements. Using these eight elements Water, Lightning, Life, Arcane, Shield and Earth. You can blow enemies to bits.That’s not even scratching the surface of what you can do.I definitely had a blast playing this game with my friends. Even though we spent most of the timeshocking each other. I would recommend this game any day!   "

The casting mechanic is 10/10 combining elements has never been this fun even when you killed yourself 'cause you were wet and shocked yourself to death in a rush of panic.Despite all tho it has a few downsides, like the loading screens in multiplayer, the random non appearing book at the start, and the horribly made dlcs.Still i enjoyed every hour i spent playing, i do recommend this title to everyone that may find it interesting enough, give it a shot lads, you'll have great fun.

""Saturday, 10 o'clock, Magicka!"" or ""Achievements for Vietnam!"" or ""Today without dying on hard!"" and so on. I couldn't sleep nor eat knowing that I have still few achievements left to earn and a friend overeager to get them all.It was a pleasure to play scenario. This game has a brilliant plot, is extremally funny, filled with lots of references to movies, games, books, voice acting is a masterpiece. One of the best parts of gameplay are spells mechanics - there are 8 elements from which you can craft spells, some of them combined can make new elements, others can't be connected, enemies are resistant for ones and can be easily killed with others.Player has decent amount of useful Magicks available and plenty of ways to kill himself and his friends. That's the pure beauty of Magicka - ruthless friendly fire.			"

												This little gem throws you into the robes of a wizard and sets you on a noble quest to save the world of Midgård from destruction. As a wizard, you are given power over 8 different elements, from which you may cast a vast array of spells by combining them in different ways. This mechanic is very well thought out, with elemental opposites that may or may not result in death if you're not careful, as well as radically different effects for different combinations providing plenty of depth in your spell casting. There are, however, some spell combinations which are obviously more powerful than others, oftentimes leaving no reason to use the others. Despite this, alternate spells do come in handy every once in a while, so don't be afraid to experiment with them.In regards to the story I'm not going to say much so that you can experience it all for yourself, but suffice it to say that it's very much an adventure of epic proportions and theres lots of content to enjoy. Every location and every boss feels unique and is fun to battle. While the adventure is generally supposed to be pretty serious, it's delivered in a silly and lighthearted manner, including humorous narration and funny NPC dialogue. Furthermore, the soundtrack fits in at every moment of the game - it's reminiscent of Lord of the Rings and it's certainly no worse for wear because of it. Booming and powerful when an action scene calls for it, quaint and quiet when it's calm, and with several other tracks to fill in moments of the game that don't quite fit into either category.Finally, there are several modes you can play with your friends and accidentally (read: not really on accident) kill your friends with a spell gone awry or something else. Always great fun to gib your buddies late on a friday night - and yes, if it's not your thing there are settings that change the gore. The game allows you to play the story mode in co-op, and there is also a ""versus"" mode, but I've yet to try the latter.In short, a great game to play on your own, fantastic with friends.Now hurry up and get it! Before they run out of cheese!			"

												Don't be fooled by the underwhelming screenshots shown on the store page. This game is high paced, action packed, and incredibly fluid. Adventure with your friends for maximum enjoyment.The game utilizes eight elements which you can combine to create an enormous number of effects. You and your friends can ""cross the beams"" and have mega powered attacks, massive explosions, and any number of other crazy effects.The story is a bit quirky but it's actually quite entertaining. There are ""twists,"" drama, humor, and even the occasional moment of somber seriousness. The game can get quite difficult, and every battle leaves you feeling like an action movie hero.It's a great game on it's own, but it's an unbeatable experience with your friends.			"

												A fun, lighthearted game, better played with friends~! It is a bit old already but I will nonetheless review it.Pros: Unique spell creation system Several robes to choose from Simple, easy-to-understand gameplay Funny & entertaining dialogue Several game modes to choose from (For me) Enough level of challenge  Friendly fire can accidentally cause you to kill allies or heal enemies, so you must be careful what you cast! Can provide you good 15 to 20 hours of gameplay to finish the adventure mode story (minus times you die over and over)Cons: No inventory system, you can only have one wand/weapon at a time Can be buggy Dropped wands/weapons can clip through the map and be gone forever, even unique ones A lot more challenging if played soloOverall Rating:7/10			"

												Spoiler alert, Vlad is a vampire. you can pick up your jaw from the floor now.Now in all seriousness, magicka is a very rare gem. No level ups, no inventories of partners, and no seriousness. Several game and meme refferences that will make you laugh aloud, cringe or facepalm (or a combination of all 3), you'll obliterate your enemies AND your allies-friends included- combining a variety of elements to make spells. Your only method of attacking efficiently is using the spells, and the combinations are very straight fowoard. Examples include earth and shield to make a barrier of rocks, or fire and water to cause vapor. you'll die a lot (mostly from accidently blowing yourself up or walking off into death pits), but you'll enjoy your adventure all the way through a gorgeous fun game with a great soundtrack.

												Magicka is crazy, fun, messy, stupid, wacky, funny, and sometimes hard enough to push you to be creative.The story is good enough to make you want to finish it.The multiplayer is incredibly fun. You'll enjoy killing your friends the foes with your friends by elaborating machiavelic elaborated plans to blow them up in creative ways.And if you, accidentally kill a friend or yourself, because sometimes it really is an accident, that's ok ! Dying is part of the Magicka gameplay, just use resurect and voilà, let's go make a mess again.			"

The computer uses a unique system for attacks:You have 5 element slots and what you put in those 5 spots determines what goes on, like:Water+Frost=Ice boltsArcane+Defence=Landminesetc.It is a fantastic way to spend your time and a recomend it.

												Magicka is hardly a game to reccomend. It's full of good ideas and awesome humor, but also full of bugs and technical issues. Can be a lot of fun sometimes, and a lot of frustration other times.Friendly fire is what makes this game interesting, its chaos is its strenght and weakness, that can lead either to laugh or cry.Overall, it's an original game, you won't find anything else like it for now, consider it only for a really low price, like a bundle or something; and remember that if you don't have friends to play with, it will be a total waste.Be aware that this game often runs poorly even with a good machine, and random bugs of literally any kind can easily ruin the experience.

												[+8] Clever element-combination system. You use various elements to make a composite spell. For example; use rock and arcane to make an arcane bomb, then add fire to make an incendiary arcane bomb. Combine water with cold to make ice shards, throw in lightning to make electric ice shards.[+4] Slapstick humour. Casting spells is the very definition of spray-and-pay, and since it's designed for co-op, you will likely have lots of fun setting your friends on fire.[+2] Also a funny story. Silly, enjoyable medieval romp, a bit like Discworld with less subtlety.[-2] Problems. While it's obvious why the funny bugs (like bouncing weapons) were kept in, it crashes a little more frequently than the average game. Also organising co-op matches can be a pain sometimes.[-2] Bit of an eyesore. Environments bland, models and animations a bit sloppy. No real distinct art style.OVERALL SCORE: +10			"

												I can't recommend it enough, it doesn't take itself seriously, but who cares, i have player a ton of time in it (look at my play time) and i didn't got bored even for a sec! In singleplayer it is fun, but where it shines REAAAAALLLY!!! is co-op, the fact that friendly fire is on, and you can kill your friend anytime you want to take revenge because he set you on fire accidentially, you can! And it wont cause any problem cause you can just revive him anytime (well if you want to).Game is buggy, true, but there isn't that big or critical bug left, only small ones. 99% of the bugs and glitches are hilarious and not rage-enducing or something like that. I VERY, VERY, VERY!!! much recommend you to get this game, get a friend with you and play it, there is so much content in it for such low price, and dlc-s doesn't cost that much either, they have realistic prices (unlike payday2 dlc prices..) TL;DR Single player is 8/10 co-op is 10+/10 game isn't serious, but VERY hilarious, and funny, you will just cry of laugh almost everytime if you play with someone else.

												Magicka is a lot of fun, the spell system is brilliant and dynamic, letting you combine Earth, Wind, Water, Shield, Fire, Ice, Lightning and Healing in any combination you like. In COOP the game really shines, as you combine each other's spells and wipe out hordes of enemies. The humour and presentation is great too! Not many RPG-esque games let your wizard wear a Warhammer 40K armour suit and wield an M16 afterall! Get it!			"

												Although I admire the novel control system in Magicka, I didn't enjoy playing this game. It feels too much like work. And... I kind of suck at it.I think I'd be more efficient and struggle less with a few more levels of play, but I don't feel compelled to keep trying. The gameplay is uncreative ARPG, and I find the humor too juvenile to entertain. The warmed-over ""Swedish Chef"" mock-language is painful and unfunny.I do think Magicka has a good pricing model. The base game is cheap ($10, and on sale for practically free all the time), and the DLC is affordable. You can keep paying for more content at your own pace until you get bored. This works for me. Good system. It's also a decent ""beer and pretzels"" co-op game; a way to kill a couple hours with friends.So... given the low price point, if you are looking for a co-op game, I would recommend Magicka with these reservations. It wasn't my cup of tea, but for a few bucks, it's hard to pass up.			"

												Loads of fun. This game is packed to the brim with replayability, from the many insane and wacky robes to don to the online Co-op with friends; all it takes is one badly aimed rock to start an all-out war amongst yourselves. There's loads of Great DLC aswell, adding new adventures and items to the table.The Graphics can sometimes look a bit dated, but that's on rare occasions. the rest of the game has that isometric hack'n'slash feel of games like Diablo or fallout. Plus, you can mix and match your different spell types to create amazing combos, like lightning that burns people, or a flaming ball of death, or even land mines.I give this game an 8/10, would Wizard again.

Magicka Left ArmI believe most gamers know what ""Nintendo Thumb"" is. For those who don't, it is when you've been been using the D-pad or Gamepad for such a long time that blisters and swellings started to appear on your thumbs or other fingers. Well, having mentioned ""Nintendo Thumb"", may I introduce a new term to you - the ""Magicka Left Arm"". This ""Magicka Left Arm"" is the situation where you've been playing Magicka for such a long time that, when you wake up the very next day, your left arm started to become sore and numb and, in extreme situations such as mine, you cannot move your left arm for the whole day. Yes, this has happened and I shall tell you why.First of all, allow me to begin by describing the game mechanism. It is not wrong to say that this game is based on the concept of conventional Diablo-like RPG. You control a character, nameless and hooded, and you roam around the top-down world by pointing and clicking at locations with your mouse. You are free to run around and whack enemies using your melee weapon, though it is not recommended to do so as you will die like a popcorn. What you can, and should, do is to cast Spells and Magick. Notice how Magick is spelt? It is, of course, different from your typical Diablo-type Magic. In Magicka, Spells and Magicks do not require mana. They are formed and casted based upon 8 different basic elements: Water, Life, Shield, Cold, Lightling, Arcane, Earth and Fire. Each of these elements are bonded to they keys ""Q, W, E, R, A, S, D, F"" respectively. (There are two advanced elements: Steam and Ice, formed by combining Water + Fire and Water + Ice respectively) You can cast Spells, such as the ""Super Steam Lightling Beam"" by first pressing the combination ""Q, F, Q, F, Q, F, A, S"" and then followed by right clicking. In that manner, a strong beam will shoot towards the direction your mouse is pointing towards. There are many others, and you can experiment more with them once you are in game, though I believe this will give you a general concept on spell casting.As for Magicks, they are special magics that can be casted by forming a specific elemental combination and then pressing <space>. For example, if I want to summon an elemental, I will have to press ""S, E, D, Q, F, S, <space>"". However, one single elemental is too weak and it will be annihilated with in a matter of seconds. So, what did I do? More elementals, of course! After starting the game for a while, I can be seen pressing this elemental summoning sequence repeatedly. I'll be trying to cast 20 or so elementals in a couple of seconds, watch them fight to their deaths while hiding in a shield (opps), and repeat the process. And that, my dear reader, is where I got my ""Magicka Left Arm"" after 6 hours of game play straight. Don't get me wrong. I am not saying that you have to spam elementals like me. I personally like to take the easy way out, and watching a bunch of kamikaze comandos fight for me can be quite entertaining. There are many other ways to complete the game, and I will give you the liberity to figure it out for yourself. But then and again, you can be quite certain that your left hand will be quite busy throughout the game. This the fun part of the game, and this experience is what make this game worthwhile. The graphics is not much of a looker (look at the screenshots) and the jokes, though initially creative and great, can get quite cheesy in the long run. Great game if you want to enjoy something light and humourous, though watch out for the ""Magicka Left Arm"". You've been warned - spell casting can be extremely addictive.			"

Great game for anybody who likes magic, strategy, silliness, and chaos.    The comedy is great and the difficulty is perfect, so that the game is challenging but also easy, in that you can run into battle with a flaming sword or throw massive boulders to squash anyone in your path, or you can put together complex spells and chain them together, Ex. Creating rain clouds to soak your enemies then fry them with lightning.   The game is without a doubt best played multiplayer. The game features great multiplayer, and I have experienced little to no lag at all. There are a lot of game modes, from pvp to vietnam, and each is really fun.   The game's story is linear and gets boring after a few runs, but all dialog and most cutscenes can be skipped and get you right into the action.    The graphics are simple and can be run on even the worst computers, given you just lower the resolution, But the game still looks beautiful and creates a captivating world.   And of course the game and all DLC are super cheap (and worth it).Also, if you are still not sure, you should check out The Yogscast and TotalBiscuit's series on this game, which is only a fraction of the fun this game can offer.

												Magicka is an action-adventure game,  where you play as a magician who still needs to learn how to use  spell combinations. The real objective of the game is: that you need to defeat the evil with your mighty spells and side-arm.In my opinion the game looks like Runescape (in a positive way). Magicka starts with eight spells at the beginning and you’ll get a staff and a sword to wield, there are also another powerful weapons which the creatures could drop or hidden somewhere over the map.In the game there are evil creatures that were made by a powerful wizard, Grimnir. The wizard wanted to spread eternal peace to the world but the order expelled him because of his ambitions. Grimnir was imprisoned at the World’s End. My first time I’ve played Magicka I needed to go into a room below me, but I was just stupid enough that I didn’t read what they asked me to do. So I’ve spent like four minutes of my live to find the damn room. The reason: there was a party that was made for me so I was in a hurry because some guys wanted to eat all the cheese there were all by themselves. I aren’t a great fan of cheese so I didn’t care if they ate it. My impressions I’ve made so far.The game is made with sarcastic jokes, which I didn’t found funny (except one tip: drink not when you drive, is that a tip for a game that has no cars)? I’ve played the game alone until chapter four and I died like eight times, with a few rages. I was proud of myself that I could beat the first chapter. Got pain in my hand, because of spamming casting the spells upon the enemy.The Pros and Cons of the game.Pros:-	The game is fun to play with friends or with people all around the world-	The graphics are admirable -	The game got trading cards -	The developers tried his best to make some jokes, but it didn’t work out somehow-	The game got some nice background soundsCons: -	The game is hard to play, when you play the game all by yourselves-	The voice of the people sounds like they are drunk all the time-	Sometimes the screen turns black when you start the game, but you can find an easy fix that will prevent it from  hapening on youtubeI’d say give this game a chance and buy it only if you play the game online with friends or with people all around the world.

												Ehhh I'm in the middle. The gameplay is kind of repetitive and boring but on the other hand there are a lot of cheeky references to many different things LOTR and Steam itself included, but it reaches out further than that. The humor is pretty tongue and cheek too which is nice I guess. Hilarity ensues when playing with friends who would much rather kill you for the items you possess than actually defeating enemies. I suppose I had fun with it but I have a hard time convincing myself to play it more. Despite this I cannot give the game a negative review. I think this is one of those things where if you think you'd like it you probably will, but if you think it is not your thing you most likely wouldn't enjoy it.			"

Magicka! Oh how I hate your countless glitches, and yet I still continue to play.I love this game. From its outrageous stories all the way to its own language. Great character design along with a rather humorous story.  (I loved the characters so much I created my own Magicka Wizard's Robe custom to me from my own bed sheets http://imgur.com/NS4Iv0e ) As I mentioned before, Magicka has its glitches, bugs and unbarable lag at times. I suppose if you are me stationed in New England with garbage wifi playing with an Estonian and someone in Britain, you are bound to run into issues. WATCH OUT THOUGH!  If you find any fridges in a cave, be careful opening the door. ;POne thing I learned from this game, Wizards like to eat Cheese and Sausage. Who would of known?Not one of those overpriced games you see in the showcase at Gamestop, so give it a try. If you enjoy it I urge you to purchase the DLC's!			"

												My best friend gifted me this game after she said I'd enjoy this. At first glance I watched gameplay and thought ''Huh, this seems pretty good.'' She gifted me this and I say that she's made me love this game.Pros: +Humorous dialogue that is sure to make you have a giggle or laugh.+Pretty good story line.+Some of the best jokes I've seen in a video game+Lovely music with the graphics+Pretty fun and interesting spell mechinacsCons:-This game has framerate issuses up the wall, which can effect some users. It's not an issuse to me entirely but to others. -Some spell combos are pretty over powered. But the same time can kill you if you're not careful.-Its sometimes hard to see what effects you have applied to you and sometimes it can get you killed.-Controls take some time to get used to.I've yet to play Multiplayer so I will add this in later~			"

												This game unexpectedly became one of my favorites of all time. The humor, the references, the spellcasting mechanic, the linear, but compelling, plot progression and of course, the multiplayer, friendly fire enabled gameplay make for a fun and fluid experience. This game really makes you feel like a wizard, giving you tons of spell combinations and Magicks to play around with.			"

												Magicka was quite the entertaining game that I didn't expect it to be. I expected a short 5 hourish game that would be fun for like the first 2 hours. I was very wrong. I ended up playing through the whole adventure mode of Magicka with a friend, so in co-op, and it was quite a bit of fun.To start, Magicka has great graphics and spell effects and animations. Everything about the game looks good. Another thing that makes Magicka so good is that there are so many different orb combinations to make different spells, effects, and Magicka. When I mean there are so many different combinations, I mean that there are legit possibly over 100 differnt unique and tiered spells and Magicka you can cast. Not only that, but each spell combination often features its own unique graphical effect and animation. Couple this with some other weather and terrain, the game has a really a super in depth spell casting system.Magicka has a pretty random story, but it is pretty funny in places. The gameplay is pretty entertaining and the difficulty level increases perfectly for the most part. Although some times there are some abnormally easy bosses while some of the mob fights were annoyingly hard. Overall, Magicka does a very good job with checkpoints too so you do not feel super punished when you screw around and die. As I mentioned before, I played this game with a friend. I strongly recommend that you play Magicka with a friend or two or three because there are so many little things that make playing with more people more fun. For one, the revive is a clutch coop spell and there are so many more spells that can be comboed.Overall a good and fun game that you should play with your friends. I really did not find any flaws to this game apart from the occasional crash.Rating: 8.8/10Recommend Price: $5 or under			"

												Pros:-There are no Cons!!!This game is brilliant on how it handles simplistic ideas and amazing references and creates an incredibly unique and fun game. This game makes you create plans and adapt to what kind aof fighter you want to be, ie what spells your want to use. But the thing is its very hard to do that becasue you want to use them all. This game is brilliant for how it makes the player think. There are hundreds of combinations of spells and enchantments, it makes you experiment and train yourself for combat with your new discoveries. And after every little skirmish you will fell satisfied, because you taught yourself new techniques that make you stronger in battle. It also teaches you to be more precise with your inputs as the enemies play more aggressive, which would be bad in other games but not this one, the dragon shout of a right click allows you to blast back any foe that gets to close to a comfortable distance where you can quickly recuperate and put in the inputs you want in order to defeat it. No matter what, enjoyment will be had. Whether it is from the story humor, the classic video game reference humor, or the satisfaction of walking away from the battlezone as the victor and getting excited for when the next challenge approaches.Gandalf/10			"

This is another very long review. If you just want a summary of my reasons for why I recommend this game skip to Results and read from there.Magicka by Arrowhead Game Studios is an interesting game that really keeps you on your toes. I use the word interesting because this game has some great concepts although I could easily see them as potential weaknesses to some people. Magicka requires you to use physics and chemistry to create spells and solve puzzles. These include such concepts as freezing rivers, powering generators, and combining elements to create powerful spells. The Campaign:You play as one of four wizards who are a part of the Order of Magick. You start their adventure in Castle Alderheim where you are given a quest to save the world. The game includes twelve chapters, which pull you through time and space. You are led by your guide Vlad, possibly a vampire, who continuously points you in the right direction. The campaign requires you to fight many bosses who require different tactics to beat: Jormungandr, Jotunn, The Warlock, Khan, Grimnir, The Aristocrats, Vlad, Death, Fafnir, Grimnir, and Assatur. There are many DLC packs which allow you to play many campaigns and experience a full new game. The campaign has funny dialogue which speaks between English and gibberish. The campaign is rather cut and dry. Each level is essentially the same concept, basically fight the enemies and beat the level. Yet again, this is how most games that fit into this genre seem to be. There are many funny jokes, references, and characters which make this game a blast to play through. In fact one of the Wizards you can select is a Space Marine from the 40k series (plus there are all these game references in the campaign). Gameplay:The enemies tend to repeat themselves and throughout the campaign you typically be using the same spells over again. What most people don’t seem to mention is the difficulty of this game. This game is not easy in any sense of the word, in fact even if you play with more people the game just gets harder. With latency issues and friendly fire can result in a very tough campaign where you will kill your friends more than your enemies. If you play the game solo it can be very difficult and with the patches and updates is even harder now than it was before. There is no mana, no leveling up, and pretty much no real loot. You may find a few weapons throughout the campaign, but they are not going to make a huge difference to how you play the campaign. I personally played the whole game with the M60, but other than that all the weapons seemed to be just as effective as the ones I start with. Useful Advice:Magicka REQUIRES a good keyboard. This keyboard preferably should be a gaming keyboard and should not be wireless (unless it’s a wireless gaming keyboard). In order to preform spells and move at the same time Magicka sometimes requires you to use more keys than you have fingers. If your keyboard cannot handle multiple key-presses then you will not be able to play this game. I would recommend playing this game with a macro-enabled keyboard/mouse in order to fully enjoy the actual campaign. In fact the game can be so difficult that even with macros you will more than likely not succeed in a mission on your first attempt. There are many spell combinations with some of them being very hard to figure out. Results:If you like bird’s eye view co-op action adventures then this could be a good choice for you. Make sure you are well equipped, ready for a hard challenge, and have some friends. This is a fun campaign, with witty dialogue, and amazing spell casting. If you have a great memory for up to eight letter combinations then you’ll be very good at this game. If I were you I’d play the game with macros, essentially that’s like putting the game from “Insane” down to “Hard Difficulty”.Pros:+Spell combinations are almost endless+Funny dialogue, hilarious references, and a great story.+Many items you can find in the game (with different bonuses and special spells)+Lots of wizards to select from with different weapons and base attributes+Offers four player co-op experience+Nice graphics and smooth visuals+Interesting boss fights which require a variety of different strategies+Puzzles and mysteries to solve within each level+Lots of DLC with new story and characters abound+Rather long campaign+NO GRINDINGCons:-Insanely difficult (especially if you solo or co-op without experts).-Spell combinations can be rather cumbersome (not a game for people who are not good with memorizing eight letter combinations).-If you are not an expert at memory you typically end up using the same spell through the entire game (rock, rock, rock, rock, rock). -I sometimes had issue with random lag in the main menu screen (nothing game-breaking, but could get infuriating sometimes).

												You are a mage that can cast spells using the various elements.  The elements can stack together to enhance your spells, and some combinations can be learned to cause special abilities, such as slow time, increase movement speed, revive a fallen teammate, summon a tornado, etc.  You can cast your magicks onto your weapon to give your weapon increased damage, cast in a circle around you to affect all characters nearby, or simply cast in front of you.Each element has something that will counter it, so not all combinations are possible.  Further, if you try to use one of these when you have an opposites status effect applied (like trying to use lightning when wet), you'll cause damage to yourself!  As an added bonus, all of your spells can also hurt your other party members, so you need to be careful not to kill your friends.I absolutely enjoyed this game.  The enemies are varied throughout each chapter and each has their own weaknesses you need to discover.  The game keeps you on your toes while allowing you to constantly learn new ways to summon magicks.  The only negative I can say about this game is that it has a terribly steep learning curve.  I played co-op with someone who had played once before and it took me several chapters before I finally understood how all the magicks worked together and could actually contribute effectively to the combat.  I enjoyed these early chapters just as much as the later chapters despite not really knowing what I was doing.Another negative about this game (that can be completely ignored) is that the gamepad controls are absolutely terrible.  Literally any other control setup would have been better than the set gamepad controls.  I prefer gamepad, but I had to play with keyboard and mouse.			"

												Magicka is a fun little game where either you or your buddies play as wizards!There are just so many combination of spells and easter eggs from across entertainment such as Star Wars and 300.The game is more fun if you play with your friends, but be warned there is no friendly fire turn off button so be careful in what spells you are casting and where you aim it at. But hey it's actually entertaining when you and your buddies are outnumbered and one of your guys accidently casts a fireball spell and takes out the wrong people.The only downside to this game is the random lag when casting a combo spell or just about any spells that requires a lot of 'tuning up' and ALSO no ""auto lock"" you have to trust your keen eyes to help you figure out if the range is right or not. Particuarly during boss fights. There is plenty of more things to do with Magicka such as the expansions, challenges, arena, the F2P game. All and all despite it's clunky ""combat"" which in time you will get better. Magicka is a fantastic game.I recommend it.			"

												In Magicka, you're a wizard. You've got eight elements that you can stack up, mix, multiply, and unleash. You can cast them at goblins, cast them at anything next to you, cast them at your specially blunted sword, cast them at your own face.Singleplayer mode is a light comic fantasy, narrated by your dodgy mentor, Vlad. The black-clad Romanian wizard keeps pointing out that he's not a vampire, and making bad puns about sinking his teeth into things. It's a mix of satire and pop culture references that'll have you smirking dangerously throughout. Lots of care has gone into the way the elements combine and contort in your spells. Combinations shape the form (Missile? Beam? Cone? Wall?) and function (Healing? Burning? Shielding? Exploding? Freezing? Drenching? Zapping?) of each glorious experiment. There's enough variety for every wizard to have his or her own favourite attack style. Mine is a steamy lightning beam that scalds you before dealing bonus lightning damage from the water element in steam.Concocting these spells is a little confusing at first, as you're commanding eight elements across eight keys, but you're rarely faced with enemies that can't be killed by particular elements. Button mashing will get you far, and a mistake might just surprise you. The environments are top-down, linear jaunts through bright and breezy fantasy tropes: forests full of goblins, orcish trenches, swamps, mines, the land of the dead. Wander off the beaten path, and you can find powerful equipment and new magic spell recipes that reach beyond the scope of your regular elemental concoctions - spells such as Revive and Teleport.Singleplayer will soon wear thin, sadly. It's not that you can't beat it with the right spells and an awful lot of goes – it's that if you make a mistake and burst like a sticky water balloon, you get chucked back to the last checkpoint you reached. In once case, that involves fighting three big groups of face-pounding orcs and one-hit-smash-to-deathing ogres, in a row, before you hit another checkpoint. If you quit before you complete that level (perhaps out of, ooh, say, frustration), you'll have to start it all over again when you boot up the game again. Ultimately, you'll hit this annoying boss or that overpowered yeti thing or this boring underworld level and you'll just give up on singleplayer. Then you'll turn to multiplayer. And multiplayer is good, when it works. If you've got a few networked computers and three eager friends with Magicka on their Steam accounts, you can enjoy the splendour of four death lasers combining neatly into a super-beam that bursts ogres in seconds. You can have tactics and gambits and laugh as they end with one wizard left, deciding if he wants your gear before he resurrects you.The bulk of us, however, will be butting our heads against the brick wall of online multiplayer. At the time of writing, developers Arrowhead have been releasing patches every 24 hours, and they're gradually improving on the terrible connectivity issues. Despite their efforts, you no sooner host a game than Steam Chat dies, Skype calls drop, and flatmates start inspecting the router for flashing lights. For a game so reliant on multiplayer to be fun, there are lots of missed opportunities. There's no chapter select function, no joining mid-session for latecomers or disconnected players, no voice chat, no dedicated servers, and tons of lengthy, wordy cutscenes that only the host can skip. Get it working, and it's great. For £8, you'll get your money's worth before everyone forgets about it. But it could have been game of the year material! Silly wizards.THE VERDICT 69/100MAGICKAConfused and buggy, but very entertaining under the right circumstances. Bring friends.			"

												I don't usually like isometric games. I feel bored too quickly because of monotony, some kind of spark in gameplay is always needed. Although such games usually have no problems with story, graphics or sound. I was genuinely surprised, starting walkthrough of this game. Original idea with a mix of elemental forces just saves gameplay and makes game much more noteworthy from the rest of games in this genre. And with sound, graphics and storyline here all good too! So many small and interesting parts lay around the player, some of them you even can't immediately notice, everything is so colorful and beautiful what made me giddy. The original storyline - emphasis here is not in pathos and heroism, but in humor, btw - there are so many Easter eggs! Voice acting is also very funny, so it completes humorous component in plot. Well-made music, which always goes well with happening on screen, doesn't bother you from your playing. And all of that was said without game with friends! In cooperative volume of butthurt and fun only increases, so buy the game, and you will get large amount of fun time :)			"

												It's Diablo without a level up system, and like Diablo, it's best played with friends.  Travel through 13 stages with 8 different schools of magic that can be combined to make a staggering number of combat strategies against enemies.  Spells and restoring friends from death costs nothing, so the challenge comes from your ability to work as a team and not screw up.  Believe me when I say though that screwing up is a LOT harder not to do than you think.  Combining magic and then deciding how to excecute it while being chased by enemies often makes you mess up your combination and worse yet, your friends can very easily be caught in the crossfire, or spells that don't mix in certain situations will cause a terrible backfire and insta-kill them.  Again, there's no cost to resurrecting your friends, but some players could become frustrated from being killed by their friends more than their enemies.  $10 is well worth a game like this, so grab your friends and see how well you work together!

												Kill things with lightning, kill things with the 7 things that aren't lightning, freeze your friends, summon rocks to shatter your friends, ignore their pleas for you to revive them!Magicka is a game with water, life, shield, cold, lightning, arcane, earth and fire. Now obviously summoning cold and water makes ice, or summoning fire and water makes steam, but you can make a life beam with water infused into it, healing and wetting your friends and making them succeptable to zapping them with special abilities like steam, lightning, arcane, lightning to do 15,000 damage!Now, this isn't just a game where you can kill your friends - there's a story where everyone speaks all bouncy and you can kill all the NPCs with crazy combos that do varying amounts of damage and it's kind of tricky to get them right. But that's for singleplayer; if you have friends you will literally want to kill them, kill them and then feel better.Ruin everything - Magicka.			"

												I don't usually like isometric games. I feel bored too quickly because of monotony, some kind of spark in gameplay is always needed. Although such games usually have no problems with story, graphics or sound. I was genuinely surprised, starting walkthrough of this game. Original idea with a mix of elemental forces just saves gameplay and makes game much more noteworthy from the rest of games in this genre. And with sound, graphics and storyline here all good too! So many small and interesting parts lay around the player, some of them you even can't immediately notice, everything is so colorful and beautiful what made me giddy. The original storyline - emphasis here is not in pathos and heroism, but in humor, btw - there are so many Easter eggs! Voice acting is also very funny, so it completes humorous component in plot. Well-made music, which always goes well with happening on screen, doesn't bother you from your playing. And all of that was said without game with friends! In cooperative volume of butthurt and fun only increases, so buy the game, and you will get large amount of fun time :)			"

												If you don't want spoliers please stop reading now!**SPOILERS**Magicka is a world where all its inhabitants have been cursed with autism and speak moon talk. You set off on an adventure to cure theses gentle creatures from their crippling autism by finding the Rusty Trumpet of Anubis. Once finding the trumpet and defeating the evil grugalar in an epic battle, you reach down to his defeated body and grab the trumpet he has hidden on his body and play a tune until the evil demon within grugalar comes out and grugalar shouts in pain and passes out. I found the story a little complicated for such a simple game, but was interesting to say the least! :)TL;DRI liked it :)			"

												Magicka is Hilariously Frustrating! The dialogue and humor in this game give you a lot of motivation to continue with the story, and it is filled with countless references to other games, movies, and even some internet memes as well. Combining spells is hilarious, especially when you use your friends as test subjects! CO-OP with your Friends is really Recommended in this Game as if it will bring Wonderful Chaotic affair chalk full of mistaken explosions, accidental blowing off your friends in the Cliff, earth-shattering combo tragic AND general mischief and mayhem surround a deceptively deep game.

												Magicka is an extremely fresh take on a very tired genre. The top-down Action RPG. It replaces the standard combat with one of the most innovative spell casting system I've ever seen in a game. Eight different elements that can be combined and used in a myriad of logical and easy to understand ways. Firing lightning at your enemies is more effective if you dose them with water first, combining cold and water makes you shoot ice shards and so on. It is easy to learn and easy to use even if some of the higher tier spells require a bit of practice.The graphics are simple but functional and the sound is somewhat lacking, the characters speaking some perverted form of Finnish mixed in with a good deal of gibberish.The storyline and characters are as random as it gets and the entire game is filled to the rim with old pop culture references. A little fun but not much, this is a game that should be played for the gameplay and nothing else.A great buy, especially with friends.			"

Bem, isso é Magicka.

												Decent amount of story content, fun versus and survival modes, and you can co-op through the whole story without any problems. You can even kill your allies in hilarious ways. Or play normally and help them. Look, it's fun. You combine elements into spells on the fly, and unlock various ""specially activated"" spells as well as you go which allow for interesting effects that the combinations alone might not do (such as making a rain of fire come crashing down only to desperately throw up a dome shield around you to survive).

												A very funny and charming game that’s fun to play in both coop and solo. The game is much harder solo because of the amount of enemies they throw at you and i was not able to beat the game without looking up what the best spells were. They balance the difficulty in coop by having friendly fire so you will be accidently killing your friends constantly when experimenting with different spells.

Posted: June 13, 2015
												I would like to give this game a good review because it can be a lot of fun.  Unfortunately there are far too many problems with this game for me to recommend a purchase.  The multiplayer is very strange.  There are often connection issues, and glitches during multiplayer.  I had to start at least half of the the levels over due to glithes.  This wouldn't be such a big problem if the game was balanced for singe player, but the game doesn't seem to scale in difficulty whether you are playing with one or four players.  I found some sections of the game almost unplayable because I couldn't connect with a friend in multiplayer and the enemies were so numerous the only way I could win was by cheesing the enemies and trying to glitch out their AI. The second problem is that the game is horribly balanced.  I can go through a level and kill everything no problem and then get to a group of regular enemies that one shot me no matter what.  Then I'll get to the boss and kill him in like 2 hits.  It's very strange.  The levels don't seem to get harder other then just throwing more enemies at you.  The third problem I had is that the game runs very choppily even on high end machines.  The graphics are not very good, but my computer and all of my friends comptuers will run this game very very slowly at times.  Even if the framrate is quite high, it will take quite a while for the game to catch up to my input.  The game is quite interesting, and the spells work great and look cool.  I really liked some of the time I spent playing this game, but frustration with the glitches and performance and balancing issues made this game almost unplayable.  I will be looking at magicka 2 to see if these issues were addressed, because the idea is there, the technical side just needs to catch up.			"

												Magicka is an absolute-fun game, made as well for solo player or coop, despiteI'd tell you to go with just 1 friend (or 2) to avoid making game too easy. Magicka takes all the RPG cliches and uses them as it satirizes all of them at once, which is  (somehow) one of the strongest point in the storyline.The growing up system is another strong point; instead of getting more hp or atack or♥♥♥♥♥♥ you'll just learn new magicks, which are just special combinations of your elements, and you'lll become faster at memorizing and using them.  You'll have to solve all your adventure with ""only"" your 8 elements, their possible combos and the way you cast them, which will make the diference between a vulcano crater, a burning sword or a burning stone armor. Anyways, this game uses simple concepts and turns them agains themselves. It's a mastercraft  with charismatic characters, funny dialogues, a decent plot and tons of friendly fire.It has just 2 bad points: First of all, it has good days whenever everything works fine, and bad days, with many crashes and/or bugs. On the other hand, there is something horrible: it has HUNDRED OF DLCs!!!! So despite many of them are just run&andkill games (and are not worth paying), you can still have MOAR MAGICKA, MOAR FUN AND MOAR ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥-HIENA LAUGH WITH YOUR BUDYS.			"

												This game is actually some of the most fun I've ever had, logical spell system with tons of versatility and combinations, you combine elements and can then cast them on yourself, as an AOE or directly, you can also store the ""spell"" in your weapon which will then be activated next time you use it to strike. This game is fun with friends and alone, especially given how easy it is to hit your friends with a bit of ""friendly"" fire... and or accidentally kill yourself. There are also a few special spells that can be learned via items found, these spells require the combination and are then executed with a button press. Such as reviving one of your friends who you probably just blew up a moment ago...I think it's got lots of replay value, the story is cute and funny with tons of references to the genre. The game is in and of itself a bit of a parody. I personally don't have any issues or criticisms of the game, it's not perfect, but the quirks are all part of its charm.  I would recommend it to anyone that has a sense of humour, especially if you have some knowledge about other games in similar genres. It's especially fun with a group of friends (up to 4) but is still very entertaining on your own. I personally found it pretty additive.  "

												This game is my favourite representation of a magic system. In a lot of movies and games the characters mention that magic is ""dangerous"" and can be harmful to yourself and others. This is THE GAME that represents the dangers of magic. The amount of times I've killed myself using lightning while being wet or summoning a boulder to crush me where I stand are numerous. The balance of simplicity of no levelling, only slight spell unlocks or item pickups and the complexity of having to mix and remember each spell is great. This game is most fun playing in coop which is also a lot easier than trying to overcome the bosses alone. Also great for LANs!			"

												This game is lovely, has a suprising amount of good humor, and is quite fun to play as single player. Unfortunately, the multiplayer is not quite as sound. There appears to be a glitch where a character will get stuck in place, as in the player can turn in circles but cannot move forward, nor cast magick. I haven't been able to find a fix for this, which is unfortunate, since we made it many levels in before this problem occurred, and were thoroughly enjoying it. Haven't heard of too many cases of this occurring though, and it is definitely worth playing.			"

While the vanilla Magicka experience is a blast, the developpers have released a plethora of additional content for both multiplayer oriented gamers and solo players alike. Everything from Vietnam inspired online massacre to an entire campaign provided from the villains perspective, Magicka successfully wraps up its lore and wit in a beautiful and responsive package that will keep you entertained for hours.

												Can you become a Master of Spell casting and Sorcery? #moneyworth.The answer is, Of course you can! If you don't spam sheilds all the time. Anyway to the main point, is this game worth your every penny. Answer depands on the penny. Magicka feels somewhere inbetween a silly and retardness, in a good way. Most of the Dialog are spoke it mix Gibburish, Vald is your narrator throught out the story, and you will play the game twice with alternate pathing.Good things.Enjoyable TK rate 100%), very unique mix of MOBA with heavy emphasis on Macro for spell casting. Comedy Story tellings, Easter Eggs and much more.Bad thingsI lost my save file 3 times :P, buggy co-op during long sessions around 1 hour, Recommand starting a new lobby after each chapter.QFASA :) best spell outdorrs (TK RATE 1000%)QSER :) best indoor spell (TK RATE (1000000000000000 %)			"

												This game is HILARIOUS and awesome. It's most fun when played with friends. You'll be telling stories about various sessions of this one!! It can take some time to learn the spells but once you do, you can mash them like a pro. One of the other things I really like about this game is all the easter eggs and little details you can find if you're patient and take the time to look. It has all the battle and adrenaline for people who like that too, though. So it's great!			"

												A very fun game, especially playing with friends. It presents a huge possibility of spell combinations that gives a great diversity to the players to pass for some area or fight a boss, so does not become repetitive. Also, it is filled with a lot of references to movies and other games, what makes it be very humorous and satirical.			"

												This game is absolutely hilarious, and loaded with references all over the place. The variety of weapons and hidden items in the base version of the game is great, but the DLC gives a lot of extra options to make the game even more interesting. The spells are really creative, but usually make actual sense. The real selling point of the game, however, is the co-op experience. It's ridiculously fun, with tons of ways to work together, sometimes resulting in accidental explosions of your friends!9/10			"

Check out the videoon the Magicka game page. It's pretty fun :DParadox is celebreating Magicka's 2 year Anniversary this weekend. As such, it's a Free-to-Play weekend (Jan. 18 - 20, 2012).

												This game will change the way your friends think of you. If you have a friend that is serious about playing this game, and you are NOT like-minded, s/he will hate you forever. One of the best magicks in the game(in my opinion), thunder bolt, is prone to freak accidents. Example, you and your friend are traveling and see an orge. Naturally, you cast thunder bolt, but instead of hitting the ogre, it hits your friend. This will happen over and over and over. So, this game can, has, and WILL ruin some friendships. But overall the gameplay is smooth, it's challenging, and more fun with more people.                                                                                    You've been warned.P.S.

												The first thing that I noticed about the game was it's sense of humor.It doesn't take itself seriously and it's great!The storyline is packed with jokes and has a humorous plot-line.One of the only things that I didn't like about the game were the controls.They felt clunky and unresponsive at times.It's nothing major but I feel like they could have done a better job.Also some levels felt badly scripted and had a decent amount of bugs or graphic glitches.Magicka offers you a great deal of spell combination,a lot of customization and tons of enemies to kill! I feel like Magicka has too many DLCs but the game itself has a lot of content already.As a singleplayer game...it's kinda boring after awhile.It's the Multiplayer aspect of it that makes it a great game.It is a okey-ish experience as a singleplayer game but I really feel that it was built as a multiplayer.Magicka is a fun experience either way and you should at least try the base game.

												Magicka is a game where you are a wizard, trying to conjure spells using elements. The catch is that multiple combinations yield multiple spells, most of which will severely injure yourself and your teammates. The goodYou are given from start, after a quick tutorial on the basics, all the elements. This allows you to beat the game with anything.Combining elements is the key factor of the game, where you can cast a stone armor to protect yourself and lay healing mines for your teammate who crushes enemies using a steam-electric-arcane beam. Without a mana or cooldown system.there are some hidden goodies to look for, some only for the sake of it, like the mooses, or magicks, a spell that has to be entered in the right order.Magicks are unlockable combinations that are far more powerful and/or unique than your normal spells. From slowing time to freezing the entire screen, or as simple as a teleport of flammable oil. They serve the purpose of progression, and one is even a plot point of the game.The game is also a living pile of references, ranging to movies to games. If you like to see that kind of stuff, it's plenty in this game.The badThe plot is simple: Your goal is to defeat the main wizard baddie. No heavy plot twists or anything.The game is also filled with bugs, bust most of them are fixed within seconds. Gamebreaking bugs can be fixed with an easy restart, which will take you a few screens back. The netcode tend to be laggy for the clients, even with low ping.Most player characters are DLC, but most of them are simple reskins with no unbalanced stats. Some extra content are also DLC-only. The ugly  Sometimes the physics are wonky, with the knockback being powerful enough to knock your wizard several meters in the air. You can even reach spots you weren't meant to this way.Friendly-fire is also a key factor in the game, which can get problematic in certain situations, such as in tight spaces or a miscast. Hilarity can ensue if the wonky physics kick in.There may or may not be some plot holes around. Not that relevant, since the plot is already an excuse to cast stuff around.Some bosses can be one-shotted. While some can provide a worthwhile fight, some can be downed in seconds. However, one-shotting a boss requires some skill (and luck), and can be satisfying if you did it right.NutshellGrab this game if you got the coin and friends to play with. I still haven't played through all the chapters and DLC-content, but the fun-factor I had playing with my friend is undeniable. Yes, there will be rage over that single miscast, yes, there will be random deathmatches when someone's♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and yes, there will be fooling around whenever there's the chance to. And bugs. And that's it's charm. There's no problem with those, since players can be revived in a matter of seconds. The fun from this game came from laughing about failures of each other and the good times you spent with them, and when seriousness kicks in when a horde of NPCS appear and you enter a tactical approach to them. If you just care about goofing with your friends in a co-op game, Magicka is there.			"

The very few matches i have played in the multiplayer were amazing though...if only more people would be interested in the PVP section of this game it would have been a much better experience. The casting system is great and its something fresh and unique compared to other games. You can enchant your weapon , create walls, create a magickal barrier around you, create an armor for your body with the power of earth or just use the same combinations with a few changes to simply send massive fiery earth rocks to your opponents (thats my fav). If you get tired of the campaign or you finish it and want more...there are loads of dlcs you can buy :)			"

												This is, hands down, the single most hilarious multiplayer experience you will ever have in your life. You can murder your friends horribly (whether you want to or not)! You can help your friends (you will still murder them horribly whether you want to or not)!You have access to 8 magic elements and combine them, on the fly, into various combinations and then let your spells fly... this usually has unpredictable and horrible results. On top of the various combinations of 8 elements you can then cast the spell on yourself, as an AOE, or on others... ya know, just because there wasn't enough variety to begin with. You'll quickly find a handful that work and, as you play more and more, grow comfortable and branch out to become more skilled in your ability to accidentally screw your friends over utterly. Lucky for you it's consequence free and revive takes mere seconds so it's all taken in stride and good humor.If you're looking for a ridiculous, over the top, ""accidentally massacre everyone you hold dear"" gaming experience then I'd highly recommend it. Don't forget, the safeword is BANANA!			"

No heavy plot twists or anything.The game is also filled with bugs, bust most of them are fixed within seconds. Gamebreaking bugs can be fixed with an easy restart, which will take you a few screens back. The netcode tend to be laggy for the clients, even with low ping.Most player characters are DLC, but most of them are simple reskins with no unbalanced stats. Some extra content are also DLC-only. The ugly  Sometimes the physics are wonky, with the knockback being powerful enough to knock your wizard several meters in the air. You can even reach spots you weren't meant to this way.Friendly-fire is also a key factor in the game, which can get problematic in certain situations, such as in tight spaces or a miscast. Hilarity can ensue if the wonky physics kick in.There may or may not be some plot holes around. Not that relevant, since the plot is already an excuse to cast stuff around.Some bosses can be one-shotted. While some can provide a worthwhile fight, some can be downed in seconds. However, one-shotting a boss requires some skill (and luck), and can be satisfying if you did it right.NutshellGrab this game if you got the coin and friends to play with. I still haven't played through all the chapters and DLC-content, but the fun-factor I had playing with my friend is undeniable. Yes, there will be rage over that single miscast, yes, there will be random deathmatches when someone's♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and yes, there will be fooling around whenever there's the chance to. And bugs. And that's it's charm. There's no problem with those, since players can be revived in a matter of seconds. The fun from this game came from laughing about failures of each other and the good times you spent with them, and when seriousness kicks in when a horde of NPCS appear and you enter a tactical approach to them. If you just care about goofing with your friends in a co-op game, Magicka is there.			"

												Played co-op with a friend. Saved a village. They gave us an M60 that he instantly fell in love with. He then proceeded to slaughter the entire village. I killed him and stepped into the wagon leading to the next area and we never saw the M60 again. His tears were delicious.Hilarious/10 would recommendCo-op definitely is the way to go though.			"

												Very, very fun!Took my sister and I about 8 hours to finish the campaign, though we were taking our time and ended up restarting a lot when one of us lost our favorite weapon.Best part of this game is that you can have up to 4 players playing on ONE computer! Of course, you need 4 joysticks/keyboards+mice for each player.It has a lot of spell diversification, and an online co-op and survival gametypes. The one thing that could make it better would be either a Versus multiplayer game mode, or an unlimited wave survival game mode (right now, there's only 20 waves of enemies).			"

												You are a wizard, a damn powerful, idiotic wizard whose given the command of eight elements to combine in any order of your imagination. It will most likely work, but like an idiot's imagination, it will hurt and kill you. This game is simply amazing, it's more than worth the ""I may aswell try it"" that can be thrown at a lot of games. Starting off with a small/short tutorial to unlock your magic or 'elements' (of which you can skip if you wish), you'll be thrown into the harsh and dangerous world filled with carboard cutouts of sheep, non-vampires and ever-trusting villagers in order to... Well, save it. (No spoilers!)But gameplay wise, it is diffcult to get used to. The vast combinations of spells pared with the movement and aiming could be the only thing to put someone off. Then again, give it time and you may find yourself loving the ongoing humor behind every unlocked door, the music which helps set the atmosphere like any great fantasy game and the endless comical refferences that just adds to the ""Ha! I know that one"" that reels you in.Multiplayer wise, because you CAN play with 3 other people within the storymode, versus and challenge mode. Yes, you may have connection issuse or lag issues, that's a downside. But! If you should find yourself with your (soon to be ex)friends starting off a story... It may take you longer than you think. This may be the only game that gets harder the more people you have, soley because you end up killing each other on purpose. Truth be told, you can have a lot of laughs without commiting to actually completing this game, to which it only makes it more exciting if you choose to.For anyone whose played a classic console game and thought ""Wow, I wished they made games like this again."" Then Magicka is for you. The elements of a classic are certainly there. For me personaly, it's just a game I feel I want to come back to time and time again 'just because'.			"

												A game that will test the deepest limits of your patience, this tale, in no way similar to any sci-fi classic, gives an old concept a new face. Combine the powers of the elemets to create deadly spells and watch your enemies explode in a bloody mess. The so classic ""♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t moments"" that this game has (a lot of them, a whole lot) makes it so it depends more on your patience than your skill to survive.All in all, after a few rage quits, you will learn how to master the best spells and you will have a lotta fun, specially if you're playing with friends.Good indie game, I give it a 3.5/5.

You can even kill your allies in hilarious ways. Or play normally and help them. Look, it's fun. You combine elements into spells on the fly, and unlock various ""specially activated"" spells as well as you go which allow for interesting effects that the combinations alone might not do (such as making a rain of fire come crashing down only to desperately throw up a dome shield around you to survive).Buy it.

												Magicka is a mostly cooperative (friendly fire is on) game about combining elements to create magic spells. It supports up to 4 player multiplayer with a adventure, challenge, and versus mode. The way the magic spells work is you have 6 slots to put elements in, and whatever combination you put in is mixed to create a unique spell. There are literally unlimited spell combinations, so there's tons of diversity. There's also books scattered around where you can find these things called Magicks, these are pre-set spells that do special things (some notable ones are summons, vortex, rain/thunderstorm/blizzard, ect). There are also many robes you can select aswell, they have special perks and downsides that make them unique from eachother (like immunity/weakness to some elements). The campaign could last you a good 4-5 hours with added DLC campaigns as well to add on to it. There are A LOT of DLC for this game, mostly PVP maps and robes, these are NOT needed and you should only get them if you feel like you would like those robes/maps or want to support the developer but the campaign DLCs are a must have in my opinion. People say this game is a buggy mess, and it is, but the glitches you may encounter are actually entertaining. The developer have worked hard and patched out most of the game ruining ones, so there's not much to worry about. Get this game, it's worth your money if you have friends to play it with.			"

Intro: This is a game that really benefited from having a demo. I enjoyed it so much while trying it out that I stopped and purchased it.The game can be fun alone, but I highly really recommend multiplayer for this one. Host your own room and play through the story while people drop in and out. If you have a few gamepads and friends you can also play locally on the same PC. Its a ton of fun either way.Gameplay: Magicka's gameplay is pretty entertaining. It has a neat magic system with lots of possibilities and a bunch of weapons you can come across. Loads of different characters. A bunch of game modes. A few different campaigns, some mini-campaigns, pvp arenas, and survival maps. Every mode is great fun to play and there's really a ton of content here. Just playing random multiplayer games can be a blast.Music & Visuals: The music was fitting, but nothing too memorial. The production was good nonetheless. I liked the artstyle. It was pretty and you can turn the gore off if that bothers you or if someone younger is going to play with you. Looks pretty nice overall.Story: The story was solid. Each campaign has its own. Its not really anything special, but its something there and gives you a goal.PC Version: Game runs pretty fine for the most part.I remember extremely high pings would cause multiplayer to crash. This may have been fixed as it was many years back, but as long as everyone was under 200ms then I didn't run into problems. Gamepads work fine with the game, though kb+m is a bit easier.One thing that some may not like - Magicka is one of those games with way too much DLC, but there's still a lot in the default game. Your best bet is buying the full bundle though during a large discount in a sale. I know some people can't stand loads of DLC, but it actually adds quite a lot without being too pricey.Conclusion: Overall its a fun game to play and has a lot of replay value. Go for it, especially if you have some friends to play with. My hours on the game are somewhat low, but its definitely something I'd play again if any of my friends were ever interested.			"

												This game lets you play as a wizard and combine elements to create spells! There are dozens of possible combinations and maybe 3 good ones that you're going to spam throughout the whole game. The writing is also spectacular, including classic internet jokes that stopped being funny years before the game's release.			"

												I really wanted to like this game, and I have spent several hours with it, but it was not a good game at all. Sure, spells are fun to cast here and there, but using the keyboard in such a manner, trying to remember what it seems hundreds of spells in the blink of an eye, is no where possible, which means you end up using a few spells that you can remember over and over again.This ruins the intent of the spells, because you can't type ""FQFQAAS"" or ""DQDQDQRUPYOURRSE"" when the game is constantly spamming you with foe. ""Good players"" will tell you to change your tactic, but doing some missions over and over again just to face another death one second close to victory, just takes away your mood entirely. Some missions you can't even complete without buying a better robe. So, the tactic here is: ""Buy an upgrade"" to advance. Real smooth.There is only one difficult setting which is ""hard"" or ""insane"", whatever you prefer, and the real challenge is starting over and over again without throwing your keyboard out the window.This is clearly not a single player game, but finding matches and people to play with is just a hassle and didn't work for me.+ The humor.+ The graphics.- The whole spellcasting system.- The unbalanced gameplay.- One difficulty setting.- The hidden ""BTW"" - agenda.

I recommend the 'Tentacle Robe'!Campaigns+MultiplayerReceive a huge chunk of rock to the face from your friend.Receive a 9999 thunder damage from a friendReceive pretty much every fatal spell in the game and still have fun.Bad-Latency issues-Multiplayer Camera - You will all share a single camera and you'll die if you are left behind.

												While teamwork may take a backseat in magicka, it's where the gameplay really shines. Just try to work with your friends, try to get four players with massive area affecting spells to keep from killing one another. With the list of different elements to combine, you've got virtually limitless potential to make your own spells, many weapons throughout the world, and even multiple robes that affect your gameplay statistics. Magicka is a wonderfully simple-yet-complex adventure game that's great fun to play with your pals.7.5/10			"

												It's rare to come across a co-op game that involves killing your team just as much as it does killing your enemies. Embracing 8 elements of magic, use your wits and your keyboard to cast powerful spells and brilliant magics. Utilise special combinations of elements to take down your enemies (and your friends). Planning strategies together is just as much of a blast as going against them, in either a campaign of magical destruction, or one of the many challenge rooms available to play. Especially with the amount of DLC available, Magicka is a nearly endless array of fun and hedonism. Truly a clever and hilarious game. Play alone only as a last resort!			"

												This game is aload of fun to play most because of its creative system for spellcasting.  It offers much variety and you can tinker with how you cast spells since there is no defined limit to how you can cast and use them allowing you to be creative in how you adapt to the situation.  The multiplayer aspect is in no way forced so you can enjoy the game either solo or with friends.  It also has some worthwhile dlc that adds a tremendous amount of content, but you can still enjoy it if a friend has it and hosts a game and you dont so as to not limit your experience			"

												I bought Magicka on sale long after its original release, so my recommendation is based on those two qualifications that differ greatly from major publication reviews. I found the game to be (mostly) bug-free and quite enjoyable, with the only serious issue being multiplayer is absolutely lacking players and those that do play tend to have agonizingly high ping (European and South American players maybe!?). The single player is a good experience and worth the price of entry, yet entirely too short. Note that ALL of the DLC is for multiplayer, which is basically unpopulated. Shame really. One thumb up, two if there were more people playing multiplayer.A month later, and I'm still playing this game almost obsessively. The reason: Challenges. SINGLE PLAYER challenges, because multiplayer is still as crappy as it has ever been - i.e. non-existant. Most players / servers have +300 ping and quit all the time. This game needs drop-in play like Mario needs a jump button, but it doesn't have it. The combination of spells and enemies makes the single-player challenges a worthwhile time-waster, so I keep playing. If only the makers would fix multiplayer, this game would be a 10/10 indie game. Otherwise, even as cheap as it is right now (75% off on Steam), it's still only one thumb up and one way, way down. Single player only for the time being, even during the free-to-play weekend.			"

												A great magic-spell game where you can create over 100 spells by combining elements to your liking. It's great because there is LOTS of DLC to collect, and there is some amazing spells that can be created from combinations. It is also somewhat a shooter, since most spells are like shooting, and it's a display from the top of the characters so it seems like the camera view is from up in the sky.

The whole game is well-designed.The magic system is pretty smart, and there's a lot of customization to suit every playstyle.Worth it.------------------------Se você procura algo divertido para jogar com os amigos, então esse é seu jogo.O Coop dele é muito massa, o estilo de narrativa é bem leve e engraçado, e o gameplay é bem intuitivo (facilita se você tiver um controle).E é claro, tem também os magos tradicionais de RPG carregando rifles de assalto '-'O visual não é do tipo, ""OMG!

Aliás, o jogo todo é bem desenhado.O sistema de magias dele é bem inteligente, e permite várias combinações diferentes, atendendo à todos os estilos de jogos.Valeu cada centavo. "

												It's rare to come across a co-op game that involves killing your team just as much as it does killing your enemies. Embracing 8 elements of magic, use your wits and your keyboard to cast powerful spells and brilliant magics. Utilise special combinations of elements to take down your enemies (and your friends). Planning strategies together is just as much of a blast as going against them, in either a campaign of magical destruction, or one of the many challenge rooms available to play. Especially with the amount of DLC available, Magicka is a nearly endless array of fun and hedonism. Truly a clever and hilarious game. Play alone only as a last resort!			"

												While teamwork may take a backseat in magicka, it's where the gameplay really shines. Just try to work with your friends, try to get four players with massive area affecting spells to keep from killing one another. With the list of different elements to combine, you've got virtually limitless potential to make your own spells, many weapons throughout the world, and even multiple robes that affect your gameplay statistics. Magicka is a wonderfully simple-yet-complex adventure game that's great fun to play with your pals.7.5/10			"

												Ever wanted to be a wizard? Agreed, lets become wizards. But for now let me tell you about this game about wizards. In Magicka you play a wizard. You can play with up to but not including 4 of your friends, who will also be wizards whilst you are a wizard. This is because the game only allows a total of 4 wizards on the screen at any point. This programming restriction is one of the least serious flaws this with game, and that's saying something. Wizard. The game suffers from a lack of control, gratiuitous amounts of bugs, and non-wizard characters. The problem is that Magicka plays like a weak beat-em up. Wizards run around and beat up non-player non-wizard non-characters, eg: wizard. but instead of fast pased action filled wizard baised action baised fast pased wizard wizard combat, we get something less. The fast placed action does not suit well to the 'plan carefully your wizard rainbow beam +1' style of gameplay. In a word, Not my tea of cup. Wizard.			"

												Welcome to the Wacky and epic world of Magicka, All I have to say is, how could any kid who grew up in the eighties or around DnD,monty python, and various other comedy and nerd references not love this freaking game...you have nutty mages to control, it says local coop with split/shared screen, just noticed that gonna check that out with my kiddo for sure.Keep in mind I've logged several hours into this title offline so my online record does not reflect actual time spent. Pros--Awesome spell conjuration system ""Mix and match, power up and merge many spells for devastating hybrid power and buffs beyond buffs""-Great graphics ""they really have a solid feel-Great controls ""keep note I have only ever used a mouse and keyboard they can be somewhat confusing at first""Cons-Game may be too challenging at points due to the time in which you have to react with mixing a spell together with your controller or qwerty configuration.-No actual dialog in english, I am assuming they are speaking in an eastern european langauge like finny-Some of the robes just plain suck.

												I bought Magicka on sale long after its original release, so my recommendation is based on those two qualifications that differ greatly from major publication reviews. I found the game to be (mostly) bug-free and quite enjoyable, with the only serious issue being multiplayer is absolutely lacking players and those that do play tend to have agonizingly high ping (European and South American players maybe!?). The single player is a good experience and worth the price of entry, yet entirely too short. Note that ALL of the DLC is for multiplayer, which is basically unpopulated. Shame really. One thumb up, two if there were more people playing multiplayer.A month later, and I'm still playing this game almost obsessively. The reason: Challenges. SINGLE PLAYER challenges, because multiplayer is still as crappy as it has ever been - i.e. non-existant. Most players / servers have +300 ping and quit all the time. This game needs drop-in play like Mario needs a jump button, but it doesn't have it. The combination of spells and enemies makes the single-player challenges a worthwhile time-waster, so I keep playing. If only the makers would fix multiplayer, this game would be a 10/10 indie game. Otherwise, even as cheap as it is right now (75% off on Steam), it's still only one thumb up and one way, way down. Single player only for the time being, even during the free-to-play weekend.			"

												A great magic-spell game where you can create over 100 spells by combining elements to your liking. It's great because there is LOTS of DLC to collect, and there is some amazing spells that can be created from combinations. It is also somewhat a shooter, since most spells are like shooting, and it's a display from the top of the characters so it seems like the camera view is from up in the sky. Great game, medium rated graphics.			"

												Ein geniales Spiel. Lustig und spannend. In dem Spiel werden so einige andere Spiele richtig gut parodiert und auch Filme bleiben nicht verschont. Die zahlreichen DLC´s bringen noch mehr Abwechslung in das Spiel, so das einem auch nicht so schnell langweilig wird. Alleine ist das Spiel teilweise ziemlich schwer aber Magicka lässt sich ja auch über Internet in einer Gruppe spielen. Ein richtig tolles Spiel das man eigentlich nur empfehlen kann.			"

												Some very silly and referential humour makes this game what it is- which is a good thing, because it can be quite frustrating gameplay-wise. Still a little buggy after what I hear was a bugtastic release, the spell combos can be hard to get right, especially in the heat of combat when you're trying not to get punted off a cliff or keep an eye on which debuffs your wizard has, indicated only by graphical effects on his person, and it's far too easy to get stuck in chat mode and realise, after several frantic attempts, that you're just typing AFAFAFACSCSWWWW into the chat bar.Still, like I said, the humour is fantastic, and if you can get the hang of the spell-casting then there's a world of depth awaiting you.

												Majicka is a game about questions, do you want to set this on fire? Do you want to slap a goblin with an enchanted ice sword as large as a baby skyscraper? Do you want to melt your friend's face, revive him, and melt his face again? These are just a small sampling of soulful questions that Majicka will pose to you, but perhaps you are a busy man with no time for trivia. Majicka can also make full-fledged statements. Ensconcing enemies in ice and flinging a rock at their vulnerable frozen forms will make it Wizard Christmas. Wizard Christmas is just like regular Christmas except Wizard Christmas snow is sometimes red and the only suitable present for a wizard is cheese. So if you enjoy seeing your enemies driven before you with weeping and gnashing of teeth do not buy this game.On the other hand if you enjoy helping a friend blow up a golem before using your mighty powers, derived from the deepest depths of Arcana to gently push him off a ledge while cackling madly, then buy this game, and buy a copy for your friend. Then find a new friend once he swears eternal vengeance upon you.			"

Gather up your friends with a four pack and try to not brutally slaughter eachother by misstake or unless that is what you want in an insane PvP match of the ultimate Wizardy. This game is enjoyable with a lot of comical aspects with twists, humor and a storyline which refers to a lot of great stories.

												Magicka is a very unique, challenging, hilariously difficult, and immensely rewarding experience. The campaign is nigh impossible to complete solo (took me at least 20 hours, and it's not that long of a campaign), which gives it a ton of replay value. Each level is honestly very short, yet you can somehow waste hours at a time trying to pass a single encounter. You could bring in friends, but then you run the risk of friendly fire, which is always on. There's always that one guy in every party that insists on casting Metor Shower at the worst times, or only uses Lightning magic or fires beams indiscriminately and gets you blown up. But all of this chaos is part of the game's charm. It's satisfying to sit back and take a deep breath after a terrifying boss encounter. Give it a few hours, and ""Level complete"" will be the two most comforting words you'll ever here.And then there's the humor, which is absolutely spot-on. A little bit Monty Python, a little bit Tenacious D, a little bit silly, and very funny. From the ridiculous voices (""Suprender!!!"") to the insistence that Vlad is ""Not a vampire"", the light tone of the game clashes perfectly with the massacre that occurs about every thirty seconds. One moment, a goblin is taunting you, the next, you've overloaded him with Arcane magic, causing him to explode in a fantastic bloody mess.Basically, this game is perfect... well, minus the bugs, but those are infrequent enough to ignore. Plus, they're usually pretty funny.Overall, 5/5, 10/10, would play again and again and again.			"

												Welcome to the Wacky and epic world of Magicka, All I have to say is, how could any kid who grew up in the eighties or around DnD,monty python, and various other comedy and nerd references not love this freaking game...you have nutty mages to control, it says local coop with split/shared screen, just noticed that gonna check that out with my kiddo for sure.Keep in mind I've logged several hours into this title offline so my online record does not reflect actual time spent. Pros--Awesome spell conjuration system ""Mix and match, power up and merge many spells for devastating hybrid power and buffs beyond buffs""-Great graphics ""they really have a solid feel-Great controls ""keep note I have only ever used a mouse and keyboard they can be somewhat confusing at first""Cons-Game may be too challenging at points due to the time in which you have to react with mixing a spell together with your controller or qwerty configuration.-No actual dialog in english, I am assuming they are speaking in an eastern european langauge like finny-Some of the robes just plain suck.

												Magicka is a very unique, challenging, hilariously difficult, and immensely rewarding experience. The campaign is nigh impossible to complete solo (took me at least 20 hours, and it's not that long of a campaign), which gives it a ton of replay value. Each level is honestly very short, yet you can somehow waste hours at a time trying to pass a single encounter. You could bring in friends, but then you run the risk of friendly fire, which is always on. There's always that one guy in every party that insists on casting Metor Shower at the worst times, or only uses Lightning magic or fires beams indiscriminately and gets you blown up. But all of this chaos is part of the game's charm. It's satisfying to sit back and take a deep breath after a terrifying boss encounter. Give it a few hours, and ""Level complete"" will be the two most comforting words you'll ever here.And then there's the humor, which is absolutely spot-on. A little bit Monty Python, a little bit Tenacious D, a little bit silly, and very funny. From the ridiculous voices (""Suprender!!!"") to the insistence that Vlad is ""Not a vampire"", the light tone of the game clashes perfectly with the massacre that occurs about every thirty seconds.

There's plenty of genuine writing that's not just references to funnier things.It's a very funny game. The magic system is really cool, and incredibly complex. Tons of secrets. More than a few references to Discworld.Don't play multiplayer, by the way. It's like Mario Party, it will ruin your relationships.			"

The spell creation system is pretty awesome, since you're not confined to specific spells but can create new ones quickly depending on the situation. The game on it's own is also very funny, with all of the 'accidental' deaths/kills and the wierd swedish/english/gibberish dialogue. Definitely would recommend to anyone, especially if it's on sale.			"

												Looking for something fun to play with your friends? This is the right choice.The coop mode is uber fun, and the storytelling is light and funny., and its gameplay is pretty intuitive (works best if you have a controller). And of course, there's also mages wearing long RPG-like robes weilding assault rifles '-'The graphics, althought not like""OMG! It's better than GTA V!"", is pretty cute. The whole game is well-designed.The magic system is pretty smart, and there's a lot of customization to suit every playstyle.Worth it.------------------------Se você procura algo divertido para jogar com os amigos, então esse é seu jogo.O Coop dele é muito massa, o estilo de narrativa é bem leve e engraçado, e o gameplay é bem intuitivo (facilita se você tiver um controle).E é claro, tem também os magos tradicionais de RPG carregando rifles de assalto '-'O visual não é do tipo, ""OMG! Melhor que GTA V!"", mas é bem bonitinho. Aliás, o jogo todo é bem desenhado.O sistema de magias dele é bem inteligente, e permite várias combinações diferentes, atendendo à todos os estilos de jogos.Valeu cada centavo. "

												While teamwork may take a backseat in magicka, it's where the gameplay really shines. Just try to work with your friends, try to get four players with massive area affecting spells to keep from killing one another. With the list of different elements to combine, you've got virtually limitless potential to make your own spells, many weapons throughout the world, and even multiple robes that affect your gameplay statistics. Magicka is a wonderfully simple-yet-complex adventure game that's great fun to play with your pals.7.5/10			"

												Magicka does really begin to shine when it is played cooperatively. Though SP works, it does not hold a candle to the sheer mayhem and anarchic fun of the multipalyer experience. Even though the campaign is solely linear, the gameplay itself is based on the principle of complete freedom. The experimentation with the different spells and elements is what turns it into a unique sandbox game, which really comes into its own, once friends join the fun. Highly recommended, especially if one is looking for a game to just have a bit of fun with, between more serious affairs like Bioshock or Skyrim ;-)			"

It has a funny plot and you have in your arsenal almost unlimited magick as you can cast freely your spells, which makes more fun but also very dangerous, even to yourself.It also has a good amount of replayability as you can solve the same maps in various different ways. Has some dlc to complement your experience and only one of your friends need that to start the dlc campaign, so you don't need to hold back in buying one if your friends won't. It also has a variety of robes with can make your playstyle more unique or just for the lols. Really recommended.			"

												Magicka is definitely best served with friends.It's an excellent blend of silly humour and self-satire mixed with genuinely wondrous aesthetics. You need only look at the screenshots above to see how pretty this game is. And thanks to the somewhat unorthodox spell combination system, you can play the game however you want, and be whatever kind of mage you want to be! Magicka knows exactly what kind of game it wants to be and it delivers that without a hiccup. The dialogue is ridiculous but constantly amusing and the storyline is constantly making fun of it's genre- the entire game is like a spoof, and it really is fun when playing with friends.I just wish there was more of it!

												MAGICKA......der Name ist Programm.Bei diesem tollen Spiel von Arrowhead Games schlüpft der Spieler in die Rolleeines Zauberers, der entweder mit 3 Freunden oder alleine die Welt vor den bösen Zauberer Grimnir retten muss.Die Spielweise ist denkbar einfach. Der Spieler muss mit verschiedenen Zaubern die Gegner beseitigen. Man hat insgesamt 10 Elemente (zB. Wasser, Feuer,Leben, Akane...) zur Auswahl.Das schöne ist man erlernt im Spiel immer mehr mächtige und sehr nützliche Zauber. Mit denen ist es dann kein Problem die Horden von Gegner zu zerstören :-)Einige Elemente kann man auch selber zusammenfügen und so eigene Zauber erfinden. Und wenn man mal keine Zeit hat zum zaubern, oder einen einfach der Platz fehlt, kann man die Gegner mit seiner Handwaffe erledigen.Das Waffen Arsenal reicht vom normalen Schwert bis hin zur modernen Uzi, welcher der Spieler auch nochmal verzaubern kann und so mehr Schaden anzurichten.Die Grafik ist eine sehr schön auf Comic gemacht. Die Highlights im Spiel sind die vielen kleinen versteckten Anlehnungen an berühmte Filme und Spiele wie Star Wars, Ritter der Kokosnuss, The Legend of Zelda, WOW, oder Matrix.Da es einige ADDons und viele andere Sachen für dieses Spiel gibt wird es nie langweilig.Also los, woraus wartet ihr noch. Kauft euch dieses Spiel und habt Spass.Harry Potter war gestern, jetzt kommt MAGICKASGTDee			"

												Majicka is a game about questions, do you want to set this on fire? Do you want to slap a goblin with an enchanted ice sword as large as a baby skyscraper? Do you want to melt your friend's face, revive him, and melt his face again? These are just a small sampling of soulful questions that Majicka will pose to you, but perhaps you are a busy man with no time for trivia. Majicka can also make full-fledged statements. Ensconcing enemies in ice and flinging a rock at their vulnerable frozen forms will make it Wizard Christmas. Wizard Christmas is just like regular Christmas except Wizard Christmas snow is sometimes red and the only suitable present for a wizard is cheese. So if you enjoy seeing your enemies driven before you with weeping and gnashing of teeth do not buy this game.On the other hand if you enjoy helping a friend blow up a golem before using your mighty powers, derived from the deepest depths of Arcana to gently push him off a ledge while cackling madly, then buy this game, and buy a copy for your friend. Then find a new friend once he swears eternal vengeance upon you.			"

												I was debating whether or not to play this game.  Did the usual scouring the internet for reviews and watching trailers to make sure this would be a good game to buy.  Well, it was well worth the research, this game is fun!  The graphics are rich and colorful, the spell combinations your character can do is crazy fun!  I found the tutorial in the beginning of the game to be quite easy to follow and short.  I've played games where the tutorial just goes on and on and on, not this game.  It took a bit to get used to the controls.  For me, I'm used to using the WSAD keys for all movement and now those are used in some of the spell keys, you point, click and hold the mouse button for your character to move in that direction.  I find the NPC's really funny as the speak a form of ""simlish"" but in a Norse kind of way.  The only thing i'm not too wild about is that it saves only at checkpoints and for someone like me who just wants to get on and play a quick few minutes at times is kind of inconvenient.

												If you are a Fan of Paradox's work, or just want to have some chaotic fun, Magicka is the game for you,With a Spell System that allows for near infinite combinations, and a unique sense of humor, this gimmicky little game is very easy to get sucked into, The graphics are decent, and the game is played from an isometric standpoint, this game easily found me spending hours blowing up my ""Friends"" and is best played ""Co-Op"", yes  the quotation marks are intended. Its well worth the price, and can have a lot of replay value due to secrets, and different playstyles, I Heartily Recommend this game, and hope you enjoy it as much as i did.Cardboard Cows For best use of a Farm Animal!

												Fun game where you have 8 different elements you can combine to make all different combinations of spells whether its aoe, shields, single target, land mines, etc.  I played through the orginal adventure and some dlc on single player and it was manageable but at times pretty challenging because I'm not a magicka expert.  There are all kinds of Dlc for this game as well as fan made mods.  I imagine playing multi player through the game would be more exciting but its not always easy to find someone who wants to play.

												Looking for something fun to play with your friends? This is the right choice.The coop mode is uber fun, and the storytelling is light and funny., and its gameplay is pretty intuitive (works best if you have a controller). And of course, there's also mages wearing long RPG-like robes weilding assault rifles '-'The graphics, althought not like""OMG! It's better than GTA V!"", is pretty cute. The whole game is well-designed.The magic system is pretty smart, and there's a lot of customization to suit every playstyle.Worth it.------------------------Se você procura algo divertido para jogar com os amigos, então esse é seu jogo.O Coop dele é muito massa, o estilo de narrativa é bem leve e engraçado, e o gameplay é bem intuitivo (facilita se você tiver um controle).E é claro, tem também os magos tradicionais de RPG carregando rifles de assalto '-'O visual não é do tipo, ""OMG! Melhor que GTA V!"", mas é bem bonitinho. Aliás, o jogo todo é bem desenhado.O sistema de magias dele é bem inteligente, e permite várias combinações diferentes, atendendo à todos os estilos de jogos.Valeu cada centavo. "

												A very witty game that parodies mmany different movies, games, and shows. It also has a unique and well thought out combat structure. From the start of the game you are given access to all 8 elements (water, life, shield, cold, fire, earth, arcane, and lighting) which can be combined for various effects. Each element affects the area differently depending on the form and combination. if you use it in its direct form (some are spray, earth is projectile, and others are beam) it is mainly a attack. if  you use say, earth + shield, on yourself it creates a body armor. If you use the same combination directly it surrounds you with a rock wall. If you use it as an Area of Effect it causes a small earthquake around your character. And if you enchant your melee weapon with it the weapon will also vary the effect.			"

												For many years I had been getting more and more cynical about games actually getting better rather than more corporately profitable. The lack of creative, enjoyable multiplayer games was quite noticable in comparison to the time of Rune, Greebles, Super Maze Wars and other such titles. And then...Suddenly, Magicka.Magicka is the answer to all this. It has a delicious innovatively smooth multiplayer integration and has a combat system that is, whilst less innovative, so creative and creatively stimulating that its smooth, intricate functionality can only be described as organic.The overall ambience and atmosphere in Magicka is a chirpy, happy, quirky one. Magicka may very well be the result of all that lacking fun and creativity I mentioned being funneled into one single project, to the extent of the quirkiness and continuous references to other media nearly getting on one's nerves. Nearly.Definitely recommended. And *definitely* definitely recommended to play with good friends.			"

												Ah, Majicka, thou art a cruel ♥♥♥♥♥, to give us such powerful spells that can turn a goblin into a greasy smear, set him ablaze, charbroil him with gouts of boiling steam, or preform crude x-ray procedures with gratuitous amounts of electricity (all whilst we  scream 'unlimited powah!'); and yet you make sure that friendly fire is always on, and we can't turn it off.Then you make the uber powerful spells impossible to aim.But you do care, oh sweet Majicka, for you make death as a slap on the wrist, you soothe our pain, and you lavish us with a powerful ressurection spell easy to cast and use within the first five minutes of gameplay. Oh this brave Macjika world, that has such goblins in it...Okay, enough with the waxing lyrical. Majicka is a game desinged for four players, all of which are extremely squishy wizards with godlike powers, to play online or through Lan. Of course it isn't designed for nothing BUT online play, as Majicka does allow for single player, and in many cases it may be easier by yourself as you can unleash the full fury of your wizardly prowress without worrying about making that red wizard you just met five minutes ago dissapear in a flash of light, a thunderclap, and massive damage.Majicka is, of course, about magic, and magic is surprisingly easy to use, and hard to master. You are given eight elements to mix and match, some of which do cancel each other out, I should mention, and depending on how you use these elements depends on what happens. Cast the Lighting spell by pressing q f a s a to prepeare the elements, then spacebar to use these elements to complete a recipie that allows you to rain down death on anyone stupid enought to anger you, stand in front of you, or stand slightly to the left or right of you (seriously, you can't aim that spell for♥♥♥♥♥♥. Or just press and hold the right mouse button to unleash a beam of death. Or... you could press shift, then right click to send it out in a destructive wave attack. Or hold ctrl and enchant your sword with the elements to create a onetime power melee attack.These are just some ways you can create amazing spells, including armour, landmines (with a variety of interesting attributes including fire, arcane energies, lightning, or healing), create a rocky barrier to shield yourself from attacks, create a force bubble to protect yourself for a long time, encase yourself in stone armour, or ice spikes, or stone armour and ice spikes, create walls of flame, summon a ring of miniature volcanoes to roast everything, crack the earth, make it rain, force magma to spout from the ground, force ice spikes bigger than you to erupt form the ground, raise zombies, create gouts of fire, steam, and/or water, shoot lighting from your hands (unlimited powah!), and more!THe game is full of snide humour, and a silly, half made up language that makes everything funnier. This game is smart enought to know that refrences are not the same as humour, and as such simply makes the refrences clever instead of rubbing your face in it and expecting you to laugh.Of course, it does have a few bugs. Mulitplayer is an ungodly mess, and some enemies seem almost impossible to defeat. Frustration is sure to come if you rely on one spell, and only one spell, and multiplayer cna get frustrating fast when someone lears a new spell called ""crash to desktop"" (an actual spell) and casts it just to see what it does.But all frustration aside, this is a smart, clever game that is sure to make you laugh, have fun, and want to turn your 'friends' into charcoal and ashes.And rerember... the safe word is: banarner.

I enjoyed playing with the ways to mix and match elements was supported by the patches they'cve included since launch, and the DLC that let people play with diffrent tactics... it still falls victim to people finding ""I win"" combinations, but in the end half the fun is in blowing yourself up. I just wish that the networking wasn't so finicky. this game is a blast with a group of friends to run around with... if you can manage to get them connected.

												Ridiculously fun! Granted, you'll spend at least half your time killing your teammates and/or hapless villagers, but that is not a bad thing :D The game controls are fairly simple, but the real beauty of the gameplay lies in the creative combinations of elements, rewarding players who take the time to experiment (preferably on a teammate XP). The story is snarky with lots of geek humor and references to everything from Star Wars to Monty Python and the Holy Grail, and the graphics are enjoyable coming from someone who plays a lot of Minecraft. I have yet to play through the game solo, however, and so am not sure how the gameplay holds up in the single-player mode. All in all, though, an excellent buy, especially if you plan to play with friends (Like me!)			"

												A clever game, and one the likes of which I've not seen before, despite the concept being something every fantasy fan has thought up at one point or another. The execution, however, is not without flaw. There are places in which game breaking bugs well, break your game. IT's also notorious for giving people with even newer laptops issues simply for being run on a laptop, and often won't work entirely on systems with on-board graphics. Occasionally they will patch and fix some of these bugs, but not before relasing another 20 bucks worth of redundant, basically reskinned, dlc first.			"

												I wasnt sure what to expect. The most I had seen was screenshots in the monthly Paradox newsletter.It's wizards, it's crafting spells with elemental combinations. After that, it's fun with friends, engaging campaign with humor.The many spell combinations can be a little frustrating, but experiment and you'll find something that works for you, and the enemy you are fighting. Quite by accident, I discovered E cast, A-S-E cast - a shield followed by 3 or 4 proximity mines in front of the field. Or F-E cast - shield of fire.I definitely recommend a try. "

												Magicka, is a most excellent game in many ways but shall not be played on your own. Gather up your friends with a four pack and try to not brutally slaughter eachother by misstake or unless that is what you want in an insane PvP match of the ultimate Wizardy. This game is enjoyable with a lot of comical aspects with twists, humor and a storyline which refers to a lot of great stories. See if you can find every secret and perhaps, you will be the hero of time.. or Gandalf.. or Merlin.			"

												it is a game that is worth playing, but the latest patch completely fugg'd up the whole game. crashing upon start and unable to play.. the developers have moved on to magicka 2 so im not sure we will see a fix for this game.. EDIT: fix for the insta-crash upon start: run the programs you got in SteamApps\common\Magicka\Dependencies. i dont really remember which one it is, but both should do you no trouble.			"

												Really fun game, especially with friends! But beware with the friendly magick! It has a funny plot and you have in your arsenal almost unlimited magick as you can cast freely your spells, which makes more fun but also very dangerous, even to yourself.It also has a good amount of replayability as you can solve the same maps in various different ways. Has some dlc to complement your experience and only one of your friends need that to start the dlc campaign, so you don't need to hold back in buying one if your friends won't. It also has a variety of robes with can make your playstyle more unique or just for the lols. Really recommended.			"

												This is a fun game to play in one go, but it's really hard to come back to. Once you've de-momorized those spells it's brutal to try to fire this game up again and expect to hold your own in the MP community (which is pretty much dead, probably for that reason) or to try to get those last few achievements done. Not to mention that it's largely just trying to plug its 4 or 5 DLC campaigns and a bunch of other DLC that's not worth what it costs, so I think I'm done with this game.			"

												Magicka is definitely best served with friends.It's an excellent blend of silly humour and self-satire mixed with genuinely wondrous aesthetics. You need only look at the screenshots above to see how pretty this game is. And thanks to the somewhat unorthodox spell combination system, you can play the game however you want, and be whatever kind of mage you want to be! Magicka knows exactly what kind of game it wants to be and it delivers that without a hiccup. The dialogue is ridiculous but constantly amusing and the storyline is constantly making fun of it's genre- the entire game is like a spoof, and it really is fun when playing with friends.I just wish there was more of it!

There ain't nothing better than create random spell out of them elements available and see how something blows up... usually that something happens to be your friend playing with you. Luckily they teach you how to revive him/her after the blast. I also do like the story and them referrals to other games.I do recommend to get this game and  have the great time with friends.			"

It gets better with friends.You can spray water that not only forces people back, but then have a friend toss in lightening which is enhanced by the water and bouncing from person to person.Or you cast a random lighting bolt that insta-kills another friend. Or toss a boulder that flies hard enough and fast enough to not only kill the intended target, but fly off and kill a civilian. It's really hilarious. I genuinely can't stop laughing and crying. It is such a simple, simple game, but brilliant, addictive, and hilarious. I can't get over how such a simple game is just, mindblowingly engaging.			"

												Ah, Majicka, thou art a cruel ♥♥♥♥♥, to give us such powerful spells that can turn a goblin into a greasy smear, set him ablaze, charbroil him with gouts of boiling steam, or preform crude x-ray procedures with gratuitous amounts of electricity (all whilst we  scream 'unlimited powah!'); and yet you make sure that friendly fire is always on, and we can't turn it off.Then you make the uber powerful spells impossible to aim.But you do care, oh sweet Majicka, for you make death as a slap on the wrist, you soothe our pain, and you lavish us with a powerful ressurection spell easy to cast and use within the first five minutes of gameplay. Oh this brave Macjika world, that has such goblins in it...Okay, enough with the waxing lyrical. Majicka is a game desinged for four players, all of which are extremely squishy wizards with godlike powers, to play online or through Lan. Of course it isn't designed for nothing BUT online play, as Majicka does allow for single player, and in many cases it may be easier by yourself as you can unleash the full fury of your wizardly prowress without worrying about making that red wizard you just met five minutes ago dissapear in a flash of light, a thunderclap, and massive damage.Majicka is, of course, about magic, and magic is surprisingly easy to use, and hard to master. You are given eight elements to mix and match, some of which do cancel each other out, I should mention, and depending on how you use these elements depends on what happens. Cast the Lighting spell by pressing q f a s a to prepeare the elements, then spacebar to use these elements to complete a recipie that allows you to rain down death on anyone stupid enought to anger you, stand in front of you, or stand slightly to the left or right of you (seriously, you can't aim that spell for♥♥♥♥♥♥. Or just press and hold the right mouse button to unleash a beam of death. Or... you could press shift, then right click to send it out in a destructive wave attack. Or hold ctrl and enchant your sword with the elements to create a onetime power melee attack.These are just some ways you can create amazing spells, including armour, landmines (with a variety of interesting attributes including fire, arcane energies, lightning, or healing), create a rocky barrier to shield yourself from attacks, create a force bubble to protect yourself for a long time, encase yourself in stone armour, or ice spikes, or stone armour and ice spikes, create walls of flame, summon a ring of miniature volcanoes to roast everything, crack the earth, make it rain, force magma to spout from the ground, force ice spikes bigger than you to erupt form the ground, raise zombies, create gouts of fire, steam, and/or water, shoot lighting from your hands (unlimited powah!), and more!THe game is full of snide humour, and a silly, half made up language that makes everything funnier. This game is smart enought to know that refrences are not the same as humour, and as such simply makes the refrences clever instead of rubbing your face in it and expecting you to laugh.Of course, it does have a few bugs. Mulitplayer is an ungodly mess, and some enemies seem almost impossible to defeat. Frustration is sure to come if you rely on one spell, and only one spell, and multiplayer cna get frustrating fast when someone lears a new spell called ""crash to desktop"" (an actual spell) and casts it just to see what it does.But all frustration aside, this is a smart, clever game that is sure to make you laugh, have fun, and want to turn your 'friends' into charcoal and ashes.And rerember... the safe word is: banarner.

												For many years I had been getting more and more cynical about games actually getting better rather than more corporately profitable. The lack of creative, enjoyable multiplayer games was quite noticable in comparison to the time of Rune, Greebles, Super Maze Wars and other such titles. And then...Suddenly, Magicka.Magicka is the answer to all this. It has a delicious innovatively smooth multiplayer integration and has a combat system that is, whilst less innovative, so creative and creatively stimulating that its smooth, intricate functionality can only be described as organic.The overall ambience and atmosphere in Magicka is a chirpy, happy, quirky one. Magicka may very well be the result of all that lacking fun and creativity I mentioned being funneled into one single project, to the extent of the quirkiness and continuous references to other media nearly getting on one's nerves. Nearly.Definitely recommended. And *definitely* definitely recommended to play with good friends.			"

												MAGICKA......der Name ist Programm.Bei diesem tollen Spiel von Arrowhead Games schlüpft der Spieler in die Rolleeines Zauberers, der entweder mit 3 Freunden oder alleine die Welt vor den bösen Zauberer Grimnir retten muss.Die Spielweise ist denkbar einfach. Der Spieler muss mit verschiedenen Zaubern die Gegner beseitigen. Man hat insgesamt 10 Elemente (zB. Wasser, Feuer,Leben, Akane...) zur Auswahl.Das schöne ist man erlernt im Spiel immer mehr mächtige und sehr nützliche Zauber. Mit denen ist es dann kein Problem die Horden von Gegner zu zerstören :-)Einige Elemente kann man auch selber zusammenfügen und so eigene Zauber erfinden. Und wenn man mal keine Zeit hat zum zaubern, oder einen einfach der Platz fehlt, kann man die Gegner mit seiner Handwaffe erledigen.Das Waffen Arsenal reicht vom normalen Schwert bis hin zur modernen Uzi, welcher der Spieler auch nochmal verzaubern kann und so mehr Schaden anzurichten.Die Grafik ist eine sehr schön auf Comic gemacht. Die Highlights im Spiel sind die vielen kleinen versteckten Anlehnungen an berühmte Filme und Spiele wie Star Wars, Ritter der Kokosnuss, The Legend of Zelda, WOW, oder Matrix.Da es einige ADDons und viele andere Sachen für dieses Spiel gibt wird es nie langweilig.Also los, woraus wartet ihr noch.

												A very witty game that parodies mmany different movies, games, and shows. It also has a unique and well thought out combat structure. From the start of the game you are given access to all 8 elements (water, life, shield, cold, fire, earth, arcane, and lighting) which can be combined for various effects. Each element affects the area differently depending on the form and combination. if you use it in its direct form (some are spray, earth is projectile, and others are beam) it is mainly a attack. if  you use say, earth + shield, on yourself it creates a body armor. If you use the same combination directly it surrounds you with a rock wall. If you use it as an Area of Effect it causes a small earthquake around your character. And if you enchant your melee weapon with it the weapon will also vary the effect.			"

												A fun casual adventure game that allows you to combine ""Magicks"" to create more powerful spells.Best played in Co-operative with friends but be warned, you will probably spend up to half of your time killing your friends. Expect to die, frequently and mostly from friendly-fire.			"

												Fun game where you have 8 different elements you can combine to make all different combinations of spells whether its aoe, shields, single target, land mines, etc.  I played through the orginal adventure and some dlc on single player and it was manageable but at times pretty challenging because I'm not a magicka expert.  There are all kinds of Dlc for this game as well as fan made mods.  I imagine playing multi player through the game would be more exciting but its not always easy to find someone who wants to play.

												Magicka is one of my personal favorite games. I honestly don't even know how I've spent over 200 hours iin this little title, but even now, I could play through again. This game is incredibly innovative and open. There are so many spell combinations, I probably haven't discovered them all yet. It is best played with 4 people but solo offers its own different type of fun.It can be buggy, multiplayer in particular. Also, it can be difficult in some parts, but for me, it never stopped being fun and hilarious. It has a great sense of humor that never fails to make me chuckle even now. The references to popular culture are everywhere.I would highly recommend this game. Its quirky, funny, innovative, and brilliant.			"

												I was debating whether or not to play this game.  Did the usual scouring the internet for reviews and watching trailers to make sure this would be a good game to buy.  Well, it was well worth the research, this game is fun!  The graphics are rich and colorful, the spell combinations your character can do is crazy fun!  I found the tutorial in the beginning of the game to be quite easy to follow and short.  I've played games where the tutorial just goes on and on and on, not this game.  It took a bit to get used to the controls.  For me, I'm used to using the WSAD keys for all movement and now those are used in some of the spell keys, you point, click and hold the mouse button for your character to move in that direction.  I find the NPC's really funny as the speak a form of ""simlish"" but in a Norse kind of way.  The only thing i'm not too wild about is that it saves only at checkpoints and for someone like me who just wants to get on and play a quick few minutes at times is kind of inconvenient.  But that's only a minor thing for me!   I definitely recommend this game for those who are into magic filled adventures and want wreak havoc on...anything!  Oh and save the world, of course.			"

												Disclaimer: Until they fix the multiplayer, this is not a recommendation. Don't get me wrong, it's a great game, and it is loads of fun; but the replay value is in the multiplayer. Screwing around with friends, endless TKs and other activities are what will bring you back again and again. Not the story, or the writing, or Vlad the ""not"" vampire.			"

												A mage is walking through a village and sees a woman standing outside of her house with an exclamation mark over her head, and approaches her to talk.  She asks him to deal with rats in her basement.  And in that moment, RPG veterans would groan from all of the times they were given the same mindless tasks, and these aren't even cranium rats!  But of course, there is a twist here.  Everything in this game takes a comedic dump on RPG conventions, lead by a narrator who is totally not a vampire.  What kind of game is this?  It's the kind of game with a Vietnam expansion where you use a M60 on goblins.  Awkwardness of that expansion aside, this is a rather geeky parody of the RPG genre, in the vein of games like Munchkin that find humor in the genre itself.  It's also in Swedish, which gives it an unusual feel.  The game features a unique magic system, in which eight elements are used in combinations that create spells.  Combining some elements create new elements (such as fire and water making steam), while others cancel each other out.  Learning the combinations that create spells is the key to the game, and it becomes vital to learn to enter them quickly.  While the game can be played with a gamepad, a keyboard and mouse are more effective because they allow faster entry of spells.  Up to four players can play in co-op.			"

												At first, i didn't really like Magika, it felt strange for some reason. Then one day i decided id take a seat and just really have at it. Turns out, its now one of my favorites, the magic in this game is just wonderful, i often find myself far from an actual fight, just standing there mixing and matching all these elements to see what i can come up with next, so gosh darn brilliant			"

												Magicka is a great game to play with other people as well as some solo experiences.The amazing different weapons and different spells makes the game much more enjoyable and adventurous.The game offers the cool spell combinations, there different combinations are a great way to find cool attacks. With the use of different spells, they can be used with the weapons as well. The different characters and DLC's that come with it is a great way to have differen experiences within the game. Although the different DLC's may not be an option for some people the different wizards within the game has a great variety within the game.The campaign mode is great, the different weapons is cool and the use of putting different weapons within the levels it makes the game much more open to look around the levels to maybe find stuff.Also some monsters/enemies have different spells needed to kill them.Magicka is a great game and have different cool things to use, kill with and destroy enemies.Magicka is good game and is worth the buy.9.5/10 is a good game.

												 This game is great! But, like any first game, it has some flaws.1: The gameplay is great, fun, exciting, and fast, but on multiplayer it can be very, very laggy.2: If you have a game setup with friends, it might not be laggy, but without Steam invites and a Private hosting, it can be impossible to group up effectively.3: The extra skins/robes and the level of customizability is flawed in how long it can last (since you die so much), but this is leveled off by the versatility of the spells and that this puts a priority on experimenting with spells.  All in all, this is a great buy for such a little cost. Try it out! You may enjoy it's humor and quick wordplay, but be careful if you don't enjoy linear gaming. Also, around chapters 10+, playing alone is near impossible, so think about that!			"

												Ive had so much fun on this game its unbelievable, awesome humour (in gameplay and story) with a complex-ish and logical spell creation system makes the coop one of the best ive ever played. One time the 4 of us had to teleport from the top of the tower down to the ground at its base, 3 of us managed the spell perfectly and stood waiting for Yellow (like always). Predictably Yellow faffed the spell and did a face-plap after falling some height.  The magic feels satisfyingly powerful and dangerous (get a spell wrong a few times and you'll see what I mean), and the whole look of the game is perfect (in my opinion). However... this is not a game yet, its a bug that has gameplay in it. While the devs are working to fix all the bugs quickly (on a daily basis), its a shame the game's early days have been marred by bugs that make playing it impossible. Buy it anyway, and coop it up with me, I'll show you my staff...once they fix the coop :D			"

Not to forget the numerous ways you can throw magic and spells at enemies, experiment and combine the elements to fit your way of combat - and to get rid of your opponents in a fun way!I absolutely recommend this game to any and everyone, especially though to coop players.

												A really fun action-adventure game, either playing solo or (even better) with friends on a versus game or co-op. The adventure story is well elaborated, humorous, with lots of games/movies references, such as star wars, 300, macgyver, tomb raider, diablo, grim fandango, zelda and many more. The characters speak some sort of mixed languages (swedish, english and some gibberish) which makes it even funnier.The magicks (skills) are combinations you can make with the 8 elements given, and even mix these to make other elements. It's possible to create various different magicks as long as the elemental orbs combine. This feature makes the combat style very versatile and unique, besides, in this real-time combat the wizards have infinite mana, use lasers, swords and even guns. And although the wizards have infinite mana, they have other limitations like taking the time to type the combo you want, being slowed by summoning many elemental orbs, the skills duration, and taking care about opposite elements.All in all, it's a very entertaining game, cheap, and completely vampire free.""I put on my robe and my wizard hat.""10/10			"

												Magicka is a delight of a Co-Op game. The powers you get are downright fun to play with 2-4 players. In addition to a lot of crazy spells, keep in mind thought that Friendly Fire does exist, you can royally screw up the game for everyone if you cast your spells randomly and without thought. It is for those reasons that pickup groups are not recommended: if you are going to play this game, play it with friends you know.You'll be able to get things like the Master Sword (if you are at full health and slash it will shoot energy) and other fancy items clearly taken from other movies/games. Countless hilarious references exist within the game, and to top it off it's just plain cute.I recommend this game to anyone who has people to play with, however the game is a little iffy as a single player; so don't buy it if that’s what you want.

												I was happy to receive this game from my friend but, it did not take very long for me to realise that this 'game' is just a Swedish cultural assimilation apparatus so, I promptly uninstalled it. I am now left shorter on time and with one less friend, whom I believed to be a Swedish operative tasked with converting me into a model of their culture. Though they may run amok in our streets, they shall never gain a foothold on my mind!			"

												Do you like fun? Do you enjoy playing with a bunch of friends, only to explode spontaneously as one, or all of you, fumble your spells? That is the essence of Magicka, a game where you play as largely inept wizards with the ability to mix spells using a set of 8 different elements, each with its unique properties. While it does have its fair share of bugs, even still, it is simply a joyous game to play, especially if you get a bunch of friends into it, as well. It goes on sale every other week, so that shouldn't be a problem, eh?			"

												Personally I dont enjoy games with no real end goal and where theres a lot of things to remember, but this game shocked me, since I first got it, I intruduced four of my friends to it and they loved it just as much. Now part of remembering all the combonations at first I was like, ""This is going to be a long time until I do that"" but I memorized half the spells in as little as no time, because you use them a lot. Also this game is much better with friends than alone, the main story has lots of jokes in it already but when you have 3 other people running around like chickens with their heads cut off trying to cast Lightning Bolt on you or they are trying to cross the beams something always goes horribly wrong and everyone gets a good laugh just to be followed by more fun of the adventure in game, and the DLCs are all fun but my favorite is The Stars Are Left, because it really grasps what H.P. Lovecraft's Call Of Cthulhu would be if it was in Magicka (Although there are some bugs - it just makes it funnier) I recommend this game for anyone who doesnt mind the ocasional paradoxs with time travel or the amount of dead mooses 10/10.

It did not end well for him until he found his own spell combos to kill each other.At the time of writing this review (12.2 hours), my friends and I still have not passed chapter 3.10/10 "

												Magicka is a fun top-down ARPG that focuses around magic. You can create your own spells by mixing the elements, use pre-built spells that can have some special effects, and play either a short (Took me 7 hours) story mode, a challenge mode with a decent amount of maps (More if you buy DLC), or PVP where you test your skills with magic against other players.The story was comical but not very interesting. In team-based modes you have a friendly fire that really gets in the way due to the top-down perspective. The graphics are a bit outdated but nothing I personally minded. Every character speaks in a fake language like in the Sims, except the narrator between levels, which I found really annoying.The gameplay is fun though, and that is a core element of ARPGs. This game is iconic in its originality but mediocre in most other ways from graphics, to sound effects, to the story, to the lifespan. I still had fun though and would confidently give this a 7/10.

												It's like Castle Crashers had a baby with Skyrim, but Skyrim realized he was better off on his own, and left Castle Crashers to raise their weird child hybrid alone. I mean Castle Crashers did the best she could as a single parent living off of Skyrim's alimony, but you can't help but wonder if Magicka needed a strong RPG role model in his life. Now Magicka is the kid that only wants to play Go Fish when he owns a trampoline, like dude, my mom would never get me a trampolone, so when I sleep over we could at least use it for my sake. But all Magicka wants to do is play Go Fish, so you say you have a stomach ache and call your mom to pick you up, but she's friends with Magicka's mom so you can't tell her that you lied about the stomach ache or she'd get mad at you for lying, so you spend the whole next day in bed with a fake stomach ache while the rest of your family goes to Peter Pipers.

												Magicka is a delight of a Co-Op game. The powers you get are downright fun to play with 2-4 players. In addition to a lot of crazy spells, keep in mind thought that Friendly Fire does exist, you can royally screw up the game for everyone if you cast your spells randomly and without thought. It is for those reasons that pickup groups are not recommended: if you are going to play this game, play it with friends you know.You'll be able to get things like the Master Sword (if you are at full health and slash it will shoot energy) and other fancy items clearly taken from other movies/games. Countless hilarious references exist within the game, and to top it off it's just plain cute.I recommend this game to anyone who has people to play with, however the game is a little iffy as a single player; so don't buy it if that’s what you want.

You can also put the spells into your sword to make your sword elemental, pick out of many different characters with there own special ability and resistances and advantages. Pick up weapons from enemies and you can also use the spells in other ways too. There are spell books to pick up giving you a special spell to use that can do things from reviving players and running faster to summoning golems or destroy things at random. This game makes you feel so powerful some things might be a bit overly cheap like rock and sheild but its still loads of fun and as a bonus has online and local multiplayer.			"

You can choose at any moment of the game to change your strategy through the game, and even great enemies are easy to kill with one or two combinations, for those who don't want to extend the game.

												Magicka is something I don’t think I have ever really understood the appeal for.I played through the game with a bunch of friends; the first thing we noticed was how bad the multiplayer was. It was constantly crashing and we had to reboot and redo certain bits over again. I can’t imagine myself ever playing this game solo in singleplayer, so for the multiplayer to be messing up so badly it was kind of breaking the game for me.From what I remember the storyline was alright, it had it’s amusing moments and parts where I thought “oh, that’s clever. I see what they did there”, so storyline wise it wasn’t too bad. From what I have heard the humour of the game is quite a big selling point, I have had people that have said they absolutely love this game because the humour is just genius. It’s got a lot of references and secrets that are references as well. I thought it was funny to a certain extent, by I personally wouldn’t say it’s “genius”. It’s for a certain audience, I guess?The characters have a really strange obsession for sausages, which I guess is kind of funny, just a tad bit odd I think.It’s still a good game, it was alright. I wouldn’t ever play it again but it wasn’t something I deemed so unplayable that I didn’t finish.The combat mechanics for this game are pretty fun and it’s definitely something you have to get used to. You can cast basic spells and mix the elements  to come up new ones, sort of “combos” which is pretty interesting and gives the game a bit of variety and choice in terms of combat.If you are unsure whether or not to buy this game, I would say that it isn’t bad. But in my opinion it wasn’t that great either.			"

												Magicka is a game where you get to play as a wizard and combine up to 5 of 8 elements to create some awesome spells allowing for millions of combos. You can also put the spells into your sword to make your sword elemental, pick out of many different characters with there own special ability and resistances and advantages. Pick up weapons from enemies and you can also use the spells in other ways too. There are spell books to pick up giving you a special spell to use that can do things from reviving players and running faster to summoning golems or destroy things at random. This game makes you feel so powerful some things might be a bit overly cheap like rock and sheild but its still loads of fun and as a bonus has online and local multiplayer.			"

 Magicka Magicka is a satirical action-adventure game set in a rich fantasy world based on Norse mythology. The player assumes the role of a wizard from a sacred order tasked with stopping an evil sorcerer who has thrown the world into turmoil, his foul creations besieging the forces of good. Magicka is a brilliant game made on the 25th January 2011 and i have to say...I LOVE THIS GAME. ONE OF THE BEST GAMES IN MY LIBRARY IF NOT, THE BEST.I am not a big fan of RPG games but Magicka has really made me change my mind. This game is superb. Create Spells with your friends .I think Magicka is probably the best mage-game out there. With its amazing sense of satirical humor, Magicka really does bring out out the laughs very often.  The characters voicing and language is the best there is because the way they speak is so humorous, just like the minions in despicable me.Pros:- Fun game that you can play with friends.- Allows you to do spells that the students of hogwarts can't do.- Characters Voicing is very funny.Cons:- Co-op (Multiplayer) needs to be fixed.All in all this is a fabulous game which i would definitely recommend to my friends. 10/10 "

												Ahhh Magicka. What an amazing, crash-tastic pile of awesome this game is.Once you get over the game crashing on level loads (which is MUCH better than the original release), this game is amazing. Play it will a bunch of friends on adventure, and don't bother going through it on single player (it's the same anyways). There's funny references everywhere in this game.I like to classify this as a ""thinking man's Diablo game with hysterical references of all sorts"". I classify it as such because as much as you get hoards of creatures to kill, you have to combine elements into spells to kill them, taking into account current weather as well as anything the opponent is casting or using. You cannot just button mash, nor can you cast the same spell and beat this game (though, thunderbolt provides hours of comedic friend-killing fun). Casting lighting on a guy is effective, but much more effective when you get them wet first, or add steam into your spell :)Don't cross the streams!5/5			"

												Things I liked:It has referential humor for days (Just in the first two levels, it makes fun of Legend of Zelda, Monty Python, Lord of the Rings, and a few others that I'm sure went over my head)Elements system can make for some interesting combos (Arcane/Fire/Lightning laser OP)With friends, it's a stupid, fun gameYou can drop a rock on your head over and over and it'll keep being funnyThings I didn't like:Playing solo, it quickly becomes a game of Ring-Around-The-Rosie when you get more than three dudes at onceReferential humor might not be your thingI'm bad at this game and keep fumbling between self casting, area casting, and normal castingTrying to use Lightning while wet makes you take damage. It might just be because I'm dumb, but it's somewhat hard to see yourself in the middle of a clustercuss being wet, so if you favor lightning you'll quickly wind up frying yourselfOverall: It's dumb, best played with friends, and don't take anything seriously.

Whether I was firing volt laced ice needles or conjuring up miniature flame geysers, this game never ceased to amaze!I love the amount of strategy in the game that causes the player to experiment with all kinds of elements nd not just rely on a few. This game is fun solo, but it really gets amusing with friends! Even if you happen to walk into a flaming meteor hurled by your friend, at least you enjoyed a good laugh! Definitely try this game!

												My friends and I started walking down a forest road casting water spells at each other getting our clothes wet. This escalated to freezing each other in place, and then rapidly firing off 5 earth elements to shatter our companions into dust.  What followed was an all out war in a courtyard filled with thunderbolts, boiling oil, volcano's, and giant ice shards that would electrify you as you stood near them, and then proceed to blow up.  We never made it past Chapter 1 for 2 weeks, but boy was it fun. 10/10 Murder-mayhem wizard  and vampire  fantasy  The keyword is banana  "

Btw you can combine alot of diffrent magics and you can kill you're friend and steal thier gear so the perfect game for co-op. :D			"

												Quite an interesting and fun game to play.First of all, my main advice would be to recruit some friends to play with you. This is one of those games that is incredibly more fun and exciting to play with friends than on your own.Be sure to search every inch of every map for those godly weapons and spell tomes - as well as various funny remarks and easter-eggs that constantly break the fourth-wall.So be brave, young Wizard - and remember!

												I picked this up pretty cheap during the recent sale, and I've got to say I'm really enjoying this so far. Possibly one of the best combat systems i've seen in an RPG. The magick system is fun and encourages a lot of experimentation, which I enjoy. The story is average, but the script is where it really shines, with a ton of pop culture references riddled throughout the script. The levels are also pretty fun. Co-op is fun and engaging and I have yet to try PvP and the Challenges but I'm sure theyll be just as good as the rest of the game. Overall I would give this a solid 9/10, only losing a mark due to the relative shortness of the game (although there is a lot of replay value)			"

												Magicka is a unique third person adventure RPG. It doesn't have a thick story plot, but it wouldn't need it anyways, as the spells and seemingly endless combinations of spells never fails to wow me.      It's got some great humor and a lot of references that break the fourth wall. Choose to be wizard or templar. Travel the forests and the rest of whatever lays await for you to kill.... or to be killed by whomever. Combine different elements to make magical, yet deadly effects. But be careful-- you can kill yourself. I've found myself humorously mashing the different buttons to see which elements made what. And It's kind of funny to see myself flying across the screen and dying shortly after from combining fire, biohazard ( because that's actually an element, right? ) and some other deadly elements into a huge AoE blast. Magicka is, albeit frustrating, but fun to play.     -     7 / 10			"

												ah MAGICKA ... this game is pretty awesome because its nothing like before.This game is really HARD-CORE REAL-TIME BATTLE-ARENA SPELLING MULTIPLAYER / COOP GAME (MMO).Game is combination of real-time strategy game with an RPG stuff also mixed with an ""creativity"" in spell creation.There is no limitation in spell creation ... only 5 slot system. Spells are created from 8 based elements (water, life, shield, cold, lightning, arcane (death), earth, fire) ... the combination of this 8 elements create a different types of spells.Game is also pretty hard and challenging. And the level of ""hardness"" is raising like game is more and more in progress. A fanny element is also an online choice of play where you can challenge or coop with your friends in the battles between BOTS (game) or online players (or your friends).This game is really worth any money ... best to get if full with all the DLCs ... and best to buy it in sale.

												If you want to laugh until you cry with your friends get this game, and go ham with your button mashing spell casting spam tastic skills. This game is pretty ridiculous and I mean that in the most positive way possible. The amount of flexibility you get with spell combinations outright beats any game I touched. The challenges are pretty good to and if you want more of magicka there is always DLC though i recommend waiting for sales on those. The multiplayer is what makes it extremely fun with all that team killing and trying not to just survive the enemies but your allies. For what they are asking as far as price this game is quite the deal you will discover things every now and then as you play the game. I haven’t stopped learning new things for quite a long time and I don’t think that will stop soon either. This game has good longevity especially if you have friends who are into it, or just want to go straight to challenges for a game or two every now and then.Recommended for anyone who wants to embrace their childhood love for destruction.

												A quirky co-op game where you cast spells at allies or enemies, often leading to horrifically gory results. It can actually be quite fun, and the game itself is fairly challenging. Sadly, this game, despite having single-player, is pretty much co-op or bust since the single-player is scaled for 4 players instead of 1. Still, the game is fun and if I had had the superb PC I do now back when this game was being played, then i'd prolly have gotten alot more achievements than I have. :(If you can actually get friends to play this with you, then have fun!

												To start off, the negatives: buggy, tends to crash at times and suffers from rather complex and odd controls.Basically I'm recommending this as a sales product, 5 euros or below is totally alright, yet 10 is a bit too much. It's an old game after all. Multiplayer can be hard to achieve (as said, buggy), altough when succesful it's sidewreckingly fun.However, don't be put off by these whiny ♥♥♥♥♥es who can't get over the controls. Magicka has a great concept, and hilariously fun gameplay when you put some effort into it. Nowadays ""gamer"" culture is elitist and lazy, so gems like magicka might get dismissed easily.Get familiar with the controls, and learn some element combinations by heart. After that, blow up your enemies with arcane ice laser beams! (or just kill your friends, that's fine as well)			"

												Magicka has a great concept. You are a mage and you have 8 elements that you can use combined as spells. Like Diablo you run around from a isometric perspective, but you don't really have the looting and rpg elements. The gameplay isn't as fluid as an Diablo. The controls are unresponsive at times. Probably because the game is poorly optimized and buggy. That makes the combat with the spell system hard and frustrating at times. And that too bad because this concept has a lot of potential. Because they created a good looking world with a nice atmosphere. That doesn't take it self too serious and is constantly joking around. But it misses that final polishing to make it a great game. I only recommend it now if you have friends to play it with.			"

												The game has alot of random features and the storyline might not be the one for the ultra serious gmaer. But this game isn't at all for the super serious gamer. I think that organized gameplay is the most exciting one and I have taken part in a lot of organized events in games like Mount and Blade Warband (with mods of course) and Arma. But this just brings out all the fun with it. The game is developed by Paradox Interactive who are a swedish game studio like D.I.C.E etc. The game combines what we from sweden likes to call swedish which you can notice if you are listening at the npc conersations with you. The game allow you to kill everything in your path and when I say everything I really do mean everything. The gmae has really no borders and is so much fun that I am almost ashamed that I havn't got more time to put out for it. 10/10 Piggys			"

Another game what owns tons and tons of bugs and lags (No s*it haven´t been updatetd since 2k11 I think) but it actually makes the game more fun. Magic, trolling your friends, funny bugs? Yeah, that´s Magicka. "

This is an indie title with a good deal of polish on it that will reward those who invest time to learn the spell combo system.  That being said, the difficulty gets to frustrating levels mostly due to a less than intuitive control set up. The steep learning curve ultimately made me stop playing.

												WELCOME TO STUPID.  In this game, the first spell you learn is haste to help you run faster.  The second spell you learn is revive, which works for free because you and your friends will kill eachother and yourselves so often.  That is not hyperbole of any kind.  In this game you play as a wizard who summons the forces of the arcane to your beck and call while still being a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ed wizard.  You are made of paper and the world is made of scissors.  The game has a splendid sense of humor to help along a bland story, and teamplay is certainly fun.  Everyone is bound to get their own playstyle due to the sheer variety of the spells available, between personal preference and memory, and between this and the MOBA, the devs really do have a whole heap of love for the game.

The way the voice actors portray what is happening in the game and in an intersting way can evoke emotions equivalent to what a tween girl would feel if Justin Bieber riding One Direction with a onterage of ponies came and took her to a Katie Perry concert.

												Magicka is not a game you'll wanna play after a long day to relax and unwind. It's hard, it's exhausting, it's punishing, it's intense. And it's extremely fun, especially in co-op.This is the deal: You have 8 elements to conjure, 5 slots to conjure them in, multiple ways of casting them and multiple strategies to use them in. Every spell must be cast from scratch every time during even the most chaotic battes, it can damage anyone including you and your ""friends"" and every optimal strategy you'll come up with may prove completely ineffective just a few fights later. With every new level and every new boss fight, you will feel like this game is trolling you, but you will enjoy it - the absurd humor of the whole thing is a big factor, as well.Definitely recommended - and best played with ""friends"".

I have only gotten around to playing a couple of hours, yet I think it's definitely worth the money I spent on it. I love the concept of mixing together elements to create spells; I felt like there were infinite possibilities as to what I could use to vanquish my foes. The art is pretty good, as well as the music. The various internet and meme refrences were somewhat out of place in my opinion, yet so far they've had me laugh numerous times. I haven't gotten around to trying it out, but the multiplayer looks like a lot of fun. The only downside is that from what I've heard it runs like crap on most decent computers, which hasn't really affected me in any way.

Its that fact and time of fighting a troll, so you go to throw a massive rock at him, then your friend gets in the way and explodes when you release that rock. Its those times where you plant some mines and a friend steps on them and pings himself into space. its those times where you kill eachother because you want to combine the beams and it fails and everyone gets knocked back and dies. This is a game about killing eachother while trying to complete a mission.The next thing is this game is chocked full of references and jokes. Those jokes that give you a cheap laugh.

But really the best way to play this game is with friends and i think locally but online is also availible. I advise local just because its one of those games that when your friend kills you, you respond by punching him in the arm.alone :            7.5/10With friends : 8.5/10			"

												After getting used to the slightly awkward controls, this game is quite good.You have 10 total elements to use to cast a variety of spells, and you are able to cast the spell on either yourself, the area or in front of you. Friendly fire IS on, so if you have idiot friends that would do that, don't play co-op. The game's DLC is not required at all in the game and doesn't give you a huge advantage if you do get them.

												An amazing and fun game, it takes a bit to get used to everything but when you do it's a very fun game.I like playing this game while watching something since it does not require a lot of attention.The campaign is short but very fun to play through the story is nice too, and for the price of just 10$ it's worth buying for what you get!Gameplay: 9/10Story: 6/10Graphics & Visuals: 8/10Humor: 10/10 Fun: 10/10Replay: 8/10Overall Rating: 8/10 Magicka 2 does have better graphics and better animations but the mechanichs are so different :/I prefer Magicka 1, 2 is a waste of money it's the same story but with better graphics and 1 extra spell combination. And magicka 2 is so much harder to play and can be a pain to beat bosses.So don't get that game, get this one instead! It's cheaper and it's more fun! :D "

												This is a good game that falls short of true greatness due to one fault, at least in single player mode. You can't save, and the auto-save points are too far apart. Moreover, the single-player is difficult, so you die often, which requires you to start a part of the game all over again. Other than that, it is great fun, and I suspect the multiplayer is equally engrossing. Very much worth purchasing especially if you don't mind shutting it down for a while to come back later and retry some of the harder parts.  8/10.			"

												Magicka is a satirical action-adventure game set in a rich fantasy world based on Norse mythology. The player assumes the role of a wizard from a sacred order tasked with stopping an evil sorcerer who has thrown the world into turmoil, his foul creations besieging the forces of good.Players will be able to combine the elements to cast spells, wreaking havoc and devastation on the minions of darkness. They will also be able to team up with friends and fight their way through the campaign, or test their skills in the magickal arts through other challenging modes.In Magicka, up to four players take on a grand adventure to save their world from certain doom using a fully dynamic spell system. The adventure mode takes the players across three different levels, ranging from the lush forests of mountain valleys to the frozen halls of the Mountain King where wits and creative thinking are the keys to victory.In the unlockable hardcore challenge mode, players fight off waves of enemies..

												I had a ton of fun playing this game, whether it be single player or multiplayer, though playing with friends is alot more fun aswell as the game being balanced more for multiplayer. Figuring out all the different button combinations to cast the various different spells with the hugely flexible and innovative magic system, as well as engaging in melee fights with a wide range of weaponry is challenging, fun and satisfying.The story, while being the run-of-the-mill saving the world adventure type of affair, is still hugely enjoyable due to the humorous dialogue, the many easter eggs that you can find throughout the game, the parodies and all the different film, T.V and videogame references that are mentioned with it's Pratchett-esque wit.

												Magicka is not a game you'll wanna play after a long day to relax and unwind. It's hard, it's exhausting, it's punishing, it's intense. And it's extremely fun, especially in co-op.This is the deal: You have 8 elements to conjure, 5 slots to conjure them in, multiple ways of casting them and multiple strategies to use them in. Every spell must be cast from scratch every time during even the most chaotic battes, it can damage anyone including you and your ""friends"" and every optimal strategy you'll come up with may prove completely ineffective just a few fights later. With every new level and every new boss fight, you will feel like this game is trolling you, but you will enjoy it - the absurd humor of the whole thing is a big factor, as well.Definitely recommended - and best played with ""friends"".

												If you can get past the control scheme there is a good deal of fun to be had here. The humor is reminiscent of Monty Python and has a lot of niche references few will appreciate. This is an indie title with a good deal of polish on it that will reward those who invest time to learn the spell combo system.  That being said, the difficulty gets to frustrating levels mostly due to a less than intuitive control set up. The steep learning curve ultimately made me stop playing. You can't go wrong for the price though. 7/10			"

												WELCOME TO STUPID.  In this game, the first spell you learn is haste to help you run faster.  The second spell you learn is revive, which works for free because you and your friends will kill eachother and yourselves so often.  That is not hyperbole of any kind.  In this game you play as a wizard who summons the forces of the arcane to your beck and call while still being a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ed wizard.  You are made of paper and the world is made of scissors.  The game has a splendid sense of humor to help along a bland story, and teamplay is certainly fun.  Everyone is bound to get their own playstyle due to the sheer variety of the spells available, between personal preference and memory, and between this and the MOBA, the devs really do have a whole heap of love for the game.

												This game is about a mage (or group of mages) going on an epic quest while killing hundreds of creatures with thousand of spell combinations, due to its 8 skill system consisting of various elements such as Fire, Water and Earth. If you ever get tired of killing monsters, you can also kill your friends in story mode! The best part of this game is the references, they are always new references at the corner, whether in achievements, NPC's speeches or weapons, this game does a ton of hilarious references to all kinds of stuff, have fun finding them all! I just think the online mode could be much much better. 8/10			"

												Funny. Entertaining. Awesome. There are a lot of words to describe Magicka and I can assure you very few are negative, especially after a sea of patches. It takes itself seriously in that it wants you to have an enjoyable experience but its wholly lighthearted and satisfyingly gruesome. The game throws at you a huge array of possible spell combinations and rewards experimentation (although sometimes it just makes you feel stupid) as well as giving you an myriad of cool spells to work with. It is an easy to use control system and generally fun although years of shooters have turned my fingers against this game on many occasions. For an indie game is doesn't get much better than Magicka and I think many would agree. Give it a try.			"

												Simply put: Amazing game, fun, new game mechanics, lots of creativity as well.Magicka is a game where 8 elements can be combined to make different kinds of spells. The combinations change the type, size and area of effect of the spell. You follow a story full of refrences to popular culture and varing enemies. The different enemies will be weaker to different spells, but due to the combination systems, occasionally the casting of spells can become repetative once you find most effective spell and crusing through your foes. This can easily be overcome by trying to think of different ways yourself to blast them down.Lots of fun DLC as well, and most of couse, online and LOCAL multiplayer, bringing a friend adds to the excitement and hilarity.

												After getting used to the slightly awkward controls, this game is quite good.You have 10 total elements to use to cast a variety of spells, and you are able to cast the spell on either yourself, the area or in front of you. Friendly fire IS on, so if you have idiot friends that would do that, don't play co-op. The game's DLC is not required at all in the game and doesn't give you a huge advantage if you do get them.

												Magicka proves the statement, that even the strongest basis can prove itself useless at some point. Being an Action-RPG with isometric perspective, Terry Prattchet-esque sense of humour as a selling point and emphasis on cooperative play, that takes place in some fantasy world, surprisingly similiar to what we could see in almost any other fantasy game.  Sounds good? Well, tough ♥♥♥♥♥♥s. Magicka gives a new meaning to the term ""frustratingly hard"", even when played on easiest difficulty. Mostly because of the control system, that seemingly was made by some mental clinic patient, with severe case of ham-handness.  Some may call this ""innovation"" but some can also try putting shattered glass and gravel to their bowl of cereal.While the good game usually cannot stand on single-player only, with some exceptions of course, Magicka has also got a nice selection of multiplayer modes. Being a litle interested in deathmatch mode (or whatever kind of gameplay Magicka has to offer instead), i tried playing it in cooperative mode. And it was only slightly less painful than swallowing a bottle of ""Jack Daniels"" whiskey. What is originaly presented as a coop mode, in the end becomes excruciating cluster-molesting mess that plays as smoothly, as Super Mario on NES, with TV turned upside-down.  Of course, this happens only when you are actually allowed to play, since most of the time network protocol decides to be a total♥♥♥♥♥♥ The main issue with the control system, that it was designed for some alien-like creature. Like any other PC-gamer, i got used to have WASD as movement controls. Frankly, i was unpleasantly surprised, when attempt to move my character with those keys resulted in his/her/it's immidiate and needlessly gory death. Even when i got used to the controls there, i still couldn't fight back properly. And since i've played it in coop mode, i possesed more treat to the other players, than the monsters. Since i've mentioned frustration, that slowly was growing to anger, i cannot leave another deadly sin without mentioning. Greed. Developers of this game really think, that there will be people, willing to spend significant anmount of their disposable income on various robe sets for their protagonists and other DLC's. Needless to say, that majority of DLC's can be called ""overpriced"", just as Magicka itself ""has a couple of pop-culture references"". Not that they would cost too much. They just don't worth it. Maybe this game wasn't meant to be serious. I won't question that. But i also won't question that the term ""game"" means something at least vaguely entertaning to spend time when Magicka utterly fails in this department. If after that someone needs a digital equivalent of my opinion, i'd give it a dead rooster out of 10.			"

												So far, this game has been utterly fantastic. I've been wanting to play it for a while, and I finally picked it up during the winter sales for under $5. I have only gotten around to playing a couple of hours, yet I think it's definitely worth the money I spent on it. I love the concept of mixing together elements to create spells; I felt like there were infinite possibilities as to what I could use to vanquish my foes. The art is pretty good, as well as the music. The various internet and meme refrences were somewhat out of place in my opinion, yet so far they've had me laugh numerous times. I haven't gotten around to trying it out, but the multiplayer looks like a lot of fun. The only downside is that from what I've heard it runs like crap on most decent computers, which hasn't really affected me in any way. Overall, I think it's definitely worth picking up, even three years after its release.			"

												""I advise local just because its one of those games that when your friend kills you, you respond by punching him in the arm.""Magicka, a game about being a wizard with other wizards. This game doesn't really shine to well on the adventure or the arena. It shines brightest with lots of friends. This game did something I haven't seen better, and thats Friendly fire. Its that fact and time of fighting a troll, so you go to throw a massive rock at him, then your friend gets in the way and explodes when you release that rock. Its those times where you plant some mines and a friend steps on them and pings himself into space. its those times where you kill eachother because you want to combine the beams and it fails and everyone gets knocked back and dies. This is a game about killing eachother while trying to complete a mission.The next thing is this game is chocked full of references and jokes. Those jokes that give you a cheap laugh. But really the best way to play this game is with friends and i think locally but online is also availible.

												I know I don't have much time put in but I've played a substantial amount on another friends account. So hear me out. This game.... was made for co op. Seriously. Friends are a blessing, mine especially so please, with tears in my eyes, PLAY THIS WITH YOUR FRIENDS!!!!!!! They will kill you more often than help. It's more fun to kill your friends then the mobs in this game (believe me I know... I was once that guy) and easier, too. So now that that's out of the way, let's get to the review. First of all, pros. The combat is glorious. If you can git gud at tactically mashing buttons in order to get the correct spell that will deal good damage. It's got 8 elements which you will press buttons in order to queue up. certain combinations make different and more devastating spells. There is also the ability to cast Magicks or spells that, instead of firing flame imbued lightning, will cause a thunderstorm or a meteor show and the like. There is also weapon pickups and melee combat. One weapon is an m-84.The game has local coop, even though playing with noob friends is only fun for them (or you if you outcast them) I still see it as an excellent feature that more games should have so it's always a plus in my book. If you have come to a truce and the only time you kill each other is by accident, then you must rely on your friends to cast a Magick in order to respawn you. If you can play tactically, you can make deadly spell combintaions with your friends, to make them more powerful like angling two death beams towards one another will cause them to make an even more powerful beam. Or you can do a combination that instant freezes an enemy your ally can charge up a boulder to shatter the ice encased opponent. The characters and dialogue are comedy gold. Everyone speaks in this rediculous swedish accent and it makes it even better. Story isn't too bad either. It isn't groundbreaking or anything but it's at least entertaining.Music is great and really sets the mood for combat. Has alot of references and secret places where spelltomes are hidden (spelltomes teach you the combinations for new Magicks)So that's all the good stuff. Now for the cons.Cons: ... You idiots actually thought there were cons? LOLMagicka is a great game that I hold very dearly in my heart. 10/10 I got to murder goblins with an M-84 in a game about wizards. As well as a few unfortunate townspersons.			"

												After getting used to the slightly awkward controls, this game is quite good.You have 10 total elements to use to cast a variety of spells, and you are able to cast the spell on either yourself, the area or in front of you. Friendly fire IS on, so if you have idiot friends that would do that, don't play co-op. The game's DLC is not required at all in the game and doesn't give you a huge advantage if you do get them.

												This is a good game that falls short of true greatness due to one fault, at least in single player mode. You can't save, and the auto-save points are too far apart. Moreover, the single-player is difficult, so you die often, which requires you to start a part of the game all over again. Other than that, it is great fun, and I suspect the multiplayer is equally engrossing. Very much worth purchasing especially if you don't mind shutting it down for a while to come back later and retry some of the harder parts.  8/10.			"

												Magicka is not a game you'll wanna play after a long day to relax and unwind. It's hard, it's exhausting, it's punishing, it's intense. And it's extremely fun, especially in co-op.This is the deal: You have 8 elements to conjure, 5 slots to conjure them in, multiple ways of casting them and multiple strategies to use them in. Every spell must be cast from scratch every time during even the most chaotic battes, it can damage anyone including you and your ""friends"" and every optimal strategy you'll come up with may prove completely ineffective just a few fights later. With every new level and every new boss fight, you will feel like this game is trolling you, but you will enjoy it - the absurd humor of the whole thing is a big factor, as well.Definitely recommended - and best played with ""friends"".

												The most creative co-op magic-based game! I love how the first couple of chapters are star wars references and there are alot of movie references such as Platoon, Star Wars, 300 and much more. Would definantly reccomend to play with friends locally with a controller or online!			"

												An amazing and fun game, it takes a bit to get used to everything but when you do it's a very fun game.I like playing this game while watching something since it does not require a lot of attention.The campaign is short but very fun to play through the story is nice too, and for the price of just 10$ it's worth buying for what you get!Gameplay: 9/10Story: 6/10Graphics & Visuals: 8/10Humor: 10/10 Fun: 10/10Replay: 8/10Overall Rating: 8/10 Magicka 2 does have better graphics and better animations but the mechanichs are so different :/I prefer Magicka 1, 2 is a waste of money it's the same story but with better graphics and 1 extra spell combination. And magicka 2 is so much harder to play and can be a pain to beat bosses.So don't get that game, get this one instead! It's cheaper and it's more fun! :D "

												Most games give you a challenge by limiting you. Magicka tries to challenge you without doing that (though the DLCs seems to have strayed from that philosophy.) The game gives you powerful spells, no mana and no cooldown to limit your spellcasting, and yet despite it being pretty much god mode in any other game, still manages to keep you challenged and engaged the entire way through.The DLC ups the ante but, imo, detracted from the original theme by limiting the magicka available to you. If you simply want chaotic fun, the original story mode is still your best bet.			"

												9/10 - fun to play alone, fun to play with friends, and there are hilarious aspects to the game (the ""Swedish"" being spoken in the game is actually Swedish babbling and not a real language, which I, as one who speaks Swedish, find to be hilarious). They add a lot of good little touches to the game and overall did a great job making it. Only problem is that it can be hard to connect with friends over LAN at times; even if the internet is good, it frequently boots people out, requiring you to completely start over.			"

												I'm a psychonaut and magick researcher, I've been through the important stuff from Aleister Crowley to the edgiest chaos magick books. As a professional magus I can say this is a very good game on both the gameplay dynamics and the anti-gameplay ones. The ethereal connections have been cured to the smallest quantum particle, the memes are good and the paradoxes are.I give this game a strong lefunnyreviewxDDD/10			"

 Keep your friends closer and your enemies closer .. unless you can blast them away... or push them towards the edge.. or into a fire wall or just let them drown .  Magicka is all about having fun and imagination. Use the elements provided and kill your enemies .. and friends  Story Magicka got campaign mode : 12 chapters in which you find items and magicks(special kind of spells) . The story is straightforward - world is in danger and you can save it. NPCs treat you as a fodder and make fun of you until you prove how strong you are with your spells. Also game itself make fun of silent protagonists in general. Devs put a lot of different references in the game so you can go and try to hunt them all . Combat Combat feels a bit like ARPG , prepare your weapon, point at the enemy and kill it .. but without the enemy droping any valuable loot. And your weapon is mainly your spells... or a melee weapon you pick from a corpse.. or a machine gun. Spells  Spells is pretty much the only reason you would play this game.You have 2 kinds of spells.Main one is the combination of 5 elements of your choice and then the secondary is magicks found while playing in which you have to pick set elements to make a different kind of skill that isnt part of the basics.But lets start with the first one.You have 10 elements : Water,Fire,Lighting,Earth,Cold,Shield,Arcane,Life,Ice(combination of water + Cold) , Steam ( Fire + Water). You need to have in mind that some elements are opposite to others and they cant coexist in your spell.Another thing to have in mind: each element got its own form so you have to pick carefuly how to create your spell.And last but not least you have 2 ways to cast the spell, either on yourself or somewhere on the screen.Magicks on the other hand got a set elements and form . Some of them affect only specific ... targets like sprint,revive,teleport while others affect the whole screen like Blizzard or Meteor Shower. Now some of the spells are kinda complicated to learn them fast so you might better off writing down somewhere the combination of key presses so you can cast them faster.Another thing worth noticing is that you can be affected by different elements like you can get wet and when you are wet you cant use lighting and if you try to do so you gonna take dmg. You can be wet, ""iced"" or set on fire and in order to remove those you need to cast the opposite element on yourself so... have fun !  Co-op While Solo play is fun, co-op is even better ... because of the moments ""Sorry, I didnt mean to blast you THAT far ."" During co-op there is friendly fire... or more like of insta dead in some cases. While in co-op you can cross beams (ghostbusters anybody?) for stronger effect.. unless you are using opposite elements which lead to someone dying.Teamwork is a must if you want to deal with enemies faster than usual. One thing worth noticing for co-op is that there is no split screen even if you play online Boss Fights The game over a bunch of boss fights which usually requires you to think about what is the opposite element of the boss itself though often several elements will hurting him, there is one that do more damage than the rest. Also have in mind that part of bosses got 1shot skills so .. be careful !!!  Overall Its quite enjoyable game for what is worth and co-op is one of the funniest I played so far. Though solo play is good I suggest you to go for co-op only.			"

												  Seems like a cool concept for a game, but unfortunately the sole reason why I bought it does not function at all.  A friend and I purchased this together long ago with the intent of playing through the co-op mode, but the game freezes at the same point of the tutorial every time. Skipping by this doesn't seem to help. Others don't seem to be having the same problem, but I'd say if you purchase, do so with the intent to enjoy the singleplayer first. The game is still very buggy and prone to strange problems that might not have a fix.  Aside from that, probably the worst thing about it are the memes and referential humor, which exist throughout the game. If you don't like crap like that and you're intent on picking this up, then prepare to groan.			"

												This game is great. The graphics are crisp, sleek, and polished. The content is fine and there are countless DLC's to quenche your thirst if the story finally bores you. Which i doubt it will, as this game is filled with content, humor and excellent gameplay. The gameplay is unique and every player to their own style.  All in all its great but, every game has its bad points. This game is VERY buggy. Most people have trouble starting it up the first time and many times have i lost saves due to buggy levels where i cannot continue. But for its cheap price and its wide availability it is worth it. The fun outweighs the bugs. Get this game. :)Graphics - 8/10Gameplay - 9/10Content - 9/10			"

												What the hell is cooperation?This game is better the more people play, because the more people the more Chaos. You're all little wizards with 8 elements that can combine and be destructive spells. The catch? The spells have equal effects on enemies and Allies. The reult is this game, The second someone is doing good? WHAM! rock to the face. Fighting a boss? Use your friends as a conductor for your lightning.

												This game is hilarious if you're a geek, fantastic humour.  The early levels/tutorial is great, lots of jokes and some puzzles to solve make it seems like a real action adventure game, but outside of those early levels it seems to devolve into something more like Diablo. Lots of combat, very few puzzles outside of figuring out the best way to take down a particular enemy. One bit early on in the tutorial is very confusing though (shift + left click the rope to exit the room - you'll know the one when you're stuck there). I had to look that up on the interwebs, and apparently I am far from the first to have to do so.It feels like more of a casual game than something for serious gamers though. Unfortunately that's a bit misleading because with the real time combat, and multiple elements to combine in the right order to cast a spell it seems to take a serious gamers reflexes, response times, pattern recognition and general skill to accurately/cleverly counter enemies. Luckily for me none of the combat so far has been challening enough that I haven't succeded (after one or more attempts) just by mashing the buttons widly ;P "

												I can't recommend it enough, it doesn't take itself seriously, but who cares, i have played a ton of time in it (look at my play time) and i didn't got bored even for a sec! In singleplayer it is fun, but where it shines REAAAAALLLY!!! is co-op, the fact that friendly fire is on, and you can kill your friend anytime you want to take revenge because he set you on fire accidentially, you can! And it wont cause any problem cause you can just revive him anytime (well if you want to). Game is buggy, true, but there isn't that big or critical bug left, only small ones. 99% of the bugs and glitches are hilarious and not rage-enducing or something like that. I VERY, VERY, VERY!!! much recommend you to get this game, get a friend with you and play it, there is so much content in it for such low price, and dlc-s doesn't cost that much either, they have realistic prices (unlike payday2 dlc prices..) TL;DR Single player is 8/10 co-op is 10+/10 game isn't serious, but VERY hilarious, and funny, you will just cry of laugh almost everytime if you play with someone else.

												On magicka you assume the role of a Wizard, from an order full of them, to go and help the king on his fight against evil monsters. Your journey will be full of dangerous creatures and obstacles that you must overcome to save the world.The game has an incredible sense of humor, you will find yourself laughing at the most simple things. The humor ended up getting a little old to me because I ended up expecting a joke to happear every time a cutcene happened or even when i ended up in a conversation.You have 8 different basic magic to use:Fire,Water,Ice,Eletricity,Life,Dead,Earth,ShieldThen you can combine them giving the game a lot of combat variety.Overall a great game and if you have friends to play It with you then you are going to love It.Pros:+Comedy is everywere +Magic Variety+Lots of fun to play with friendsCons:-Bugs..Bugs EVERYWERE D:-Dificulty doesnt scale with more players, most people wont have that many problems doing adventure mode on solo and if you get friends to play with you the game only gets easier.

												I really want to like this game. It takes me back to the good old days of Gauntlet. You have to be strategic with your moves but keep moving. You have infinite ammo of your chosen weapon. You can have up to three friends with you.But what's killing me is in the 90 minutes I've played of this game, I've already encountered 4 major glitches that forced me to quit to desktop. What a pile of hot garbage. If you think you can deal with a constant barage of BS that's festering over what could be a serviceably fun game, you're a better person than I.			"

												While this is a good idea there are very few times if any that I feel it is my fault when I die. That combined with the limited combinations of magic leads to a short enjoyment at the beginning before frustration sets in. I find that the most common death results from being flung off of cliffs and other insta-kill situations making it more of the environment instead of battle that kills me.			"

												I can't recommend it enough, it doesn't take itself seriously, but who cares, i have played a ton of time in it (look at my play time) and i didn't got bored even for a sec! In singleplayer it is fun, but where it shines REAAAAALLLY!!! is co-op, the fact that friendly fire is on, and you can kill your friend anytime you want to take revenge because he set you on fire accidentially, you can! And it wont cause any problem cause you can just revive him anytime (well if you want to). Game is buggy, true, but there isn't that big or critical bug left, only small ones. 99% of the bugs and glitches are hilarious and not rage-enducing or something like that. I VERY, VERY, VERY!!! much recommend you to get this game, get a friend with you and play it, there is so much content in it for such low price, and dlc-s doesn't cost that much either, they have realistic prices (unlike payday2 dlc prices..) TL;DR Single player is 8/10 co-op is 10+/10 game isn't serious, but VERY hilarious, and funny, you will just cry of laugh almost everytime if you play with someone else. Single palyer is awesome too, just a bit lonely, ONLY A BIT			"

												I enjoyed the game for the free weekend, and liked the large and varied amount of wizard robes,staffs,secondary weapons, and spells, I thought it was fun mixing the spells in combat to find an enemy's weakness and swapping out elements accordingly. The game is filled with humor aimed to parody other series and that is also something I enjoy, I had fun with the game they couple days I had it, I did not get to play it that much but it is definitely a series im going to keep my eye on in the future!

												Magicka is a game with a good concept but poor execution.The game is poorly optimized - it depends on your graphic card, because apparently the game can run choppy even on newer computers.Controls are overcomplicated and feel like not made for fast-paced combat that Magicka is about. The game's mechanics with controls combined can really make you mad.You have 8 button binded to elements usable to create spells; when you are flooded with dozens of enemies there's a high probability you will smash these buttons to spam spells as much as possible. But you really can't since you have to wait for about 1 second to apply an element to spell, which can get really annoying.You press MOUSE3 to use spell on yourself and also use items, like throwing grenade on soldier. Since game doesn't wait for element to be applied when you already pressed a button, just so happens you will often blow up your friends by accident with said grenade.I really didn't like how controls were made, to cast spells you need a total of 13 buttons (if I'm not mistaken) and use them on the fly, when you are trying to deal with a spam of enemies.There's no option to bind your favourite ones to keys, idk why.Your and your teammates' characters are sometimes hard to distinguish when there's a lot of stuff on the screen. I many times had problem to tell if my character is already dead or not, because there's no indication.There's more, but it all leads to frustration.In multiplayer it sometimes lags horribly, sometimes crashes. There's of course times when it works perfectly, too.That said, I can't really recommend Magicka to anyone.			"

I love the casting system... being able to create a nearly endless combination of spells is very cool and challenging.  In my first session, about an hour in, I dropped a massive magic boulder on my head and died.

												Buyer beware, the game idea is novel and it's fun when it works, but both single and multi player are still plagued with connection and optimization issues, it crashes a lot on some system configurations, and the devs are famous for releasing lots of unpolished and/or weak DLCs. Nothing here, the base game nor the DLCs, is worth buying if not at least 75% off.			"

												A decent game, if only the lag issues were fixed. The combination of elements is fun, but the game slows down greatly during battle -- so much so that keyboard input is delayed. Nothing quite like murdering yourself with lightning bolts, even though you told the game to cast several seconds before. A great disappointment, considering the potential.Another big issue is the clipping problems. You cannot pass through enemies, which enables them to corner you and beat you to death. Continously getting knocked down, only to heal when you can stand, scant seconds before being knocked down again, becomes very frustrating. If these two issues were fixed, the game would be nearly perfect. The humor isn't for everyone -- some of it is downright juvenile, overly inspired by Reddit's hivemind -- but the gameplay is phenomenal.			"

												I really wanted to like this game. The premise is fantastic, but the execution is flawed as to make it unplayable for me.The control system is incredibly clunky as is simply moving around and targetting. I'm sure with time and effort this would improve the same way you could get used to having a knife jammed in your ribs.I don't have the time to spend on making the game a playable experience. When I play a game it should be reasonably intuitive and controllable from the outset. This then improves as I get used to it. That is not the case with this game.On top of the control issues is the game performance which is shoddy at best. Frequent graphical glitches and stutters pop up every where you go.Sad for a game that could have been so good.			"

												My first thoughts about this game were like: ""Combining elements to create new spells? Awesome!"", then I bought the game and played it.Combining spells was fun, but I feel like most of them are same, or working really similiar. There are some combinations which creates unique spells and that's it. Also, when you'll find some spell really useful and strong, you'll stop trying new combos, because you have one.I have friends to play with, but there's one problem. Multiplayer is so buggy! We couldn't play arenas or campaign, because loading took forever or suddenly your friend stops doing anything and just walks.Humour in this game is good. There's so many references.So, if you still want to play this game, be sure to get some friends. Single player is boring, multiplayer is the only way you can have fun unless bugs will interfere into game. Somehow, I regret buying this game.			"

												Magicka is a cooperative, top-down action game where players use fusions of different elements to cast custom attacks or ""Magicks,"" the game's equivalent of spells. This game is best for cooperative play; I wouldn't buy it for single player. I had very mixed feelings about this game overall and am not sure whether or not to recommend it.Pros:+Really unique and entertaining combat system. There are eight ""elements"": arcane, heal, water, lightning, cold, fire, rock, and shield. The player buffers any combination of these elements of their choosing (experimentation is part of the game) and casts it as an attack to see what happens. Attacks can be cast in a specific direction or as an AOE attack in all directions. Elements can also be cast on oneself; some examples of this would be using combinations with shield or heal on yourself. In addition to this, there are a series of ""Magicks,"" which are basically a pre-determined order of elements; creating the specific order allows the player to cast that Magick. I really liked this combat system and in my opinion it was the game's saving grace. There is lots of experimentation available and each Magick has its own cool effect.+Above average amount of content for a $10 game. The story mode took my friend and I over 12 hours apparently, although we were probably a little slow. There is a versus mode and survival challenge as well as some support for online play (although I haven't tested it).Cons:-The humor is dumb. It had its funny moments but was also kind of... meh.-There isn't much artistic value to the game. The menu art is not particularly attractive and the silly story leans completely on the humor... see the previous bullet point.-The game is pretty buggy. There is one bug in particular that causes a level to crash in the same spot every time. If you don't know the trick for getting past this bug, it basically means the game is impossible to complete. Even if you Google it and use the trick, it means skipping a battle where you are supposed to unlock one of the best Magicks. The opportunity to learn that Magick is permanently lost. This is not the only annoying bug, but it's definitely the worst one. NOTE: See the end of the review for the trick for getting past this glitch.-The game's menu navigation is a nightmare. Honestly, the menus in this game are just a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥to navigate. There aren't any real bugs, it's just bad user-friendliness. The first couple times I played this game the biggest challenge was getting past the startup menu.-The difficulty is not well balanced. One boss will be mega hard, the next will be a walk in the park. Some of the bosses have some ""trick"" or special combination of elements that makes them super easy, but if you don't find that special trick they are annoyingly hard. One of the game's bosses in particular was nearly impossible for my friend and I, and then out of sheer luck we ended up suddenly winning. We merely got lucky, having picked one particular combo of elements, and suddenly the boss became a one-hit kill.-The game has a the makings of a party game; it's designed so there will be occasional team kills in humorous ways. Some of the enemy attacks are designed to be unfair or OP to compensate for the fact that any player can revive a teammate instantly after their death. This is all fine; if done correctly it leads to a humorous and fun casual experience. But when some of the unbalanced parts of the game (see previous bullet point) come to play, these humorous elements turn from entertaining to tiresome and annoying.All in all, I thought this game created a unique and fun style of gameplay. The way players buffer up elements in an order of their choosing is a lot of fun. But other than that the game really has very little going for it. I was heavily undecided whether or not to recommend it, but overall I think the cons outweigh the pros.For getting past the crash glitch: This glitch happens in a swampy looking area. You reach a rundown old church. When you enter the church, a difficult battle ensues, where the best way to win the battle is to grab the Magick at the edge of the room, which allows you to summon friendly zombies. If you win this battle and exit, the game crashes, and restarting brings you back to the last checkpoint, in front of the church. The way my friend and I got past this bug (after having it crash on us multiple times) is by teleporting (there is a teleport Magick) through a stone wall on the right side of the church. I didn't come up with this, I found it online. This is the equivalent of coming out on the other side after the battle, but it means you can never unlock the Magick hidden in the church.			"

												I bought this game and turned out to be one of many people who had a bug with super low frame rate.The developers know this bug exists but don't provide sollutions, thank god gamers and people who know more then most people about computers give a lot of tips and for many people there is a fix, but I tried every single last one of them but it didn't help.Offcourse I also tried verifying game cache integrity, reinstalling, all the usual stuff.After that all failed I contacted the developer, they quickly responded that I needed to contact the distributor. Offcourse Steam doesn't do refunds so that's the only party I could contact. At first I got the PR e-mail from the dev. and I got a very polite response within 2 hours. Then I got the support e-mail from PR and e-mailed them. After waiting for many days I got a response if I wanted to send them some info about my computer. It appeared to have a graphics card that has VRAM with a sliiiiiiiiightly lower clock speed while it was much more modern and performed much better. In their eyes this prevented me from being eligable for getting a refund. I explained that how horrible the performance was had to do with something else then just my graphics card, my computer couldn't even run winamp and play an MP3 anymore as it took all 4 gb's of ram and 98% of my processor.(Got a fresh install of windows so everything is still running super efficiently)I also explained to them that this is a common problem that is admitted by the developers. They ignored that part, told me after 10 days of horrible discussing that they don't do refunds and never replied after that. By the way I never said I wanted a refund, I wanted the game to work and if that wern't possible a refund would be fine, but that was never the main goal. But they refused to help me and even when I convinced them my computer wasn't the problem their only response was 'We do not handle refunds directly, you have to turn to the seller to request a refund.' and they never got back to me.So I strongly recommend against this game. I'm sure it's a fun game but we shouldn't support distributors like that.Edit: I got a new pc on which it works... Nah it's not that fun either. Awkard♥♥♥♥♥controls. Lóve the concept, not a fan of the execution.			"

												Magicka is not a traditional game, and I laud it for its use of new mechanics and great humor in order to provide a fun and unique game experience. However, the game has enough caveats to it that I cannot heartily recommend it. For one thing, if you have a low end computer that just barely meets the minimum requirements to play it, stay away from this game; its optimization is very poor and and it will crash on startup if you try playing it on such a system. Additionally, this is a game that really shines with friends, and will not be that much fun if you play it without at least one friend. The game is also notoriously buggy, especially in multiplayer (I swear at least a third of my gameplay time was just spent trying to connect to my friends after game crashes). There's a good game hiding behind these issues, but there are so many of them and they are so blatant that they prevent this game from being the great game it could have been. As is, it's a good sale buy. P.S., Many people rag on this game for its absurd number of DLC's, but there are only four or so that are actual campaigns; the rest are just skins and challenge maps that are completely skippable.

												Magicka has become quite popular over the time for it's unique gameplay and humor. The basic premise is that you assume the role of a wizard and combine spells in order to defeat hordes of monsters and bosses, all in a cooperative manner. The unique spell system where you combine different elements and cast them in different manners sound really intruiging, furthermore you can play with your friends. But is the game any good? Personally I think it's highly overrated, the gameplay seems fun at first but is really frustrating and annoying to me. Combining elements does require a lot of skill but it often feels more like a hassle and it's really painful to pull off the spells. Often you just tend to mess up your spell due to the bad controls. The movement and controls feel really sluggish which take a lot from the fun, it's more frustrating to navigate the map and cast some spells than actual fun. Furthermore if you play with friends it just becomes  a huge uncontrollable mess. Overall the game feels poorly optimized and still suffers from numerous bugs, there has never been a session where I didn't encounter a bug or issues.The campaign is nice and offers a lot of humor but very often it's pretty silly and the game tries to desperately to sell around all the references and internet jokes. It's funny at first but gets annoying really fast. The fuzz around the game is more entertaining the the actual game itself.Get the newest Magicka, I don't recommend this game.			"

Levels are colorful and detailed with a design that rewards curiosity and exploration. Combat is entertaining (when it works)Any fun you might have will be overshadowed by glaring technical issues.[UPDATE] After being patched (a few times) performance is acceptable on my machine. Still a gamble from a purchase standpoint. Wouldn't guarantee that it will work on anyone else's machine. I wish that I could rate this as a ""maybe"".			"

I'm shutting down anyways.""I get home from work eager to play and when I try to run the game it starts in Task Manager but the game doesn't launch on screen.I've tried every fix for the last two hours. I verified the game cache. I reinstalled twice. I ran the two programs in the dependencies folders in the game's files. I give up. I DO NOT recommend this game. It wouldn't run on my laptop (I understand they have a problem with integrated graphics but it's not like this game is graphically instensive) and now it will not run on my gaming PC for some reason.

												I really wanted to like this game because the concept is really cool. The system of combining spells is really awesome, and I was excited to try the game out for this reason in particular. However I quickly realized that I could just roll through level after level by spamming the same spell over and over. It wasn't challenging at all. Having a cooldown would help a lot. I'll give the game the benefit of the doubt that it requires you to mix up the spells as you progress further and enemies become tougher, but after 75 minutes of playing I was ""defeated"" while a cutscene was playing, so I got frustrated and uninstalled. 4 player co-op is a nice plus to the game. It's always cheap, $10 full price and often $2.50 during Steam sales, so it can't hurt to try the game out for yourself. I can't give it a positive review unfortunately.			"

												It's a really fun concept, but it quickly dies.It's so awesome to have so much magic at your disposal with just the click of a key, and have so many crazy combos to use on those damn goblins. However, I quickly found the two or three combos that worked best, slash actually killed bad guys, and then the game just turned into ""how quickly can I mash my combo against all these bad guys"" and the fun dropped as if from the face of a cliff.Basically it's a great concept, but it falls short.

												Maybe its just me - but I found this game to be really hard.  The controls are a little odd, but I got stuck on just chapter 3 (of ten?) and decided that due to the difficulty the game is unplayable for me.  I actually thought it was quite fun but I grew tired of playing each fight 10+ times just to win.  The game doesn't have any diffuclty settings so I cannot select ""easy.""  Normally I find games to be fairly easy, so I wouldn't say its just because I suck.  There is an online mode to play coop - but there aren't enough online players to get anyone to join.Overall I thought the game was fun; but due to the limited graphics, wonky controls, and lack of difficulty settings, I have to vote thumbs down here.

												The idea of combining spell is great at first but as play time goes on you'll find that the spells are practically the same thing.And the DLCs are just rip off. Get it on discount.其实各种魔法都差不多，特别是攻击类的，看似组合很多，其实都是一样的东西。DLC巨多巨坑。非土豪请自重打折再买。			"

Whisk through to remove any lumps.Cream together butter and cocoa powder until well-combined.Add sugar and milk to cocoa mixture by adding 1 cup of sugar followed by about a tablespoon of milk. After each addition has been combined, turn mixer onto a high speed for about a minute. Repeat until all sugar and milk have been added.Add vanilla extract and espresso powder and combine well.If frosting appears too dry, add more milk, a tablespoon at a time until it reaches the right consistency. If it appears to wet and does not hold its form, add more confectioner’s sugar, a tablespoon at a time until it reaches the right consistency.Now back to the cakeCAKE INSTRUCTIONS:Preheat oven to 350º F.

												A very fun unique game that has a light hearted but entertaining story line. The option to combine multiple spells and make a completly different spell is a very cool feature this game has but i always wanted to play multiplayer and it never worked. I very, very, very, rarely found a multiplayer pvp game, i think i may have gotten to play one the entire time i was playing this game.The co-op you were able to find a couple people playing every now and then but i would not recommend this game if you are looking for any type of functioning multiplayer. Unfortunately that is what i wanted to play the most in this game so i can not recommend this game unless you want a single player only experience.			"

												How this game ever got popular I'll never know.  What with its performance (Why my computer has performance issues with this game and can pay Skyrim fine is beyond me) and interface (Why for the love of Fate do I have to exit out of the game and go to the main menu to change graphic and control settings?) issues.Although I will be the first to admit the game had potential, but it squandered it with the aforementioned issues.  Heck the game wasn't even properly prepared for Steam (which is evident in the fact I have to disable the overlay in order to even play it.)Anyway take my advice if you want a good difficult RPG get Dungeons of Dredmor and skip on this.

												Compared to other diablo-like action RPG's, Magicka focuses less on the RPG elements (no stat points to distribute, no levels to go up, no skill trees to follow) and is set up as more of an arcade experience. You will find weapons and staves to acquire, but other than that you'll be relying on the game's ultra-flexible magic system, where different elements can be combined as you see fit for different effects, and cast in different forms, while more specific, special,  powerful spells such as summoning or full-screen weather effects can be acquired through the course of play.The game shines the most in the multiplayer experience, where friendly fire is always on and exploding your friends in the most catastrophically unfortunate manner possible is both hilarious and easily reconciled with a simple revive spell.This is the sort of thing you and your friends will play whenever you've got nothing better to do, and just looking for some casual mayhem to pass the time.

Buggy as a Bethesda game, unpolished gameplay, slow and clunky, and flat out unfair and 8bit cheesy at times.  Be prepared to have your char get ""stuck"" in mid cast and not be able to do anything other than die.  When fighting multiple enemies if you get hit with any kind of knock down attack you will never get up again.  You will be hit with the same move over and over until you are dead, then revived right in the same situation.  You will have no chance to move or do anything other than die the same way again.  Many cinema scenes cannot be skipped and you have to sit through them again and again when you die over and over trying to ""get"" what the designers failed to communicate to you.

												Wizards have always been in a rut when it comes to games. They're portrayed as miracle workers; quick-witted masters of arcane elements. What wizards are handled as, though, are simple glass cannons -- frail men with a limited attack pool governed by arbitrary numbers and points. The player is forced to forsee several actions and plan ahead, all to achieve the same effectiveness as the burly fighters who charge headfirst into the fray like a bloodthirsty, brain-dead zombie.Magicka is the first game I've played to do wizarding right. Magicka puts you in the role of a rookie wizard, and you progress through the game not by leveling up or watching a magic meter, but through experimenting with combining the eight elements you are given, much like you would expect a real wizard to. What happens when you mix fire and water? Does lightning do more damage than earth? Can you add cold to this spell to make it more effective? You can use all elements infinitely, so the only limit to what you do is what you have yet to try.That's just the casting mechanics. Mix it in with the tongue-in-cheek style of the world of Midgard, based on Scandinavian mythology and driven by pop-culture references. This game has many moments, from hilarious tributes to many fandoms to the excitement of perfecting your favorite spell. It was well worth my time and money.			"

												This game is uncompromisingly bad. It has way too many bugs to even be listed, the sad part is that this game does have a novel way to use magic that's fairly fun. However that is all it has.The control scheme is horrible. Next time use the WASD to move or have movement work like it does in any other isometric action RPG. There is a reason Diablo is a top seller still. It's controls are not slow and clunky. You cannot cast spells preemptively requiring you use them as soon as combat starts or your move speed slows to a snails pace (and here I thought you couldn't move slower). The bugs are so damn numerous. You have one that made Steam crash and I was unable to connect to the network short of resetting my net options for TCP/IP connections in my admin page. Another where the game suddenly cannot be interacted with forcing you to control-alt-delete to escape it. Another game breaking bug is that joining or hosting multiplayer may cause the game to randomly crash on it's own merit if not require you restart the game because someone left or you crashed. That's right, if you were in the game and your friend crashed restart it now, because simply rejoining is not possible. Another bug is that it crashed so hard my computer restarted itself. This game is crap. I do not know how this could be considered a release let alone worth any money. This software is hideously broken. The worst part is that no attempt to fix these game breaking bugs and bad design decisions has been made. You must still hold the mouse button down to move and movement is clunky and hard to control in tight spaces and around corners. Bugs keep showing up and rearing their ugly head to make the game suddenly unplayable, and the worst offense is that people keep hoisting this game up as if it's the pinnacle of gaming. This game is bad, broken, and needs to be taken off of Steam until it's actually fixed and playable. Games like this are the reason Steam needs quality control. The kicker? This game was gifted to me and I still feel as if I was ripped off and cheated. It takes a special kind of broken to make a person feel shafted after getting something for free.			"

												I wanted to like this game. The spellcasting system should make it a home run almost by default. You can combine up to 5 choices between up to 8 elements. It's not quite 32,768 permutations--order rarely matters, some pairs of elements can't be combined, and repeating an element doesn't usually change much--but it's still a system with a lot of room for creative tactics.Despite that awesome foundation, the mechanics of the game are just too clunky to be enjoyable. The action feels very chaotic and random, and the controls feel unreliable. To give a few examples:If you get knocked off your feet, you can still cast a healing or shielding spell on yourself...sometimes.If you mistype a long combination, you can't cancel it; you have to cast the spell before you can start another.In certain fights, the camera will take a fixed angle that leaves critical parts of the battlefield offscreen or nearly offscreen.I should note that I haven't played this game in multiplayer, and it may be more enjoyable there. Getting thrown off the level for the fifteenth time in a single fight might not be so bad if you have a buddy there to immediately cast Revive on you. As a single player game, though, I really can't recommend this.			"

												Magicka. Dont recommend it, unless you have met certain conditions.First of all: This isnt a normal game made by a normal company. It is a suprise hit, made by eight students of a swedish university, that sold over 200.000 times during the first 17 days.Knowing this, you can imagine the release was BUGGY AS HELL. While most of the critical bugs got fixed as the popularity and playerbase grew, some remain to this day and probably will never be fixed.Due to its nature, Magicka has some flaws, like missing hotjoin. You cannot join online games, that are already past the lobby and running. With the now very shrunken playerbase, public-online gaming with random people is almost impossible.If you want to buy and play this game now, you MUST make sure to have some steam-friends who also play Magicka and these friends REALLY should live close to your location.Best chances are to play with people in your country, crossing one country (Germany -> Spain) may also work, but connecting to games over the Atlantic for example (Europe -> USA) WILL be almost impossible. Insane lag, bugs, constant crashes will be your fate.EVEN when you play with the person next door, there is a chance that the game refuses to work. You may play EVERYTHING with that one friend without any problems, except for this one map, who constantly crashes.You may try a campaign map, it constantly crashes. You try it again four hours later and suddenly it works and you can play with your team. Its really random. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesnt.TL;DR: DO NOT buy this UNLESS you have STEAM-FRIENDS who also play it and live NEAR your location.			"

Trying to cast spells in the heat of battle is frustrating and feels more like work I played the demo but this wasn't a good representation of what you will encounter later in the game, that is strong and large mobs which need frequent powerfull (read more complex combinations) spells to deal with. Everytime you use a spell you need to type in the combination, mobs will get to you in no time and pressure you to type those combos like a madman. There are no spell slots where you can save spells. I play these types of games for relaxation, but this game does the opposite. I have only played in coop mode btw and would not recommend this for singleplayer. This is not a bad game but definitely not for me due to the casting mechanics and can't recommend it.			"

												With the sheer number of enemies you have coming at you all the time it doesn't seem very viable to play 1P on this game.That said I played through it with a friend and it kicked♥♥♥♥♥ Don't let the isometric camera and sheer number of spells/combinations turn you away--it's very overwhelming at first but you grow into it fairly quick. Press w + e + right click to not die.			"

												Paradox Interactive, the minds behind the popular Mount and Blade series and more grand strategy titles than you could shake Stalin's bushy ‘tache at, have taken a massive step away from their usual romp through history to produce a game that is not only unique and fresh but also offers hilariously explosive fun.  Magicka is Paradox Interactive's latest attempt at taking over yet another genre.  Having succeeded many times in the grand strategy genre and making a huge impact within the RPG genre with Mount and Blade, Paradox Interactive now bring Magicka to the table.Magicka is a cute yet oddly violent and often explodey third-person action adventure wizard-‘em-up.  Quite a mouthful, but it’s a formula that is not only unique but also a whole lot of fun.  Taking place in a fantasy world, Magicka puts you and up to three friends in the mucky boots of four wizards as they set out from the comfort of their grand castle to take on the forces of darkness.  While this might seem all too familiar to the average fantasy fan, it's more Pratchett than Tolkien with the fantasy setting mixed in with vast amounts of witty humor that'll keep you laughing all through its ten-hour campaign.

												FUN PARTThe game definitely has potential: no mana bars or skill trees. You learn new spells by making combos out of life, fire, water, earth, lightning, arcane and shields. For instance, cast water + arcane (for longer distance) on a target. While the target is all wet, cast frost+arcane to freeze it for greater damage. Some untested combos may kill you or throw you off the map so be careful!MANY BUGSBut, man, the bugs are annoying! How about getting stuck in cutscene view when goblins arrive in town? They are hitting on you while you stand in your ""shiny robes"" unable to do anything! It is even impossible to end the cutscene view or anything. How about the starting area where you have to press Shift to activate your secondary weapon in order to destroy the bar that prevents you from progressing into the dungeon while the game tells you to cast life on yourself? Totally not helpful.Then Magicks. Gimmick spells that you learn, spells of great importance. The game says press Space Bar to cast them but apparently nothing or not much happens. Or a magick can get stuck in locked-and-ready to fire mode and you cannot use it.ITEMSI have no idea how to compare the items that I sometimes find with the items that I have already. No inventory it seems. Too many innovations in this aspect of the game.DLCApparently there are many DLCs for this game and you can see it already in the main menu. Many parts of the main menu are locked because you haven't bought DLC. Not subtle! Frustrating.			"

												This game sucks.By that I mean that despite the excitement of a flexible spell casting system and destroying of whatever-it-is-this-week-that's-causing trouble, the game is a total pain in the♥♥♥♥♥ It throws you up against enemies that are more than capable of disarming you, make it very easy to open the stupid equipment/TAB dialog while in battle, allows you to be pushed off cliffs, knocked off airships (and respawned off the ship), and insists that you drown in any convenient puddle.I'll admit it's a little fun, but the story is crap and the game is out to kill you by making it impossible to win. Having the goblins be able to climb on your head is a 'feature' that should never have been implemented.			"

												I get that this game is absolutely hilarious, but the broken, unbalanced physics of combat makes this game almost not worth the inexpensive price it is. The controls are not very intuitive as it is, and being blown to and fro across the screen (if you don’t die on the spot), makes this one of the most frustrating, time wasting short games I've played in recent times. There are literally parts where you have enough time to cast one quick spell, then die no matter what the spell was, because you can’t protect yourself from the multitudes of bad interactions in the game.Buy it for the laughs, and… well... hope you get far enough to get them.

												Magicka is a 4 player co-op game where players create combos of spell powers to summon dastardly effects. The game is heavy on humor with oodles of references to popular culture and previous medieval fantasy games. However this game's recommendation doesn't come lightly. While I do like Magicka it is a very difficult game, especially as it goes on. Play it wtih 3 others that know what they're doing, and I hope you can stand the bugs. This game is as buggy as they come and it still hasn't been completely fixed.			"

												tried to get into it, but too hard to. Extremely glitchy, poor map mechanics (the rotating island in chapter 6... I literally cannot walk ON it - checked a walkthrough and the guy has no problem walking on it but when I TRY my character just walks right through the island like it's not there and plummets to his death.) The concept is great and lots of fun - casting spells can take some getting used to but isn't impossible to get the hang of. Combat can get a bit silly sometimes (wall, bombs, wall, bombs....rinse repeat) but the storyline is very well written. Doesn't matter how GOOD the storyline and idea is though, if the game is so glitchy you can't even play it (my laptop crashes everytime it tries to load chapter two, my desktop got me to chapter 6, with the rotating platform that can't be stepped on regardless of its alignment...) so disappointing.

												I would recommend this game otherwise, but some levels are 99%. At chapter 6 where I encounter the purple wizard and have to beat him in mind game it's impossible. Firstly it has est. 4 different parts and you have to stay alive all of them.Sounds easyFirst is possible but you can still get one-shotted by multi-attacks npcs makeSecond is easier because there's only half of the wizards from previous and if you kill them quickly you can continue. Sometimes they though shoot projectiles through stone wallsThird one is harder because more difficult wizardsAND NOW IS THE  ♥♥♥♥♥EST PART OF THIS GAMEThere's only 2 wizards and looks easyexcept that both of them spawn 8 undead ghouls that surround you. And their attacks poison. That means instant healing. During repeative healing you should also try to killthe ghouls and the wizards but how. You are in the weaker position. Stone armor isnt a option because for some reason it wont protect from physical poison attacks and you cant heal while wearing it.SolutionDONT BUY THIS GAME "

												Socially acceptable review: Used a sausage on a stick to kill an army of orcs. 2319041347137/10(Unrelated, but I AM willing to host any adventure/challenge maps if anyone else is actually reading the review.) Actual Review: When it first came out, Magicka was so buggy that spiders poured out of every orifice. Now, today, the community has been killed, gutted, and cooked over the grim reaper's campfire. There are at least a few other people out there, and I hope people buy this game in hopes that Magicka 2 will have an early release date. Now, the game is 99.99% bug free. The last 0.01% are spiders in-game. The developers even released free DLC giving us a few new wizard models, and weapons and such as an apology for the bugginess. (Microsoft joke). This game is funny, unforgiving, and has 2 Legend of Zelda references in it, along with a bunch of other references people like me don't get. Number Review: 8.5 (High-fiving batman while riding a rainbow shark into mordor, smelling like a public toilet)Look up some videos, and if it tickles your fancy, buy it. And if you do get it, and want a co-op partner which won't attempt to murder you at the drop of a hat, message me. Yeah, I hate PVP.			"

												OMG! I just started playing this and it is NOTHING like the other RPGs! FREAKING AWESOME!  First off, you have a slew capabilities from the begining, which means if you can figure out how to cast a spell, you can cast it!  The game is very open ended in the casting system which does take some practice and coordination.  By being so open ended it makes the gameplay very fun... often from the mistakes you make.  So far the story line is interesting and always humorous.  I think this will be a great game for casual and hardcore gamers alike.			"

												A game that is only worth playing with friends who enjoy killing each other more than the ever-present enemy. Rife with game-breaking and game-enhancing bugs all the like, it appeals to the ideology that ""it isn't a good game without game-breaking glitches.""That being said, the impressive and admittedly overbearing breadth of spells available to each hapless mage offers a bold experience for hardcore gamers while also allowing the rest of us filthy casuals to spam one or two of our favorite overpowered spell combinations. The game offers an incredible amount of frustration at times that eventually become so hilarious that you don't even care anymore and come to terms of the frustration being a core feature of the game. I rate Magicka 5 out of 8 vortex portals. Fun for $2, regrettable for $10.			"

												With one of the wildest concepts from an Indie developer, the game borrows heavily from Diablo elements with Kirby and the Crystal Shards. Sounds interesting, doesn't it?The combat system revolves around 8 different elements that are combined to make spells, each of with can be casted in different ways (from cast upon self, cast towards direction of cursor, to enchanting weapons). The combat system is like no others, and is one of the most unique AND one of the best fun I've had! This game is a MUST Play simply because of this mechanic.But the game itself offers a lot more. There are references to tons of internet phenomena, and even makes fun of itself. Its graphics are amazing and fits the theme very well. And, with utmost respect as a gamer and part game-developer, the difficulty curve and challenge of putting so many different combinations of spells and AI is done AMAZINGLY well. So Kudos to the dev team!There are issues with the game, sure. As I'm typing this, I'm trying to get chapter 10 to NOT crash on me <_<. But the problem is greatly overruled by its awesomeness. So, BUY THIS NOW!			"

												Good, but could be betterMany different magic combinations, a funny storyline, excelent graphics, good to play with friends. But it requires a quality video card, even with reduced in-game effects. Also, 75% of the game is DLC.If you have money and time to spend, buy it. If you don't, add it to your wishlist and buy it when it's on sale. But don't miss it!Recommended to play with friends.			"

												When they say ""Integrated video cards not recommended,"" that's an understatement.I have 4 GB of RAM, a 2.4 GHz duo core, and Intel Graphics 3000. Intel integrated graphics are pretty bad, but I can usually run League of Legends at playable FPS (on minimum graphics settings). Simple isometric games like this are usually little to no problem to run on minimum graphics settings.This game was a huge problem though. Movement is extremely choppy. The game freezes for a bit when I cast fire. Worst of all, the next event happened: the ""Particles"" setting was set to off by default. I changed it to ""Low"" thinking I could run the game ok. After I couldn't, I tried to change it back to off. It wouldn't go lower than ""Low."" Either it was glitched in the first place to allow Particles to be off, or it glitched and wouldn't change it back.Another glitch: When making my character, I decided to be the Cyber Robe because that sounded cool. At the beginning  of the tutorial, you fall and take damage. They told me to use the heal staff to heal myself. I kept trying and it didn't do anything. I finally deduced that it was because my character was a cyborg and immune to heals. Why would the programmers allow you to pick a character immune to healing, but not adjust the tutorial depending on your class? Lazy tutorial writing, if you ask me.			"

												The tale is more concerned with squeezing in as many Star Wars, Star Trek, 300, Back to the Future, Monty Python and Diablo references than anything else. Any cultured nerd will get a kick out of the character chatter and storybook presentation. Magicka's spell system allows for a wealth of experimentation and gleeful discovery. It's an action role-playing game, but there's no experience is awarded for making kills, there's no leveling, and there's no money to collect. Instead, Magicka focuses on combining magical elements to produce dramatically different effects. Playing Magicka isn't about going through the motions with a control scheme you've used a thousand times before. It requires some reflex training that can reward you with wildly entertaining success on the field of battle.			"
