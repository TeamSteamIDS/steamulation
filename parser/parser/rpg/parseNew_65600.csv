												BEWARE: This is not a patch or updated version of Gothic 3 as the description makes it sound. It is a quickly produced and shoddily written expansion that improves little to nothing about the game. This is the product that forced the developer to leave their publisher and start the Risen series, so I guess in that regard it could be seen as historical.The script is BAD even for a Gothic / Risen game. Some of the dialogue is like a bad english puzzle. Even in its native German I can guarantee you the script was garbage because if you take away the poor grammar and apocalyptic voice acting, it's still boring and uninformative.The map is the same as in Gothic 3 they just lock off Varant and Nordmarr. Pretty lazy. The quests are WoW type ""go and get this"" or ""go and kill this"".I loved Gothic 3 but I can't play this POS for more than 15 minutes. I've tried 3 times.			"

												This game is fun if you like to be immersed in rpgs and can deal with immersion breaking bugs. It has everything you would see in a good rpg. The bugs can be pretty bad though, like you can skip entirely to the end of the game without completing the story line and you can do it on accident, which is what lead me to quit playing as once i did this i couldnt go back and finish the story line. I like how it is open world, full loot, and open dialouge even though the choices made doesnt affect much. Overall it is a good game and should atlest be checked out but beware, the gamebreaking bugs and flaws may turn some gamers away. This is definitely for only the hardest of hardcore rpg gamers. 6/10			"

												Honestly, I don't know how this game is not talked about more. I would put this in the RPG genre, but its like something more interesting because its like the base/basic feel of our modern RPG's only grandfathered and skill toned in a way that suprised me to play for as long as I did. ALSO if you do play save often, those damn lizards in the tunnels kept making me load back to the forest area, ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s. I would not recommend it, exept for the fact it has a unique and similar feel towards my favorite title genres (Skyrim, Final Fantasy). You play as this one guy however, so don't be suprised. Good game. Worth it if you get for like $5 on steam.			"

												G3:FF attempts to provide some closure to the Gothic series where no closure was really needed. G3 wrapped up the nameless hero's journey well enough. Now, a developer that isn't Piranha Bytes, throws him back into the world of Myrtana with a wildly different personality so he can deal with new and equally unfounded conflicts that have arisen in his absence.

												While it has its problems, the Gothic series, including this one, are some of my favorite games. The UI for inventory, trading, crafting, and skill development remain the easiest to use that I've seen in any RPG. Especially love how the inventory is automatically categorized. The soundtrack is pretty good too. I also like that you have a choice in combat as whether or not to kill an NPC or just vanquish him/her. Yes it has bugs, but not to the extent where I can't enjoy the experience.			"

												This game feels like it was made as a total conversion modification for the original Gothic 3, like Nehrim was for Oblivion. It uses all the assets of the original to do something new - in this case to continue the story after Gothic 3 ended. To me it shows all the characteristics of user made content. All, except the love for the original game. The world feels empty, the hero is an arrogant b***h (though somewhat understandably given the story) and you are limited by basically nothing.I am not sure if I should rate it down or stay neutral....

												I've played this right after the Gothic 3. Before that, I didn't recognize how bad this addon is. Many things are ruined: image quality and perfomance is bad, conversations are primitive, script looks like hastily written. But worst of all I consider a heavy altered personality of the Hero and his friends. Whoever wrote a story probably didn't know much about Gothic. Sad. I've expected this game to be at least as good as Gothic 3 or even better. This time even the community patch won't help much.			"

												As quite a fan of the Gothic series I can tell you this game is not worth buying. The voices are all messed up, the dubbing is bad. The quests are like something a small child would make. This is not a follow on of Gothic 3 its a supreme turd.Although there is some merits to be had with the (Verrry slightly) better graphics they have made the main character a prize ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ who isnt likable anymore. The main characters which the game was built on (Your companions Lester/Diego/Gorn/Milton etc etc) Are all messed up with voices from hell. The combat system seems counter intuitive and just feels wrong continually.I say this as someone who has completed Gothic 1 as all camps, Gothic 2 as Mercenaries/Fire mage/Paladin, and Gothic 3 as the Innos ending and the Beliar ending. So I think i know the game fairly well.This isnt Gothic its some random wannabe. Be warned if you buy this it is not Gothic as we know it.			"

												I will say up front that I really wanted to like this game. I played Gothic 2 and, though I found the game difficult, ended up enjoying it greatly. I anticipated Gothic 3 would be another open-world fantasy game with better graphics that would, like the prior game, rise above its flaws. I was mistaken in my anticipation. Unlike Gothic 2, which was greater than the sum of its parts, Gothic 3 is merely the sum of its parts, some good, many flawed.The graphics are nice, but the animation is bizarre. The game writing and voice work is poor, resulting in real problems with immersion. The game doesn't telegraph well what you are supposed to be doing and how to interact with the world and the various items you'll pick up. These are all forgivable and leftovers from the previous game. Worst of all, however, is the combat mechanic. Gothic 2 was a little wonky in combat, but it all worked out. Gothic 3 does not work out. Combat is how you advance your character and interact with the world, and it is the most distancing and alienating part of the game.Also, I didn't read well enough and picked up both Gothic 3 AND the Forsaken Gods Enhanced Edition. That was pointless. They're both pretty much the same game, with the latter being slightly upgraded. Thank goodness for massive sales. I would otherwise have been pretty angry.If you like open-world fantasy games and have run out of entries from Bethesda, this game might be worth trying on a major sale, but chances are you'll end up disappointed. Sure, the lack of polish is annoying, but the actual gameplay mechanics themselves are just not there, leading, ultimately, to little desire to keep playing.			"

United Myrtana: WingGothic 3: Forsaken Gods is independent DLC to Gothic 3, game itself wasn't made by our loved Pirahna Bytes, it was made by Indian firm Trine Games. Game was released on 21 of November 2008. The game continues the story of Gothic 3 from the Adanos Ending.Story & CharactersIn the land of Myrtana rules the peace, until Thorus and his Orc Army decides to start a war. When our protagonist awakes after fight with Xardas, he discovers that Myrtana has been divided betweenLee - Rules VengardThorus - Rules Trelis and OrcsInog & Anog - Rules Silden and GeldernGorn - Rules GothaAs you will see, the rebels caves from Gothic 3 - Okara, Nemora and Reddock will be emptied, the wild fauna took control of'em - Wolves, Goblins etc. etc.General ThingsAt the start, game can be pretty boring, but play, you'll be pretty surprised about progress of story and plot twist at the endFight system is pretty different from Gothic 3, in mentioned game you could just spam LMB and kill many things, but here if you'll spam - enemies will stand like rocks and if you'll still attack as crazy, they'll hardly counter-attack you.SUMMARYGameplay - 7/10 - Fight system different from G3, cool culmination of Gothic Saga, kinda boringAudio - 9/10 - Pretty the same as in G3Graphics - 8/10 - Pretty the same as in G3Difficulty - 8/10 - In comparision to G3, the difficulty has been considerably increased, AI is betterOVERALL - 6/10 - I can't give this game better rate, it has frustrated me a lot, it has many bugs, I'd even give it something like 3-4/10 but audio and graphics have rescued that.Anyways, if you want to really complete Gothic Saga or just experience the hard side of Gothic 3, get it.Greetings, Wing "

												It seems such a long time ago when the game was released. I remember playing the original Gothic 3 throughout 2007 so now when purchasing the Enhanced Edition of Forsaken Gods my main interest was to find out how well it has held the test of time. Verdict: it has. Design is something that fails first when games age, but G3:FG still looks great compared to other fantasy RPG's. The gameplay seems fun, the open world is rich in variation and places to explore, the missions are interesting, though I felt like there was too much running back and fourth between two characters to complete a mission. One place where they overdid it were the follow/ escort missions. NPC's did not run as fast as you, which caused a lot of pointless waiting and they tended to get stuck behind stones, corners, inside walls. This brings me to the most burning issue of the game: the bugs. Though the Enhanced Edition was supposed to make the game playable, there were still so freakin' many of them. Bugged missions, NPC's inside walls, weird sounds, crashes - it was all there and made the game feel unfinished and unprofessional. It could have been less painful if the procedure of saving game progress would have been fast but it was a slow and tedious process. Final verdict:I got the experience what I sought, I was not disappointed but maybe it's time to lay this old game to rest and move on.			"

There is nothing enhanced here. Gothic 1 and 2 are dimonds, but Gothic 3 is rough.			"

												I guess this was supposed to be an expansion to Gothic 3, but it fails in so many aspects.	To start, all the♥♥♥♥♥♥that happens in the normal game doesn't count here. The game world is just a chunk of the standard Gothic 3 map; It's not small, but it's still kind of disappointing, especially considering how Gothic 2 and other open-world RPGs have handled expansions.	The combat is fairer than in normal Gothic 3, as blocking actually works for the enemies. The visuals are more efficient, but this is to be expected, seeing as how the size of the game world has been drastically reduced. I would have figured that this would also lend more depth to the actual gameplay and variety, but most of the unique NPCs are now just replaced with generic stand-ins who give fewer quests but otherwise perform the same functions.		There are also so many things that simply don't have a reason to exist. For example, in Gothic 2, it's possible to escape from the map into the void, but it does require some going out of the way. In Gothic 3: Forsaken Gods, all I have to do is jump around the little boulder blocking the path to Nordmar. My question is, ""Why bother including Nordmar on the map if I'm not even supposed to go there?"" I can see the location when I bring up the map on my interface, but it has no reason to be present in the game.	My biggest gripes are in the general sloppy execution of the whole thing, resulting in problems not even too plentiful in vanilla Gothic 3. Models are poorly placed, the AI doesn't know how to follow, many NPCs have multiple voices, the crime system is gutted to the point that I can steal entire towns without consequence, and I could go on and on. Some of the bad changes can sometimes be helpful, such as how I can use transformation potions to morph into animals in front of hostile guards and just walk past them, but doing the same in front of allies is asking for suicide.	But none of that matters, because all that it really took to kill it for me was the broken quests. When a main story quest irreparably ♥♥♥♥s up without explanation, that just ruins everything. This is an expansion only in the loosest sense of the word. It might as well just be mod, and a rushed one at that.			"

												Despite all the negative reviews about this God-Forsaken game, being an avid Fan-Boy of the series, i decided go play this game. The reason was simple. I had to know what events followed when Gothic 3 ended. A lesson learned in humility. So many people simply cannot be wrong.The negative reviews hold true! This game was a major pain to play.For starters, the whole world of myrtana is pretty much the same , minus the varant and the nord regions.There aren't any new opponents except for the troglodyte. They should have made more new opponents.There is not much meat in the main story. You are stuck doing some really lame and senseless quests just trying to get to meet the main characters who are Gorn, Thorus and Lee.The end is not at all satisfying. It didn't feel as if it contributed anything to the story.The voice acting is the worst. Simply horrible.They introduced a new battle tactic. While encountering an opponent, if you double-tap the direction key, your hero will perform a hop in that direction, which didn't help. It actually made things worse.This really feels like some unpolished attempt made by some wannabe game designers who simply made it because they had nothing else to do.With the enhanced edition, you wont find the game play buggy and as such if you forget about the story and quests and just play it for the sake of the Gothic 3 world and the graphics and the character building aspect, then it might get through the game.My suggestion. Spare yourself of this one, jump on the next game in the series. Arcania.			"

												I spoiler the whole ""story"" for you... here it comes:  _________""Find Xardas.""--------------That's it. That is the ""Story"" of gothic 3. Thats the target you see for the first 97% of the game.The game is now playable. Patches and users fixed the massive technical problems (the ""enhanced Edition"" just added more of them). Although technically reviews are for the game as you buy it on steam. Be aware that you have to apply at least the community patch to get it even WORKING properly.To make it clear: When G3 was released, it was a absolute catastrophy, an annoying, unplayable bug orgy. I played it offline a bit, I played the (somewhat) patched non steam version a bit more (in god mode, the only way back then, to deal with the buggy wolves and boars and spammy fighting system). But i'm not up to date with the latest user patches.They (to my knowledge) didn't  fix the fundamental gameplay problem. Gothic 3 is pure EXP and Faction-Points farming, to get access to the next area, where you do the same. Quests consist entirely of kill/gathering quests with not even an attemp to wrap them in some kind of narrative.  If you're fine with this, go ahead. The world at least is nice. The relatively open gameplay of the gothic series is still there a bit. I loved Gothic 1 and 2, despite the very rough edges.Gothic 3 has an impressive and beautiful (by then standards) world, Completely let down by the way it was filled story-wise. That's what's so sad. It could have been an amazing game. Even most MMOs have better quests and storytelling. If thats, what interests you in an RPG, gothic 3 isn't youre game. It is the worst farming/grinding-feeling i had in a SP RPG.Skyrim, not a storytelling masterpiece by all means, blows Gothic 3 out of the water in this area (and all others). Two Worlds 1&2 have better story telling. (DON'T buy the horribly DRM'd versions on steam though!!) But getting Gothic 3 recommended ""because i play The Witcher 3"" is an affront to me and that game and ABSOLUTELY ridiculous!			"

												+A few more hours to play after you have finished Gothic 3+New weapons and armor+After you finished the main quest, you can continue to play the game, finishing quests or just killing everything in your way.(The following may or not be advantages or disadvantages, depending on ones perception)*Skill requirements have been changed. You need to invest more points in getting your stats higher or learning a skill (points for a skill can vary from 10 to 20). Some spells require a previous spell to be learned, even if it's not useful.*You gain less points from reading books/tablets.*Quests yield a lot of experience points. Most, if not all leveling ups will come from that.*Unique and powerful weapons can be found pretty easy.-Quests are boring: go there and fetch this, escort/follow that person, go kill that and so on...-The personalities of the hero and characters have been altered.-Voice acting isn't the same for some NPCs.-Weird hitboxes.-Varant desert and Nordmar are no longer accessible area. You're stuck on the mainland.-Some important characters are missing (Lester, Lares, Diego).-Once you get your hands on some good armor and weapons, it mostly becomes a fight with the weird hitboxes.-And the cherry to top it all: A wolf can still kill you!Verdict: I only played this because I got it bundled with the other Gothic games. If you're getting this like me or for free, then go for it if you have the time. Otherwise, ignore it.			"

												The gameplay time is quite low, but I have had a different Steam account quite some time ago and I forgot the password and that consisted of a good 100 hours on this and Gothic 3 so I am quite familiar with the gamesI think the game is fantastic, it still needs a little improvement on the combat system, but over allI do quite like the Forsaken Gods.I really recommend to play Gothic 3 before playing this, more things will be familiar to youand you will have a generally better understandingI would have to say this paraticular game would get a 8/10 from me!

												The cities are full of npcs yet there are empty. There are 60 npcs in some cities yet only a few can talk. There is war just like there was war in every gothic game, yet in this one you see no suffering, no desperate leaders, no one asks for help, the atmosphere of war could not be depicted worst. The masters of perks are randomly distributed nearly. Some dude on some camp can teach you the highest warrior perks, a ranger who is afraid of orks can teach you the perk Ork-killer for Bows. In Gothic 3 the warrior perk was learned from the kings, the ork killer perks from fierce warriors and archers in Nordmar. There are not enough lockpicks in the game, so many chests yet not enough lockpick even in vendors it doesnt regenerate fast enough.The story is incredibly weak and boring. The map is Myrtana from Gothic 3, and even the monster and special chest placements are the same. The voice acting is horrible. The hero acts very different. He doesnt have the usuall swagger and sense of humour anymore, but cries over thing like he had never done in previous game under harder circumstances.This games fails in so many aspects to become a Gothic game and fortunately it is not since this is not a Piranha-Bytes game.I give this game a 3/10 and it has the enhanced edition that fixed the bugs in the first release. Cannot even recommend it to Gothic fans.			"

												*WARNING* THIS GAME IS INTENDED FOR ADVANCED RPG PLAYERS.First off, I'll start by saying that this is the only Gothic game I've played. Ever. So I have nothing to compare it to. In light of that, this game is really fantastic. It has a good degree of realistic difficulty( i.e no hovering arrow to show you where to go, minimalistic map, ANY enemy in the game has the potential to destroy you, wide variety of magic spells that do things other than directly hurt your target, etc.), and what I like most is that it's very well optimised for PCs that can run it. Suck it Windows 8. Now, from what I've read, the game's story isn't actually Canon, and a little force-fed to both the player and the character. Speaking of, your character is a bit of a♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ but hey, I would be too if I had to be the one and only guy that can help anyone with pesky problems like fetching mushrooms, collecting taxes from townsfolk, and facilitating communications between two neighboring towns. All in all, I'd rate this a 7/10. There is alittle room for improvement, the difficulty system is something to be desired, it only really changes the amount of enemies in their groups found around the world, and little else. You can probably steam-roll through this game and finish it in about roughly 5 hours, excluding exploration and side-quests.			"

												Don't listen to all those people saying this is a disgrace compared to gothic 3,even if gothic 3 is better,i definitely enjoyed playing this game and plan to still play it after this. These people saying that the game is bad,okay it might have been quite bad in terms of bugs and glitches before the enhanced edition,but one thing i CAN say is that with the enhanced edition it is probably ALOT better now and definitely worth your time. It's obviously not the best game out there,but it's quite fun to play,however unless you're one of those people that can really get the best out of a game that has a worse storyline than pac man and the graphics of a potato (not reffering to the game) , i wouldn't recommend playing this game all the time,as it might get to your head since the combat system isn't the best,and just a warning before you play the game,when you are still kind of a noob when it comes to the combat mechanics,it WILL punish you for it,pretty badly,so practice alot on that,unless you're one of those people who get the hang of things pretty easily,oh btw i'm not exaggerating,when i first started the game i had to quicksave before every single fight because i died like once or twice each time i fought something,luckily i quickly got the hang of it after like an hour or so but,that does not mean that enemies won't crush you if given the chance,and i mean ANY enemy,obviously enemies become a lot easier to kill once you get to a decent level and you have a decent health pool.Tip:when your stamina/endurance bar is gray instead of yellow,it means you have a disease,you can cure this with a spell or with a potion,i think you find potions randomly and for spells just search for shrines,there should be one right next to the stairs in the room you start in. Trust me,you'll thank me late for the tip,it took me and quite a bunch of other people several hours into the game before we realized that we had a disease >.<			"

												At first, I thought the dialogues were a joke, and the game would get serious. Nope. Quests are go kills this, fetch that, dialogues are written by 13 year olds who make bad puns. Seriously, all the dialogues are just bad puns or simply not funny jokes. Like the game. If you liked gothic 3, stay away from this. This is not a game, it feels more like a mod made by a bored kid.			"

												This game is quite dated. Its age shows.Clunky UI. Horrible combat/gameplay. Crappy keyboard/mouse controls. Obnoxious ""harvesting/looting"" animation. Bad voice acting and dialogue that feels like it was written by a grade schooler. INCONSISTENT voice acting, a single NPC may radically change voices many times from sentence to sentence during a single conversation. Quests are often busy work, but this game manages to make it painfully FEEL like busy work. This is exacerbated by having us walk back and forth and back and forth between towns for some inane NPC brothers who really should just have a sword run through them so we can skip their dumb quests.Oh, and I thought with the ""Enhanced Edition"" they were supposed to have fixed bugs or well, what is enhanced about it? It's still buggy as eff, and the main quest is stuck because Inog won't budge from his book. I guess I could see if the ""community patch"" fixes the enhanced edition, not really worried about breaking the game further since it's already kind of broken already. (Update: the community patch won't recognize the enhanced edition.)I would not spend more than 5 cents on this game. Even then, it's a waste of a nickel. Luckily for me, mine came with a bundle of other games. Still, I cannot get back the time I wasted up until getting stuck.			"

												This is the worst game I have ever played. The dialogue is painful and eeriely similar to your standard conversation with an indian based call centre tech support guy. The problems is being with the no same designers and the influx of new ideas for the karkland.Please don't do this to yourself.  If you want a further Gothic experience, play risen. That two pounds I wasted could have been better spent on rat poison coating the letter G key on my keyboard ensuring I never encountered this game in the first place.The lore has been trampled on to a worse degree than the dialogue, everything that you achieved in the original trilogy is thrown out of the window in the first 10 seconds of the opening cinematic. The ♥♥♥♥♥ slap the nameless hero delivers to xardas as he turns his back on sanity and character progression leaves a lingering taste of copper in your own mouth.The world is now divided into 4 corners, the characters now have 4 emotions and there are 4 enemies. Oh and 4000 bugs.Installing this game is foolhardy. Press play and a pop-up appears: Consensual or non-consensual? Either way you leave violated.			"

												This game should never have been. Having discarded the dev team, the publisher hired a foreign dev team that was barely familiar with the code and tasked them with an expansion. The result was an even greater mess than Gothic 3 itself had been at launch, and everbody recommended skipping the expansion entirely.Yet, the community came to the rescue again. The same fan devs who had created the community patch set forth to make another one for the (standalone) expansion. I must admit that I have yet to play it, but this effort alone is worth having at least a look. Sadly, all Gothic games have deteriorated somewhat from the very first, but it is easy to fall in love with the unique setting and characters. And once you love it, you want to see the whole story. So all praise to the fan devs for making that possible.			"

												This game should never have been. Having discarded the dev team, the publisher hired a foreign dev team that was barely familiar with the code and tasked them with an expansion. The result was an even greater mess than Gothic 3 itself had been at launch, and everbody recommended skipping the expansion entirely.Yet, the community came to the rescue again. The same fan devs who had created the community patch set forth to make another one for the (standalone) expansion. I must admit that I have yet to play it, but this effort alone is worth having at least a look. Sadly, all Gothic games have deteriorated somewhat from the very first, but it is easy to fall in love with the unique setting and characters. And once you love it, you want to see the whole story. So all praise to the fan devs for making that possible.			"

												i am far from finishing this game, but what ive played i really enjoy. this game doesnt hold your hand, from the begining you are plopped down and told what to do but not where to go or how to go about it, that is all up to you as the player. either steal what you need, or negotiate for it. the voice acting is aweful, the main character can go from a depressed tone to an overly cheerful tone in the same sentence. the graphics are nice when the screen is free of randomly occuring trees, or the ground doesnt go white on you. the music is beautiful, but it seems like the tracks are short, so youll be hearing it loop alot. i have to issue with the controls, although i would have loved controler support. all in all id say it was worth my $2.

												Make a Gothic 3 expansion that completely ignores my decisions in Gothic 3 and starts me off from scratch. Smart!			"
