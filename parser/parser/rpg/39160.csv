												Meh...it's average/slightly below for a generic hack and slash, which is part of the problem. DS 1&2 were damn good, and then you get this ____________.   You could build your character how you wanted based on spells found and weapons used, now you are stuck in predefined roles as named characters. You used to have a fairly open world to explore, now it's pretty much a guided tour...seems like things keep getting ""simplified"" for ""our benefit"" in many modern games.If you can get it cheap, go ahead...It's decent, but I wouldn't suggest paying full or even half price.

												PROS:1. Great story/lore2. Your decisions shape the story/relationships with other characters3. Great graphics/music/voice acting4. Maps are easy to follow5. Trail feature allows you to see where you need to go for a quest6. Seamless changeable battle stances7. Point and click facing enemies rather than mindless one-click automation (More engaging battles)8. Learning about a set character's backstory and personality (Refreshing change from spending a lot of time customizing a character yourself)9. Easy to follow/understandable/simple talent tree (Refreshing change from tedious, complicated talent trees)CONS:1. TERRIBLE camera angles / control. I mean it was so bad, I almost didn't want to play this game.2. No zooming in feature.3. Playing as Lucas is darn near impossible. You're in for a huge challenge if you decide to play as him.4. This game has near NOTHING to do with the first two games, therefore making it more of its own game rather than a continuation to the series.I felt like I owed this game my two cents because honestly I'm astonished at the amount of bad reviews. I will fully admit to this: After I first bought the game I only played it for one hour before giving up in frustration. The camera control in this game is absolutely TERRIBLE. If they would have just made it so the camera follows the way the character is facing, it would have solved the problem entirely. I also hated the fact I can't zoom in at all, because I like to look at my character and the monster detail closely on occasion. Despite this, I decided to give the game another chance later on because I am a huge fan of the Dungeon Siege series and I really wanted to finish the third installment. Getting used to the stupid camera controls took a lot of patience but eventually I found I had almost shrugged off an awesome game. The lore and storyline is rich and engaging, arguably the best aspect of this game. I also really enjoy how my decisions shape the game's outcomes and relationships with the other playable characters, much like The Walking Dead series (which I also love). The graphics and music are great, the voice acting is excellent. I liked how the maps were easy to follow and I almost never got lost due to the really great quest trail feature. Being able to swap between ""stances"" or whatever you want to call them during battle was near seamless. I actually liked that you had to point and click in the direction of the enemy rather than mindlessly clicking once on a target and letting your character attack by themselves as in DS1 and DS2(that is, if you choose the DS1 style of doing that when playing DS2). Many will argue that just having four generic characters is boring and un-inventive on the player's part - however I personally feel it is a refreshing change. You get to uncover this character's rich backstory, and learn their personality and style as you play. It's almost like getting to know a new friend rather than just making up a fake one. lol. Besides, I could spend upwards of 1-2 hours fully customizing my character down to the shape of her nose (*cough* Elder Scrolls anyone?) and for what? She's going to be wearing a helmet anyway, and even if you have a mod to make it so you can see your character's face, how often are you actually going to look at it? It ends up being kinda tedious, especially since I just want to get onward to the game! I -would- have liked to at least be given the choice of keeping their generic name OR coming up with my own like some RPGs, but meh it's not a game-changer for me either. As for other things I DON'T like about this game, let's talk about Lucas for a second. I'm a straight girl, so when I saw Lucas I was like wow this guy looks super hot...I'm going to try him out. ;P BIG mistake. The problem with Lucas is that to do any real damage you have to basically be up the enemy's ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, and when you're in the process of doing that in a huge mass of flustercuck you're going to get mowed down as often as the White House lawn. Unless you fully specced into every healing ability possible and have a ton of chaos:vampirism as Lucas, then you're in for a world of pain my friend. I don't really like when a game forces me to spend all my talent currency in ONE thing. Like okay well if I don't want to die over and over and over again I better spend everything in every healing ability possible. Super lame! My favorite character has got to be Katarina. Her gear looks cute and girly, her voice actress sounds exotic and awesome, and she hits like a truck from afar. I can just sit back and send my cool hound in while doing some badarse sniping and when the enemy gets too close I can just switch to my sidearms and deal powerful knockback damage. Amazing. Anjali is also fricken AWESOME. She's absolutely beautiful, especially in her fire form with all those tribal tattoos and the orange eyes. The way they made her voice actress (as well as the other archon in the game) sound all ethereal-ish was cool as hell too, it really added depth to the exotic element of her race. Her fire jackal is super cute, I love the little noises he makes!! Her self-healing is ridiculously through the roof, it's almost impossible to die as her if you do it right. She also has some decent range on her attacks, and both of her forms are viable though I tend to stick more to her fire form. Reinhart is the only one I haven't tried yet and meh, I probably won't. For some reason whenever I look at him I think of the Sultan from Aladdin and I start laughing. Also the way he talks is kind of annoying. lol. I've never even used him as the AI. I'm sure he's a great character with great abilities if I just gave him the chance, but meh. Moving on, I see a lot of people complaining about the very basic talent tree but let me tell you something, I WELCOMED it. Huge, complicated talent trees with a billion different avenues has always been one of the things I actually DON'T like about RPGs. It's like, here let me google online what is the very best talent tree and fricken -research- how to play my dang character. Otherwise I'm going to be halfway through a game and realize shoot I totally screwed up my talent tree and I can't go back so now I either keep playing and pretend it doesn't bother me or restart. GROAN. It's like work instead of play at that point! In closing, I see a lot of the angry people are commenting that they don't like this game simply because it isn't like the other two. True, it IS sort-of a letdown that this game has next-to-nothing similar with the first two games other than some very minor basic lore ties. But I wouldn't just throw out the whole thing just because it isn't a similar or because it ""shames the franchise"". I tend to want to look at it as its own game...just ignore the whole continuation of the 3 slapped onto the name. :P			"

												Dungeon Siege III really falls somewhere between good and bad but in the end, I do think it was a fun experience.The game takes place in a generic fantasy setting where generic evil people are being generically evil and you, the generic hero of a generic almost extinct generic group of generic heroes do generic things in the name of generic goodness.My playthrough took place with a friend. He played the generic wizard and I played the generic swordsman. We played on the hardest difficulty. While the game offers some fun hack and slash combat, there's nothing very special with it. Each character has two modes (zwiehander/sword+shield, rifle/dual pistols, etc.) with three skills per mode in addition to three defensive abilitites. While I do believe you're supposed to use both of your modes, there seemed to be no benefit in doing so for me. I just went berserk with my zweihanders and that worked terrifically.I can't say anything about lower difficulties but we mostly found the regular enemies to be rather trivial while the bosses were hard only because they could kill you in one or two hits. This was challenging and fun in its own way but not in a good way as this was more like artificial difficulty where you're punished for a single mistake.With this in mind, the balance between bosses wasn't good, either. One early boss was super hard while others were a breeze. The penultimate boss was one of the hardest in the game while the last boss was a joke.Lastly, the game had some notable issues with other aspects. The depiction of women felt rather sexistic as you could usually judge the moral level of a woman by looking at the size of her breasts. Big breasts - good person. Small breasts - evil person. The camera was a pain as my partner and I limited each others' movements, which was super problematic as he was a long range character and I was purely melee. As far as I know, the game is purely a console port and although it could actually be good, I'm not so certain that it's good if you don't have a gamepad to play with.So that's my review. You can see that I ended up giving it a recommendation but that's a weak recommendation. I do not recommend buying this game unless you'll either have someone to play with or if you can get it for less than the base cost.			"

												Dungeon Siege in name only, this game has nothing in common with the ground-breaking classic, other than being an action RPG.  DS1 was classless and level-less.  Pick up a sword and start swinging it, you get better at using swords.  DS2 added classes, but kept specialties.  DS3 takes away almost all character customization by giving you four characters to choose from and a handful of points to spend each level.DS1's equipment system allowed anybody to use any equipment they had the stats for.  DS3 essentially drops different loot for each character.  This must have saved a lot on art assets but leads to some oddities, such as the witch-with-a-gun character only being able to wear stockings, not pants.The only real upside to DS3 is that it's not a grindfest like the first two.  But this is mostly a side-effect of it just being a much smaller game, both in terms of length but also in terms of ambition and vision.			"

												Dungeon Siege 3 is actually a GOOD game, and you´ll enjoy it quite enough once you get past the 2 biggest problems of this game: 1) despite the fact that it is called DUNGEON SIEGE 3, and takes place in the same fantasy world of the previous 2 DS games, other than that it HAS ABSOLUTELY NOTHING TO DO with DS1 and DS2, and if the producers of the game had not named it DS3 this game would have more appeal and approval, overall.Let´s see: unlike the other 2 DS, this is NOT a HACK´N´SLASH RPG, it´s a (quite good, actually) ACTION RPG, with very pretty graphics (even now, considering its age), good acting voices, a deep and intriguing storyline full of lore.2) A good controller is MANDATORY for this game become playable (and fun). Once you get the hang of it you´ll discover a whole different game than the one described by most of the reviews.So, my advice, coming form a HUGE Dungeon Siege fan, that spent hundreds of hours on the previous titles, is to give this game a chance, making an effort to completely forget this is called Dungeon Siege 3, and after the initial hate ends, you´ll be surprised.8/10 (Y)			"

												Probably the most important info about this game is: This is not hack&slash. This is pure action gameThis is not continuation of old Dungeon Siege by any standard.When I first played this I thought to myself - what the heck is wrong with this?!I played with keybord and mouse and I was completely confused by the camera and controls.There are only three or four classes with pretty much no room for customization.I stopped after half and hour and felt cheated but...After few moths I gave this another try. Now I was prepared. I grabbed proper gamepad, took the class with the lady that hold rifles, pistols and shotguns and...I was blown away.This is extremely fun action game. It's very challenging. Boss fights are probably the best part.Graphic are beatiful and get better the longer You play. I understand that this might be not game for everyone especially for those rooted in H&S reality but If You like pure action and Your gamepad literally burning under your fingers give it a try.			"

Summary  (TL;DR)Dungeon Siege III, while not stellar, is a bit underrated or otherwise suffers unjustly from its departure from the original games of old. Those had more of a Diablo-like interface, with top down, mouse point&click, party management gameplay, with classes, gear and loot. Dungeon Siege III was clearly designed for consoles and controller use, as the keyboard and mouse controls are very awkward and it has a more 3rd person view. Without a controller, it is very difficult to play this game. I’m a fan of the original game, and I found that despite the change in paradigm to a 3rd person hack and slash action RPG designed for the controller, the Dungeon Siege “feel” is there. Experiencing the different events in the story, meeting new characters and talking to them, going from location to location, playing the combat, collecting loot, and optimizing abilities and equipment in regards to combat, all was rather enjoyable. None was arguably groundbreaking, but was interesting and enjoyable enough to keep me invested for 32 hours, which, in retrospect, is saying something. 7/10Detailed reviewRPG-wise, it’s actually quite deep with lots of stats and mechanics. You choose from 4 different main characters with different characteristics and play styles: a knight for meele/tank, a rifle and pistol/shotgun wielding ranged character, an agile fire magic female warrior and a spell casting mage/scientist. One of the other characters follows you as an AI companion. Each character has 2 stances that can be switched on the fly, each stance has one attack and 3 active abilities. There are also 3 defensive abilities per character. Active abilities include heavier or AOE attacks, buffs/debuffs, or even summoned creatures. Defensive abilities include healing, pushing back of enemies or buffing yourself. As you use attacks and abilities you fill their mastery bar and once you’ve mastered it, you can perform an empowered version of it. As you level up, you can develop each of your abilities in a branching choice, for instance do you want more damage or increased chance to knockback opponents? You can go all in on one, or choose any balance between the two. Additionally, there are passive “talents” to level up. With all this and also the different equipment you loot, buy and enhance with enchantments (3 weapon slots, 4 armor slots, a ring and a pendant slot), with different stats, you have a vast array of possibilities. You can choose the abilities’ perks to work well with one another enhancing your favorite play style, and also compliment your companion’s abilities to your own, which is very satisfying, particularly, I suspect, in local coop.However, with this 2-stance system sometimes it’s a bit difficult perform actions from different stances in the heat of battle with a lot going on. Of course, it would be easier with pausable combat and 1-9 keyboard hotkeys, but this is a 3rd person action game. Also, the way aiming works is a bit awkward, especially for ranged combat, as you have to move in the direction of an enemy to soft lock on it. This results in sometimes having to move away to get a better line of sight to the desired target. I got used to it, though. Additionally, the companion AI is not ideal, though it’s reasonable. Again, local coop should be fun.I won’t spoil the story, which I found surprisingly interesting, meaning that the game is far from a loot fest. Events are set approximately 150 years after the first game, much of what once was has fallen or faded, and the characters from the first game are now close to legends, which also means you don’t need to play the other games to enjoy this one. You’ll learn of what happened as you progress in the game, your journey has always that tone of grandeur lost as you seek to reestablish some of that. You’ll meet interesting characters and the plot will make you reflect on your actions and compare them to the main antagonist, and also think about your dialogue choices. The voice acting is also good and the dialogues lengthy. The lore is very well done, tying in nicely to the Dungeon Siege universe, and is deepened by finding some books or documents, and talking to characters. You’ll even explore a location directly related to the characters of the first game, which was extremely satisfying for a fan.The progression is mostly linear with growing scale of locations, enemies and events. It’s an action RPG, but the pacing and amount of enemies is not insane like for instance on Diablo 3, though some battles are more enemy heavy. Though there are different and varied locations with enemies matching them, “dungeons” aren’t as big as in the first game, but nonetheless acceptably lengthy. The graphics are quite good, showing some age by now, but at least in runs well, high FPS. However, the camera is always restricted to look down a little, so you can’t tilt it up and enjoy the scenery in a more 1st person style, which is a shame. That restriction also sometimes doesn’t provide the best view for combat either. Though different equipment reflects visibly on the characters, there’s no way to view the full character close up and rotate it, like in a character screen. The HUD is somewhat simplistic, as are the indications above enemies, which at first makes it a bit difficult to understand what’s going on.The soundtrack is quite good, mostly in the atmospheric orchestral style, aiding to that tone of grandeur lost, but with tense and epic combat sequences.

												Try to imagine Obsidian's role-playing dialog system embedded into the console port of Diablo III.  In a nutshell, that's Dungeon Siege 3.You'll notice that the majority of negative reviews on here can only be summed-up the way Machinima's Inside Gaming Daily recently described most haters' opinions. It goes something like, ""I hate this pizza because it isn't a taco.""  Granted, it isn't wise to change a franchise as much as Obsidian did here.  Many fans of DS1 and DS2 appear incapable of liking this game, and it seems a lot of them feel tricked out of their cash.  I'll mention their gripes here, however, to give a fair review, I don't want to just look at what DS3 *isn't*.  I want to review it based on its own merit. To be up front, I actually hated DS3 at first, but when I was looking for a co-op to play with my non-gamer wife, I took a second look at Dungeon Siege 3.  I found I had completely changed my perception of this game, because I changed my perception of its design choices, and it actually became one of my favorites of all time.Dungeon Siege III is a gamepad-friendly isometric action RPG with local and online co-op.  While much more casual than its predecessors, there's still plenty of quests, hacking, slashing, shooting, magic, looting, upgrades, lore, and dialog - and when multiple players (online or off) are in a story conversation together, players can vote for their preferred responses to NPCs, albeit Player 1 has the final say.There are four characters to choose from, and each delivers a different fighting style (melee, ranger, sniper, magician). Each character also has two ""stances"" to vary up their attack strengh, range, and/or speed.  Not to mention, the back story will also change, according to which hero you've selected.Gone is the tactical pause.  Gone is the squad management.  Gone are the skill points you earn, specific to your fighting style.  Gone are the multiple skill trees for each character.  Each weapon and piece of armor you find can only be equipped by a specific character.  Obsidian has ""streamlined"" this game, effectively consolizing it.  This is the heart of Dungeon Siege 2 fans' complaints, besides multiplayer camera controls and multiplayer inventory management.  You now will be only upgrading a single skill tree for your character, which means close vs ranged combat will not award skill toward that specific stance. Instead of holding down on right-click to attack, you'll button-mash, and each press will be one swing/shot. Also annoying to some, even when you gain NPC followers, you will not be in charge of their tactics, nor their upgrades.This game was developed by the same people who made South Park: The Stick of Truth, Fallout: New Vegas, Knights of the Old Republic 2, Neverwinter Nights 2, and Alpha Protocol.  I loved all of those games.  My point, they KNOW role-playing.  In my opinion, the story here is great.  If you don't have nostalgia stars in your eyes, it's easy to see that the voice acting here is by far superior to its predecessors.  Although the story is drastically shorter, it's certainly more focused.All in all, I can tell you this:  if you have a friend or loved one you want to play an immersive, open-world action RPG with while sitting on the couch together, this is the game. You'll find a rich story, a simple skill tree, upgrades, dialog choices, and tons of loot.  It's one of the best (and few) couch co-ops that delivers a true RPG experience.  Plus, gamers of all experience levels can enjoy it together.I come from a Fallout 3 background, but my wife is really only good at Bejewelled and racing games.  While I was able to try to craftfully master my character's moves, she was able to button-mash with a rifle-wielding hottie from a distance, and we made an excellent team!  We were able to hack/slash/loot our way all the way through the campaign +DLC together and we both had a blast.  If you've ever played/enjoyed Diablo 3 or Daggerdale on the couch with friends and/or family, and you like the idea of breaking up the action with cutscenes and dialog choices once in a while, I'm telling you, this really is an awesome game.If you're looking for the next 100-hour tactical RPG in the Dungeon Siege universe, buyer beware.

												What happened to this franchise?  The first and second games were incredible, this one is a like somebody decided to release a technology demo as a full-fledged game.  It's the best looking Dungeon Siege game yet but that's where the praise ends.  I tried to like it but was thwarted at every turn.  A weird game save system, frequently finding yourself woefully overmatched, a weak storyline and of course those awful camera angles that have you looking at walls instead of your opponent.  Control is vague at best which combined with the goofy camera angles make the game tedious to play.  You spend more time compensating for the interface than worrying about your quests.  That's a shame because the maps are gorgeous and painstakingly rendered but the technical problems with the game ruin the immersion.  It took the ""Play"" out of Role Playing Game...I actually bought a copy of Dungeon Siege 3 for a friend of mine who's an avid RPG player which included previous Dungoen Siege games.  I was hoping for the same hundreds of co-op gameplay hours we enjoyed with Dungeon Siege 2.   He loaded it up, played it for 30 minutes and said to me, "" I can't play this...""There's not much more to say...			"

												I believe this game's biggest crime was naming it Dungeon Siege III. I found the game enjoyable as an action RPG-lite style game in a vein similar to the Overlord series, Dragon Age II, and perhaps Trine. Think Gauntlet and you'll be on the right track. Its a decent bit of cartoonish fantasy fun that works better with a gamepad than the traditional keyboard and mouse setup. The game features a dialogue/choice system similar to Bioware's. It's not quite as fleshed out, but not quite as pointless either. Decisions you make are neither good nor bad, just different, and will effect how things carry forth from the point they are made. With the excellent Treasure of the Sun DLC the entire game clocked in at 20 hours for the first play through including all but a few side quests. The previously mentioned choice system and four character classes lends the game a fair bit of potential replay value			"

												Most of the negative reviews for this game are about it not being similar to the previous games and being a vastly different experience in the Dungeon Siege series. I've never played the first two games myself, however, even if I did, I would still believe Dungeon Siege III is a really good game. I would describe Dungeon Siege III as something that could be a Dragon Age action RPG spin-off.Tell you what, try the demo and decide whether you want to buy it or not. If you are familiar with the Dungeon Siege games, try playing the third one again. You may actually like it, or not. Give it an hour or two. It could be a whole different game, but you know, if you enjoy playing it as much as I do, then it's a good game to you as much as it is to me.			"

												Ahhhh, this game.... This game... What can I say? I don't like writing negative reviews but, well... Let's just say this game is FAR below my expectations.Let me start by saying that I have been a DIEHARD fan of the first two Dungeon Siege games. Those two games - Dungeon Siege II in particular - were a very nice, fun, and more light-hearted action RPG break away from my long-standing Diablo II obsession at that time. The first two games were pretty much Diablo clones, at least in terms of overall gameplay - point and click mechanics and the usual hack, slash, loot - wash, rinse, repeat routine, and I was very much okay with that.So what's up with Dungeon Siege III? It's NOTHING like the first two games. I was so excited when I first learned that a new Dungeon Siege game was in the works, but after it was released, I read not-so-good reviews of the PC version in particular and after finally getting around to acquiring it myself to try and give it a fair shake, I was left shrugging my shoulders with a head-scratching ""huh???""Obsidian has essentially ""console-ized"" Dungeon Siege III. Kinda felt like a slap in the face to us longtime fans of the first two games - Dungeon Siege has always been a PC game, and the console focus of this installment made it not much fun at all. It doesn't even come close to feeling like the previous games. No more point and click mechanics, the character movement is now relegated to the usual WASD suspects on the keyboard. I figured since they ""console-ized"" this game, I'd pull out the Xbox 360 controller and try to approach it that way, maybe I'll enjoy it more, but no dice.I can't stand the inventory management - it really would've been nice if they could've revamped it for the PC to be more like the first two games. I'm not a fan of the overall character management/leveling system either. Again, this is NOTHING like the original Dungeon Siege games.The Dungeon Siege games were never very strong on story, so I wasn't expecting much in that regard. However, I've had such a hard time enjoying this game to get anywhere nearly far enough into it to fairly judge where Obsidian went with it. But as far as I can tell, they at least stayed true to some of the base lore in the earlier games.I can't recommend this game. Sad as it makes me to have to badmouth a Dungeon Siege game, I just really wish they would've stuck to the tried-and-true formula. It's a shame, and I can only hope that someday, Obsidian - or any other good RPG game developer, for that matter - makes a Dungeon Siege IV that will return to the original PC-based point and click, hack n' slash approach.

												Let me start off by saying I have not played the first two Dungeon Siege games, so I cannot say this game did or did not kill the series or something like that. And although this was my first Dungeon Siege, I can honestly say I immensely enjoy this game. I loved how I could actually control my character's movements instead of just clicking on some part of the map and wait for them to get there. It makes me feel more involved. Also, the combat was absolutely great and at times a great challenge. The abilities the four hero's have were all fun to use, and they each felt different from the other's. Something that really impressed me was that when you change any part of your armor, so too did your character. I do not tend to see my character's look change with other RPG games like this one, so it was just nice to see something as simple as this being implemented.  Now, despite what I said, I still have faults with the game. I have to agree with many others when saying that camera was a pain at times. It was too close to the player, and at times it made me feel constricted. However, is the camera beyond awful and ruin the whole game? No, not even close. I also would find myself getting stuck in objects towards the later levels for some reason. I would be walking then uh oh, I am now stuck in a log, or what have you. I also see many complain about the confusing skill tree, clunky AI, bad controls, and for some reason picking up objects. I really do not understand their complaints because one: the skill is so simple to use. You literally choose what ability you want(only certain levels let you pick an ability), where you want your proficiency, and what talent you want. It is so straight forward. As for the AI, I have never had a problem. My companion was always helpful ( I have not played co-op) and never felt useless, and the enemies were not mindless oafs. I also thought the controls were just fine. There was nothing confusing about them (I played keyboard and mouse). And picking up objects? Really? If there are a lot of items near you, press ctrl. You now just picked up everything. No reason for that to be a struggle.If this is your first Dungeon Siege game (because apparently this is not worthy of being called a Dungeon Siege), or if you like action RPGs, I recommend this game. It is beautiful, addictive, and the story is actually pretty awesome. I got hooked with it and felt really involved in it. It really is a solid gaming experience, and I wish more people could see that. I also recommend getting the DLC as well. Raises level cap, grants enchanting weapons and armor, and adds a good lengthy and engaging mission. The game is great and I highly recommend picking this one up.  "

												RECOMMENDED : HIGHLY NOT, you shall not pass, run you foolsReasons :All version about Dungeon Siege on Steam are cursed.Dungeon Siege 1 is incomplete (no add-on Legend of Aranna), no multiplayer and cut end game scene.Dungeon Siege 2 is incomplete (no add-on Broken Worlds), no multiplayer and cut end game scene.Dungeon Siege 3 is pure joke and will never be Dungeon Siege.Stay as so far as you can from Steam versions about that serie. If you own boxed version, play it about 1 & 2. Do legal copies to keep them safe and never sold these jewels because they cost a lot to buy online.			"

												One of my favorite games of all time.An action RPG (more RPG than ARPG, you mind), with an in-deapth storyline and good loot tables.  They did a fantastic job with the atmosphere of each area, capturing the feeling of darkness and turmoil in each zone while keeping the individuality of each location.  The combat is challenging, and each playable character brings a  feeling of uniqueness to the combat.  The followers add support that (at times) is much needed.  The loot system is decent, and upgrades feel exciting.  Watching your gear change as you gain levels is as satisfying as it is in any other well-done ARPG.As long as you're not looking to play this game with friends, you'll find DS3 to be a well-rounded, immersive game with a storyline that will suck you right in.

												A flawed game unlike the other Dungeon Siege titles, or most other Obsidian games either. I don't know how fun I'd describe it as? It's... it's actually MASSIVELY bland. And pretty short. And one of the systems I enjoyed most was apparently only in the game because I bought the DLC, so that's another half-strike.I don't know whether to praise or damn this game. It's seriously some kind of limbo-state. Very controller-centric action RPG gameplay, probably one of the worst co-op setups I've seen in ages off of consoles (only the host keeps gear/save data/XP! ♥♥♥♥ you, other guy! don't go trying to bring your character up in here!), but then it adapts some of my favorite quirks of the genre (story choices and actions in-game giving you perma-perks to stats, controllable evolutions of skills, solid amount of customization for your characters within their roles).If you buy this: buy it with the Treasures of the Sun DLC. You may as well - the game's a bit short, and TotS gives you some cool new toys and a rather fun new region. Just know going in that the game is not amazing by any standards. On the other hand, it doesn't really ♥♥♥♥ UP anywhere that I can point out, either.I still don't know how the hell I feel about this, and I've been debating it with myself for about a week now as I played it to completion.

												First off: This game is NOT a bad game!It actually is a pretty good one. The problem it has is its name. This is no Dungeon Siege!Obsidian/Square Enix would've been better off by giving this child a different name, or make it a Spin-off (like it happend with Baldurs Gate back then. PS2 version was called Dark Alliance). This would've been alot better and the die hard fans of Dungeon Siege 2 wouldn't have been dissappointed that much. Especially when considering that they made this game with consoles in mind. The Port is bad. Crappy and slow UI, plays best with a controller and so on. Performance is good though.Anyways, in terms of Action-RPGs, Dungeon Siege 3 is not bad. It has its flaws, yes, but overall it's good enough to be picked up by fans of the genre. Especially at a discounted price. It features good graphics, a decent story with multiple choice stuff, okay-ish combat with dodge mechanics and a nice lootsystem which keeps the good loot coming until the end. The companion system they used in the game felt kind of good too. They weren't annoying and could stand their ground on their own. They even pick up gold drops for you. The biggest problem this game has, is its lack of bigger maps. It's mostly a really long tunnel... and I mean really long. It's on par with FF13. There is not much exploration going on and this is especially bad when you reach Stonebridge (the games Mainhub/Town). It doesn't feel like a Town at all. Where the game kind of got it right was with the Treasure of the Sun DLC. Here it actually feels like you are running around on a big map with ways to explore it. Still a longshot away from being called an open world, but it felt satisfying to run around in the Desert. The DLC introduced a few new/nice Puzzle-/Dungeonmechanics as well.So getting the DLC with the game should be a no-brainer. But I don't recommend picking it up at the current price. 20 bucks for the Game+DLC is too much. 10 bucks at most seems about right. All in all I'd rate it with 7/10. So definetly recommended to fans of the genre. "

												This game pales in comparision to the original Dungeon Sieges, and doesn't do them justice. The game is boring and the plot is contrived. It tries to be Diablo and fails. It never kept me interested. Many other recent RPGs have done much better (Skyrim, Witcher 2, Diablo 3, etc), and I suggest you take a look at those and avoid buying this.			"

												Despite all the negative comments I think this is a great game. I loved the story and the gameplay. The battles, especially the boss battles, were great because you had to actually work out tactics to beat them, evade their hits and utilise  blocking.If you don't want the game to be too hard you can just play it on easy. I finished it on normal playing as Lucas and thought it wasn't insanely hard. The game gives you a good challenge though.To solve the camera and controller problem I changed the button layout as follows (Give it a try!) :W: Move ForwardS: Move BackwardsA: Move LeftD: Move Right(And now the important bit)Rotate Camera: Right ClickThat way its easy to control your character and to adjust the camera angle even in busy battles			"

												Dungeon Siege III takes an interesting and well defined world and shoves it into a blender. The resulting mess is then poured down your throat like the worst karmic payback in the history of mankind. I'm only still playing it because I can't get a refund and I want as close to my money's worth as I can get.I mean this with all honesty when I say that DSIII has ensured that I'll never buy another game in the franchise again. Square Enix should be ashamed of themselves for utterly ruining a wonderful product line and setting with the worst control interface ever designed by human beings.As a matter of fact, I highly doubt the interface was designed by men. I believe that it was, in fact, cribbed from apes.If you have kids, use this foul abomination of a game as punishment. An hour attempting to accomplish anything while the controls actively conspire against you will get your children acting right. Another hour attempting to fight grotesquely overpowered bosses will ensure that they continue to act right.This game gets four stars because that's how many it takes to censor the word I feel most aptly describes it.

												Single Player Review - It is a shame that so many people gave this game a negative review just because it wasn't what they expected. Check thier playtime and most of the negative reviewers didn't even give it one hour. I think the game is pretty good. It has good graphics with interesting environments, the gameplay is fun even though it can get a bit repetitive, There is a lot of skill upgrades you can make to your character and a lot of armor and gear to aquire.  You can choose one NPC to join you on your journey and they are really helpfull.  It doesn't have any bugs that I noticed. The replay is ok too because you can try a different style of hero on your next playthrough. It's pretty easy most of the time but some of the bosses will really challenge you.I have so many games that I start but struggle to finish because they are not that fun. I keep playing DS3 so that is most important thing for me. The expansion adds a few hours of content and some decent gear  too. If i had to point out some flaws, I would say the shops should have some uber gear that you can work towards getting. You will end up with a ton of gold and nothing to really spend it on. Also, A town portal scroll would have been nice and  some of the character models are not done that well. But these things don't really take away from the game. Overall, I give this game a 7.5 out of 10. It's worth playing.			"

												First of all lets get one thing cleared out quickly apart from the name dungeon siege 3 , this game does not have much to do with the other games apart from being set in the same world nor does it carry on the traditional style the first two games had.I can only recommend this game as a separate rpg and not a dungeon siege rpg game. With that Obsidian got many things right with the game and many things horribly wrong. Overall its a decent rpg game with a single expansion that can easily last for about 30 hours. The story is good enough to carry on till the end.Pros- Good story decisions affect it a lot , every decision aftermath is narrated nicely in the end making you want to play the game again and correct a few decisions.- Good graphics and a decent sized world to play in.- Tons of side quests and lore to find and has a nice gps style helper to lead you to the quests if you have trouble finding the locations.- Co-op is a hit and miss , surely no one plays it and the camera would mess it up worse but its always nice to play a 4 player co-op in story modeCons- The controls are kinda good and horrible it fails to have a proper point and click nor a keyboard oriented control, which means you will be moving around awkwardly and missing tons of attacks. Aiming is horribly hard which made me stick to melee only.- Mad camera view points, its the worst enemy , never use the mouse to control the camera.- As with Obsidian games before the game crashes a lot and freezes up frequently in cut scenes. - Terrible skills most of it is not needed and it makes the game more complex- The game has a lots of unwanted complex stats instead of the standard attributes most rpgs limit themselves , just go for anything that increases attack and health leech(vampire) , They tried to copy the D&D attributes but gave up and its just confusing.- Boring loot the rare items can become more better than unique items which should not happen in  a rpg.- Companions are terrible and there isn't any romance or side quests related to them either. It would certainly be sad that square enix killed off the dungeon siege series after how badly this game did , because this game sets up the story nicely for more sequels to be made in the series.

												Did you enjoy Dungeon Siege 1 or 2? Do you like action rpg's like Diablo or Torchlight?  Or you even enjoyed the D&D lite Bauldur's Gate version for console? If you answered yes to any of these questions then don't buy this game.What DS3 does is a disgrace to aRPG's. What's so strange is it from Obsidian, one of my favorite developers. How they messed this up so badly is beyond my comprehension. Let me point out a few of the flaws.CONTROLS - In all aRPG's the left mouse button moves your character around, attacks enemies that are highlighted, and picks up loot. In DS3 the left mouse is the attack key only. It's basically what most games have set as shift+attack since when you press it you stop what you're doing and preform an attack no matter if there's an enemy or not. Moving is the right mouse button. The move button does not attack at all. Picking up items is the 'E' key. Yup, they took one simplistic function and divided it into 3 buttons that will confuse and frustrate you. That's just one example of how badly they messed up the control scheme here.CHARACTER - Character development should be an important aspect of any RPG. You are presented with 4 different characters to choose from, all with different abilities, and a decent back story. So in the beginning you're thining you'll be able to develop and grow this person. Nope. Firstly, you are not allowed to zoom in on your character for a close-up look. When you get new weapons and armor their apperance changes, but you can never really get the feel of how much more badass you are. Combine that with the worst inventory management system I've seen in 10 or more years. You are never allowed to view your character in an inventory screen and see good your new loot looks. And if that wasn't enough, when you interact with other characters in the game you are only ever shown the other person's face. Basically once you choose your avatar, and begin the game, you will never be allowed to relate to them again. Match that with a talent tree that doesn't give you a choice as to what to develop. You are forced to unock all abilities in each tier.GRAPHICS - There is one major problem here. Peoples eyes look like they are dead. Everyone's eyes in this game is slightly whited out and it seriously feels like they are the eyes of the deceased. Also a problem is the UI. I mentioned some of it with the inventory, but the UI is just bad all around. Not to mention your characters abilities icons aren't very good. They don't do a good job at representing what each ability does.SAVE POINTS - Really!? Save points in a game!? It's the 21st century is there anyway we could have just moved past this? Was it in Square Enix's contract to publish this game it had to have Save Points instead of an auto-save feature, check points, manual save? Oh, and when you do save; instead of just selecting the save slot, you must first select the save slot you want and then you have to actually go to the bottom of the screen and press the save button. An unnecessary step and only further points out the bad programing decisions that were made in this games development.MULTIPLAYER - Last but certainly not least is MP. You do not bring your avatar into a MP session. You are only allowed to play as one of the Hosts NPC buddies. Yes, playing with friends means you do nothing more than waste your time while your friend gets to complete the game. Which leads me to my final complaint...AI - You unlock NPC's in the game that help out on quests. Basically they're the pets of most aRPG's. Except the pets of most aRPG's are vastly better programmed than these human counterparts. They wander around in combat, barely helping at all. In fact, this game would have faired better if they had just not included them. IMHO it feels like they were behind on development and the team never got around to actually fleshing the NPC's out. Pros - From all that badness there is some good. The story is well written and developed. Voice acting is good. Game runs well.			"

												DS3 while not like its predecessors it's still pretty damn good.  I thought the story was fantastic and you have multiple branching paths like choosing your own adventure books.  Much like you would find in a Dragon Age or The Elder Scrolls title.  The game can be quite difficult at times too.  Difficulty spikes throughout the game.  You may down a boss within a few minutes, but getting to the boss you may come close to death more than a few times from trash mobs.  Treasures of the Sun DLC is highly recommended and has quite a lot to offer.  Level cap +5, enchanting, more story and the option to respec your skills!!!DS3 isn't like DS1 or DS2 in the regard of open world ARPG's, but still does a good job in the genre nonetheless.  There are save points everywhere in this game so if you do forget to save your last save shouldn't be far behind.  I do wish the respec pool for your abilities was easier to do.  You'll have to backtrack and traverse through areas again just to get to the town that offers this.  Buying new gear from merchants was way overpriced so buying from them was never an option for me.  By the time I made it to the last boss my gear was pretty good anyway, but I did end up having an excess of gold by that time too.On the fence about whether you'd like this or not?  Like I stated above.  If you're into choose your own adventures like Dragon Age/Oblivion, but in ARPG form this game is for you.  DLC recommended.  Well written and very fun.  Enjoyed.  9/10			"

												The first game from Obsidian I have to give the down finger. It's a shait console port, and even worse, it completely did away with the character system and playstyle from Dungeon Siege I and II. Some good characters and playing co-op are the only redeeming qualities, so if a) you are not a fan of the first two games and b) can withstand consolitis, you may want to try it for the aforementioned redeeming qualities.

												A lot of people ♥♥♥♥ and moan about this game in the reviews, and I can understand why. The game plays nothing like either of the first two titles, and is quite restricted in what you can customize about your character. That aside this is a really damned fine RPG, and the story is very much equal to the other Dungeon Siege titles. Available quests and in game lore pay a great deal of tribute to those titles as well. The biggest complaint I have for this one is the camera is really restricted in how far you can move it and zoom, there are a couple quick fixes available on the net that will remove this though, and that makes the game much better by itself. Locations and characters are quite beautifully done, and the voice acting is very good. The only real negative to this game is that the story cut scenes are basically poorly drawn stills with narration.			"

												The loot isn't amazing, the story isn't really all the great(obsidian entertainment have done way better) but damn I really enjoyed the core mechanics in this game. I don't typically enjoy the Diablo-like RPG but something about this game scratched an itch I didn't know I had. Building around physically dodging attacks made the game feel more like engaging than anything than anything else I've found in the genre. Just play the game with a gamepad though, it was how it was designed to be played.I've also never played through Dungeon Siege I or II but from what I'm told, they're entirely different games. You might not like this game if you liked those. Might have been better if this game was it's own IP.			"

												I was a huge fan of Dungeon Siege series and unfortunately this game nothing to do with DS. I played this game one hour and I was so mad that I uninstalled and shelved the game. The stupid Obsidian perk system (yeah, the same one they put in every game like they can't do anything else)  replaced the unique attribute system. The character based weapons replaced the free customization of your character. The game world is just a one straight path with locked doors. Obsidian Entertainment is a one big joke in game business and it's famous for ruining big game francishes because they doesn't respect the legendary games.

												The third installment of the Dungeon Siege series really brings a huge change to the series, one that most people hated if they were fans of the previous installments. They take away the feeling of freedom, and the ability to have a large party, the skill system is completely stripped out and replaced by a VERY straight forwards skill selection tree, with a few passive powers for you to pick as well.Although it fails in comparison to what the old Dungeon Sieges represent it is its own unique blend of action RPG. Its linear making it a no brainer to get around, the graphics are decent, the moves your characters can do have impact and flourish to them, and the environments and enemies are all well thought out and interesting.The story is actually pretty good, and even the side quests you can do can end in different ways, since you can make choices that literally alter how parts of the game will play out, and if you get certain perks or not. Which adds to the replayability of the game. You can go back and make different choices the next time around, and even have a different partner to see their different dialogues during the times you can make interactive choices.The real weaknesses in this game stem from a high difficutly and learning curve, some cheap boss battles that you must figure out what to do right away or get pounded into the ground, and the VERY boring loot you receive, alongside a sometimes terrible partner AI that will stand there and watch you get your skull caved in from a safe distance..The difficulty spikes up a huge amount if you choose to play as the melee character in the game. It takes alot of manuevering and quite a bit of use of the block and roll buttons even to survive a standard encounter on normal difficulty, even when your partner isn't being ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.Some boss fights come up suddenly with little warning, and unless you figure out their patterns pretty fast, they are going to absolutely crush you into the ground within' seconds. You need to quickly figure out what moves can be blocked, and what you have to avoid, because if you don't get ready to reload your save. Yes it adds to the challenge of the game, but some instances and some of the bosses almost require you to die once or twice just to figure out what you were supposed to be doing. Some of the fights for when you actually get to them are straight up unfair with the gear and skills you've acquired on your journey, and if you are playing on hard, get ready to get one or two shot, there is NO room for error in the boss fight on the higher diffculty.Then after all that, what do you get? A ton of garbage drops, a handful of cash, and a long walk back to turn the quest in, just to get a perk or a halfway decent item or money reward, sometimes not even that. Sure you get a ton of loot in the game, but most of it is boring and much of the same. Alot of the stats have no in game description and you literally need to look up a guide to figure out the meaning of the stats on your equipment and what it actually does for you, since there is no in game indicator as to what the stats do.The game has an interesting enemy roster, with a variety of environtments that usually force you to round them up in a large area or choke point so you can combat them effectivly. Even some of the standard enemies can wreck your life in a matter of seconds if you're screwing around. If you wanted a challenge this game can definitly serve it up, depending on the character you select, and which partner you decide to pair up with. The difficulty spikes down a bit IF you can actually find someone to play with online, or if you're playing with a friend who is willing to replace the sometimes brain dead AI.While it's a fun romp with actual decent dialogues and cool choices, I simply would not recommend picking it up unless it's on sale or part of a bundle with possibly the other games in the series or perhaps bundled with other square-enix games for CHEAP.

												The only reason I have this game is because it came together in a free package deal when buying my new video card.  I had happy memories of the original Dungeon Siege and Dungeon Siege II; so I was excited to play this to finish my collection as I always wanted it, but never got around to it.15 minutes in I was feeling sick. I mean, Dungeon Siege was always a generic fantasy setting but had a charming 1980's D&D feel. This was just so bland, and I dare say the Dungeon Siege movie was more visually inspired than this game. The graphics look good at first, but the animations of the first NPC you run into is just cartoonish puppet looking and  uncanny valley at the same time. The lipsync was terrible, the eyes of NPC's dead and souless. Combine this with lack luster voice acting...I just couldn't get invested. First impressions are important, and it did not impress, but I continued playing further. An hour in and I still found myself exiting the game to play something else because I was bored. I couldn't be hooked!However, the major killer of this game is the camera, damn thing is clunky when being adjusted. It also turns so fast and wildly around making you sick and is never in a tactical advantageous position. Also seeing how Dragon Age Origins came out a couple years before Dungeon Siege III, I couldn't help but compare the two. The graphics, animation, gameplay, camera and interface was just lackluster compared to a simliar sword and sorcery fantasy RPG. It feels like a cheap product trying to lure in some of the same audience by the way they were marketing this game and hyping it.Some might say I have nostalgia glasses, but I have nothing against a game franchise trying out different styles so long as it's good or enjoyable. I got together some distant friends who were not familiar with the Dungeon Siege series, but were familiar with other RPG's or avid players and they too were unimpressed even as casual gamers.I later learned from a review by Ross Scott of Accursed Farms; that one of the key and unique features of Dungeon Siege, it's large party system which could include up to eight party members active at one time, was not present. Having bombastic large melee's was one of the most memorable and fun things about Dungeon Siege and it's gone. Well, that killed any chance of me picking up the game again.I uninstalled it and I wish I could delete it from my library.I don't even want my money back; I just don't want to remember owning or playing this.

Awwwh ""Dungeon Siege III""... I can't have a clear opinion about you. No, wait. I have...First of all: Dungeon Siege I & (especially) Dungeon Siege II where one really big part of my gaming history while I was a kid, I loved them! So, I was really excited when I heard that a new ""Dungeon Siege""-game will come out. But then I saw the negative reviews of how disappointed the people were... so I waited for a sale and grabbed it, with good conscience. The whole series only cost me 5 bucks - so I left out my daily dosis of coffee and pizza... nevermind.I started the game and thought... ""yeah, ok. It's.. uhm.. different?"" and this throughout the game. But let's see:...good was:++ that it was over...+ ...oh! and you can block and dodge now...+ ...a nice battle sytem (it's different)+ good graphics+ exceptable soundtrack...that's it...please don't be mad, ok? But I can't find a mass of positve aspects. The problem is, that ""DS I & II"" are different... In a better way. ""Dungeon Siege III"" offers:- flat characters (sad biographies)- only 4 characters available- no ""own"" hero- horrible inventory- the story is mehh.. 08/15- ""too"" easy? (also on ""legendary"")- poopy endboss- dead multiplayer (with terrible camera)- it's pretty linear (no open-world, only elements)- bad level-design... similar to a long hallway- NPC's are too powerful...- ...often they aren't recognised by the enemies- it's NO Dungeon Siege!Yeah... as you can see, it is not my game. Even if I played over 40 hours. But trust me, one big problem is, that I loved ""DS I & II"" but ""DS III"" is in comparison with those just... poop. You were able to play with more than just 2 guys in your group; it was open-world; the classic-inventory was there; you had your ""own"" hero, with your individual hair, skin, face and name! And not ""Lucas"" some kind of a knight... like this 2011-decal.I have nothing against a game franchise trying out different styles so long as it's good or enjoyable. I also asked other friends, who like RPG's (and didn't knew the ""Dungeon Siege""-series) and they were also not impressed or interested in playin'. Maybe my review is so bad because I was guided by the other two parts, but let me tell you, that other RPG-games are more fun. So if you still decide to buy the ""Dungeon Siege""-series, play ""DS III"" first - it has nothing to do with the other parts and you won't be disappointed. Only in comparison with the other two parts it feels pretty bad (sadly). If you also don't care for graphics, the other two parts are a good variety.Dungeon Siege III - you are a solid game but can't keep up with your ""older siblings"". But you will not be disadvantaged.That's why I give you 5/10 but still a negative review - I am sorry.Please tell me your feel for the game withIf you want some more details -> look into the comments! :-)			"

												Bad console controls and camera (camera is fixed for local -read:same screen - co-op). Ontop, it's got absolutely nothing in common with other dungeon siege games and I don't even see why as they were perfectly good games with a ground-breaking design. Dungeon siege I and II mixed hack & slash with TRPG creating a real time tactical RPG with tons of replayability and a seemingly endless journey for a campaign.Dungeon Siege 3 on the other hand is just a generic action RPG for consoles. Granted, the characters and skills aren't all that bad designed, as is the campaign but it's not great either and the consolized controls drop it below mediocre for PC games. It may be worth buying if you have no expectations whatsoever.			"

Played them, but must not have been memorable enoughGood voice actingChoices come into play during and at the endSkills and abilities are balancedCons:Poor camera control - takes a few hours to get used toQuest system/map isn't well designed.  Hard to find some quest lines and others are much too simple and bunched together.Capped level - DLC increases it, but I hate killing stuff and not getting xpSome of the quest lines are a little predictableEquipment is a little all over the place - can't get into details on some stats so you're not sure which piece might be superior			"

												Wow what a piece of ♥♥♥♥....Never underestimate the ability of large corporations collaborating together to churn out a steaming pile of filth.  The basic camera issues and glitches would more than fill out a review before the ♥♥♥♥ rpg elements and boring game play could even be discussed.  ""O you mean to tell me that every single move I get can be mastered and then empowered to create a unique variant of that same move?!""....cool now I have total of 5 moves when I beat the game...and maybe 2 of them are useful.  Riveting.    The graphics are dated,  the camera sucks a huge phallus (especially on multiplayer which is what the game is meant for, unless of course you enjoy running around with an  A.I  imitating Gilbert Grape), and the combat gets stale after 2 hours.  Thankfully the game can be completed in around 10 so I can assure you, if you already made the mistake of purchasing, the suffering will be brief.  I’d rather go to church than play through this game again.  2/10  Doodie.			"

												What happened to Dungeon Siege? The first one was truly amazing, the second wasn't the same but this one is horrible, It doesn't feels like a Dungeon Siege anymore.If you're new to Dungeon Siege, you should either move on and get the first and second or play this one then play the fist game, you probably won't want to play this one anymore after having played the first and second in the series.It's still a good game but it shouldn't be considered as a Dungeon Siege game, there was 2 maps in the first one, the campaign one and the multiplayer one (that could also be played singleplayer) and that was a plus, you could always play with the same character on the campaign or multiplayer map, you could also create your own maps and/or download community made maps.Not In the second though but the campaign was still really good.If you want it, then wait for a deal, do not buy it full price.5/10			"

												I was very uncertain about this game at first try... I mean I've played both old DS games and this one doesn't use the same mechanics at all !And I've to admit that the beginning isn't very addictive. But I kept playing and... I loved playing mid/end game content. Once you leave that ♥♥♥♥ing valley/forest and enter to stonebridge, the game is way more interesting !!! That is not the best action-RPG at all, but this title deserves some love. If you can get the DLC aswell, get it ! It's worth ! But only if you can buy it for a reduced price. It adds ~5 hours of gameplay.			"

												Dungeon Siege and Dungeon Siege 2 are without a doubt my two favotite games of all time and it really hurts me to see what Dungeon Siege 3 became. Its clear this was envisioned from the start to be nothing like a proper Dungeon Siege game. On its own its perfectly respectable... for a console game. For the type of game it is, it does well enough. My problem with this game has nothing to do with the combat or loot or even the screen sharing issues though. It the fact it tried to sell itself off as another Dungeon Siege game when it makes no effort to even try to capture what made the previous two games so great. Under another title it wouldnt have had the fan following behind it but it also wouldnt have created such a contraversy. The Dungeon Siege lore was turned into a joke. Without spoiling anything, I'll just say the main plot revolves around a religious nutcase being the badguy and doing all kind of things but with a selfrightious justification like all badguy religious nutcases are prone to have. I dislike the story. I dislike the visual representations. The only thing I actually like about this game is the Heroes' Crypt. Its where the heroes of the Dungeon Siege 1, the main character and all your companions you gain throughtout the game, were laid to rest. Its a beautiful nod to the first game but unfortunately the only good one.This review was a long time coming. I hate this game for everything it should have been but isnt. I hate Square Enix and Obsidian for effectively killing my favorite series and I dont believe I will ever forgive them for it. If you are new to the series you probably wont mind the change. If you are a long time Dungeon Siege fan dont waste your money on this. Do not reward the developers for this abomination.			"

												I am definitely disappointed, this game didn't even exceed my expectations, which weren't too big. First of all there's not such thing as auto-save, so if you die after 2 hours of playing you will have to start all over again(as in my case) but only if you forgot to save it manually and the fighting mechanics are poor The gameplay is pretty boring , the story has a forced ""coolness"" and the voice acting is terrible, additionally the multiplayer is a total disaster.Overall not a good game but not a very bad one too(for people who REALLY love rpg's). I just don't really like it and I think a 5$ price would be a reasonable price. I would rather buy a Diablo game.  Type Rating   Gameplay 3   Lore 2   Audio 3   Multiplayer 2 My rating: 2.5			"

												Dungeon Siege III is, of course, the third game in the roleplaying series this time developed by Obsidian and published by SQUARE ENIX. You choose one of four different character classes and begin an adventure to take back the nation of Ehb from an evil force that has gained control of the land and declared war on all of the former protectors of Ehb, known as leggionairies. The title has all the elements of a traditional roleplaying game with you, the player, gaining experience points through combat, completing quests and discovering lore. You use these points to upgrade your chosen characters abilities and gear to your particular style of play. Graphically the game is beautiful, it's played in a isometric top-down view much like ""Diablo"" and the ""Baldur's Gate"" titles. The environments are varied, colorful and full of the little details that one looks for in games of this type. Both the sound and musical score are excellent as well. I have to admit though that for some strange reason I remember downloading and playing the demo of this game right before it launched a few years ago and I did not like it. I can only believe that's because of my gaming habits having changed around that time and me moving more towards RPG's like ""Skyrim"" and ""Kingdoms Of Amalur"" and away from the old-school roleplaying games that first captured my interests in the genre to begin with. I don't know...all I can say now is this is indeed a great game and highly recommended for roleplaying gamers!!!			"

												While DS1 was a fairly boring hack and slash with a fantastic modding community, and DS2 an obvious attempt at trying to be more like Diablo 2, DS3 might as well be from a different series. That's not to say however, that it is a bad game, merely questionably named. DS3 drops most of the grinding and instead plays more like an action game. Loot and leveling still exist, but the emphasis is placed on the combat and story. The story isn't anything to write home about, but it's still significantly better than the first 2 games in the series, and most action RPGs in general. The combat is where this game shines, different weapon and skill combinations can accent any play style, and it's just flat out fun to play. The controls, especially with KBAM, may take some getting used to, but the game is worth it in the end.			"

												+ Smooth combat+ Nice character designs+ Great storyline+ Nice map system- Very dizzy camera- No Create-a-Character systemThis is a very good game overall, however it's so different from Dungeon Siege I & II that it shouldn't be named Dungeon Siege III. Maybe Dungeon Siege: Retribution or something like that? IMO one of the main reasons this game gets so much hate is because, the way it was named generated a lot of expections from long time fans of the franchise. Honestly this game is very decent to say the least, so try it if you don't mind that the gameplay is different than the previous two DSs.7/10			"

												Let me get out the way the most frequently mentioned points in the reviews:I have not played any previous Dungeon Siege title.I have played with a controller. Completed on Very Hard in 17 hours in Single PlayerQuick OverviewSo what got my intrigue about this game was the developer. I have always been a fan of Obsidian for the fact their RPGs are generally very well written, have great characters and lore and feature fun and active player choices. On those fronts, this game did not disappoint at all. In more depthCompanionThe characters are well developed and your companion delivers the right amount of commentary during gameplay and during conversations to the point you appreciate them being there but also don't want them to just shut the hell up.There is an 'Influence' tied in with each companion that allows powers to be unlocked if you fill the influence meter. The influence is gained by being a great leader to those companions in your actions and conversation tones. The companion I preferred (Lucas) was a diplomat and felt people should be heard and given a chance, before being cut in half, where as my starting companion had a much harsher and warrior like attitude.This adds a nice level of depth already to the companion next to you, assuring that they are not just another icon on the map.CombatEnemy and location variety is great. I really enjoyed the pace in which you move from one area to another and the different enemies you face within. You are never in one area for too long, and this is coming from someone who did every side mission he could find. From elemental magic attacking enemies to long range bow to big towering tank like enemies. It's all there to test your skills.One thing I will say against the combat is, playing as Katarina, a rifle and dual wield pistol packing badass woman, who fights from distance, the roll for me was very OP. The roll dodge basically puts you in a invincible frame state and the amount of 'cool down' before you can roll again is almost non existent. Some tougher fights can turn into a rolling game due to that but there is strategy in that you have to decide when to stop rolling and make an attack. There is also the environment variety that can change and affect how you fight as some areas are tight, where as others have space to move around. StoryThe story is well realised and did not disappoint an Obsidian fan. Though not their most ground-breaking work; it's solid, well written and well told.It really gets you thinking about power and how people gain it and hold on to it. And also why they want it in the first place. As with most Obsidian games, there is no clear good or bad. There is only intentions, inspirations, and actions. It's up to you as a member of The Legion, a great historic order who have been massacred and lost many, to decide many people's faith as that is the role of The Legion. It is also you who decides and helps decides how The Legion should rebuild itself. Do you face the ugly truths of the past or hide them to make The Legion appear a something greater than what it is?As a member of The Legion, who historically decide on disputes of the land, it is your job to settle some disputes and call some of the shots. There range from a land ownership dispute to deciding the faith of an ex-Legion member who causes chaos to ultimately deciding what to do with the person you have been pursuing for the whole game and many more throughout your journey.Your decisions and the outcomes are explained in nicely drawn comic like pages, elaborating on the waves your decisions have made and perhaps how it was received by the public and the fellow Legion members. This is a nice way to acknowledge and feel the weight of your decision.GameplayIt might seem odd I have left gameplay for last but this is actually a fairly simple affair. Simple in its execution but done well and is addictive similarly to how a loot based ARPG games can get (think Diablo, Torchlight, etc). There is the three grades of items, many skills and proficiencies to pick and upgrade, many stats to think about, another upgrade system which is tied to 'mastering' the skill. You have two sets of weapon sets, main and secondary. Main is usually your damage weapon and secondary is crowd control. Each weapon has three powers along with character based defensive powers. So it has most of the depth you would expect from such game and really I feel this is best experienced by playing the demo which you can get right here on Steam. I have mentioned the depth demo might not express in this little overview section.To End...So, overall, this is a very solid game in all its functions and I have thoroughly enjoyed my 17 hours with it.It gets an overall;VERY GOOD

												I finished Dungeon Siege III (i i i) moments ago. I pulled up the review box immediately.Guys and gals... I really like this game.When I first saw it being paraded about, advertised, I came under the impression that it was a fantasy-action romp through a rich setting. I saw that it had unique characters. I concluded it had nice voice acting. My impressions were correct.While I grew up beside Baldur's gate, Neverwinter Nights, Vampire the Masquerade, and manymanymore CRPGs, I never actually got around to playing Chris Avellone's epic: Dungeon Siege. Over time it became dated, and somehow thrown into my own personal category of ""just another old fantasy title"" (Like The Summoner. Man, that needs a remake). I bring up my gaming heritage to illustrate that I love Oldschool roleplaying. I probably would have liked Dungeon Siege. but I never played it. I walked into Dungeon Siege i-i-i without any expectations except for those listed above. Thus, for the sake of the other (negative) reviewers let me say: If I was expecting a fantasy epic stat crunching party based spacebar-to-pause open world fantasy, I too would have been a sore child. These things DS iii is not. So, let me tell you what it is.Hopeful. Noble. And well meaning.It is an important piece of story in the world of Ehb. You can tell because your choices are explained to you in the end. I love it when they do that, and I haven't gotten such a kick out of it since Arcanum (don't get me started on Arcanum, I'll start drooling). This was written carefully. Characters have personality and charm (even if that personality is merely ""flirty russian""). They say things that matter. A lot of work was put into their comments and role in the game. They aren't just a sandbox of people you can choose from the beginning, or just meet along the way. These characters are part of the tale. Some more than others. Their models are well designed, from the somewhat pudgy Reinhart, to the seductive Katarina. Their voice acting is mostly excellent (I'm looking at you Anjala, that synthesizer seems to throw off your tone). There are a finite number of side-quests, and low and behold a lot of them impact the story in small and meaningful ways. The continuity was surprising.Surprising.In a game set in a rich and lore filled world, and one that has a legacy to live up to, I must mention the abominable level design. It's a corridor. This broadens slighly in the later levels, but my first piece of advice to any new player would be to turn off the mini-map. You don't need it (unless you get turned around), and it will just depress you. Ignore the map and take in the sights. There are nice sights in this game. The graphics are well designed. The engine was meant to eliminate load times by loading the next area as you play (this and the fact it came out for last-gen consoles might explain the linearity), but still manages to put a nice glowy sheen on everything. Mud looks sumptuous, water ripples, and sewer bricks glisten. Attacks carry graphical weight, and hits are punctuated nicely. There's lots of flair here. I especially love the teleport animations for Reinhart, the wizard.If you've never seen them let me give you my next piece of advice, new player: Play this game on Hardcore. Hardcore, because combat is really good when you need to dodge. Actually, nerf that. Combat is good ALL the time. Animations are smooth, and attacks are flashy. Until you clear an area, enemies tend to respawn, but there is really no need to grind. Once you start getting your groove into that leveling system you will tear them a new one all whilst proceeding forward gracefully. Once you finish an act, much of the villainy is narrated away, so you can wander about once more with a minimum of fuss, should you desire. You really shouldn't. There is no point in returning to old areas unless you collect Unique weapons.In the realm of combat are the epic, epic boss fights. No, not just any joe-shmoe ""leader"" of a group with a health bar, I'm talking the real bosses.  You'll know one when you meet one. There will be a sort of arena that appears, a flash of special effect, and you'll get stomped.It's glorious.These bosses shake up the fighting with excellent special moves and themes. I wish the same care had been taken for the usual enemies.I've digressed from my original points. Hopeful. Noble. Well meaning.The real draw here is the story. A story that continues the CRPG tradition of interaction. The gameplay is fun and arcady, the mechanics are fine, but suddenly you'll be placed with a true conundrum on your hands. A narrative imperative! And the succulent tones of the narrator (Odo) will accompany whatever you choose. You reap the consequences in a tightly focused tale about rising from the ashes. Getting back up again. Repentance. That golden second chance. It is noble, and great, and fun. I recommend it for the $15-20 pricepoint, or lower (as it often goes on sale). So...:Grab a controller,Turn off that mini-map,turn that baby up to hardcore,give it whirl.			"

												Dungeon Siege III is rather curious game, in one hand is not good port to pc (weird camera controls), have very little do to with the original franchise, lots of strange game mechanics that are barely explained. But also have some very good concept art (even when the camera make very hard to see your character up close), rather good story;characters with some choices that impact the end (but don´t expect much). It feel more like action rpg with some diablo like mechanics that a proper ""dungeon siege"" game, it could be said that its greatest sin lay on it´s name. So if you aware and wish to give a try, I might recommend, but if you seek something like Dungeon Siege II or I, avoid it.			"

												I enjoy most Square games, usually give them a shot, this one was no different.  It just took me longer to get into the games story than I would have liked.  Four unique characters all having unique play styles, but all of which feel bland at first.  This tends to hold true for most of the game, whether its character or story telling, it starts off slow, gradually improving.  There is nothing ground breaking about the style presented, nothing new about killing for loot and moving on.  The level design left something to be desired, and the mini map was not very helpful at times, and certain stats were never quite explained without delving into the help section of the game.  The combat was fun, if not slow at first, as you learn to dodge and block and to use your two stances.  One for single enemy combat and the other for Groups.  This holds true to all four characters, even if they have vastly different abilities, they are still grouped into group or single combat.  The AI partner never bothered me and seemed to do thier job fairly well as the game progressed. There are also dialogue choices that affect your current companions ""trust"" in you, not as in depth as Mass Effect or other bioware games, but pretty alright.  You can also unlock ""deeds"" through this and completing certain tasks, which give permanent stat boosts, which I found rewarding.By the end I found the story to be quite alright, envolving and engaging enough to feel rewarded after it was all said and done.  I ended up liking the character customization by the end, even if, like I said, it took awhile for the ball to get rolling.  All in all, a decent game, well worth any marked down price its given, and certainly not the worst hack n slash loot fest I've ever played by far.			"

												If you like RPGs and a bit of hack 'n' slash, this game is for you. Lot's of fun, good story line, good characters and super addicting. Parts can be hard (boss fights) but definitely worth it. There was a lot of thought put into this game and there are a lot of different ways your decisions affect it. Haven't beaten it (about 25% of the way through, I think) and I absolutely LOVE it. Sometimes it's hard to pull myself away, haha. Definitely a good buy and a good way to pass the time. Long Live the Legion!!Edit: I beat the game quite awhile ago and forgot to update the review. I was addicted to the very end and was very sad when the game finally came to a halt. I ended up having to replay the last bit cause I missed one of the achievements which kept me from getting the fully-win-the-game achievement. At some point I hope to play the other three characters, but I really liked Anjali so it might be a hard change.There are quite a few interesting aspects in the game that I enjoyed. The skill selection process, for one, as well as the essences to add boosts to your character by way of weapons and armor. The multiplayer is certainly not the greatest, it would be if it didn't have a tethered camera. There is a way around this, but I am not desperate enough for a multiplayer to deal with adjusting the game by way of editing files.So all in all, I would suggest buying this game to play solo. If you want it for the multiplayer aspect, I think I should say to skip it.EditEdit: I forgot to mention this is a linear game, meaning it follows a pretty solid track with no real free roam. I didn't find it bothersome, but some others might so I figured it should be thrown out there. :)			"

												One of the best isometric action games there is. Definitely a really good game. Four playable classes, my fav being the mage because he has cool looking spells like clockwork bombs. I have beaten the game with him and the entire game was awesome. Now I am playing the dlc Treasures of the Sun with my gunner. The gunner can switch between a rifle and dual wielded weapons that include a one handed shotgun and pistol and she has some really powerful skills. The fighter chick can summon a fire dog to help and the warrior is pretty self explanatory with some good skills also. The voice acting is very good and the game has memorable sound effects. The mouth movement actually matches the words in most cases in cut scenes. That's some pretty good detail for a top-down action game. The music is superb and always fitting of the place and mood. The graphics are really very good and hold up very well even by today's standards. The best thing about the game is its unique combat system. You get two sets of weapons with three skills each, and you can hold right trigger to activate more powerful versions of your spells or hold left trigger to activate healing and defensive skills. Obviously I play with a xbox 360 controller and it actually works very well because otherwise I would never even consider using a controller for a isometric game. A good example of a game that you can easily find somewhere on sale for a steal or could actually pay its regular price of $15 and that is still a great price, especially since the game will give you around 14-16 hours of playtime as it did me.8/10 one of my all-time favs.			"

												I remember dungeon siege as being something that rewarded you for the skills you did over time no matter what they were, allowing you to create weird character types of strength and magic.  This installment removes that and gives you 4 hard choices to pick from with no customization whatsoever and no skill branching that was indicative of the others.I'd have preferred if this was called something else other than Dungeon Siege as it didn't feel anything like the previous installments of the series from my POV.

												If you ever played the first two games in the Dungeon Siege series and enjoyed them, do not... I repeat, do not buy this game. It is in no way shape or form even close to the original.

												Rating 7.5/10What is it?Action RPGThe Good:+Graphically the game is beautiful, but what really stands out is the use of color especially in regards to the characters skills. Every skill used is colorful and bright and makes the combat really stand out. Making a critical ht is satisfying because it really stands out.  It makes you wonder why other developers are so afraid of having color in their games. +4 unique characters each with their own unique play style. Every character has 2 offensive stances used to either deal with single or groups of enemies and one defense stance. Each stance has 3 skills associated with it. Each skill has 2 way you can upgrade it, allowing you to customize how you want to develop your character. In addition each character has a passive skill tree further adding to your build. All of this leads to interesting builds.+The game play mechanics are a bit more unique to this type of game. In order to use your abilities you need force and the only way to gain force is to attack your enemies. Defensive skills use power spheres which fill up as you take damage. All of this creates some unique game play elements and changes the way you play and develop your character. Dodging and blocking also play an important role in game play,  +You can always rely on Obsidian to craft a well thought out story.  The games side quests in some regards are even more interesting and creative than the main quest.  Books and lore are scattered around the world to further flesh out details if your into that sort of thing. +Music/sound and voice acting are all top notch. The Bad:-If there is one aspect of an action rpg that you need to get right it's the loot. The loot has to be exciting, it has to make you want to kill enemies to discover new items, it should feel rewarding. This game has non of that. The loot in this game is boring. For the most part, loot just changes stats and more likely than not you will equip the loot that gives you the highest stats. A good loot system means the player has to make tough choices, this game doesn't do that. -Multiplayer is all but dead meaning you are not going to get any achievements related to multiplayer. Even if you do play a multiplayer game you character progress is not saved if you join someone else's game when you go back to single player. How this even passed in today's time is mind boggling. Conclusion I really loved this game, I played it many times on 360 and will continue to play it here. This game gets a lot of things right in regards to the genre sadly it also gets things horribly wrong as well.  I love that each character is really unique and no two characters play the same. Hopefully we see Obsidian get to make another with more improvements.  "

												Graphics? Acceptable. Sounds? Fair enough. Gameplay? Pretty bad with keyboard and mouse, so I switched to a controller, a bit better. So I'm playing this game, only on normal difficulty, and I keep asking myself: ""Why do I even bother?"" Even though I've purchased this game, I have absolutely zero intention of playing it again. I just can't get into it. Let alone the tedious walking from point A to point B, the respawning monsters and/or the loot system (which isn't very good either), the controls just kill it for me. I know my character isn't bad equipped, yet I keep dying because of control issues (bad response time, etc...). I just can't recommend this game. :(			"

												Read the lore, Play through the entire game play. I believe this was written beautifully. It may not been like the older style of dungeon seige 1 or 2. And the camera could be  a bit better for multiple player. But the game play, graphics, and the story alone surpassses the the two in the past. This game pack quite a challenge base on which character you decide to roll out as. I do hope they make a dungeon seige 4 and keep up the good work. And the ending script is all base on the choices you made. So play multiple times and choose different actions spare someone slay someone else. The choice is yours in the end.			"

												I like DSIII. The game had some interesting choices made for it during development it seems though.Let's take a small look at what you can expect _IF_ you decide to buy it at the end of this review. THIS GAME IS MEANT TO BE PLAYED WITH A CONTROLLER, MOUSE AND KEYBOARD DO WORK BUT IT'S UNOPTIMIZED Dungeon Siege 3 hosts a few terrain problems in some areas that force you to turn the camera 180 degrees before you can get away, unless you changed the basic controls (W S = movement, A D = turn camera). Don't be scared of this though, it'll mostly happen at the very edge of the paths and normally doesn't happen during boss fights.We also don't get to evade past enemies (at least this seems to be the case most of the time) but you get i-frames during your dashes so just dash away once you find your character. DO NOT LOSE TRACK OF YOUR OWN CHARACTER.If you love a challenge, you'll enjoy the ""hardcore"" mode, which no- it's not actually hardcore, it's a cool word for hard to them. Powerleveling won't get you anywhere as the enemies randomly jump in power, and any spray or ability that makes the floor deal damage over time will -most- likely 1-shot you, there's no limit for how fast it damages you so you can drop really damn fast, and they decided to let most bosses and later mobs have at least one of these two.That being said, every start is troublesome until you get to the first town I'd say, an unequipped character is exceptionally weak, and easy becomes really easy as soon as you start getting gear. Normal is still fine for a small challenge later on, though you'll probably be equipped and confident enough to win every fight.There's also a few more things worth noting, this IS a ported game (at least feels very much like it) and IS made for 2 player co-op (I'm not sure if you can do 3 players or more, I haven't tested it.) Playing anything but easy or normal on singleplayer is like asking for someone to make you mad because honestly, the AI is the worst I've ever seen in any game, the way it attacks and positions makes no sense at all, it feels like it just spams random buttons in hopes of doing something useful. They also try to revive you instantly even if it's dangerous, so don't play this alone, you'll regret it.So please, do not buy this game for a fun solo rpg game, because this is a co-op/multiplayer rpg, not a solo one.YES, you CAN respec in case you ruin something or want to change skills, but this requires the DLC and it isn't needed at all. At max level you'll have 3-4 talents untouched and 2-3 ability upgrades untouched and from my experience there's always at least two abilities you don't want to level, because others are much better to use.While we're already on abilities, the game introduces ""Mastery"" for abilities, which is based off of times used rather than time used or damage dealt with abilities, so keep that in mind when going for that.When travelling in the game there's a few things that are nice to know.Firstly, the screen is capped in the area the players are currently in on any given map, P1 counts as a host in a signal, if P2 tries to dash away or other things, they'll be reset and teleported next to P1 exactly like AI will if they get too far away from the host. This also means that both players have to co-operate when going places, or else one of the players have to let the other run around freely. This can be done by having either P1 or P2 open up any menu (c, x, f -- etc, though not escape menu) which will force the player into AI mode, It's best to have the player return to moving their character around before combat as the AI sometimes will force the player to stay locked out of their character because they're either using a skill, following a pattern of commands or a third thing that makes no sense at all. This can make it seem like you're unable to control your character at all, which technically is the case, but the AI has registered that you want to go back to control so it won't force you out completely. It will most likely stop attacking soon enough and you can help this by spamming the evade key just keep in mind that it won't always help and you can be stuck unable to control your character for a bit, so please try to have everyone out of menus before combat for your own sake. It helps a lot.P1 is also the ONLY person that can interact with people and quest items/objects and NPCs. I can't tell you why they decided to do it like this, but that's how it is. P2 (and others) CANNOT progress quests, interact with quest objects (unless they just have to pick it up for pull a lever) or talk to NPCs. Here's a final thing for playing multiplayer as well. Your mic is automatically turned on and you cannot disable it in-game for some reason. If you don't want it to be like this, change your mic settings under steam settings -> voice, add push to talk or change the mic to something that doesn't work.I believe I have mentioned anything worth mentioning in this game, and I'll answer any question needed in the comments. Besides everything I have adressed, I love the game.I love playing the game despite getting mad at sudden barrage of projectiles 1-shotting me on Hard, or other things.The story is average to good, you don't really have any big options in the game, but picking the right thing to talk about at the right time earns you small bonuses. ""Deeds"" give you minor stat bonuses and some you get from talking, others you get from really exploring and checking out everything you can. Exploring pays off in terms of items and deeds, rushing the game lets you farm achievements I suppose, but why would you do that in an RPG?The gameplay pays off tacticians on Hard, and lets people playing on Easy mess around and have fun, there's a fine balance from Easy to Normal, though Hard is a thing for itself. The graphics are also where they should be I feel, they don't seem old nor super high-tech, I may be biased as I prefer it when games look like how Dungeon Siege 3 does, but I wouldn't say the graphics are bad at, they suit a game from it's year.If you like the first 3-5 hours of the game I would buy the DLC if you have the chance, the DLC adds 5 hours of gameplay I'd say, if not more, and gives you just a little bit more to do in the game.

												Years ago, I used to play the first Dungeon Siege game at LAN. Me and a friend played it a lot, never finished it, but had fun with it nonetheless. Then the second game was released, didn't play it and don't really remember why. Although, it got excited back when this third game was announced - ""Hell yeah, another game in this great series!"". Imagine the disappointment when I first played DS3 and it was NOTHING like the first two games.Well, that was like three years ago that I last tried DS3 and it was on the Playstation 3. One strike right there. Well, I got the game in a Humble Bundle some months back and thought I'd give it another go and surprise, surprise, I actually had a lot of fun with the game.The first two games were squad based tactical RPGs, this one you're only controlling one character and you've got one companion and it's more like a Diablo clone, more than anything else. Maybe you've grown tired of Diablo 2 or 3, Titan Quest, Path of Exile... whatever it may be, and you want another game to play for a few hours (with or without friends), give DS3 a go. One character may be completed in like 10 hours and there's four to choose from so in all reality, you could play this game for abour 40-50 hours if you choose to play with all the characters.Anyhow, I do recommend this game but that is if you get it for a maximum of €5. So in another words, during a Steam sale or a bundle of sorts.			"

												I only played this game in couch co-op, and for this purpose, I recommend it is as a fun, if not particularly deep, hack'n'slash with a pretty good story and good production values. It provided us with an enjoyable 30 hours of monster slaying and while I will probably not play this game ever again, I will remember it as a pleasing experience.Most probably it would not be as good if I played alone, so keep that in mind.If you can this at 50% off, and have someone to play with, I say go for it.

It won't win any award and that really makes me sad as I do still think this is the best co-op arpg I've played.)This is the best couch co-op action-rpg experience you'll ever have. Clearly underated game because of the way it broke apart from its predecessors.The challenge that this game offers matches the tightness of the control and the satisfaction of beating up some hard encounters in co-op with your best friends.4 players co-op is too chaotic, but 2 players is pure awesomeness.

												Square Enix NA bundle was crappy to say the least as with HB monthly March with One Piece I was hoping this game can somehow offset the price we paid for the bundle.Pros:- Great VA - after going through ""Incredible adventures of Wolfboy"" the VA here is quite good which helps the 2nd point- Story is quite clear, simple but clear enough to understand the plot. It isn't as deep as Grim Dawn but isnt as shallow as Victor Vran. - Stable perforrmance even when mining -The only downside is during speaches between characters. its 60 FPS stable when outside fightingThings that I am technically NOT considering as cons- Game is clearly designed for consoles - everything is quite big and skills and abilities are simple. It doesnt have the depth other ARPGs have. Items, maps and skills are all simplified to say the least.- As much as I would say this is a top down ARPG i would consider this more as a 3rd person ARPG due to how the camera looks and feelsCons- Lack of PC settings with only basic ones. - Doesnt have 75 FPS support(its stable 60 in VSYNC but will produce more frames with it disabled)- Controller ""hang"": when moving sometimesFor now the story is enough for me to keep on playing, hopefully i get enough hours of enjoyment to warrant the SE bundle "

												Here is a game that got completely overlooked. Partially with good reason as it is NOTHING like the previous titles in the Dungeon Siege franchise. While the game is still a hack and slash at it's heart, there's nowhere near the amount of loot and customization typically associated with games of that nature. That doesn't mean there isn't a great game to be played here, just maybe not the one you expect.Instead of creating a custom character at the start of your adventure you are given a choice of four different characters. Each has a completely different ability set than the other and a somewhat different adventure in terms of who you meet and when. I've played as all four and with the exception of one they are all a blast to play. I highly recommend trying out all of them whether it be in another play through (you are required to complete certain tasks, like getting to level 20, as each character) or in multiplayer. The game was made by Obsidian as well so the writing for all the characters is very solid and voice acting is pretty good.When it comes to combat this game doesn't disappoint. It DOES, however, almost completely require a controller. You would think playing with a KB&M would fit a Dungeon Siege game but unfortunately, it doesn't. If you have a controller though, you're in for some great hack and slash combat with a fair amount of strategy (especially on the hardest difficulty). Visually and audibly this game is pretty darn good. The music, while nothing special, fits the game enough. You won't be humming any of the tunes, but you won't be cursing the game for repetition. On the visual side, this game looks great for an isometric title. Even during cut scenes (where you see your model up close) there is a great amount of detail present and numerous visual effects that add to the level of immersion. The voice acting does Obsidian's script justice as well.Last but not least, I have to mention  multiplayer. I played through the entire game about two times in multiplayer sessions and it is a BLAST if you have people who know how to use each character. It's almost necessary for the highest difficulty in the game to played with other people if you want to stand a chance. While the game can be enjoyed fine solo, it's at it's best in multiplayer sessions. Each player takes a different role and strategy really starts to come into play.Overall I highly recommend Dungeon Siege III assuming you have a controller. If you have a KB&M I honestly can't recommend it as it is a pain to play that way. If, however, you have a controller and some friends to join you you are in for a treat.8/10			"

												I originally played through this game on console in local co-op, and now I wanted to try out the DLC. Turns out you need to play through quite a lot of the main campaign to even get to the DLC which kind of sucks, but I found the game good enough to replay. It's even better in single-player actually because of the annoying camera issues in co-op, and there's also quite a bit of dialogue which slows down the pace.DS3 is nothing like its predecessors; the loot is kind of non-relevant, RPG elements are dumbed down, the world is much more linear, and the main theme isn't even in the game. But it's still a solid ARPG with a good combat system, good music and beautiful environments. The story and the lore is super well written and there's a lot of it, all with good voice acting too. Too bad there's no sequel in sight.			"

TL;DR: Hilariously wooden voice acting with gravelly-voice-man doing the cut-scenes and fire-baby make for great laughs with friends. Just kind of annoying and awful without.This game is hilariously bad, it's like one of those movies you watch with friends and laugh, a lot, about.Like, I don't care about any of the characters, the voice acting is half-wooden, switches between accents, and from time to time just sounds like someone ran Siri throuhg a Synthesizer. But it's pretty frustratingly hilarious when you play it with a friend. I just don't recommend playing it alone, because as a single player game I would have just stopped playing after roughly 10 minutes.I also got it very cheap, so that factors into my 'this game was worth 5 dollars as a package deal with two other games that don't run on my computer because they're so old.'I haven't gotten to play dungeon siege I & II, but dungeon siege III is a barrel of (albeit unintentional) laughs. 6/10, with friends.Not recommended without friends.

												Another prime example of the dangers of consolification: take a gear grinder with a hundred available skills to give near-infinite character customization, and shoehorn it into a system where the player is only expected to bind five or six buttons and then mash them like a retard.This game killed the license.

												After all the negative reviews, I started playing the game expecting nothing but with an open mind. If this was a stand-alone game it would probably okay. But they made it under the Dungeon Siege Franchise and they really messed it up. The first two games were all about starting out with nothing but customizing your characters looks and capabilities as time went on. You were the character, it was an avatar of you... With this newest installment to the franchise it is story-driven like The Witcher series. If you like The Witcher you might like this. But if you wanted something more like the two previous games you're gonna have a bad time. The two previous were more like a mix between Diablo and Neverwinter nights, while this seems like a bad Witcher Copy-cat.But if you haven't played the two previous games, this game is not bad at all. It's only bad if you have played the previous ones.			"

												A fair adventure game with great graphics and environments, good voice acting and decent story largely ruined by a horrible camera angle which will have many ranged enemies shooting you from off screen and many ranged attacks by your characters hitting enemies you can't even see.An additional frustration is enemies respawning in areas you've already cleared.   This happens despite times in the story where you are blocking off entrances to areas to prevent that exact thing!  Combat is also a little too simplified to really be enjoyable.A beautiful game that just misses too many marks and has an enjoyment killing flaw. "

												I was somewhat surprised at this game, considering having played the first two in the series and finding them somewhat cool, but boring. This one is not very similar to the first two, but in a good way. It is a bit more linear than the first game (if I remember correctly), but it works out anyway. I guess that the sort of linear gameplay is perhaps my only critique of the game, but as I said, it works out anyway. I would have prefered the option to go on more side-quests for fun and loot and experience points, but the game is not set up in a way that you will be massively outgunned and needing further level-ups. If you do end up doing all the side-quests, then you will probably have enough good stats to get through the game with moderate difficulty. There were two times in the game that I had to drop the difficulty to casual in the options menu, but things in the game are pretty well balanced.This one is my favorite game in the series. I recommend getting the game, especially if you can get it on sale. There is one DLC that I can find, but I haven't tried it. Supposedly it is more ""completist"" if you get that DLC before getting into the main game because it changes a few things.All in all, this game does not offer much in the way of innovative development, but the game is fun enough to be something good and well-made anyway.

												Dungeon Siege III is not without flaws, but it is a very underrated game that deserves more respect than it receives. If you are a fan of the first Dungeon Siege games then you may be understandably disappointed to find that this game deviates from the typical diablo-clone formula and instead takes on a more traditional action RPG style. If you treat this game as a traditional action RPG then your expectations will be more in line with what you will get and you'll probably have a more favorable opinion of it. If, on the other hand, you are expecting another diablo-clone then I'd advise steering clear of this, but do keep in mind that this game respects the lore of the original Dungeon Siege games, even if it doesn't respect their style. If you are a diehard Dungeon Siege fan and love the lore and story then maybe you should give this game a chance even if you don't care for the gameplay. If so, I'd advise playing it on the lowest difficulty, as it can be quite challenging if you're not prepared to give it your best.I also strongly recommend playing with a controller, no matter which difficulty level you choose. It does take some time to get the hang of things, but there is a built-in help system that most people seem to just ignore, that explains everything in great detail. You'll see all sorts of weird stats like Retribution, Doom, Momentum, Staggering, etc. which you'd do well to learn. These stats also give you lots of different ways of customizing your character towards certain strengths. There's also an enchanting mechanic where you use ""essences"" you collect from defeated enemies and you can put these on your items to boost them in certain ways. You can also do the same with the gear of your companions, which you do not control directly, but in my opinion this was a welcome improvement over the earlier Dungeon Siege games as this means there is less micro-managing and you can just focus on controlling your own character. I also thought it was an improvement that enemy swarms are a lot smaller, and more of a focus on boss fights which can be very epic and fun. There is a co-op mode which many people say doesn't work very well and I haven't tried it myself, but the option is there in any case.The worst thing I could really say is the controls can be a bit uncooperative. For example, you might need to execute a certain move in a hurry, but if your character is moving the game won't recognize it and you have to make sure your character comes to a complete stop and then try it again before it works. I've died countless times because of that and that's the worst thing about this game in my opinion. A game being challenging is perfectly fine, but the challenge should never be as a result of clunky controls.I found the story very well written, and you are presented with multiple branching paths in the dialogue and how you interact with other characters. For example, you can choose to spare a defeated foe's life, or execute them. The choices you make will have consequences later on, for better or worse. Your companions also have an opinion of you based on what you say and your actions, which makes them feel like real characters and not just soulless automatons. This may be a very minor point to most people, and a lot of people probably didn't even see this at all since they got frustrated at how the game wasn't like the first Dungeon Siege games and quit, but to me it is very important, and I took note of it.Anyway, to summarize, no, this game is not perfect by any means, but in my opinion the positives outweigh the negatives. I got nearly 40 hours of gameplay out of a single playthrough (including the DLC), and more importantly it was time I enjoyed. There are lots of games that have maybe only 1/10th the content that this game does, but have far better reviews. I ask you, where is the justice in that?			"

												Short Version:Coming into this game expecting more of DS1/2? You'll be disappointed. Forget the Dungeon Siege name and you'll find a pretty solid game with nice couch co-op.Long Version:Gameplay: Clearly more geared for console (gamepad) play, enjoyable nonetheless: fights ask more out of your positioning and timing with attack/skills/dodge/block. There's a lot of enemies/loot/merchants, some quests and the 4 main jobs you'd expect on a DS game, even if under a new paint. Of course I miss using multiple party members but the AI is not that bad, my biggest problem is with the online co-op: the camera is BAD and the game doesn't allow all players to have a character, you have the host's game and everyone else is a guest using the stats/equips of the characters in it.Story: The plot isn't winning any awards, and there are less characters and worldbuilding than in the previous DS's. The narrator isn't bad but most of the story feels like it's trying to be more epic than it is. I also felt that, for a game with choices, they should matter more than... next to nothing, lots of places could have been better/more explored. The main characters are decent and their interactions are a nice add to the experience.Sound: A mild soundtrack with no memorable themes. Nevertheless, they fit the locations and acompany the battles, nothing felt out of place. I enjoyed the VA for all characters with a huge bias towards Katarina's, I'm a sucker for that accent @_@.Graphics: A great improvement from the famous derpy looking DS's graphics (which I had no problem with), love the changing armours, the spells effects, the scenarios, they all hold up to this day imo.Disclaimer: I'm a huge fan of the DS franchise and, like a lot of people, had trouble adapting to this new style, I feel like it would have done better under a different name.

												Action RPG. I don't usually buy or play these type RPG's, but I read a review that said the single player campaign was very well written, and well worth the time. It is worth the time, and well written (imo). I enjoyed it. And yes, I played the other two DS and liked them as well. I would rate this 4.5 out of 5. If you usually don't play action RPG's, you should try this one, it may change your mind, as long as you understand it is not like the other titles. Not sure why the bad reviews just because it is different than the other two, though it did take me six years to purchase this because it was action and not turn based.			"

												This game takes on a slightly different format than the first two in the series. I would almost call it a Diablo III clone (with lower production values), which is disappointing. If it had stayed true to the style of the series I probably would have enjoyed it a lot more. The first two games required strategy in combat and micro-managing a party of 4. DS3 combat is simplified and you only control the one character, so it gets boring pretty fast.			"

												This game is a huge let down, as I was very excited to start playing it after completing the previous two dungeon siege games.Instead of it being a true open world game where you are free to  explore vast areas, you have to go down narrow passageways to get to anywhere on the map.The storyline is boring and the cutscenes are dreadful.If you play as Lucus you will probably give up as he is impossible to play as; you have to go right next to the person you are attacking.However, for me there are two major things that disappointed me about this game; the lack of customisation of your character and the horrifically annoying camera angle.So no, I do not recommend this game, it is one of the worst games I have ever played.

												I've liked the Dungeon Siege games for some time. But I'd never seen or heard of DS III before I got the collection.I really got into the game, it was very interesting and I was drawn into it through the character. I played the Archon.This was a very good story, learning the background and being key to the story.The combat was a bit tricky, as I had to get used to the controls. But it wasn't difficult to pick up after a while. The storyline was able to keep my attention and the side quests kept me moving forward.You have to choose from four characters, this usually is an issue for me. I like to customize my characters in games. But for this, I didn't have a problem. I liked the idea of the Archon and it seemed to turn out as the best choice for my playing style. (I like fire wielding... well, any elemental magic really.)So if it looks interesting, give it a try. I'm really satisfied with the ending and really wished that there was more DLC thanthe one small expention that I did get with the collection. "

												With Diablo 3 around the corner, figured I should play this game otherwise I never would.  Not a bad game in general, but it suffers greatly due to the fact that this game was made with consoles in mind.  Sure you can at least customize graphics (to a basic extent) but for some reason you cannot customize controls and the default keyboard mouse controls are just terrible.  Instead of having abilities 1-6 binded its 1-3 and you have to continually hit shift to switch to other abilities which basicly means you aren't going to be dodging or blocking (space) when you need to.  Plugged in a controller and suddenly everything made sense and I stopped dying every 2 seconds because i could actually play.  The decision making, combat and story are actually decent, all else aside.  Buy it for cheap, or just wait for Diablo 3 or Torchlight 2 if you like dungeon crawlers, and you might as well buy on console if you have one since the pc version is probably worse than it without a controller.

												Taking a break to write this before the game drains me of any sanity I have left. ..and with the overall reviews being 'mixed' I think a positive review is more than welcome. I'm about halfway through the original campaign and halfway through the DLC but I have a good impression of the game, playing it solo on Hardcore all the way through.The negativity for this game comes from people expecting a game much like it's predecessor(s), which yes; it is not. I have only played DS2 and though I would have liked a direct sequel that plays similar to the previous, I'm not disappointed with the result. I can write an essay on game franchises with sequels that changed things up and why it's not surprising they usually aren't well-received, but it's common sense really.. or should be. Anyway, the gist of 'these' games is to treat them on a separate level in the spirit of fairness.I'll go ahead and say that there's isn't really anything that stands out from the crowd. Graphics, Story etc. are all around the same level and more than decent but nothing out of the ordinary. Game options are sort of there but other than that, the game is pretty consolized. Moving around, basic combat and UI controls are designed with a controller in mind. Though you can use your mouse to navigate the menu, it feels off as for instance you can't click an item to view it's stats without directly equipping it, effectively disabling you from comparing it with others. In general, keyboard and mouse just doesn't feel nearly as good as playing with a controller.That said; if you can get over the controls, there's really a good amount of fun and enjoyment to be had with this game. Quests are easy, tracked individually and the game shows you exactly where to go should you only ask. Even the puzzles you come across don't require much (if any) thought to solve. ..in other words, the main focus is pretty much the combat and character progression. It's not a hack and slash as it has a different pacing which often requires more tact / blocking or dodging.Not sure how it plays on Normal or less but I imagine the game becomes a walk in the park of casual fun. If however you don't want to be a scrub and join the hardcore folks, be forewarned because it is brutal, relentless and can be unforgiving at times. Aside from everything able to kill you in just a few hits, there are certain boss battles and segments in the game that can feel overwhelming to say the least. You may find yourself cursing at the screen and/or putting the blame on your friends/AI companion. Really, it sometimes feels like I'm playing Dark Souls as I found myself soldier through the same trash mobs over and over again just to die a horrible death in a seemingly unfair boss fight where one small mistake proved to be fatal. But as with Dark Souls, when you finally do get through; it feels very satisfying.. until, a moment later you come face to face with something just as bad if not worse. Nevertheless, I'm liking it very much.I think it's worth the current retail price. But as with most other games, if you're doubtful; just get it on a sale. There are games that truly deserve every bit of negativity, but DS3 is not one of them.			"

												So far the story is uninteresting and the characters are boring. Its somewhat sexist towards women and the mechanics are shallow. I found it annoying that when I'm talking to others, I can only see the back of my head. Would of been nice if the camera shifted to show who I was talking to and then myself back and forth.On the plus side, everything looks really nice. Cool environments and the music is good. Biggest plus is that they have a really good engine to work off of if Obsidian wanted to make a more robust and deep Dungeon Siege game. Hopefully spend some more money on writers that don't constantly say the whole name of the bad guy like a 1990's movie high school bully and good character artists, not the ones that draw giant breasts on everything.I got this for a few bucks on Humble Bundle.

												I actually enjoy the game play, the quest based story line and the look of the game.  Where it falls completely short is: 1. No map (other than a mini map)  2. No potions, but rather a very lame healing mode which when getting hit in combat almost always fails to heal you enough or fast enough.  The boss can ALWAYS damage you faster than you can heal.  3. boss battles that are insanely hard even on the casual mode.  NO GAME IN CASUAL MODE SHOULD REQUIRE RESTARTING A BATTLE 5 TO 20 TIMES!!!!!   4. The main tank character is almost completly useless in boss fights and even with everything I could find has almost no resistance to any kind of magical attack which all the bosses (so far) rely heavily on.  I like a good story based adventure game that is challenging but fair.  This isn't that game.			"

Needless to say i am super disappointed. The camera angles blow, the controls are whacky as hell, and i absolutely hate the way they did the inventory and equipment menus.

I would play for Jeyne and slay remaining filth of the legion and the hiding royals (and wipe out the remaining Montbarron line), BUT YOU CAN NOT! So basically you are asked to be bad guy in this game and hunt down rebel Robin Hood. Makes no sense.... but then again there are games where you are terrorist and r@pist and general bad guy (GTA series)... - this game is sadly one of those.Now about the gameplay annoyances:1. The game is either locked into fullscreen or when you disable it, the mouse is trapped into the game window - what the f***? THERE IS NO OPTION TO MAKE THE GAME RUN IN BORDERLESS WINDOW MODE! :-(2. If you have controlled attached to your computer, but are not using it - so better unplug it and restart the game or you're f***ed. As the keybindings are just simply ignored when you had active controller plugged in when you started the game. NO WAY TO DISABLE CONTROLLER IN-GAME! :-(3. the few story clips here are there seem to be in 640x480 resolution, streched over your screen... so you can see the huge jaggy squares. BAD QUALITY STORYLINE VIDEOS!4. Anjali character in her fire elemental form takes damage while being in fire.... WHAT THE F***? (NO LOGIC; NO COMMON SENSE!)5. Anjali in her elemental form has no nipples and no pubic hair flaming around like her head-hair does. Game is PEGI-16, so there should be no problem with those even for PEGI reasons. ANATOMICALLY INCORRECT!6. Tutorials about using different fighting abilities jump up during the fight without pausing the fight, so you have to fast close them to survive and fight off the attacking monsters without being even able to read what was written there.

												Clumsy UI, this game was probably originally designed for consoles. It's certainly not intuitive for keyboard mouse use. This for me, is an instant turn-off and makes up the lion's share of why I think this is a waste of money for PC gamers.There's little to no customisation available for the UI and scant tooltips/help etc. So if you play it fora while then get side-tracked because you start playing a new release you have been waiting for, and then come back to it, you will invariably have to start the thing from scratch to go through the tutorial/opening scenes to get used to the UI again.It's pretty, graphically, but a bit dated and certainly won't tax your machine.Lesson learned? Don't buy a game simply because of the intro vid on Steam and the reviews.			"

												If you haven't played any of the previous games and you enjoy Gauntlet style combat then you MIGHT enjoy this game. However, having played the first two games in the series I am greatly disappointed. Square Enix not only destroyed the mechanics that defined the Dungeon Siege series but they also did a great deal of damage to the setting as well. Everything is completely different. As such I was greatly disappointed. there is little to no back tracking available in the game, if you miss completing a quest you cannot go back and do it without starting a new game.Also the game didnt take much skill at all to beat.

The targeting system is absolutely horrendous and adds to the already difficult boss fights. I almost never NOT finish a game I start but the stink of console-itis was just too much to bear.

												Its the least dungeon siege of the series, but its still fun to play. I am almost done with the main storyline.pros- Fun boss battles- enjoyable combat- awesome graphics- great action combat- perfect with 360 controllercons- Its sublinear design is annoying. Its like its linear, but has options, and the quest flow will end up forcing you through long boring journeys to finish up meaninless quests.- the viewpoint can be frustrating. Sometimes in caverns the view will get obstructed, which gets frustrating.- The storyline feels pretty meaningless, as if they tried hard to write it but it just fell flat on its face. I think my eyes rolled pretty hard when they told me that the dvarves made magic fans in the caves. Yeah magic fans.-no fast travel. This sucked pretty bad when you complete quests and have to go back to a place to finish a small quest. - the difficulty was rather nonsensical at times. I am playing on hardcore, but only some of the bosses are difficult, some are kind of difficult, but alot of them I can literally just run around while my companion does all the work. pretty lame.Conclusion: Its a great game to get on sale, and its pretty fun to play with a controller. Other wise, just play the other two dungeon sieges.			"

												Top-down action adventure. It's okay, not great.The good stuff: No glitches, decent storyline, interesting abilities, good combo-ingThe bad stuff: Not many abilities (only 9 per character), boring enemy abilities (melee or range. No specials).The worst things: 1. DPS doesn't mean anything in this game. Every description is too vague. ""Lightning has a moderate chance to do low damage over 2 seconds"": This is meaningless without number. Most abilities work this way.2. You can't play a mage. There's no way to just use 'will' to attack, and will powers spells. If you use just abilities, you run out of mana. Then you die because you didn't build attack power, just will. Be a mage and do something every 5 seconds or so maybe.It's fun for a single 8 hour playthrough, but I can pretty much guarantee it's not worth a second playthrough.			"

												Ok I have a few big issues with this game first being this feels like a console game that was poorly ported to PC. First off the controls are pretty bad unless you do some modifying in the option menu, game barely explains what any of the stats in the menu do or how they act on your character. You also cant reset any of your abilites if you wanted to try out a different build for a charcter and to top it off you have no control of your AI partner in combat, so you invest into their second tree its just wasted effort because they only use that tree in rare occasions. The game honestly feels like a half-♥♥♥♥♥ diablo 3 that the developers didn't want to put much effort into otherwise it would've been a good game.			"

I was surprised that I was drawn in as much as I was, however, and certainly not for the reason I expected. The combat is honestly pretty boring and tedious especially later on. The boss battles in particular can be a slog (the final boss of the DLC in particular is just awful). The loot is boring, there is no exploration to speak of and the skills (at least for the class I played) were nothing special. So why would I still recommend this game? I was actually drawn in by the story. This is something that VERY rarely happens to me with video games but there is something about the setting and the interactive dialogue choices that really clicked with me here. Would I recommend this to just anyone? No, probably not, but for anyone who wants a pretty mindless action rpg with a story that blows most diablo-likes out of the water (and coop), I would say go for it. I actually plan on playing it again in a year or two, probably.			"

DS3 is by far the worst of its series and not suprising to say the least considering square enix co-published this game. Watching child baring hips swing from side to side does not make up for trashy gameplay as for the story it was alright, it wasn't bad but it wasn't good either. If you are a true Dungeon Siege die hard the first two of the series would be your best investment in time and money, not worth the $19.99 for all three which includes the DLC.

Do yourself a favor, if you're going to get this, get it on sale. DS 2 was vastly superior, as the other reviews have noted this game is designed from the ground up as a console game. blech. also the story has practically nothing to do with the previous game. The controls are wonky and have to be customized, though that doesn't solve the frustrating soft-target system. And the walkmesh sucks meaning your char gets trapped in corners if you're not playing with heightened perception. The storyline is interesting butslow moving.

												A fun little couch console aRPG, you play as one of four preset characters (a tanky knight, an elfish kind of thing, a ranged gunner, and a mage) set on restoring the glory of the 10th legion of Ehb. The game can be quite unbalanced for the melee knight due to some difficult ranged enemies and bosses, and the game's difficulty fluctuates a little. But it's overall a fun ""corridor shooter"" RPG kind of game. I've been playing it with the Xbox 360 controller, with Lucas (the tank) and the combat is very satisfying and challenging!Don't approach this from the ""epic RPG"" point of view, rather: a more dynamic Diablo or Torchlight where you dodge and block, and that is played with a controller. Only then will you have all the fun!There are also some choices that you can make throughout the game that affect the epilogue after the one ending. I'd recommend you buy it for $5 or $7.5 or something, great fun for that price!			"

												While i enjoyed the mystery of the first game and i found the epic scale of the second game to be enjoyable i found the quick pace of the 3rd game to be a bit rushed. The character choices are pretty boring wit the exception of the female that becomes an avatar or something and the level design isnt very inspiring either. The bosses range from SUPER easy to insanely difficult and not in the fun kinda way. I feel like this game was rushed and they needed to take some time and up the scale of things a bit.			"

												It's kinda bad, especially compared to the last two. Looting is terrible, multiplayer isn't worth the time considering only the host makes any progress (srsly? wtf?) The last two games had persistant multiplayer. I also don't like that they split all the gear into seperate characters. It just seemed really unneccessary, and limiting the fun of half the game. (Shiney loot.) Controls are pretty bad too, but you get used to them. Character acting is bland and the story is uninteresting, and re-tracking through the same area several times is just boring. I found myself more grinding my teeth than having fun. I've tried to give it a chance a few times, now I'm just sorry I bought it. Maybe if you're really desperate for an new RPG, pick this up. Otherwise, go play something else.			"

												This game is nothing like its predecessors, but it's amazing in its own right. There are so many different choices to make, so many different outcomes, a free-form hack-and-slash type of combat system, and so much lore that it can make your head spin. If you are a fan of deeply engaging stories, then this is definitely a game to try. You can play through as one of four main characters, getting the rest as partners along the way, each with their own attitudes, fighting styles, and things they agree with. You can switch between your partners at will, and they add to the story as you play through, with different pieces of insight or comments they make. The gear is completely random, but not overly terrible. There is also a nice multi-player feature where you can host your own private game or join in a public one, although you only have access to the gear the owner has acquired (as it is their game you're playing). All in all, a fantastic game with a lot of lore and plenty of replay value.			"

												Having played the FIRST TWO Ds, several times. it was with some trepidation that I bought this game on Steam. It was interesting, but way difficult at first. Basically, just hack and slash, run to the Light column to get ""revigorated"" and go back for more. Leveling was tedious, and the WIMP knight could not fight his way our of a paper bag. The girls, on balance had much easier time with mobs, albeit took a few weeks of same-ole hack and slash of the same old mobs to get levels and skills to an acceptablwe levels. LOOT sucks.  It is not always visable, get bounched to inaccessible areas, but usually not worth spending time to recover. Now, zones are locked until you complete certain quests or objectives,  STATS appear to be ambiguous, and gear is hard come-bye. you can not auto-pickup lot, but must click on it. Not sure if weight is a factor, but usually is in these games. Healing is readily available at the LIGHT collumns., but configuring the toons was SOOO  mysterious, with no readily available help, at least while I played. Someone said/posted there is a help file to guide in the config quagmire, but I never found it. So, after weeks, literally hundreds of hours, I got thru all four characters to the Boss. Each time you enter a NEW zone, it will auto-save, and you are locked in. You can NOT go back, you can not get out. SO it you are not upto the level of the mobs, you will lose. And while you can restart from previous zone save, it gets to be a real PIA after 10-15 re-tries. The biggest ♥♥♥♥♥, for me, is the FINAL savegame, after completion, got LOST or deleted, BUT NOT BY ME. So, this prevents me from accessing the DLC, paid for TY VM.,and it appears Steam disavows and responsibility. Trying again for the 15th time to REDO the Boss fight, it appears they gave the Old Boy some steroids, cause he wipes out BOTH of my best toons, repeatedly. Overall, the game is similar to the first two, but since you do not have any physical disks, must abide by Steam rules, and at the mercy of some server-in-the-Sky to maintain your files and saved games, it is barfely worth the 50% discount cost. This must be a Steam policy, as EQ, again paid for, got wiped and can't be played without some additional fees being paid, so I was told when I attempted to log in....The Community groups are great help, mostly. I recommend the game, if, ONLY IF, there is a 50% price reduo, and GET SOME HELP files. Having played these games for 25 years, or more, back to PM and Donkey Kong on Atari, OK, 35 years, I thought I had a decent idea of how it should go, but NOOO. It appears that some of the ""special"" skills or attributes are worthless, and don't work most of the time. Made HOT KEYA for all of those, but they are intermittent, That is, you takes your chances. In Boss fights, you do NOT have any time to recon, reconfig, or GUESS. They will cream you. It would be nice to have some healing Pots or some decent gear, but you can only get what you can scavenge. Cheats might help, but are against Steam policy. IF you are tenatious, persevere, keenly observant, and have the patience of JOB, (read that book sometime) like Gilgamesh, yo might just win.

												Horribly underrated game. The controls are a bit strange, but once you get past the initial learning curve, it's incredibly fun. Beautiful graphics even on a lower end system, visceral combat, interesting characters/classes. The story's also a lot better than you'd expect, though it may not seem that way at first. Gameplay's a bit of a departure from the previous installments in the series (to say the least), but most changes are for the better, and the story connects back to the first game's much better than DS2's did.My only major complaints are that the audio can be buggy at times, and some of the voice acting is what I will politely call less than stellar. But even with those issues, it's one of the best RPGs I've played in a long time.			"

												this is my first DS game , i haven't played any of the previous titles in this series so i can't compare but what i can do is let you know that this is a very good game except for a few flaws 1. the loot is very repetitive , you get to a part where you stop hoarding items and ignore them if the name seems familiar which is honestly disappointing since in this type of games players are curious to the looks and advantages of loot and boss drops.2. sometimes the creeps become annoyingly op and you have to rely on your companion to revive you numerous times in one encounter.3. the story is somewhat simple although the game has great potential to become a diablo 3 competitor if develloped with more care and complexityi havent tested out the online tbh and it might show that i have very few game time on this game since i mostly played it in offline mode so it doesnt really add to the time played , if you're interested in buying this game go for it , it's a nice game and it will amuse you (since that is the point of video games instead of making them become a culture or point of obsession like WoW , CoD and other games) and if you do buy it add me for online gameplay :D			"

												Having played and loved the first two Dungeon Siege games this one came as quite a shock. It's a very different style of game and that's not in itself a bad thing, but the way it has been implemented here is.As far as the good things go, the combat is excellent and a much better system (imo) than the previous games. Characters actually have some story to them, although the banter is not as good as DS2. The art, sound and graphics are also very good. And, oddly, your choices do actually have some relevance.Unfortunately the rest is not so good. Major things like the camera, the (lack of)path/journey, the skillsets, the inventory, the loot, the overall story (the sub stories and characters are fine) and the lack of playable characters really detracts from the game. Especially the loot. Finding uniques doesn't actually matter, the stats are cryptic and you will most often replace items every 5 minutes. Characters are also horribly imbalanced. Anjali and Lucas are what you would expect, but Reinhart is a tactical nuke the further you progress and Katarina is weaker than wet paper. Why? Because of stats. Agility (Dex) which is crucial to Katarina gets worse as you level wheras Will (Int) remains the same which is crucial for Reinhart's skill spamming. Katarina is also not a good AoE character but Reinhart is all about AoE.I could ramble on for ages but what it comes down to is this. There are plenty of other games you could buy and play and be much happier with. If you really want to get this, do it when it is on sale as this is a once through kinda game with 0 replayability other than trying out each character or playing in coop.			"

												Dungeon Siege III is a solid, if not spectacular, linear action RPG.  The game does not really have anyhing to do with Dungeon Siege or Dungeon Siege II.  Its like someone took a totally different game and just wrote Dungeon Siege on it because they wanted a name that people had heard of before.  Here you only control one character and you only have one companion fighting with you at a time, not a party based affair like the previous DS games and you have little to no control over your companion.  Its more of a single character action adventure with a pet.  There is a variety of different equippable loot and different passive abilities to put points into so you have some minor character customization available, but not as much as you might like.  If you play it with no preconceptions it is fine as it is, but if you are expecting another Dungeon Siege you will be disappointed.The storyline and combat action were adequate and I didn't notice a single bug in the whole time I played the game, which is very commendable these days.  The graphics seemed pretty nice, but the camera is a bit of an annoyance because it doesn't allow you to zoom far enough out so you often lose view of your enemies off screen while fighting.  I recommend a gamepad since the right stick can control the camera while you fight.  I can't imagine how you would do that if you play with a mouse and keyboard.  Anyhow, the game was designed for consoles so that should be the preferred method of control.  I don't think I could recommend this game if you don't have a gamepad.The playtime of the game was adequate.  I'm guessing it takes around 20-30 hours total if you do all the side quests.  There's not a massive number of side quests so you won't get bogged down with them like in some other games, but they do add a few hours to the game.I bought the game for five dollars and I think it was a decent enough game for that price.  The game is not the best in its genre at anything it does, but if you get it in a bundle or find it on sale you can get a few days of reasonable entertainment out of it.  You aren't missing anything important if you don't ever play this, but this game is not horrible. "

However, as a newcomer to the series, I can heartily recommend this game to anyone who likes a nice action-RPG. I thoroughly enjoyed the story and some of the boss battles were quite cool.

												I was hoping for a sequal to dungeon siege 1 or 2. But as it turns out this game has nearly nothing to do with the previous games. It's more like a cheap version of darksiders. The graphics are nice, it has some good combat action, though I liked the versatility of DS1 more. It's a pity that in DS3 most enemies look like clones, all the same faces. And there is no diablo like loot system or a goal where you try to get good gear to showing, use or trade with friends, in fact the coop option is truely limited, but those who log in are forced to stay in the same screen as the host, so no wandering off and they cannot bring their own characters, gear and so on. The only thing they can do is use a free character slot on the host. So they don't gain anything for the time they spend on it. At least not for their own campaign. It's a pity really that they called it DS3, I can only hope there will be a real sequel for DS1 someday in the future.			"

												Cause who doesn't like a good dungeon crawler? This game has loot, skills, specializations, different classes and more. Without having played the previous Dungeon Siege titles, this one just felt like an old classic along the lines of Champions of Norrath. This is a great game for the price. Don't expect Diablo 3 level graphics or skill animations, but it keeps things simple while also offering decent variety.Recently tried the multiplayer. You can join your friends very easily, or play with strangers if you want to. It's annoying that you can't save your character if you join a friend, but the game saves that character for you so you keep the abilities and gear that you collect. Still, very fun to play with a friend and a great game in my opinion.			"

												Dungeon Siege III is definitely a Dungeon Siege game. Like its predecessors, it blends action-RPG gameplay with the character development of a more traditional RPG. However, the gameplay in Dungeon Siege III is bland, and the combat is dull and repetitive. Maybe it gets better, but I lost interest pretty quickly. It's a sort of console-friendly Dungeon Siege.The storyline seems to expect you to be playing Co-op with friends, and maybe that would add variety to the fights. But solo, it's really difficult to stay interested, when most of what you're doing is mowing down wave after wave of enemies in the same way, over and over, and you make your way from point A to point B. This is an uninspired game, not worthy of your time.			"

												Dungeon Siege. A game about smashing, looting, and wrecking the place, with no care or consequence for the world. When I saw this game release, my co-op buddy and I grabbed a copy and immediately jumped into the game to play. The Co-op was decent enough, though you can troll the other guy in a few irritating ways. Most horribly, however, is the fact that co-opter, the person joining the host, does not retain -anything- their character aquires when they leave the match. Instead, the hosts alternate character maintains the items. Thus, it's not so much co-op, as it is ""You're my B****"".In the end, we never could make ourselves continue to play it, after discovering that, and thus, never beat it.			"

												I gather that the Dungeon Siege fanbase for the first two games looks down on Dungeon Siege 3 as a departure from the very enjoyable gameplay motif. But I never played those two games. I started with Dungeon Siege 3, and it's not really half bad. The combat can get stale and the looting isn't as enjoyable as say Diablo or Titan Quest, and if you buy the game with the Treasures of the Sun DLC you'll get powerful items that will easily carry you through the rest of the game. The redeeming value in this adventure is the story and its lore, but if you're not the kind of gamer that enjoys that sort of thing, then you can skip this one.For me, I enjoyed trekking mindlessly from quest to quest (with zero exploration since you can summon a path with the press of a button) piecing together the game world and its history.I'd recommend it for someone seeking an easy RPG to play that's something other than Diablo.

												I loved DS 1 & 2, but 3 is what my friends call ""on rails"". There is very little creativity, choosing items is over-complicated, and it's repetitive as hell. It's the worst role playing game I have played in years. I'd rather go back to playing Final Fantasy 7 or Tactics, or DS2.			"

												As a big fan of the previous two games, I was pretty excited to see a sequel.  I received this game as a gift, which is probably a good thing, because I'd have been pretty annoyed had I spent money on this.  Why?  Because the only thing this game shares with the previous two games is the name.   The actual boxed game came with a double-sided piece of paper as a quick start guide.  Unfortunately, it doesn't really give any indication on when or how to use things.  The minimalist UI doesn't display the bulk of your abilities, and one of the more important features, saving your game, isn't really explained that well - make sure to ""use"" the save portals.  Likewise, there's next to nothing in the game ""manual"" (maybe there's one on the install disc?) about which stats are better for each character. I picked what was labeled the ""wizard"" to try out.  The wizard runs around and punches things.  To be fair, he can throw a lightning bolt, but literally, he runs around and punches things.  Do yourself a favor, and buy DS II instead of this, because this is just flat out awful.  Were the game released as a standalone title, and not as a third installment, it would pretty much still be awful.  The story seems vaguely interesting, but the game is pretty lackluster with an unhelpful UI.			"

												Note: My time with this game was on a console rather than PC.This game is an odd one. If you were a fan of the first two games, this one completely destroys their story line. There is not much of a story line here at all. In fact the story line is so bad and boring that I usually just put on music and button mash this game away. Its fun but relatively short. This is one of those games that you can see a massive problem with it, yet you had fun progessing through the game.If I was more of a Dungeon Seige fan I would have hated this game. It is not true to the series, but I still liked it enough to give it a thumbs up.Summary:-Very Short-No story-Very basic gameplay-Fun to play with a friend and music going			"

												The original DS was fun because it automated quite a bit of the mechanics of the dungeon crawl, like looting, fighting, and the world of Ehb was kinda fun to explore, and find all the ""side paths"" containing treasures. However, the sequels failed to recapture the charm, and sadly DS3 is just more of the same, by adding complexity instead of fun, and even ""casual"" mode ended up being way too difficult for someone who finished DS1 w/o any cheating. Most RPGs utilize a skill tree, and as you level up you allocate skill points toward different skills and you can see the . DS3 however, went for a different sort... There's ""ability"", ""skill""  (which can become ""empowered"" if you use it enough), and talent, which interacts in a complicated way that you're never quite sure which way to level up, as there are so many different choices, but not in a proper tree form so you can understand it. As you unlock more abilities, skills, and talents, you are given vague hints on what they do, but not the specific effects on your character's stats, like to-hit, or damage. Furthermore, the skills vs. empowered skill deployment is messy to use, as the game moves like an action RPG, but using the skills and the way they recharge is far closer to a phased combat RPG. Deploying the empowered skills is more on chance than actual proper timing. The game soon gave you a companion and now you have TWICE as much skills, abilities, and talents to play with. Which brings to point yet ANOTHER problem... INCONVENIENT interface. Instead of something like shoulder button to swap characters or hot keys, only one character was displayed at a time, and you're prompted to press ENTER to swap characters. Who the heck designed this UI?  DS1 had a much better interface, sheesh.  This interface feels like it's trying to cater to low-res screens but failed horribly in being efficient. Combat is generally not a problem, but instead of just fighting (attack, attack, attack), you now have ability to dodge, block, and even one-handed vs. two-handed stance (and instant switching)  Slash/shoot then roll away is almost required unless you have good sweep moves. Fighters can use two-handed stance to sweep an arc, and shooters have shotguns (which we'll explain later).  Magic users can use circle or fire and such, but again, this is just adding complexity, not fun. Original DS has two ""loadouts"" per character, like ranged vs. melee, or close vs. far. DS3 again, decided to use a list interface rather than the standard RPG ""doll cloths"" interface where you fit items onto the character. This screen was separate from the stats screen so you can't see how much improvement the weapon does. The only ""comparison"" you see was how this item compares with the item the character was currently equipped with. At about the 1/3 point, when you're about to take back the town, you and your companion took out most of the mercs and was attacking the town hall, and you end up fighting this girl who's related to the archon. The problem is you need to defeat her TWICE, and even on Casual difficult I get killed multiple times. The boss sets out magical landmines that takes away 1/5 of your health per hit, and your heal skill only restores like 7-8 points (out of 350!) per second. You die in about 2 hits, and since the traps are all over the place, even your archon companion gets hit and falls. As you need to stop to revive her, you die as well. This is just ridiculous, as there's just too many things to do... dodge, run, back in and attack, get out and not get hit, heal up, get back in... Repeat... After almost an hour trying to get past this one big fight, where my archon made absolutely NO damage to the UBG, I quit.			"

												This is a great game the physics and mechanics of this game is up to scratch, but one problem, its too dam easy! But if i put it on Hardcore its too dam hard, its not so bad at the end of the game but when you start of with junk weps and its on hardcore its almost impossible to run solo and too time consuming running around dodging mobs to regerate life, However Online CO-OP Hardcore is recommended. Also it took me 5 days of playing a few hours a day to finish, and 3 days once i knew what i was doing on another character. 5/5 for graphics but the game itself 1/5, I would never recommend this RPG to anyone unless it was free. Otherwise waste of money.. IMO anyway, maybe you will like it.			"

												Don't let my playtime fool you, I've got 4-5 hours logged in this game across accounts, consoles, and demo.  I only own it because the entire Dungeon Siege trilogy was on sale.It's an awful, awful third installment of what was once a great series.  Camera controls are terrible, gameplay is simplistic in the worst possible ways -- this turned Dungeon Siege from a wonderfully atmospheric party-based RPG to a thoughtless button-mashing ARPG.  A sad end to the franchise.If you're looking for an updated version of DS1 or DS2 to play, this is not it.  Go back to DS2 and try to sort out the multiplayer bugs instead.I have heard the couch multiplayer in this is acceptable, though I have not tried it.			"

												I am astounded. DS1, DS2, and then this? We were lied to. I don't care how many other ways you want to cover up that fact, but welcome to the business marketing world (psychological warfare). It had the name DS3 simply to sell it--grub some more cash. I have played maybe 10 minutes of this game, and I will not waste anymore of my time on it.I am angry enough that Dungeon Siege 1 and 2 are not multiplayer-able in Steam (someone should definitely be locked up for that, all by itself). Dungeon Siege 3 was a marketing lie. Lock this guy up. He had done some careless, selfish things with his merchandise, and should be slapped. I don't care how many people on here say, ""Der, this is not like DS 1 and 2, but-but-but... it's the best game I've ever played! It's an amazing ARPG!!"" --- Baloney and cheese, that's what that is.He failed, and should not get any attention. He should care more about his audience and gamers than this. He deserves the failure he received from trying to make a ""console"" game, and not being faithful to his gamers and followers he had. Fluffy-fluff.			"

												This is a very good game that never found it's audience. Peole who were fond of early Bioware forays into consoles - KOTOR and Jade Empire, to be precise - would have loved it. It's built on the same design principles: incredibly well-paced story in a ""choose your own adventure"" form coupled with extremely linear level design. You won't find open world exporation, deep character customization, complex skill trees and full party management here - but it's not a bad thing, per se, since it allows to focus on a story while not being entirely devoid of gameplay.Even though there is no traditional party, the game features companion NPCs that double as pregen player characters. You can't control them in battle, but you can change their equipment and stance. You can't initiate conversation with them, but they have plenty of contextual banters and can disagree with your choices in conversations. All four are fully voiced. Story is lighter and less prone to deconstruction than certain earlier Obsidian titles. There is a fantasy trope subversion here and there, but most of the time the setting is treated with respect. This is a welcome change for me, but undoubtedly those who wanted it edgier were left disappointed. George Ziets was creative lead on both this and Mask of the Betrayer NWN 2 expansion, so they share much of the atmosphere.Starting levels suffer from being incredibly bland traditional fantasy, but later areas - both Stonebridge and Tumbledown Court - are excellent each in their own way, with great NPC casts and unique ambience. Gameplay wise it's your run off-the-mill ARPG. Once you get your twitch going, it flows smoothly. Makes you wish the corridors weren't so narrow, the trash mobs - so numerous, and small time bosses - such obvious damage sponges. Otherwise it gets the job of carrying you from dialog to dialog done. This is a departure from the first two games in a franchise, but it's not really worse - just very different.			"

												Bottom line: If you enjoyed DS1 and DS2, don't expect the same from DS3.It's nothing new.  There have been games like this before, but it is nothing at all like Dungeon Siege 1 or 2.  Baulder's Gate did this with some console games and they were similarly shallow compared to its progenitors.  This game was designed to bring DS to console (which was a mistake for the franchise IMO).  Controls are simplified and there is no more party tactics playstyle and very little character customization (beyond choosing your gear).  That said, if you like this type of game then give it a shot.  It's relatively well finished and mostly balanced (some issues introduced with expansion).  Not a lot of replay value and no higher difficulty reruns (like in DS2).The leveling up system allows SOME customization, but at the end you unlock all of the skills.  You can customize individual abilities for special effects, but after you find the core skills for your play style and max them out, it becomes a chore to level up.Only get the expansion for this if you got it in the bundle (which I don't like because it doesnt have the expansion for DS2).

While this one I wouldn't say is AAA good, I will say it was an enjoyable experience.Pros:-Graphics-Unique Characters-Decent Combat System-Decent length (roughly 20 hours)Cons:-The loot isn't as good as it could be-No way to drop items (must be sold at a shop to remove from inventory)-The controls without a controller feel a bit off (W,A,S,D to move instead of traditional click with the mouse to move)-Dialogue (while decently VA'ed), there's a little too much to go around making you want to skip it.Overall worthy of giving a try if you like games like Diablo, Torchlight, Titan Quest, etc.			"

Solves any camera angle issues.Pros:Good storyGood graphicsChoices matterPre-setup for controllerCons:Combat is to easy even on Hardcore. Camera is a pain if not using a controlerWorld is smaller that the story indicates, breaking imersion a bit.Note: Combat isnt all about hack and slash... its abouit understanding the timing of your characters dead time before and after attacks, and dodging at the right times... Almost never have to use healing abilities after getting used to the timing. You can fight entire boss battles without taking a hit... Even dodging the lockon magic spells that cicle around till they time out or hit something. USE COVER if your a ranged player... Magic and guns will hit pillars that you can shoot around.			"

												Before I begin: My opinion on this game is actually neutral if it is leaning more towards the negativ than the positiv, just not enough to honestly justify a thumbs down.Now I, like many other fans of the series, was excited when I heard news about about a new DS and couldn't wait to play it. Sadly my enthusiasm was quickly destroyed by two things:1. You can't create your own character, instead there are 4 you can choose from.2. Those character have 2 styles each.Now for those who don't know what's so bad about it let me explain: In DS you could always create your main character, the companions however where pre-created obviously and your fighting-style as well as your skill were determined by your playstlye. This mean that if you continued to use a certain style your character would get better and better with it. And , at least in DS 1, the stats for that style would raise as well.Well in the end, after it was avaible for a few bucks, I decided to play it anyways and quite honestly was exactly what I suspected it to be if slightly worse in some aspects.Now first of the good things about it:+The combat all around seem more dynamic, while it was very possible to win with little to no movement in the first two games that would be a death ticket in this one. Some might hate it but I kind of like it even it it is sometimes kind of clumsy.+It looks good, well most of the time... and yes I know graphics are not everything.+The story CAN be interesting, or at least entertaining. Especially if you take a drink everytime someone says ""Jeyne     Kassynder"" in a dramatic fashion.Now it's weakpoints:-Those f*cking bosses, now don't get me wrong, I love a challenging boss like everyone else but if it's difficulty is purely based on it having ♥♥♥♥ton of HP as well as respawning minions? Not so much. There are bosses where it make sense (the warbeast comes to mind) but most of the time it fells more like the developers were lazy. -The characters are just stupid. No really they are. Imagine this: Your antagonist, who by the way controls the entire army of the church, wants every legionaire and anyone connected with the legion dead.... what do they do? RALLY ALL SURVIVORS IN THE ♥♥♥♥ING MANSION OF THE GRANDMASTER! Sure! It's not obvious or anything like that, not like Jeyne could have spies nearby or anything like that! The next destination after the onvious happens? THE LAST CHAPTERHOUSE! Are those guys ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥?!While I am at it: I really wish I could have told some of those guys to go screw themselves.-Those ""triggered"" fighty, to summarize: You see an obvious foe; you attack; nothing happens. You go closer, a cutscene starts and BOOM! in the middle of an ""ambush"" or something similar. Not to bad with the melee-fighter but as a ranged one?-The desing on several character is just... ugh... really just uncomfortable. Old character sometimes look like albinos in their 30's and they will NEVER. STOP. MOVING. THEIR. EYES! Really ?! Look me in the eyes and not at the ceiling damn it!-It just didn't fell like a DS-game... instead it relied on references to older game while practically screaming that it's a DS aswell and we should notice it.-Square EnixIn the end? Is the game good? No not really but it's also not horrible either instead it's in that weird limbo where some will like it while others despise it.Now if this games catches your fancy, buy it but wait for a sale. It can be fun but you won't miss anything. But if you really REALLY need to play it: Play as Anjali, makes for a better story.			"

												From playing this for an hour and half I got the impression GPG must have walked up to some Russian/Ukrainian Game Dev. students and said here, we will pay you a bit to make us some random cheap ♥♥♥ game to sell do the DS fans to make lots of quick cash! but oh wait, apparently the game IP of dungeon siege is owned by Square Enix now, so no real surprise there... Basically, its a sub standard game. Oh would that steam only had a proper scoring mechanism, but no it takes it's scores from meta critic. :( this was a horrible waste of money.All I can do is 'recommend' the game with the 'handwritten(typed)' score of 2/5 bleah.

												If you look at the other reviews, a lot of them are extreme fans of the previous 2 installments and cannot cope with the game changes in this one. Dungeon Siege 3 is actually a pretty decent game, it's kinda like RPG-lite but with a bit more background lore to it. Anyway, I'm having fun with the game and I think I could easily see it through to the end :)			"

												It's very unlike me to review a game after barely having played it, but I feel that it needs to be said, in light of all of the reviews I've read; Dungeon Siege III is pretty good.I only bought the game (from Humble Bundle) so that I could qualify for a larger discount on another set of games that I wanted (Tomb Raider and Deus Ex). I paid $3.00 for it. So, it was very, very cheap. I guess I should get the DLC as well at some point, considering it's a lot more favourably viewed.At any rate, I've done Dungeon Siege III a great disservice, by not actually sitting down and trying it out. Having burned out on Dragon Age, and not really looking forward to opening up anything ""heavy"", I decided to run DS3 for a bit, just so I can uninstall it with a clear conscience.Now, I've played the previous games in the series, though it has been a very long time. I remember the slow build-up of the first game, as I went from being a farmer to taking on a Dragon. I remember enjoying how I could customize my character's fighting style, and I remember that there were mules to carry all of my loot (something that Torchlight stole and then improved). I also remembered the second game, which I'd always start, but couldn't play through because I'd get frustrated with the characters. So, I have mixed memories of the games, having enjoyed them, but not enough to get them onto my top-ten.Dungeon Siege III is more like its immediate predecessor than the first game in that you're restricted to 4 specific characters (whose skills you can modify). The other characters then later join you as computer-controlled companions (with whom you can raise your influence, and equip with items). I will mention that Anjali seems to be very OP compared to the others. I'd started playing with Lucas, but even as a companion, Anjali is outstripping me (which is rather embarrassing).The graphics are pretty good. It won't break records, but it looks good while still running very smoothly. The animations are great, the ambient effects are very nice. Faces aren't the best, but there are very few games that can get those right. But it looks good while playing, and that's what matters to me.Voice-acting is uneven. It sounds a bit like those audio-books you buy for kids, with a small cast of people narrating the story and doing the voices. Some are better than others, but it's not at the level of, say, Dragon Age, or Neverwinter Nights 2. It's very... pedestrian.But I enjoyed the gameplay, and that's what this is about. I lost patience with Torchlight when it came out, and Diablo never appealed to me. But Dungeon Siege III is far more to my taste. I would recommend that you look into changing the key mappings once you start because the default control scheme doesn't gel with how I like my layout. And I much preferred moving my character using the WASD buttons rather than the mouse.The camera is mostly okay. It sometimes swings way too close if I'm bumping a wall (which can happen in the tight corridors of the game), but it doesn't happen all that often, and it's bearable.I will note that just like the previous games, Dungeon Siege III is very linear. There aren't a lot of open areas (except for boss arenas), and there aren't any ""procedurally generated"" maps. There's a very definite direction you're supposed to trek in. In RPG terms, you're being railroaded. But the combat is fun enough to overlook it, and I'm really looking forward to finishing this at least once (and we'll see how I feel about trying the other characters once I do).			"

												played the original and dungeon siege 2 on an old ♥♥♥ pc my brother had, we still have the original cases they came in, I played the second one so many times I think it just stopped working.At any rate, when this game came out I tested it on xbox I THINK, don't quote me on it, it was either a demo or perhaps on a laptop, the point is. NOW that I am re-experiencing the series again, I think this MAY be my least favorite, it could be the wonky controls as far as keyboard goes, or how the camera seems to move around you if you walk with either mouse or keys, and the combat is probably the worst combat I have ever played with in any game ever, honestly it feels WORSE than a mobile port, at least you feel like you have a sense of control in mobile rpg's, this is just wrong. The blocking mechanics alongside the attack buttons seem like the game wanted to have such a huge  emphasis on the next attack position, that it dissociates itself from having smooth combat overall.The story is also pretty meh SO FAR, and the characters to choose from look alright, I picked a mage, which has a voice actor that doesn't fit his look in 15 years. He's like a damn 70 year old mage with a 20 something year old voice actor, come on. Atleast pretend to be old or edit the man's voice. I can say one thing that makes this game good that stands alongside it's tendency to give me (who has never experienced it in his life) vertigo or some ♥♥♥♥, is the graphics. Sure, parallel to it's aspired gameplay overall, the graphics do puzzle into sort of a mobile fashion, but; I think in order from best to worst, DS2, 1, 3. For sure.			"

												Loved this game. The story was entertaining and some elements reminded me of a Salman Rushdie novel. Just fantastic. I read a guide before playing to choose the most OP toon and get the right abilities without having to spend ages thinking about it. As a result i picked the Gipsy and this helped me enjoy the story a lot and own all the enemies no problem. Environments are nice, it's cartoony but its well done. Clocked it in 40-50 hours which is great, didn't bother to replay with other toons or try multiplayer. If you get it at a discount, which happens a lot, you won't go wrong.			"

												If you played the first two Dungeon Siege games and are a huge fan of them, you'll probably have issues with this game.  It goes in a very different direction away from the Diablo style click to a hack and slash style game.  I didn't take issue with the change to different format of combat, but where it really fell flat was in the skill trees.  The skills were really dumbed down, all your stats to improve your charecter are now just the gear and nothing else.  For RPS players who like depth this will be very dissapointing.  Aside from the change in combat and the dumbed down skill trees.  This game is good in my opinion, not great but good.  It has an interesting story.  The combat is fun,and pulls you in at times.  I would recomment playing with a friend at this game does have local co-op.  It's not a game that most people will play for months or years, but if you are planning a day with a friend this will fill the bill.  Great story, good graphics and decent combat.  If you were hoping for a really deep combat system and skill tree sadly you won't find it hear.  But if you are just looking for a fun time.  This should suit you just fine			"

Solves any camera angle issues.Pros:Good storyGood graphicsChoices matterPre-setup for controllerCons:Combat is to easy even on Hardcore. Camera is a pain if not using a controlerWorld is smaller that the story indicates, breaking imersion a bit.Note: Combat isnt all about hack and slash... its abouit understanding the timing of your characters dead time before and after attacks, and dodging at the right times... Almost never have to use healing abilities after getting used to the timing. You can fight entire boss battles without taking a hit... Even dodging the lockon magic spells that cicle around till they time out or hit something. USE COVER if your a ranged player... Magic and guns will hit pillars that you can shoot around.			"

												I can recommend this game for people who are looking for a good single player dungeon crawler. But for those who are looking for a cooperative adventure, don't come here. The coop mode in this game is completely useless, you come in as kind of like a placeholder for the companion you have in the single player. You dont gain levels, or loot, or anything of value, its a one-sided help to the host. The story is decent enough to continue to play for a while, but because of the fact that dungeon crawlers are lonely by nature, the game loses luster unless you are completely commited to the game. If you really want to play the game get it. But not at full price.			"

												THIS IS NOT A DUNGEON SIEGE GAME!!! This game is nothing compared to DSII, the gameplay and style are completly different. (I have not played the multiplayer and I probalby will not.) Your team building is completely limited to the constructs of  the preset game options, your  character class is permanetly set and you cannot stray in the slightest to develop a character to fit your design or fighting style like the incredible system in DSII. You can tell that Chris Taylor had really nothing to do with this game, the fact that he let it be produced is disheartening. The visuals are great dont get me wrong, but the camera is horrendous. It is always at an angle that makes you a bit nauseous, plus you cannot adjust it to see well at all. The target locking system is entirely automated, I have not found a way  to turn it off, so the enemy that you are targeting  is not the one  that you choose, completly eliminating any potential strategy in the battles. The story line is not too bad, a bit dry at times but overall it has been pretty decent. Alas the only real connection to the wonderful DSII is that a few of the names like Asunites are thrown in for good measure. To anyone who is a fan of the DS series I WOULD NOT recommend this game. (I wish I had looked into the game further  before purchasing, but the idea of a new DS game I hit the  purchase button without hesitation.) But if you are looking for  a halfway decent loot based RPG then wait until it is on sale before you pick it up.			"

												This game feels awfully similar to Dragon Age II while playing it, though it is a LOT harder. The similarities to Dragon Age II also means that Dungeon Siege III doesn't play even remotely similarly to the previous two DS titles. It's an extremely good game if you can live with the high difficulty level, and because it is so different to the first two DS titles, it is not essential that you play those two games before this one.

												This turned out to be a very solid hack/slash/loot game.  You can choose from 4 solidly different characters.  The combat starts fairly simple (mash attach, use 1 or 2 abilities), but it gets more complex in a really rewarding way.  Each character has 2 combat stances, and each stance has 3 abilities that you get as you level up, plus 3 defensive abilities.  Each ability can also be mastered to unlock a more powerful version of that ability.  You get to distribute a few meaningful upgrades each time you level up.  The entire game was bug free for me in single player.  The graphics were really nice, and the plot was pretty solid (although as with most fantasy games I said ""huh?!"" a couple times).  The looting is good, the inventory and quest systems are good.  The game isn't incredibly long, but for me that was good.  It was about 9 hours for the single player and it really felt like an epic journey.  A few sidequests, but it wasn't bogged down with them.  As I ramble on, I realize that the bottom line for me was ""this game was pretty awesome.""   I am also a couple hours into the co-op.  Only the person hosting gets to save their character, but as long as you play with the same person, you'll both get to keep your stuff.  Co-op is mostly smooth, but since you have to both be on the same screen, sometimes your partner running off, gets you trapped in a corner.			"

												As a Diablo-eque hack & slasher, Dungeon Siege III is far from the usual fare you've come to expect from Obsidian. While the game is fairly linear, where forks in the main path usually means loot chests or side missions, choices being reflected in the epilogue was a nice touch and a welcomed addition.Instead of building a party, you only control 1 character with 1 other character deployed as an AI companion. Combat involves mixing up the 9 skills, and their empowered variety; the stances switching and constant dodging reminded me a little of Bastion's combat.The game is pretty and practically glitch-free. It is a shame that the beautiful character models were rarely showcased as the dialogue camera never panned over to your character, other than in the DLC. Other mild annoyances are the slow-ish walk speed and restrictive camera pitch.One feature they did retain from the Dungeon Siege brand was the huge continuous world. It's quite amazing how the lack of loading screens can add to the enjoyment of a game.All in all, I can understand why Dungeon Siege fans condemn it and others bemoan its ""console dumb-down"". Dungeon Siege III seems to suffer from the recent trend of being a decent game but also a ""bad"" entry in a franchise, however it should still be an enjoyable distraction for a budget price.NOTE: probably best played on a gamepad			"

It compelled me to get the cheats and try to fix the mission and objective status myself to continue, but it proved too arduous.

												This is an incredibly awful change from the previous titles. The control and moving the character is so bad on a PC that I just can't do it. If you could set the controls to mouse look that would eliminate 100% of the problem but yet again we have a titled ported to PC from console that takes advantage of NONE of the pc control mechanism. Your keyboard is a crummy dpad and your mouse has the buttons. Is the plot good? Is the game fun? I will never find out because the control is so bad. Something simple like turning to your left to open a chest, looting the stuff that falls on the ground and then positioning yourself back where you were is just agony.Being a purely digital download there is another drawback - I can't take it out back and set it on fire for at least a little cathartic release.

												(played offline a lot and at school so my game time is wrong)NOTHING LIKE THE DS1 OR DS2! The game looks good and plays okay...well aslong as you play single player for that i give it a 7/10 -points for ♥♥♥♥♥♥ pc controls since i cant be botherd to pay another 30 euro for a good controler. Still playable though but its a lot harder to walk around (definatly remap the keys) Also NO POTIONS ANYMORE???? wich is really strange...Now the multiplayer is where the mayor problems are. Your charecters are restricted to 1 screen so you cant just walk away and do something on your own (this is fixable with an unofficial patch) Only the host can interact with NPC's for quests so as p2 - p4 you cant do **** your just like an AI prettymuch. YOU CANT PLAY AS YOUR OWN CHARECTER ON SOMEONE ELSES GAME!You join someone else and you have to play as (Insert charecter you play) but the version on their pc so if you actually want to do a fun mp game you really have to start from the start as MP then continue together every time which is horrible especialy if your not playing on the same machine with controlers.For the multiplayer i would probably give it a 4/10 Dont buy this if you want to really have a fun multiplayer experiance atleast not for pc for singleplayer only its okay though.

I played the first 2 games with my dad and my brother, but they screwed this one over, buy it in a package with the first 2 and maybe check it out if you like games were you mindlessly swing a sword or shoot a gun but other than that, I do not suggest this game 2/10.

												I liked Dungeon Siege. I really liked Dungeon Siege 2. I wanted to like Dungeon Siege 3, but it fought me at every turn until I stopped fighting the inevitable and admitted the BEST thing that can be said about it is that it simply lacks.The first two both featured adventuring with full parties. The third barely made a pretense by allowing you one companion.The first two actually allowed you to create a character of your own. The third lets you pick from a very limited selection of pre-made characters, where your entire input is choosing one- you don't even get to name them.The first two were both pretty linear. The third one makes the term linear seem insufficient to convey just how ""on rails"" the gameplay is.Replayability? Pretty close to zero, in my opinion.Just not seeing the appeal. At all.			"

												One of my fondest games when I was younger was Dungeon Siege II. It was an amazing game; a seemingly wide-open world, amazing levels of customization, and tough, too.This game is a console port. The inventory system is optimized for console controllers (ie no grid system any more), the controls are built for a controller (ie to my knowledge, there's no strafe functionality, so if you want to strafe, you've got to use your mouse and stop attacking), and the skill system is simplistic enough for console controllers (ie no depth).The game quickly deviates from the Dungeon Siege format. Instead of being able to build a character that does what YOU want with the ability to mix and match abilities, you get to pick from four pre-made characters. If something doesn't fit your fancy, well you can go screw yourself. What do you think this is, Dungeon Siege? ... Wait... Combat is MUCH more focused on positioning and fast-paced movement, where in earlier games movement was much more tactical and positioning was a little less relevant. The skill system is bland and uninteresting, not really letting you build characters like you could before. Oh, and your character can only use three skills at a time. Two stance abilities and a guard one.Speaking of the stances... The game has what I can only describe as a stance system. You hit ""q"" to switch between two stances per character. One of the characters switches between double pistols and... a rile? shotgun? It's been a while since I've played her. Another switches between using a staff and spitting out fireballs. There's no customizing that, either. Each stance has one ability tied to it, and you have to be in that stance to use that ability. The ability use button (1) is right above the stance change button (q), so I often found myself switching stances instad of using the ability I wanted to.One last thing that I want to harp on: the bounding boxes for terrain do not match up with their visuals half the time. I often found myself trying to walk into completely open spaces only to find myself unable to, because the stairs that were four feet away really had a bounding box there, or the cliff that was behind me was wrapping around in from of me somehow, or I was anywhere near rocks. For a game that relies so much on quick movement, you want to go NOWHERE near the rocks. They're devious traps set by the enemies to trap you and leave you helpless.Essentially, this game is not a DS game. It's a bad attempt at a third party of cashing in on the name brand, and a sloppy game even on its own. Stay away.			"

												When I first came across the Dungeon Siege franchise, it was magic. Loved the style, loved the gameplay and got very taken in by the story. This was (somewhat) well adapted into Dungeon Siege 2, which I ended up spending at least 100hrs on. Then when the 3'rd was announced, I was ecstatic, the trailer looked awesome, the graphics amazing... however, these feeling were not to last. I bought and play the game for nearly 2 hours and little by little it became very clear to me. The magic was gone. I understand the need to try new things, (and since it wasn't even published by Microsoft, it makes sense), but I didn't get Dungeon Siege 3. I got something else. The story is dull at best, the gameplay is... not for me, and I'm left with an empty feeling and a horrid excuse of a game. No go from me.			"

Suffice to say it's not a typical HnS ARPG where you highlight somethign with the mouse and then attack it. You have to actually have the character facing it. This means you have to hold down MMB constantly in a fight.  Strafing is worthless because it's not actually strafing. Pressing left or right ""strafe"" actually faces and moves your character to the left or right. It's a right-left movement key. Not a true strafe.The only game series to get third person right was the first two Batman games.Waste of money even at five bucks for the franchise pack. Complete waste.			"

												Honestly, not really sure I want to reinstall this one. The gameplay changed so much from the first 2 that it seemed like they couldn't be bothered to do something decent with this one. You have a choice between 4 characters; 2 male and 2 female. Gender specific classes and story based around each character. While you didn't have much in the way of customization due to the garphics in  DS and DS 2, you'd think they would give you the option of playing characters that had more open ended story. Instead you get that gun chick, the tank guy (who is actually really nice to have as a second), the amazon caster chick (who didn't really make a whole lot of sense to me as a character in the basic story), and the mad scientist dude. I disliked the movement controls and point of view for the camera, but I really liked the boss mechanics. The whole ""Oooo something on the ground"" which you wanted to avoid because it generally meant a special ability that really ♥♥♥♥ing hurts. The nice thing about that was you actually did have a chance to move out of whatever ground effect or targetting effect was in place before you took damage.			"

Suffice to say it's not a typical HnS ARPG where you highlight somethign with the mouse and then attack it. You have to actually have the character facing it. This means you have to hold down MMB constantly in a fight.  Strafing is worthless because it's not actually strafing. Pressing left or right ""strafe"" actually faces and moves your character to the left or right. It's a right-left movement key. Not a true strafe.The only game series to get third person right was the first two Batman games.Waste of money even at five bucks for the franchise pack. Complete waste.			"

												Utterly pathetic excuse for a game, lot alone a Dungeon Siege sequel.  Story - It's story BARELY sets it in the Dungeon Siege world   Graphic/Style - For the time it came out, it is both graphicly unimpressive and lacks any kind of thematic artstyle  Gameplay - Plays like you jerked off in your controller and never cleaned it, with extremely poor movement and camera controls alongside clunky game mechanics which was somehow achieved even with the extremely simple, uninspired  gameplay.  Characters- All generic, most are repeated models with the worst lipsync I have ever seen   Aliens:ColonialMarines/10 - Literal garbage that killed an amazing IP, they could have just remastered Dungeon Siege 1 and 2 remastered with Multiplayer and they would have made a ♥♥♥♥ load of money.

												Horrible addition to the now three part series.DS1 was great with its freedom of development, varied items, and pause combat.DS2 expanded on those three core systems and made an even better awesome pause combat game.This game (DS3) butchered the freedom of development system, destroyed the item progression, and absolutely ruined the camera controls.This game was nothing but and EXTREME LET DOWN following in the footsteps of DS2.I don't know how anyone could vote this positive having played either 1 or 2, or even neither. The game is just missing so many basic core fundamentals that are necessary for something this expensive and polished by a big name.If ever there is a DS4, I pray that it is made by an entirely different team.

												If you enjoyed the first two Dungeon Siege games and like Diablo-like adventures in general... well, then don't buy this.  The mechanics are very different, the multiplayer experience forces you to share a (small) screen (making movement very difficult), and the plot feels like it was stitched together in the same style as Unreal Gold.

												Even though this game is a few years old, the graphics are still crisp. Now, a downside to this game is that there's only one way to really 'fast travel' between locations, and those are limited. Within any given area/city/etc you'll be going back and forth from one end of the map to another multiple times, and the enemies will respawn within a few moments so the maps are never clear of baddies. That aside, the game is still very playable, with easy to pick up controls, a good story and nicely written characters.			"

												Er.....Fans of the first Dungeon Siege should steer wide of this offering.   The controls, UI, combat, party mechanics, plot (-_-), etc is geared toward less of a traditional fantasy and more towards an action game.  The menus are confusing, requiring navigation when I should just be able to click on the item right in front of me and perform whatever action I wish to perform.  I am glad the game has dialogue choices, and half expected them to remove voice acting (which was in the first game from, now, 15 YEARS AGO!).  Sure, the graphics _look_ pretty, but you can only polish a turd so much.  The game shows a general lack of innovation and more of a general phoning in of a ""fantasy setting.""  If you've ever played Dragon Age and thought: ""Man, I want absolutely no control of my team and want to just sit here and roll my face on the keyboard,"" this is the game for you.Pros:Pretty graphicsDialogue choicesCons:Not a strategy game (like previous games)No tactical/strategic control of party membersCumbersome menusHack/Slash combatNo Save optionNot fun			"

But after only a few hours and a couple dungeons into the game, I am finding this game nearly unplayable. It's a drag. The gameplay is stunted by a real lack of diverse skills. Without interesting skills, there is no real strategy and character development is a waste of time. Many rogue-like dungeon crawlers have more customization than DSIII.			"

Disclaimer:Did not play Dungeon Siege 1 or 2 (at the time of writting).Played only in co-op.Played in hardcore mode.The graphics are good, the music is forgettable but in no way terrible. Clearly the story has been worked on: there seem to be quite a lot of content there. But it's wasted by the lack of choices. This is an action game before it's a RPG, and it shows: killing is your only argument and you'll then be given an choice from the unconditionnal surrender of your enemy (it gets too repetitive not to be ridiculus). Can't expect too much from a game in which all stats are combat related, and it is better than a completely linear story, just not by much.But then again, this could still be a pretty darn good action game right? Well...The camera controls are among the worst I've ever seen. If you play co-op like me, there's simply no choice: you have to install the command line and tweak them into something playable (it'll still be pretty bad, but at least it'll be playable). I also recommend the command line if you play in hardcore, because otherwise your damage output is too low and it takes forever to kill anything (it doesn't make things less challenging, just less boring).I had to start a new game because I started with Lucas, the melee character, and it became apparent that my damage was so low it wasn't worth hitting enemies and blocking (although it's very effective) was useless because I didn't have any 'taunt' skill.Combat is repetitive. I've seen this game compared to Diablo, with people not understanding how the two games are similar. Well, Diablo's combat (considered very repetitive by many) is LESS repetitive than this game's, and there's a simple reason for that: in Diablo, your character's skills make your gameplay vary, making you want to level up to get new mechanics. In comparison, DS III would actually benefit from not having levels, as very few skills introduce new mechanics. Indeed, it would have been better to put the skills on equipement, which is otherwise just a collection of numbers (there's no unique effects) added to your character's attack.The simple combat mechanics of the game aren't too bad though, just don't play if you don't have a controller. There's just one attack button (with a 3 attacks loop), no combo system, a nice dodge system (by far the best part of this game, IMHO). The two stances mechanic was a good attempt at varying the gameplay, but it's ruined by the loot system: if you get a good item for one stance, the other becomes pretty much useless.I'm not sure the game was play tested for its gameplay, as we found ourselves with way too much money effortlessly and yet nothing to spend it on, despite having bad equipement.The only bug we encountered (a door preventing the main character from going to the boss room, effectively blocking any progress until we cheated our way in) was caused by the camera tweak, so I don't have any complain there.

												NO, just NO, do not install this.This game might have great story, but I will never know, because I could not suffer that horrible console interface. Inventory, quest log and menus are designed for consoles, and they come with all the quirks and limitations. The camera in this game is abysmal at best, you are either too far or too close to see anything. The UI and the HUD takes way too much space and you can't click on it, in fact you can't click on almost anything in the game, not even to get info on various objects or characters, you have to walk to it/them and press ""E"" to interract, this brings me to the character controls, you either turn with with keys, or hold ""alt "" and turn with mouse, which isn't that great. RMB is not used to change camera, all it does is make your character walk. On top of this there is no auto-click-and-move-to functionality in this game, and you will get stuck on the environment a lot.Combat system seems week, switching between different stances on your character is clumsy and unintuitive. Boss fight mechanics are repetitive, altho I haven't finished the game so it may get better in the late game (I wouldn't bet on it). There is no character customization in this game, you have to select from 3 (or is it 4?) pre defined avatars. Chracter progression is unrevarding, abilities and their specialization is very limited (I belive there are 9 core abilities for each class). And now about all the loot and all the treasures... well you know that feeling when you get that one special item that makes you feel so powerfull and rewarded? In this game you get lot of garbage with weird stats instead! And if you combine this with that horrible inventory system, you just wish you did not pick that up.Enviroments are well designed, the graphics are nice and some of the spell effects looks amazing, game have great voice acting and really cool music.

												If you're a fan of Dungeon Siege 1 and 2, this game isn't even remotely the same. It was sold by Gas Powered Games (DS1/DS2 creators) by Chris Taylor and Square Enix were the buyers. Obsidian Entertainment butchered the style of Dungeon Siege entirely, but they obviously couldn't have been trying to use anything more than a similar lore basis. Ignoring the relation to the previous two games, this isn't actually a bad game in it's own right. It's got a decent story and a decent combat system, though it's entirely designed for consoles and simply given a decent PC port. While it doesn't re-invent anything, it's a solid title if you get it on a Steam sale for under 7$. It gives roughly 20 hours of gameplay, and the DLC adds another 2 hours or so as well. More gameplay if you replay it to try out each character, as you can only play that one character, even though you recruit all 4 throughout the game. All 4 character clears would be around 60+ Hours of gameplay.			"

This is hands down the most frustrating thing you will encounter outside of a few annoyingly difficult bosses.  The camera angles tend to be almost directly overhead and always seem to rotate around to the worst viewpoint possible.  Maybe the camera is only a coop issue, but be warned.7/10			"

												The game isn't as good as it's predecessors but it still delivers very enjoyable experience. Story isnt amazing but it's not bad/awful either. It's good enough to keep you interested in the game. This game is worth buying but only with the DLC which adds things that basic game lacks (ehcnantments, respeccing).OVerall score: 8/10+ 28 hours long on Hardcore mode, 100% walkthrough+ Nice graphics,+ Low system requirements, good optimisation+ A lot of action and humor+ Amazing OST+ Huge Replayability value, either SP or Co-Op+ Great AI but easy to learn overtime- Stupid partner AI. Yet, it's good as cannon fodder.- Camera could be more flexible.- Camera in co-op is shared so your partner has to stay in your sight.Neutral: Demanding and challangening game - others may see it as downside, especially that the first boss to fight (Rajani) is the hardest one in entire game, others are just easy mode. Hardcore mode is very punishable for those who don't think on the run and rush blindly. 2-3 hits max and you're on the ground begging to be revived.			"

This is such unbearable crap, I could only play for 2 hours by hoping it wouldn't turn out as ♥♥♥♥♥♥ as i read. Also by figuring since II was so good, how could III be bad? Well it is that bad.

												The next in my long line of pretty appalling reviews. I played this (on normal) for around 8hrs, and was level 11, completing as far as I know all of the side quests and getting to the end of Act I.Graphics@@@@@The game is about three years old, but Titan Quest is older, but looks much better. Nice enough, but nothing special. There is a gamma setup, but I think its more to annoy you - making get stuck on the scenery to add to its difficulty.Maps@@@@The area's seem varied enough, but oh my god is it bad in how its presented. All ARPGs are huge open maps that are basically mazes, with natural terrain to force you to backtrack as required, but using these dead ends as boss encounters or hidden chest areas. In DS3, you are in a series of corridors. I am nearly having a panic attack as I play this game, its so claustrophobic.The map is beyond woeful. Imagine trying to navigate from Lands End to John o Groats with your map that looks like a small circle with a line going from South to North. That's what your map looks like. Sometimes its a little wiggly, but its basically a line. You can change the zoom once, or you can remove the map. There is no overall map and no map overlay of the area and no adjustable zoom to be of any use at all. Quest markers lead you to think that you are heading in the right place, but are miles away from where you think they are.Mobs@@@@You get swarmed a lot, and need very early on to perfect the hit, roll, hit, roll, hit, roll technique if you don't want to be dead. I am not sure why you can roll faster than you can run, nor why just about EVERYTHING can run faster than you to swarm you as they run down the corridor, sorry I mean through the dense forest that is so overgrown apart from the perfectly manicured path.Mobs are a little samey, bandits and spiders so far, but the Boss mobs and encounters have had some interesting attacks.Skill Tree, UI & Classes@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Lets start with the UI. Basic is the word, and nothing is contextual, meaning you have to wonder what on earth the empty orb things are that appear to be un-learnt skills are as no little pop up box helpfully appears.The Skill section is something else. I am still not entirely sure what the Proficiencies do, as I think they only work when you expend your focus with your Ability 1 button (normally 1) You then change Stance to do something else and while in this stance, the 1 button does something different, but 4 always heals and 5 always does the other buff spell....its simply too confusing, when other games would allow you to use the orbs as you wish. Its reported to be a console port and one that has had no PC love at all. It shows.There is a nice balance on the active skills, as you can only rank them to 5 in total and you have two choices per skill, so you can have 3/2 or 0/5 as you wish. Filling all 5 'empowers' the skill, meaning it now has a more powerful effect - multiple targets instead of one or heal all the party rather than just you.You get Passive skills as well, which are normally based on x% per rank.Leveling is quite annoying though, it waits for the second you have finished a fight then goes to the character screen. So you cannot find a save point, then level and test a skill or anything. Its just annoying - like running into a wall.Controls & Camera@@@@@@@@@@@Right click move and left click fire as usual, but you also have forward and back and lefty/right camera angles. You need them as well, as getting stuck on scenery happens a lot, getting stuck in corners happens in swarms and thats why I think the dodge roll was added. Spacebar adds a block move, while space and move rolls on that direction.The camera is a mad thing that sweeps in and out at a moments notice. Nothing becomes see through, solid objects block its viewpoint, and boss fights in a room can see you looking at the floor a few feet in front of you as the camera changes without you doing anything.You cannot direct your team members at all. Not with their spell choices or when to do anything. They do revive you if you fall, but forget directing them at the boss or the boss's minions, depending on your strategy.You cannot click on targets to switch - it seem to be locked to the last one you attacked and you will contain to shoot the one miles away that you first started attacking while another beats you to death at close range. This is VERY annoying during the big boss fights, as you are shooting backwards and hitting barrels and chairs rather than your intended target.Controls are not responsive either. There have been plenty of times when I have had to mash a button to get the heal to work (and I had enough foucs to use) and sometimes the roll dodge causes you to stand still and blck instead of roll, and as you are ALWAYS doing this, you are always facing the wrong way to block something.Loot@@@Loads of it, which is nice, and you can upgrade your weapons with essences you find.Gameplay@@@@@On one hand its all a bit meh! to be fair, while on the other so frustrating its beyond belief. At the end of act one you have a BIG boss fight that takes place in a tiny room. In single player, you can do nothing but fire off a quick ranged attack, then roll twice, then fire off an attack, then roll twice.....all aggro is on you all the time as you let your AI partner fight the boss and you just run away. If you miss a beat, she does so much damage that you lose half your hits in one go, and her she fires something off that takes away the other half. You have to roll as this is quicker than running, and if you dont roll she (as everyone else) runs 200% of your speed and chops your face off. If your AI party member drops in combat, you have no chance to revive her as you cannot get far enough away to spend the few seconds required to get her up again, and.....I wont say anymore about the fight, but it gets worse.This is not difficulty levels being too high, this is being hampered by game mechanics that are just ♥♥♥♥. Camera angles, confined space and mechanics all together. Take the Dragon in Torchlight - now that was a rock hard fight, and while running and kiting is a sound mechanic, that felt brilliant. This? Nah. I have tried and failed a dozen times now, but with pretty much all of the above rantings going against it already, I should go back to Assassins Creed II and finish that off.			"

												Obsidian is at the helm here for Dungeon Siege 3, not Gas Powered Games. DS3 has improved in some regards, yet went backwards in others. For improvements, DS3 has the best story & characters this series has ever offered-up. Another improvement is that there are quests which have more than 1 solution to them. There are issues, though - the camera can be wonky & wind-up poorly placed. The game lacks the size of parties, which basically made the previous titles what they are. Pretty much, there is only you & a NPC [which you have no control over] going with you in your SP campaign. All the strategy elements of DS1 and DS2: Broken World are gone. Forget MP - pretty much nobody is playing this online currently [10/24/2011]. Take the improvements & also the fact there's plenty of loot to pick-up & skills to upgrade for your character to obtain, this should still certainly keep you playing. Obsidian has overall delivered a solid ARPG experience here w/ DS3. Grade: C+			"

												This game is great!  I got it on a sale because I've heard good things about the series for over a decade.  I never really got into the other games, but I bought this one because I noticed that it was done by Obsidian.  I'm glad I did because I really enjoyed this game. The story isn't anything great, but it works for the game.  The gameplay is where I had the most fun.  It's not complicated at all.  The simplicity of this game is really great because I don't always want to get my ♥♥♥ kicked by every game I play.  It was really enjoyable just to enjoy the fun story and gameplay without all of the micromanagement of Diablo or similar games.  The game is totally worth the price especially if it comes on sale.

												I was a little torn on whether to give this a recommendation or not, but decided not to in the end. While I did play the entire game all the way through, I wasn't too interested in playing beyond the ending. There's a few characters to choose from, but I found that one playthrough was enough. It's your quest-based RPG. You go into a zone/dungeon, you fight monsters, you fight bosses, you complete quests. The gameplay was at times frustrating and not at all something that could keep me engaged.You might be able to get about 20 hours from this game, but probably not a whole lot more. If you're truly interested in checking this game out, get it during a sale. "

												Well after beating this game, I have to say I enjoyed it. I like the combat system, most of the time it felt very skill based as opposed to just spam dps moves, you actually want to move and roll to dodge enemy attacks. I was interested in the story and ended up caring about the characters involved.  And the voice acted dialouge was nice and enoyable to listen to.However, after all that has been said, here are my complaints.....- Some bosses ended up feeling like bullet hells, in some cases I was almost just rolling around spamming space bar non stop while waiting for my ai componian to kill it. (especially the dlc bosses)- Speaking of dlc, the special moves you acquire in the dlc never felt needed.- The level design in the game..... sucks..... ♥♥♥, just felt like narrow hallways all the way through, inside a cave? narrow hallway, outside in the open? narrow hallway, running though a town or city? narrow hallway....- Another thing I didn't like about the level design was during the credits I got to see the awesome concept art of each area, and it just gave me flashbacks to all the ugly textures I saw throughout the game.- I would say the dlc desert was the best designed since most of it felt more open and alive.All in all I liked it and want to play it again with a different character, and see how the ending will change based on my decisions.

												First, I'll admit I hardly have over an hour of gameplay in this game. That being said, this game was hard to play due to camera angles! You could not switch the camera, and often this would put you at disadvantage when playing the game. Your character would go behind a wall, or a pillar, and you would not be able to see what was going on. Very annoying!Two of my friends bought this game, hoping to rekindle the great times we had playing Dungeon Defenders, as well as the sequel! This game, however, was not even worth the sale price we paid.			"

												This game is different than the previous installments:GOOD: This game has many types of stats a player can have. Everytime the player levels up, so does enemies, so there will always be a challenge. Lots of replay value, and graphics are not bad.BAD: Although it has many replay value, it tends to become repetitive, making it boring after awhile. EITHER: If you play by yourself, your companion tends to become stupid when you die. ( Your companion would have to revive you if you die.) Although your companion is stupid, you can customize your companion to equip equipment as well, acting as if you have 2 players to control, but an AI is controlling 1 character while you control the other.SCORE: 7.5/10 Get this if you got friends to play with, otherwise not a good single-player game.

												this game while decent in terms of an RPG really didnt meet the expected standards of the first 2 dungeon seige games.  Both of those games are miles and miles above this one in all avenues from the leveling/skill systems to the way the game works.  Having set classes and even a distinct lack of character customization really makes this game feel like they took the world and the name but not the actual game its self and improved upon it.  It really is a shame since DS1 and 2 are imo some of the best tactcal/Action based RPGs of all time.   I remember when the first game was released and they used the seemingly endless no loading screen technology for the first time.  It blew me away that i could move from one point to another with out having to load and that i could complete the entire game with out a single load screen.  Moving down into a dungeon felt like it had real depth and the same went for DS2.  If you are looking for a decent RPG then this is an alright game, but if you are expecting the dungeon siege expience look elsewhere.			"

The second and third seemed to be a do act 5 100Billion times to get good loot. Find your dead body... grrr.Why? - Hack and slash, use same abilities over and over again. Point and click, cast this over and over and over again. At least in diablo it told you how far in the game you were with ACT 1-2 etc. Felt like this one can keep going another 24 hours of the same thing.  At least the girls looked good.			"

												I can recommend this game, but it's not fantastic.(note, don't worry if my playtime is very low - I played this when my internet didn't work)If you were looking for a worthy successor to the first two games, you won't find it here.  This feels nothing like it's predecessors.  That said, it isn't a purely horrible game, just not the sequel we were looking for and nothing amazing in its own right.The game world we get is pretty linear (which the others were somewhat, but a decent amount of ARPG exploration was introduced in the second game) with little to find off the beaten path.  Character building is simple, as skill choice isn't immensely important and works out to about 1.5 builds per character type (so not much replayability within a character type).  In previous games, we had skill choice mixed with a variety of spell choices you could equip at leisure (but, still had particular types that were affected by the skills).Party building, a feature that was pretty much a signature of the Dungeon Siege series, has been reduced to 2 characters at a time (which, if memory serves, was at least 4 in the other games).  They have introduced some interaction between characters as well as their liking or disliking your choices, but not with much depth (I barely noticed it).Visuals were actually really nice, especially on Anjali (who looks so awesome in archon form or with late-game armor, you feel a bit underwhelming as the other characters).  I gotta admit that.Combat was pretty fun too.  They've set up each character to have two types of combat stances, and switching between them can actually make for some versatile combat (and does allow you to make your build more interesting).Items are somewhat varied.  You find a lot of class-specific stuff, though (actually, I think most of it was).  You find a decent amount, but don't upgrade them extremely often.  Some people like that, some people don't; up to you.The story works but isn't extremely memorable.  That said, you see more if it and of your characters than in previous games.  So, better!Quests are pretty standard, but some do offer a degree of choice.  Again, not to a degree that makes it special, but it is a nice addition.The Bottom LineThe game isn't horrible, or even bad.  I CAN recommend it, because it can be some good fun.  Just don't expect anything amazing and pretend this is called Journey Into Dungeons or something (and is not part of the Dungeon Siege series) and you should have a good time.  It does very little that is special, but doesn't do things that are overtly wrong either.  It is a solid experience, but I couldn't bring myself to replay it.The Good+ Nice Visuals+ Fun Combat+ General Simplicity (if you like that sort of thing)The Bad- Small parties- Linear world- General Simplicity (if you don't like that sort of thing)Everything else is just plain neutral.

												It's the best Diablo-like experience I had in years (since Titan Quest). It plays really smoothly, landscapes and enemies change constantly, every other room you find/buy better gear for yourself and your companion, the game is also quite a looker! A single playthrough took me about 35 hours so that's also quite nice for a modern title. Different classes are very...different - I finished the game with a warrior, now I'm replaying it with Lara Croft (a rogue who uses double pistols) and it's already something else.Now for the warnings: it's consolised so make sure you play it using a 360 gamepad because it sucks with mouse and keyboard (I'm a PC gamer at heart but this didn't bother me at all, in fact a pad is implemented really good - all the menus function great, there are useful shortcuts too), it's also very different than the prequels so just treat it as a new title with no expectations ok? All in all it's very arcady - that's why I love it! That's all, quite a pleasant surprise!			"

												Fun enough for some mindless dungeon crawling until you realise that the game thinks itself an epic tale. Well that throws the mindless fighting out the window. Now I have to pay attention to what people say and go where they tell me -- or work out where the heck they want me to go. Loot drops constantly but it's never realy clear why one item should be chosen over the other, unless the numbers are significantly higher. Costumes never appear to be anything more than palette swaps and remixes of the initial outfit your character comes with. Thus, depending on who's playing, all enemies change the useless clothing which they carry in their pockets to suit who's coming to kill them. How nice! And what kind of loot game lacks a means to examine your character. You have to get the camera jammed in corner so you can see youself properly.			"

Although your companion is stupid, you can customize your companion to equip equipment as well, acting as if you have 2 players to control, but an AI is controlling 1 character while you control the other.SCORE: 7.5/10 Get this if you got friends to play with, otherwise not a good single-player game.

												Wish i never bought this. Linear world, VERY clunky combat, and surprisingly difficult, that scales WITH you, so if you get nice weapons and armor, the mobs hit you even harder. This game is just bad. Keep away.			"

												I should have known better after the Steam Dungeon Siege II pile of vomit, but due to pretty characters and hoping for a good game of this genre, I bought it. It's ridiculously, mind-numbingly linear and boring. You can ""level up to make your character unique"" but that's lies, you get exactly the same abilities and ""level up"" to create uniqueness is basically small % tweaks to your tiny handful of standard abilities. Furthermore, while having decent quality voice acting, it feels like they didn't care and weren't working together, like all the actors were reading their lines in a vacuum with no direction or understanding of the story or the game's tone. That alone kills the voices for me and breaks immersion, which due to the massive flaws of gameplay would be one of the only ways this game could hold my attention. *Sigh* Again the failure at multiplayer made me frustrated, since the main reason I got this game was to play with partners over LAN, but it's frustrating and unweildy at best, a sloppy alpha-quality afterthought at worst. Finally the gameplay. Not only is DS III slower/clunkier than other games of this type, but it's also hard in frustrating ways, not ""good"" ways. There's no learning curve, no in-game clues to learn from, and certainly nothing to be gained by ""being explorative"" and leveling up and finding hidden things before mind-numbingly boring and way-too-challenging boss fights. FYI devs, making you do the same really hard thing over and over again for 10-20 minutes just to chip away at a boss's healthbar that's 800-1000% too large is NOT the kind of challenging players want to go up against. I give this game a D plus, maybe a C minus overall. If you want a good gaming experience of this genre, or if you expect to mostly play multiplayer, avoid this game and spend your money on something better.			"

												Updating this review, so I really wanted to review on this game since I have very mixed feelings about the game. At first I really thought this game was unfairly reviewed bymost, actually to go back further I had many doubts about this game before buying it sinceit had alot of negative reviews and poorly judged, things like the camera is bad so yea I will give it a thumbs down... So I decided to buy it anyway and give it a try, I meanit was published by Square and honestly Square has never let me down 100% with any game itdecides to publish. After purchasing this game I played it an hour or more and gave it a temporary good review with a solid thumb up since I didn't notice anything really that badabout the game, I stopped playing it and decided to go serious on the game about a month laterwhich brings me to this updated review. After playing this game more deeply I started to noticethat first of all the game does look alot like the older Dungeon Siege games, it even hasthe same camera angles, also the story is really interesting and the quests are alot more funthan the previous titles. Also I noticed that it was impossible to get lost since the gamehas a navigation system, I played the game in hardcore all way through so it was very challenging and it made the whole game experience better. The level up and overall game mechanics are a mix of Torchlight and old Diablo, the game's mechanics are nothing like the previous titles. It didn't bother me at all that the loot and leveling up was made much more simple and that grinding didn't even exist in this game, honestly I embraced the change since everything else seemed to scream out Dungeon Siege, the game was made very simple, easy map navigation, simple quests, no grinding and very simple leveling up and skill learning, I honestly didn't mind any of that, also the controls seemed very confusing but plugging a controller fixed all of that. So I was there playing this game thinking to myself this is actually a very decent game it doesn't deserve all the bashing it has recieved, the graphics are excellent and I mean theyare very richly detailed honestly the best part about the game. The music and sounds may notbe the best ever but they are very decent too, the whole plot and story is really good it'sway better than DS1 plot and story, also the way it lets you take decisions and interacts withthe player is really nice, it may not change that much the outcome of the game but it givesextra stats depending on your choices. Like I mentioned I was playing this game in hardcore mode so it was challenging and made it way more fun IMO since sometimes I lowered the difficulty to see the change and it was a drastic change so I set it back to hardcore mode. So anyway yea I was there playing this game hours straight thinking wow this game is alot like Vagrant Story which is IMO the best game ever made by Square and the game I use to measure any other game that are hack and slash or similar to it including this game so... When did things start to go wrong? Well it's really simple, I was playing the game without any problem, made it almost to the end I even played the treasures of the sun expansion which IMO is really good I was even willing to give it a 9/10 since everything about the game was really good I couldn't even think of any flaws that this game could possibly have, in fact I was thinking maybe this game was affected  by the Mandela Effect, meaning this game was bad in some other reality but now it was fine. It was all I could honestly think of on why this game had bad reviews and then it happened... I reached the max level... I know the game was made very simple and designed to have no grinding  at all but really? Max level 30... just when I was about to finish the game that level cap just made me want to not even play anymore. I mean what was the purpose of even playing anymore if I could not level up? The world has not that much exploration, the loot is almost meaningless since you get whats strongest most of the time, the skills are preset but they need leveling I mean this game had no grinding to it except leveling up, it was the only thing that made me want to keep going, without the leveling this game was simply just a common RPG but lacking the deeper story and unique items and characters that make you want to play through a real RPG. The only thing that kept this game together was that... the leveling, but it had reached it's limit at level 30... I mean why!? This game had so much potential and it just all went down the drain with it's awful game mechanics, it's like buying a great chocolate cake with the best frosting and cherries on top you ever saw and then you take a bite just to notice the cake isn't even half baked, well this game is exactly that. It's just a shame honestly, anyway I will recommend this game but only if you get it on sale and want to play a very simple RPG game since this  game is not really hack and slash, the story and everything else except the controls is alot like the previous games.BTW I didn't have internet these past 5 months so this is a 5 month old review from the point it was posted.GRAPHICS: 10/10 Really amazing and very detailed, almost like Vagrant Story or Dark Souls.                Best part about the game IMO, even the swamp area which I always hated in                previous Dungeon Siege games was amazingly done in this gameSOUND:    8/10  Nice music and sounds not as memorable as Final Fantasy OST but good enough                 like any other decent RPG game, reminded me alot of Legacy of Kain series CONTROLS: 4/10  The controls are simply broken, just plug a gamepad and it will solve it,                that is if you get the gamepad to work properly, xinput should helpSTORY:    9/10  Really good story, lots of interaction with player and lots of cameos from                 previous titlesMECHANICS 1/10  This game couldn't decide what it wanted to be, if a common RPG or a hack and                slash dungeon crawler, the camera is fine even if others say it's broken it's                 exactly broken like the rest of the other Dungeon Siege titles, the level cap                kills the game totally if you ask me, also the multiplayer mode is broken,                only the host gains significant things and the screen is shared like Gauntlet                LegendsOVERALL  6.5/10 The DLC is really nice, the graphics and story are enticing just that is enough(BELOW AVERAGE) for most players, the music and sounds are nicely done nothing to get excited                 about though. The controls and the game mechanics, mostly the mechanics are                 simply broken, this game wanted to be everything and it failed, the game                 mechanics simply butchered the game, if you can overlook that it has those flaws                including no grinding, no significant loot, easy map navigation and broken                 multiplayer mode then this game is for you. Otherwise just get Dark Souls or even                 Vagrant story, it's a 17 year old game but even Vagrant Story does a better job.                The game is honestly not bad but it's not what the title of the game should be,                maybe with another title and better level cap this game would have shined.SCORE TABLE10     (Gift from Heaven): Vagrant Story, Dark Souls9.5    (Perfect): Shadow of the Colossus, Parasite Eve9      (Excellent): Torchlight 28.5    (Amazing): Darkstone8      (Great): Dungeon Siege 2, Blood Omen7.5    (Good): Dungeon Siege 1, Gauntlet Legends7      (Average): Diablo 26.5    (Below Average):<--- (DUNGEON SIEGE 3) 6      (Playable): Diablo 1 & 3, Torchlight 15.5    (Playable???): Eden Eternal5      (Unplayable)4.5    (Almost Refund)4      (Refund)3.5    (Unrankable)3      (Nameless)2.5    (Trash)2      (Abomination)1.5    (Radioactive waste): Tantra1      (Toxic Waste): Atulos  0			"

												Just finished this (on the easiest level).  Yes, I thought the interface was somewhat frustrating.  But the story was awesome, and games with random equipment of a zillion combinations are almost necessary to me.  The camera swirling around was kind of annoying, plus using the keyboard and mi♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ keys on occasion was too.  But heck, you are killing some pretty scary monsters, so I figure the dubious interface helps model the fact that we aren't all level 30 warriors with super agility.I did have to cheat a bit to beat the tougher bosses, that is look up which techniques work well.  Which is good, the game's difficulty was appropriate for me.  I would recommend this game to RPG fans, but suggest a demo if you are picky about camera views and so on.  Comparing this to DS I and II - I liked the story line better, but the interface was kind of sketchy as noted.  I felt more like I was following the character around from behind, as opposed to DS1 and DS2 where it seemed you were overhead like a god of some sort.			"

												SP is mediocre at best with its boring leveling system and attempt at making a good story line in a series that has never focused on SP or story prior to this installment. Something was taken from my friends and I with the release of this game. we used to be able to spend entire weekends Smashing thru goblin caves and leveling our characters as we see fit. now we are congested to the same camera as if we were still playing some Gauntlet game for nintendo 64, and re-issuing our points each time our generic cookie cutter characters die.Square was once my favorite game Dev. Now they are a publisher known for defficating all-over good game series and hopefully dont put thier hands in just cause 3 and Arkham city.			"

												Although this 3rd installment of the series is not by the traditional studio that started it, they managed to keep it intact for the most part. Satsfying combat mechanics, realistic plotline, fast paced and generally fun to play. The main downside in this game is the lack of variation, the relative short playtime until completion and generally doesn't honor the epic lands as they were depicted in DS1 or 2. Overall, i'd reccomend it if you're fan of the series, but overall it felt too short and linear at times.			"

												Dungeon Siege III is the third game byu the Dungeon Siege franchise developed by Square Enix. Let me just start by saying that i probable have player more than 80 % of Square Enix tittles and i love their games so much!Graphics/Art: The graphics are smooth and the game is optimized well so it can play on older devices aswell. The enviroment is very good (not the best) but very enjoyable and the cutscenes are awesome aswell. There ae not much to be said about the raphics of the games, but certainly it is a big improvment from its predecessors. Soundtracks help you get in the mood of action as they feature a medieval/action/epic rythm.Plot: The storyline was very good and interesting. As a classic RPG you have to complete quests to move on through the game. Those quests can be main storyline or substory quests. In general there is nothing hard about getting the flow of the game as it is very specific on what you have to do and where you have to go. You dont really have to search around for what you have to do, you just follow the indicator. In general for a fan oof the series its a very satisfying game as you even explore and area directly related from the first game of the series which is awesome if youve been there before!Gameplay: As a classic RPG you have the overwatch camera where you see a fixed amount of map and you character which is a little bit annoying because you would get a whole new experiense if you had a different camera. The movement is simple and so are the attack patterns. Each player has 2 combat modes that that one focuses on single target attacks and the other focuses on AOE attacks. Each mode has different skills and abilities. In general the gameplay is interesting and intense some times as the game on the hard difficulty is very hard, almost impossible to complete and the only way of doing so is by playing online with other 3 players. Each boss you fight offers you a different experiense as you have to play by a specific way to defeat each. In general each character offers you a very different experiense, defensive / offensive or close range / ranged attacks.If you get this game at a daily offer its a pretty sweet deal in my opinion.

												I don't understand the hate for Dungeon Siege III; In my personal opinion if you like a little bit more action in your RPGs this is it for you. I've only played it for a few minutes and I found it very easy to get into. Probably inspired by other successful RPGs it's a tad bit different from the previous games but change isn't bad. If you like action RPGs this game is for you. If you like a customizable open-world story type of RPG; then this isn't the game for you.This game is more linear from what I've played so far.

												Not sure why so many people be hating on this game. I was a die hard fan of DS1 and I really enjoyed this game. They bring in all the lore from the first one. It is 150 years later, but the story line is still great. I'm assuming that any bad reviews are coming from people who havent played more than an hour of the game or really suck at the new gameplay. They just a bunch of pansies. It does take some pratice to work the camera and hotkeys properly, but once you do it is easy to enjoy the game. I played as Katarina my first time through and had no problems once I figured everything out. The more melee style characters may be more difficult. I was definitely more disappointed with DS2. This one was a nice surprise, I went in expected to be disappointed. Definitely is an underrated game. I recommend you give it a chance.			"

												Short version: This is a competent and enjoyable ""Diablo clone"". Certainly worth the timeIt has some interesting places, a story decent enough you don't just roll your eyes and quit it (Yes, that would be you, Lords of Shadow. Yours didn't last 3 maps). It has a lot of what I emember being optional content and nice mechanics. Guess a testament to how well it was made is that I finished it once and still wanted to have another go with a different character AND see how it plays out with a party. So yeah.. worth the monies, worth the times, would play it again (especially now it's been quite a while and I've forgot most details)			"

												Graphically beautiful but with clunky controls. Dungeon Siege III is a vast departure from the long in depth story of Dungeon Siege 1 + 2. Dungeon Siege III is a focused linear story line played in cutscene and with quick gameplay. The characterization is well done but of the 4 player character choices it is clear that Lucas and Anjali have the advantage. A decent hack and slash for the 6-10 hours it would take to finish.  Worth the purchase on Steam Sale if you are looking for an experience similar to  Diablo a time constraint.			"

												First, a warning: This game is NOTHING like DS1 or 2. Nothing at all. If you were expecting a party-based Diablolike, you won't find it. Obsidian took DS3 in a totally different direction. The random loot/mobs has been watered down, the control over your party's development has been watered down, your ability to control your party itself has been limited, and your progression and potential has been reworked into linear specialization of your basic skills. When you get over the shock of realizing you're playing a game that's NOT really a DS title, you realize the game stands well on its own. It has a certain charm in the combat, the characters are credible and engaging, and the story is interesting. DS3 should be approached more like The Last Remnant and less like Diablo. Play it for the story and you won't be disappointed... even if the lack of character customization and the limited progression choices hamper replay value.Worth checking out the demo before hitting the Buy button.

												In many ways, this is better than Diablo 3.  OMG!  Yes I said it!  It feels like a game made in this decade and not in the 90's.  I could change the camera angle, I played it with a controller, there were actual cutscenes with dialog not just text bubbles, my character talked!  My companions were the other heroes I didn't pick.  I got to shape the world depending on my actions (kill or save a guy, free or imprison another guy, etc) so it had replayability and your choices mattered.  The classes were fun, I played the chick with the gun.  Cool abilities.  Cool story.  The game had different endings.  It's really worth playing and I enjoyed it much more than Diablo 3.   I give this game 4 out of 5 Whitestars.			"

												I haven't actually played the first two games but from what I've heard they were awesome. DS III is abit different from what I've played before but I like it nonetheless, the story is interesting and it wasn't at all hard to get used to the whole idea of the gameplay. I won't say that it is one of my favourite games of all times because... well it isn't :P it does keep you entertained though so if you have nothing else to do give it a try :D:			"

												Don't listen to gaming magazines or websites. Dungeon Siege 3 is worth the money. With four characters to play through as, there's tons of replay value. It might seem like a Dragon Age/Mass Effect clone, and there are similarities. The story drags a little at first, and there aren't any customizable controls, which can be frustrating, especially for new players. But the second half of the story is where DS3 shines. The ending, depenant on your choices, is superb.			"

												i have been playing the dungeon siege series since the first one for pc. and the 2nd one, and the bonus content for 2. this one number 3 is a good game with great potential. however theres a few very negative features, or lack there-of. one is the camera angle which keeps zoning me in or out to the point at which i cannot see where the boss is nor my character in relation to the boss, which makes for harder fights than they actually are. and the other thing that really bugs me is all the new stats that are avaiable, warding/retribution/vampire...etc etc. they are in themselves self explanitory for the most part. however without the ability to mouse over for description or click for... it makes it rather annoying trying to figure out which stats to stack for. example: block, L2 is the block button however there is a ability in your tree which increases your block. now does that increase the block amount? or does it make it an auto block without having to use the L2 block button? retribution, can mean any number of things as far as a stat is concerned, however instead of having to look each and every stat up online it would be nice to be able to have them detailed in game. overall this is a pretty decent game esp. like me you have been playing this series since the begining, and again it has great potential to be even better. just seems like the devs got a lil' lazy in the details category on this title.

FFS, it is a 3d game acting like a 1d game, always looking at the ground. Mouse wheel seems to do some sort of zoom in / out, but it fails to let you look at the horizon.With it forever pointing at the ground and not allowing you to zoom out to any real extent, it is impossible to tell if you are approaching enemies until after they have already started attacking you. Sure, you can run away and come back, but why would any game force this on you as a constant way of playing!If you are a fan of this type of game, get it!			"

PS. this game might be somewhat decent if you play alone.. but for the love of ketchup do not play this with you're friends.			"

												Lots of folks giving it negative review because it doesn't resemble the previous DS games. True, this game is vastly different then anything before. This however isn't a good argument to give this game a bad review, I even prefer games that try out something new, even if it means completely changing the game mechanics.  That being said, the current game has horrendous character controls, took me forever to figure out how to interact properly in combat. Lot of combat abilities used require of you to point your mouse in the direction you want them cast. In a bigger fight, with lots of mobs and numerous particle effects I'd constantly kept losing sight of pointer and would end up casting stuff in direction where there were no mobs or only a few of them. Quite frustrating. Too many stats and too generic gear that made gearing up so frustrating and a huge waste of time.Game storyline, while having an interesting backbone, appears to have been written by a 12 year old. While it was interesting to revisit some of the locations from original DS, the NPCs and playable characters & companions are so bleak with robot like interactions that made each convo in the game extremely cringy. You're also given an illusion of choice through dialogue, but in reality the development of events in the game aren't affected at all. These 'choices' only affect the final cutscene after you finish the game and 'influence' you gain with your companions (give you some small passive stat boosting perk).Now, a few things I did like is that game went in another direction. Completely revamped, you no longer drag entire army with you, instead you duo the game with one of 3 companions you get. Each companion/playable character is unique and has vastly different abilities from the other 3. This makes for an interesting experience, trying to figure out which combo is best for your play style. Also each char has two different stances, usually one for single mob fights (boss fights usually) and one for group pulls. Game also introduces transmuting and essences, which allow you to mend your gear and add one of 5 possible stats to your gear (costs a bit, but usually worth it, especially in final act of the storyline).My final score for the game would be 2.5 out of 5, though you could say I'm biased. I really loved the original DS, but the 3rd installment as a standalone game isn't an RPG at all but a quickly made hack n slash, and not a good one.			"

												This game is one i thoroughly enjoyed. However, i am a fan of the genre of dungeon crawler. If you are not then you need not buy this game. It follows the path of every Dungeon game that has come before it. For those that are you find a very well polished experience. The graphics are sharp, the gameplay is standard, and the story intriguing. My only complaint would be the somewhat unbalanced form the 4 players you choose from have. The knight and the ranger are your best choice, and your only choice is you play alone. If you desire to play the other 2 characters. Then you need to be in a party as they are more geared toward helping, or assist party members than stand alone ones. Although this game is aimed toward multi play it shouldnt be neccasary. Complaint aside i enjoyed my time, and look foward to completeing this game again. Although i might enjoy it more with another to play with.			"

Have to say one of the best RPG experience I ever play, If you're a fan of DS I or II don't even bother with the storyline, just go with the flow and enjoy the gameplay if you're into ARPG. But the game also have a flaw to be honest, I Rage and QQ while battling Jayne over her Overpowered move and teleportation, she is even harder and much more irritating than the final boss, This has to be the poor build boss to be honest, just a poor disappointment. But if I want to recommend this game? I would say yes, But the score that I willing to give is 7.5/10			"

												Отличная игра.Одна из лучших ARPG, что мне доводилось играть.По сравнению с предыдущими частями - так и вовсе лучшая.Да, в наличии минусы: - однообразные сражения. Схема, которая позволяет побеждать разные виды и группы противников, вырабатывается сама собой, и довольно быстро. В процессе прохождения некоторой локации, она только оттачивается. С боссами - примерно то же самое.- небольшая вариативность прокачки персонажей. Не уверен, насколько это минус. Ведь если вы играете за бойца - вы и качать его будете в бойца, так ведь? Остается лишь вопрос лучшего подбора скиллов.- малое разнообразие врагов. То есть, некоторые типы будут преследовать вас всю игру. У некоторых просто поменяются скины. В целом, уникальных противников - разве что автоматоны.- малый размер локаций. Тут нечего даже и добавить - так и есть.- снаряжение. Огромное количество одинаковых предметов, один из которых дает +1 к оглушению, другой +1 к вампиризму.- интеллект напарника. Его нет :)Но. В наличии и плюсы:- разработчик. Я немало удивился, когда узнал, что DS 3 делали Obsidian. Но они сделали все, чего мне хотелось - сюжет, лор, диалоги, побочные квесты, выбор (и местами весьма непростой), который при всем при том влияет на историю.- динамика боев. Уж очень мне понравилась сама система. Да, она проста, зато низок порог вхождения. Но она и смотрится неплохо, и играется приятно, особенно на контроллере.- режим кооперативного прохождения. Еще не пробовал, но, думается мне, компанией как всегда будет еще веселее.- сложность. Даже на среднем уровне сложности, некоторые бои могут заставлять ваши руки до хруста сжимать контроллер.- финальный ролик. В котором вам расскажут последствия всех принятых вами решений.И вроде бы как минусов набралось больше. Туда ведь можно еще впихнуть слабый дизайн, как большинства локаций, так и персонажей и снаряжения. Графику, которая серединка на половинку. Невнятность большинства образов NPC.Но. Dungeon Siege 3 по-прежнему останется игрой, которая глубоко тронула меня. Простая в освоении, она все же не стесняется испытывать игрока. Невзрачная на вид, она несет в себе какую-то простую искренность. Будучи игрой про уничтожение полчищ врагов Легиона, она заставляет принимать решения и их последствия. История, в которую хочется верить. Одна из тех битв, которая оставляет след. Конец, который требует продолжения.P.S: и вот еще что. Я очень рад, что третья часть не похожа на первые две.			"

												Has nothing to do with a good action RPG-game. The controls are totally designed for a controller pad and not for a classic mouse + keyboard setting. It feels very iffy and unprecise. Also the way you deveolpe your character is even more linear than in Diablo 3 after release. You just take every skill at the end - because there arent much anyway - and then just choose between 2 upgrade options. There is no real freedom in that game at all, but this is what defines a good RPG. I dont mean freedom story-wise that isnt really necessary, as linear stories can be as good as non-linear. But the way you approach that game in terms of gameplay is the worst I've seen in years. I payed 3 Euros for it at the Humble store and it was still too much money for a that game. Casual console gamers maybe could enjoy this but this game should have nevert been ported to the PC. "

												Developed by Obsidian and published by Square Enix; Dungeon Siege 3 is a very good action loot oriented rpg. Streamlined compared to it's predecessors but surprisingly polished and littered with the influence of Square. The original penned yarn and accompanied lore are well versed and played out through npc interaction and discovery.  The game's art direction and lighting are striking and the voice acting is suffcient.  The companion AI, one choosen from a set of 3 as the story evolves, can be customized though not directly controlled and can be swapped but not during combat. Skill trees have been replaced with an abilitiy / profiency system though this system does not provide the level of customization seen in similiar games with extensive skill trees. To compensate for the lack of health or mana potions mana regen occurs though battle and health regen occurs though the use of abilities.  PC controls have been long since patched but the controller implementation is near perfect.			"

												For an action game, it's not a bad title. It's just pretty average.The only thing in common with DS1/DS2 is the name. The game is quite different. Previous game had more freedom for building characters, more options and more spells.Here every character has a fixed role and althought they can have 2 different modes with different skills, the mages in previous version has a lot more spells avaible.DS1-2: click on a monster until it's dead.DS3: smash buttons until the monster is dead. The number of options during fights are limited and the AI can be pretty dumb at some time.The ennemy attacks only the player, it never focuses on the frendly AI. I died a lot because of this concentrated fire on me.Equipment: in this game, the stuff you find almost always give bonus to some stats and penalities to others. Mostly because of this, most of the stuff I've found was garbage and felt like a waste of time to gather it.Conclusion: it is worth a try if you can get it in a bundle with DS1 AND DS2. Otherwise, I would not really recommand it. Also, women are suggestively dressed and I found this unappriopriate.			"

												Taken on it's own merits the story is interesting, the playable characters are fun, and the combat handles well while keeping the fights difficult.But do NOT expect Dungeon Siege 3 to be like 1 and 2. I am highly annoyed that this is a console port, and would be a great game if not for my expectation of what a Dungeon Siege title should be.The multiplayer is more like Fable 2 than your typical dungeon crawler. You could even compare it to Hunter: The Reckoning or Marvel Ultimate Alliance. The biggest weakness here is really that the camera locks your team into a small area of movement on screen while enemies will spawn and attack outside of it. You need to move together, while still blocking and dodging, in order to engage targets.It's no wonder why you only get the single player versions of DS1 and 2 when you buy this, LAN either of those 2 games and you will have a vastly improved multiplayer experience...

												This is a game that reminds us why certain games do better on PC and not on console due to their specific genre related contents. Unlike Dungeon Siege I and II, this game is no where near what it could've been. Anyone who played Dragon Age Origin and then played Dragon Age II would immediately realize that a game that is built to be big, beautiful and content intensive should be put on pc only. Dragon Age II's epic failure proved why DA II should've been on PC. This game, in an attempt to please the console players (like DA II), is a port that failed to provided the mentioned contents, that PC players would otherwise expect. In other words:THIS GAME IS AN EPIC FAILURE IN THE FRANCHISE THAT WE KNOW AS DUNGEON SIEGE. If you see a very low price drop, get it. Otherwise, save your money.			"

												Dungeon siege 3 is a tricky one. Its not like the previous games, it has issues, and the PC port has its own issues. Still, I would tenetively recommend it. If you can get past quality of life issues, there is a solid basis here. It feels rushed honestly, this seems like it was almost an excellent game. It took me about 19.5 hours to beat everything with one character, first run.The plot is good, with exceptionally well written dialogue and interesting characters. It brings to mind a much larger lore and makes the world feel like it retains a lot of mysteries. You always feel like you are playing someone important, regardless of the character you choose. The different sections all feel a bit too unrelated though. It comes toghether, but your actions in each area mostly only serve the story of that area.Graphically the game is still attractive 4 years since its release. Character models in particular look very nice. Though the selection of armors available is a bit small. The locations are diverse and all interesting, each with their own palette.Combat is pretty good, your character has a small set of abilities to use, 3 each in 3 different stances. Every one of them is useful, and you can customize them further with special character talents and proficiencies. The basics of combat are nice, with attacks building up your bar for special abilities. Special abilities and taking damage build up a bar used for enhanced specials and support abilities. This keeps you engaging enemies and rewards being active. There are a few viable ways to play each character, and each of them feels unique. There are downsides. The stats are a bit confusing, you will probably need to look online to see exactly what stats like 'warding' or 'retribution' do. This adds a bit of confusion to already rather dull loot, you will pick up a lot of items, but nothing is exciting. Its just more damage, more defense or more of one of the 'chaos' proc effects. Your AI partner holds their own okay, they make decent, if incosistent use of their abilities. However, when they need to revive you its a crapshoot, sometimes they run into an enemy, or stand in a pit of fire trying in vein to run towards your corpse.The biggest issues the game has are all minor anoyances. Many, many minor annoyances. The UI was clearly designed for consoles, and while you can click through the menus, they are really inefficient at displaying information. Bizzarely, if you open up the equipment menu with the F key (or any other shortcutted menu) you cannot return to the main character menu, you have to manually exit out and then open it with its own hotkey. The movement and camera can also be a bit strange, and several times I was killed when I became stuck in a corner or an ability didn't activate. It also takes some finger juggling to activate your enhanced abilities, holding shift and punching in a number takes some getting used to. I never bothered with an enhanced support ability, but I suppose that would be space+shift+[1,2 or3]. Finally, and absolutely most confusingly, there only a minimap on your HUD, no dedicated maps. This is probably the biggest single problem I had with the game, and it makes finding your way to certain quests a guessing game until you figure out everything's locations.Overall dungeon siege III is a game that hurts from a transition to consoles. Even so, there is fun to be had, and I enjoyed it enough that I would recommend it to those who can ignore some rough spots. The game feels rushed, but the ideas behind it are solid, as is the story. I know this installment did not sell well, but I would like to see it built upon for a future release.			"

												TL;DR: Mostly Dungeon Siege in name only. The setting is good, the skill system is lacking. Slightly above mediocre, give it a try.Dungeon Siege 3 is an odd one. It got more to do with the first DS game than DS2 ever did, and at the same time, has almost nothing of what made us love those two games.First of all, DS3 is set in Ebh several decades after the Seck incursion from the first game. DS3 contain enough tidbits of lore to make this connection plausible, and you even visit several places from the original game. It seems to me that Obsidian took care to tie DS3 in with the first game, unlike DS2, which is set on another part of Aranna. The plot revolves around events and characters related to the 10th Legion (which founded the Kingdom of Ebh in the first game).The story is alright, even if character development and backstory is a bit wonky. All the player characters are desendants of the 10th Legion (almost all of them, at least), but I feel Obsidian could have fleshed out this part better, or even added  more information into the game. I felt especially one of the party members could've gotten a better backstory. She was interesting to be sure, but Obsidian did not act on it.Graphics and performance for a four years old game is good. The visual effects from attacks, spells and powers look pretty good.I got two major gripes with Dungeon Siege 3:- The party system: You can only have two party members at any given time. You and one of the other three. Even if you can switch whenever you like, it simply isn't a Dungeon Siege game without the possibility of a large party. To make this even more irritating, the other two companions that you don't bring along is nowhere to be found. At least they could wait for you at the HQ or something, but no, they are *with* your party, without being there.- Skills, powers and (lack of) spells:The original DS had no powers, only regular attacks and a huge amount spells. DS2 fleshed out this system significantly, with fewer spells but a load of powers for each class, which greatly improved replayability and customization. DS3 removed all spells. Instead, each of the four classes got 9 powers/abilities (the mage abilites look like spells, at least) tied to a ""focus bar"". Each ability have two additional improvements which you choose on level up.What we are left with, is a system with minimal customization, 9 powers for each character, several of those which are almost identical, and not a lot of reason to replay the game. Too bad. It gets a bit old when you use the same two or three powers throughout the entire game. Reinhart Manx is one of the most powerful party members, but for a mage, his arsenal of powers is somewhat lacking.All in all, I liked the game, but it could have been so much more. It's cheap, give it a try.Edit: Finished the DLC as well. It is actually surprisingly good, and worth buying. Adds a higher level cap, a whole new area (Aranoi desert) and a good storyline. Not the longest DLC ever, but it gives you a few hours of fun.			"

												There is no autosave... if you die, I hope you saved recently. I mean come on, I understand games where when you die you get pushed back a bit, or lose some gold or w/e, but no. In this game if you die your character, that means your levels your items all the abilites and talents, everything that you have done since the last time you used a save location is lost. Now there are save locations literally everywhere, but nowhere does it say that you can lose hours of play by simply not saving because your playing... thats what atosaves are for... ffs.			"

												Juego de rol facilongo entretenido se puede llegar a decir, divertido porque no, pero.......como es la tercer parte de una saga tengo que decir que desiluciono completamente. Que paso aca??? si ya se lo agarro otro pero no importa cambiaron completamente lo que es Dungeon Siege. Si fuera un juego aparte de otro nombre que no tenga conexion con ninguno seria un positivo aceptable, pero aca lamentablemente tengo que evaluar de acuerdo a la comparativa que tengo del 1 y 2, y me da pena decir que este juego es totalmente distinto a los clasicos dungeon siege. Si van a hacer esto cambiale el nombre....si ya se que lo hacen para los que vienen compren como unos giles que somos...Bad move...			"

I would have been fine with paying full price for it. It seems most of these negative reviews are from people who have played the first 2 games. I have not. I bought the second one when i bought this but i wanted to play this one first.                      I have been looking for a solid RPG that was not as in depth and time consumming as WOW or Skyrim and i am so happy i found this game, cant wait to start the second one.			"

												This game is much harder the Diablo 3.  Sure, Diablo 3 has more chaos and effects on-screen, but it just isn't that demanding in terms of tactics (unless you go up several Torment levels).  Dungeon Siege III demands that you react quickly and use both fightings modes with their associated abilities properly.But beware, just like Diablo, there's a bit of grinding involved, especially if you want better gear.Basically, if you like Diablo 3 but wish it required a little more skill, then I highly recommend Dungeon Siege III.

												For those who are here for a DS game can leave, for those who are here for just another game do try it out. The main reason why its getting so many negative reviews is because of this game not being like the previous DS series. It still has a great story and a decent ARPG while having good graphics. Yes there are ofcourse cons like getting used to controls and camera but if you want to say bad about this game about its bad mechanics, go try playing darksouls2 on pc without a controller >.< if you can live through the start of getting around then it really is a enjoying game.All games have flaws but stop judgeing a book by its cover, just cause its a DS series game doesnt mean that if it doesnt continue the series good it stops being a game. Even most of the negative reviewers writing i quit the game in 5 mins or something still have played over 10h. HOW CAN YOU PLAY SOMETHING YOU HATE OVER 10H!?			"

												The game is tight pipe run which is ""out"" now at 2015. The game is playable after fixing the controls: wasd with move left and move right, and hold right mouse button for camera rotation. Combat is still akward: just spam click the screen without proper aiming due that I kite and dodge a lot. The view is limited in distance, giving me a closed space anxiety. Cannot view player character in detail, for screenshots. Cannot preview clothes/armor in equipment window or in shop. I succeeded to buy expensive armor that Katarina cannot wear without the game warning me prior purchase.			"

												Incredibly bug-free for an Obsidian game, but it's also rather generic and not terribly compelling compared to their usual offerings. I made it through most of the game enjoying it more than not, but I realized that I wasn't actually looking forward to it between play sessions. I'm not sure if I burned myself out on side quests or it's just mediocre, but I'm guessing some of both. Strangely for an ARPG, seems to be designed with a controller in mind. Only weakly recommended. Unless you've completely exhausted the genre, you can probably find a game in it that does something more interesting to spend your time with.			"

												Nothing alike the previous DS titles + handles much better w a gamepad. Ally AI is stupid (but u can solo thnkfully) and the co-op works in a weird way (camera + saves) but u get used 2 it eventually. Other than that this is a solid title. Tech looks impressive and is 100% stable + the story & dialogue options are suprisingly good 4 a H&S title; desicions influence parts of the game. Combat mechanics are also good and force u to be constantly active (must block | roll 24/7, mana regens on hit,etc).Loot diversity could be better uniques look awesome however. Each of the 4 chars plays diffirently and the game is sadistically hard on Hardcore diff. All in all if you want a co-op based, challenging H&S title with engaging combat, great visuals and an interesting story then this is right up your alley.			"

												I haven't played the first two of this series, and the only similar game I can compare it to is Blizzard's Diablo. In comparison to that I find this game to be acceptable. The way some negative reviews go on about the lack of story and horrible gameplay mechanics, you would think they are comparing it to Baldur's Gate. The earlier Dungeon Siege games have never been compared to Baldur's Gate so I'm assuming they are nowhere as complex and engaging. With that in mind this game in itself may not be a great RPG, nor an improvement over the older series installments, but it's a decent game that I would recommend to other Diablo players who prize gameplay over plot.Also, the camera controls are fully customizable so if a player has issues with it, they must be the type of player who only plays on default settings. I never play on default so my game plays how I want it.			"

												Dungeon Siege III is by no means a great game, particularly in light of the drastic changes that make this entry to the series a sharp departure from its superior predecessors. But that tart treatment is not the whole story. The truth is that DS3 is simply a fun game to play, particularly with friends, even if it's not a very good one. It's quick to pick up, easy to engage and hooks you with the classic ARPG formula: leveling, talents and gear upgrades!With the entire Dungeon Siege franchise bundled for less than $20 these days, it's hard not to come home with this one in tow.

												Dungeon Siege 3 is, IMO, 3/5 stars. The original Dungeon Siege franchise used to be a party based, hack/slash game that focused on highly customizable character and party selections;  however, the latest installment was a blatant clone of the Diablo franchise, without the strengths that Diablo has. While it is still a strong installment, it does not live up to the expectations or any of the potential that the release had.The main problem is that the game play was far easier than any prior Dungeon Siege or Diablo game, and only had a few difficult parts.  While the character's health was generally low and you can only define Katarina as ""squishy,"" the dodging function was exceptionally overpowered.  Once I got a good tempo while playing Katarina, I spent more time dodging than anything else. Due to the game's auto-target system, it was exceptionally easy to dodge, dodge, face in the general direction of your target, shoot, dodge.  While this removed most, if not all, of the difficulty of the game, it added a level of difficulty created by the pure frustration of changing targets.  Once the game selected a target, it was usually counter productive to attempt to change to a more desirable target than it was to simply kill all the least desirable targets to get to your intended target.The second issue was that the story was completely unengaging.The UI was cumbersome, and counterintuitive.Finally, the exact way stats affected your character were never defined, leaving the power gamer in me screaming for satisfaction.It's a clear step-down from the original Dungeon Sieges in almost every way, but it is very similar to the Diablo franchise now. The original Dungeon Sieges were hack/slashes, but were party based and unique enough to stand apart.  If you don't have some other game to occupy your time, DS3 is an awesome game. However, don't go in expecting something comparable to DS 1 or 2. Expect another Diablo clone and while it is a pretty good clone, no clone is comparable to the original.			"

												Just finnished this game and DLC with someone else. This game has an really really good stoyline, good voice acting for all of the quests, good look along with tons of items to loot. The most eye catching aspect about this game is that as you play this game you have to make choices that effect how the story plays out. Usualy the choices have to do with someone's fate or what action should be taken. Combined with the voice acting this is very impressive. Over all a really good RPG game, looking forward to the other DLC that is sure to come for this game.The only down sides is that it is not what I would call an open world and in multi-player the ""3 legged race"" feel with the camara takes getting used too. But if you ignore thoes two things this is a game that is worth you time. Fully say to anyone who likes the screen shots to get this game.BTW..... Got 57% of the achivements, see if you can beat that.			"

												Forgoten phenomen.It's Obsidian bug free game,In the world of hack'n'slash game but with more story focused.Which make it a bit strange (or bit off).And combat is more than servicable. Believe or not, it's playable with kb+m (keyboard and mouse). The only thing that reallly irritated me was targeting system. Pointing mouse cursor at enemy and pressing LMB, like in evey hack'n'slash, does not work every time and instead - attack something else (barrels, minions etc.).Some fights are unbalanced (not only for Hardcore difficulty), forced me (only once, on Hardcore mind you) to use trainer. I'm talking about Master Thief. You're supposed to dodge missles and focus on the boss.What you really do is rollin-rollin-rolling-rollin-die. And borked targeting system also doesn't help here...I count it as cRPG because it's better than other overrated AAAArpgs, but because it's Obsidian game it don't get much praise.			"

												This game gets a 9/10 for me, it got nice graphics plus very detailed physics, like items that move they way the should in the background, you can walk towards some chains and they will get pushed by your character (as they should). The game have a decent amount of spells, could maybe be like 5 more or something to each character, but still good with not so much to choose from (can get confusing with alot of spells). The quests have a nice story line, and they managed to make the side quests more well made, that you do a side quest butt you still fight a boss that give you great loot, you sometimes even get to a pace that you probably think is a main story place, but its not.All the background content is well made and placed for it to flow in with the environment.The times in quests were you get options on how you want to do things, like spare or kill someone and that makes it different for you in the game.Only downsides that I can come up with is that you share the same screen (when you play with a friend), it would have been more fun if there were 2 separated screens, though in this shared screen way you get more ""team play"".Great game, recommend to anyone that like rpg's!

												I never played DS1 or DS2 so based on my unbiased opinion, this game is not as bad as other people seems to say. It's a decent action RPG which has a pretty linear story and location. The map style reminds me of Dragon Age 2, although not as pretty. The story is intriguing and the combat is okay, can be hard when 20 mobs are ganging up on you though.I agree that the camera is quite horrible however there are some camera fix available floating in the internet if you bother to search for it.Overall it's a game that I don't mind playing 7/10			"

												This game, ah, this game! It's not a bad game.Dungeon Siege 3 is not like its predecessors. Overburdened with strange, clunky PC controls and a horrible interface, despite its shortcomings, DS3 is a really competent Action RPG that deviates from the mold of its two older siblings and does its own thing to its own fault, since it disappointed a lot of people by not being... well, too much like a Dungeon Siege game.But isn't it? I believe it actually is. There's loot drops, there's plenty of places to go (though most of them consist of narrower hallways, something it got from Dungeon Siege 2), and its combat system, while strange and quirky, is fun and cathartic.No, you can't customize your character as you could before, but the characters you can choose from are classic archetypes of the characters we used to use in previous games anyway, so I don't know what the issue is. You always just stuck with a single specialization anyway or your character would not have turned out very good...Anyways, this game suffered a mixed reception because it carried the name Dungeon Siege, and it wasn't the same Dungeon Siege game that people remembered and thought this game would be. Instead, it is a relatively competent action RPG with clunky controls... but still, I think it's worthy of praise for what it has done - not worthy of scorn for what it could have been.			"

												You need to play this one alone or with three other people and have yourself a controller to fully enjoy the game.It's horrendous to try to play Multiplayer as 2 or 3 people, and incredibly confusing for whatever reason until you hit all four.That aside, it's still a very fun, simple yet challenging dungeon crawler with a decent story.Don't pick this game up and expect it to be anything like the original 2 Dungeon Siege games! Play style is no longer the above dungeon crawler but instead a third-person crawler with a lot less customization. Each character has their own set of skills that can't be changed.			"

												This game has its faults, like a clunky inventory, an inefficient notification system, and also forcing you to rebind your keys before getting into the game, but somehow this game still holds enough polish to shine. The gameplay is a great, hack and slash dungeon crawler. This adventure is also a fair example of how straightforward RPGs can still tell great stories without a load of optional, distracting, inconsequential side quests that require you to go out of your way and stray far from the main storyline. The land of Ehb is a rich and colourful one that more people should take a chance to explore.			"

												首先，如果你想玩这款游戏，请自备手柄，至少是360规格的。用键盘玩容易蛋碎。确实是很不错的一款作品，可以算是RPG类的ACT，因为太考验格挡和躲避技巧了，用战士前期打BOSS真的只有被一套秒的料，法师什么的可能更脆。 所以此款游戏的难度相对来说还是很高的，建议打穿过DMC系列作品的人再来玩=-= 这可和D3， T2这类传统刷刷刷不一样。游戏的人设很喜欢~ 各种养眼，DLC也很有节操。恩就是这样。值得一玩，手残慎玩。			"

												I can't even play this game and that's saying something. If you are someone with ANY cognitive or physical challenges or even frustrated by utter incompetence--do not waste your money on this game.The FOV is atrocious. The camera is wonkier than handing a toddler your video cam and asking him to film his birthday party. I found the controller stuttered and skidded, crashing my character into walls, barrels etc. for no apparent reason. The camera won't do anything other than overhead unless the stars are in the right configuration and the moon is full so you can't see a demmed thing that's coming from RIGHT IN FRONT OF YOU. Hello? If they wanted a Diablo-type top-down the reason that worked was the FOV was a large area. It's like they couldn't make up their minds what they were going for, here.The lighting is grim. It's hard to see anything.The characters choices are ridiculous. Puleeze, a medieval rogue with GUNS? There's no clear explanations of which spells do what for the mage. It's like someone in the concepts department yelled ""Hey! Nobody ever did THIS before!!!"" [Well yeah, they did, and they did it much better--I'm looking at YOU, Arcanum]The dialogue was mailed in by someone who flunked their first year in college lit and the voice acting caused my dog to chase my eyeballs across the floor when they fell out from rolling so hard. It wasn't even cheesy enough to be amusing. I can get past a few poor NPC performances and some self-deprecating cheese but not just plain bad.I have no idea what the story is about  because the game is virtually unplayable. The controls are ludicrous, unclear and can't be re-mapped for easier playability or to accomodate physical challenges or disabilities.It's been a decade or more since I played the first two so I'm not basing this on my fond memories since senility has set in...although I recall them as entertaining and feeding a donkey some daggers. I'm basing this on the utter crapfest of how this game was put together for playability.Run for your lives!			"

												Diablo. You see what I mean? Yes, exactly, this game has certain traits that make it similar to Blizzard's ancient legacy. I didn't really expect that even modern games will still be influenced by it. Of course, it does not mean that this one has old-fashioned pixelized graphics or something - no, the visual part of it is nice. I speak of the general idea that stands behind it, and the gameplay peculiarities. It's rather good, though. I'm a bit tired of open-world RPGs by now, and I was seeking for something with a fine, lengthy, and entertaining main quest. I can say, that's something I found. 18 hours of gameplay is a decent result for a contemporary product, and I still have 3 more characters to study and experience.What I disliked was the camera management. It offers 3rd person view only; it's suitable when you are surrounded by enemies, but generally I hate looking into the ground instead of seeing what is in front of my character. That's especially tiresome in narrow tunnels or passages, when the camera constantly jumps - now it's close, and now it's far, and now it's close again.It's not astonishing, but neither is it terribly bad. A solid action RPG that will let you spend some days of your life with fun.			"

												Dungeon Siege 3 was my very first foray into the RPG genre of gaming.  Before this game, I was strictly a CoD fan and would only consider FPS games.I received this game free upon the purchase of a nVidia video card, and the coupon stated that a Steam account was required.Not knowing what to expect from the game, I installed it and started playing (I picked the female character with the guns).  Little did I know that I became quickly immersed in the game and had a hard time putting it down.  I loved the graphics, gameplay was solid, good story line, customizable character powers (you pick how you want to level up your character), however the character selection is rather limited. "

												Disclaimers: this is not a flawless game.  The biggest issue is that it's sometimes prone to targeting the wrong enemy. And I could have done with less cheesecake in the character designs. Finally, if you're a die hard action-rpger, you'll probably find it too short and the character abilities not diverse enough.That said, I liked it.  It's certainly my favorite of the Dungeon Siege games, overall: the combat was more diverse and interesting than in 1 or 2 (though 2 had better boss fights), and the characters were given more depth.  Though certainly not the deepest tale, the story was also stronger than in the other games.  Most importantly, DS3 has a satisfying ending, with plenty of 'what happened to ...' information about the post-game world.  I leave the game feeling pretty happy about the experience, unlike DS2 and the terrible non-ending it offered up.			"

Combat for single players is made virtually undoable without having to stop and recover for long periods betwen each encounter and the gear system was confusing.  With forced different combat styles for the characters, there does not have the chance to specialize and focus on one ability and run with it.  Overall, a lackluster sequal to a great game.			"

Kassinder!Jeyne/Kassinder DO NOT BUY!Real review:Pros:-Dem grayficks-Boobies!!!-Got for a pittance (paid one pittance too much) in the bundle with its infinitely better prequels-Also got for free on XBLA, where I slogged through this mess (hours on Steam don't reflect actual play* time)*""play"" implies that I enjoyed myself. I did not.Cons:-Most linear story I've played outside of a rail shooter, maybe a dozen ""important"" choices that affect only what cutscene you see-Boss battles are cheap, and consist of mainly AoE-attack spams, and minion summoning-Somehow the levels are more confusing than most actual RPGs I've played (maybe I'm just too dumb to appreciate the masterwork of level design?)-Notice that three of the four Pros have nothing to do with the game (see: ""Boobies!!!"", onward)-Characters (good, evil, and mainly-neutral townsfolk, alike) do little, if anything, to be memorable-No real choice in character-building. Same six (or so?) canned abilities, level up points put into attributes that tweak the abilities, rather than a skill tree-Jeyne F*CKING Kassinder. Worst villain ever, hands down. She manages to combine all the worst aspects of video game villains, while retaining none of the qualities that make them memorable/sympathetic/interesting/well-written/likeable, etc., etc...Holier-than-thou-and-don't-you-forget-it monologues bring the game to a screeching halt, with not even a single memorable line. I cannot even recall what she looked like, she was so uninspired and dull-Jeyne Kassinder. Seriously. I could write an essay on why she's the crappiest villain of all time-Jeyne Kassinder is brought up in damn near EVERY character interaction you have in this game, and despite hearing her name 1,657,927,412 times throughout the game, it serves no purpose other than to CONSTANTLY remind you who the villain is, and hype her up as the baddest baddie ever to be bad (she's absolutely not)4/10 even on sale, this is a terrible game. There are better ARPGs out there, and by GOD, there are WORLDS-better Dungeon Siege games out there. Save your money, learn from my mistakes.			"

												This game is thrash, plain and simple. The visuals look okay for their age, but that's about it. You know the ages old control mechanics that pretty much every ARPG used since the original Diablo? You know, left click to move (or attack if you click on an enemy, or pick up loot) and right click to unleash your primary ability. Convienient and simple. This game wanted to reinvent the wheel though. Left click attacks, even if there's absolutely nothing to attack. The attack animation is sluggish and cannot be interupted. To move around you either have to use WASD (clunky as all hell) or hold down the right mouse button contionously. There's no click-to-move. In addition the camera is as reliable and fast as a a drunken mule. Oh, and picking up stuff? No, you can't just click on them you silly sausage, no, you have to stand next to the item and press E. Because a context sensitive cursor is way too complicated to program apperently.A lot of these ARPGs have a checkpoint system where the game automatically saves. Some others have the normal, manual save system. This game has neither. See, there are checkpoints and you have to save there manually. You forgot or you thought the game would autosave? Well, there went several hours of your time, you can start from the very beginning. On the top of all that even the presentation sucks ♥♥♥: during dialogues the camera zooms in. The character models are okay, but this puts focus on the horribly low quality textures on the environment. I know, I know, the game is 6 years old at this point, but you know what else is 6 years old? Skyrim. Oh, and if we were at dialogues, I've heard fan-made mods for TES IV: Oblivion with better voice acting. Everybody sounds equally bored and uninterested in whatever they have to say.Don't bother with this game. Not even on sale. This pile of garbage doesn't worth a single cent.			"

Adjusted player speed, otherwise player movement is toooo slooow:player_additive_speed 7modal_close_allBut.. Stuck on Master Thief boss fight.. Ehregott?Previous bosses were nasty, but this one.. OMG, he does damage >1000 with debuff on a distance before animation draws.This is probably the worst OBSIDIAN game I've ever played.It designed badly. Persisten camera problems, the console doesn't really help.Spend two-three hours only trying to defeat that boss.. It's not fair.

Now that evil has returned to Ehb the people turn to the few remaining Legionnaires for the protection of the past. As an heir to the legion will you accept this plea for help? How it will all be resolved is up to you!Dungeon Siege III is an Action RPG that seamlessly blends intuitive fast-paced gameplay, a robust RPG system featuring a large selection of abilities, loot galore and the depth of story Square-Enix and Obsidian Entertainment are known for creating. Players will be able to adventure by themselves, on the couch with friends, or online in a fully multiplayer experience.			"

After events take place you must fight men and monster a like and find the truth about the past or ignore it.PositiveThe story and atmosphere in the game are actually pretty compelling. The voice overs actually work well. The combat feels pretty good overall.NegativeThe game comes off with that sense that you've seen this all before. Even with a good atmosphere it never feels real.

												I wasn't too sure about this game from the start as I like when games stay true to their base. As I started playing I was astounded by the graphics and solid gameplay throughout. The Framerate stays solid with no lag or tearing. Even Mid to low range machines can play this game flawlessly with no issue. With it's Steampunk/Anime staging and deeply engaging storyline it is sure to keep you interested all through your journey. With a balanced ablility tree with defensive offensive and passive powers there is no battle you cannot win.  The Armor system alone in this game is unique as you have to really think about how to balance your gear for maximum effect.  Agility is crucial for critical hits which matters when you come up against higher level opponents so brute force isn't the only answer in all enagements. That alone to me is what keeps this game fresh and unique.			"

												I am a fan of DS III. If you haven't played the franchise, I recommend that you start here, but there are a few things that you may want to know: 1) This game is limited in how you customize your avatar. If it is important to you that you have numerous character classes with unlimited choices for hair color and skin tones, this isn't going to work for you. There are, however, both male and female classes. 2) Unless you have never even seen an RPG-style game before, I would avoid the easiest level. Since it avoids a lot of combat, there is almost no one to fight, which is poor skill preparation for the game itself. 3) The camera--oh, god, the camera. The spinning is so obnoxious for anyone with video game motion sickness. Every move changes the camera perspective. Caveat emptor, if this affects you. Beyond those inconveniences, I highly recommend this one. There is a LOT of deep lore and backstory here, if that is your thing. Everything has an on-screen text that accompanies the narration (so I can play this at night with the sound off and not disturb my spouse). This is my first-time through on Steam with the DLC, ""Treasures of the Sun.""			"

												I have beat this game and it's DLC and have completed every side quest in this game. Only play this game if you want to play single player.Multiplayer review In short, If you want a co-op rpg DONT PLAY THIS GAME. It has one of the worst versions of multiplayer i have ever seen in a game. The game forces both players into the same screen (which for pc is a slap in the face), only the host of the game gets to progress any character, money spend is the hosts money, any items obtained are only obtained for teh host, If you have a mic plugged in its always on (no toggle to talk) and etc. Overall its pretty much pointless to play multiplayer unless you own it on console and only play with a friend at your house. Single Player reviewIf you are reading this you most likely dont care about multiplayer or realize that the game has been out for so long that the multiplayer base (what little there was) is now dead. Honestly i have to say that the single player aspects in this game are fantastic. While in single player you are limited to only 1 additional teammate. Depending on play style will depend on who you like to partner with the most. The story line is the thing that suprised me the most. Unlike mass effect your decisions often effect you long term. For example early in the game you get the choice of killing an archon, putting her in jail, or letting her go free. While the first choice will give you an extremely powerfull staff for that level, it will in turn make all future instances with archons hate you forever. Combat The combat is what i really enjoy most about this game. Each character you have has 3 abilities and 2 stances that they can switch between totaling 6 abilities overall. Each stance is either single target is aoe focused. Each stance though often has buffs or pets you can summon that remain active even if you switch. So reguardless of the situation i often found myself switching between them fairly often just to get the extra buff out even if that stance wasn't optimal. Using its combat system took a little to get use to. It's a small delay but deals quite a bit of dmg if you are able to get combo hits off or finish a long casting spell.			"

												While definitely not as good as the first two (four) games in the Dungeon Siege game, there's quite a lot to be said for DS3.The simplification of the game mechanics was a huge shock initially, and as much as I loved the original DS games . . . there's a nice simplicity to DS3 that turns it more into a player skill-based fighting game with RPG elements. In DS1 and DS2 you just spent all your time ducking into corners trying to find armour and weapons and spells that were just a touch bit better than what you already had; DS3 honestly does a better job of this, with a much tighter reward cycle.The story is a bit . . . ""meh"". Decent enough, but not a selling point of the game. The butchering of the original DS1 lore is a touch sad, even if it kind of does set up nicely for a sequel . . . that won't ever happen, probably.Couple of other things that bothered me: many of the female characters have ""armour"" that isn't even close to being realistic (for Azunai's sake, Katerina wears _high heels_ in combat!). Multiplayer is a bit of a joke... some of the skills are solidly OP. I finished the game on the hardest difficulty and only ever needed to use the ""block"" mechanic in one battle, which was in the DLC content . . .But overall it's a solid fighting game with beautiful graphics. Camera controls are a touch annoying, and the story is nothing to write home about, but it kept me interested enough to play through three times (once as Katerina, twice as Anjali). It's very different than the other DS games, so I suspect that's why it has poor reviews, at least in part.I think you can do better with $15, but you can also do far worse.(Quick note --- I played this game offline, not online, hence Steam claiming I've only played it for 0.1 hours?!? Silly steam).			"

												Play this game if you want to break your fingers on the keyboard.This game became fun only after the hours I spent programming a Logitech G13 gaming keyboard to keep my fingers from tying into knots.Some of the supporting abilities are very weak.  It's possible to build a character that can't progress beyond a boss and becomes stuck.  There are plenty of save points; make a lot of new saves.  Reading texts in game is terribly executed.  I keep telling myself I'll read them later in the Lore menu.The visuals are pretty but the settings are finicky.  Adequately controlling the camera requires a thumbstick.  Fighting and moving the camera together can easily require 5 simultaneous keystrokes. I mute the music and listen to a playlist of my favorite bands.I really enjoyed DS1 and DS2 with all their expansions and Broken Sword.This game made me yell a few times.After slapping it around a few times with the G13 I feel that tender Dungeon Siege attraction.

												Very limited Game. Little to no replayability. Liked the casual gaming aspect though. Easy to play through and watch the story. Wish it was more like fable. More customisable character / more open world aspect / reasons for returning to previous areas aside from xp for vengeance quests.			"

												I wasn't too sure about this game from the start as I like when games stay true to their base. As I started playing I was astounded by the graphics and solid gameplay throughout. The Framerate stays solid with no lag or tearing. Even Mid to low range machines can play this game flawlessly with no issue. With it's Steampunk/Anime staging and deeply engaging storyline it is sure to keep you interested all through your journey. With a balanced ablility tree with defensive offensive and passive powers there is no battle you cannot win.  The Armor system alone in this game is unique as you have to really think about how to balance your gear for maximum effect.  Agility is crucial for critical hits which matters when you come up against higher level opponents so brute force isn't the only answer in all enagements. That alone to me is what keeps this game fresh and unique.			"

												This played like a blend of Diablo 3 and Dragon Age. It is a pretty standard RPG - build yourself up, save the world, sort of deal. The graphics are lovely, and visually pleasing, but most of the world is standard fair (but very well done). I really enjoyed the combat, except for the camera mechanics. They know how to make worthy boss fights too, and keep the difficulty at a good level. Most bosses took a few tries to get past, a few were smooth, and several took many attempts. The length of boss fights was plenty long - it felt like a BOSS fight since you'd be battling for 5-15mins, instead of blasting them down super fast. Normal mode kept me on my toes, but wasn't gruesomely painful - which is how I like normal modes. I think the weakest point is the character development, for there really isn't much. There are a few fun phrases, but nothing to make you glom onto the characters and love them as you would in Dragon Age.  7.5/10, would recommend to RPG adventure fans easily.			"

												If you were a fan of the original Dungeon Siege, you're probably too busy with work, nightlife, bills, and studying to have even noticed this baddy touchdown on shelves.It's been years since we last battled the epic final bosses of Dungeon Siege II- Bhad Kamurah and Lyag. You'll find it a nostalgic treat to know that Bhad Kamurah makes a return to the series in Dungeon Siege III as a consistant enemy! You'll have to come up with innovative and sometimes creative strategies to work your way to victory over this old foe! As if that wasn't enough, each and every level is made unique by a curse mysteriously named Porr Diizine! It is up to you, the heroes of the kingdom of Ehb to figure out how to rid the lands of this evil plague or forever remain lost and confused by it!			"

												It's an action RPG, with average action, and next none RPG.Action:It's clunky, and if you are playing a melee character(Lucas), it's easy to get stuck in the terrain. It's also a bit weird, you are expected to move and dodge with your keys, but target your attacks with mouse, and this is not as comfortable as one might imagine when it's a top down view. There is no pause option, so you'll end up missing with your cone/line type attacks very often. E.g. with Lucas, ended up rushing away from enemies almost as often as towards them.RPG:This is as much an RPG as Diablo, except you don't even get to name your character, and there is really just the one build per character that will work, unlike in Diablo. There are also a very few intances of making any choices, apart from being rude or not, or refusing side quest. There are few instances where you can just murder a few people for no reason, but that's about it.I got this part of the DS collection, (which by the way, I would *not* recommend, as it does not include Broken World for DS2), and as such, I don't think I would have played it otherwise.I wish I could give it a neutral grade, because as a whole, it's average, not bad, but with only rating options of steam being: ""it's the best"" or ""it sucks"", I'll have go with the latter.
