												What starts off as a promising concept falls badly flat. The first half of the game is all about unlocking more and more features, which is implemented very well, and would have made a great game if they'd stuck with it. But as soon as you unlock ""3D"" the game just becomes alternately a bad zelda clone and a bad FF clone. The concept of ""unlocks"" goes out the window, in favor of ""whatever gimick we feel like giving you for a short while, then taking away"".The puzzles requiring you to switch between different ""eras"" are briliant. Pity that this idea was so sparingly and arbitrarily applied.Bottom line: A great set of ideas looking for a better game.			"

												A short, sweet, but well written love letter to the games of the 80s and 90s, Evoland is a must play for anyone who grew up on classic Zelda, Final Fantasy and Dragon Quest. There's even a Diablo level thrown in for good measure. Evoland is quite literally a walk through RPG history, starting with black and white 8-bit and ending with 6th gen level graphics. Nintendo's infamous ""rule of 3"" is in abundance, as are the frequent turn based FF/DQ battles. The game has a few bugs, and hit detection on some things is a bit off in the Zelda segments, but it's hardly game breaking. I have to stress that the game is short and has little to no replay value, but it's still well worth it for fans of the old school.			"

												Evoland is a charming tribute to the history of RPGs. Obviously influenced by The Legend of Zelda, Final Fantasy, Dragon Quest, and Diablo, there's a lot to love in this indie gem. You'll traverse the annals of video game history as you move from early 8-bit games through 16-bit and 3D, gaining little bonuses along the way that poke fun at RPG stereotypes. I smiled on more than one occasion at the humor in the game, and I was always looking forward to the next technological progression of my character. In a way, Evoland presents as a haphazard combination of themes. On the one hand, you have the excellent unlockable tributes to video game history. You unlock the ability to enter houses, you gain the ability to fight, and you'll be able to fight random enemies. All good, and all evenly and comically presented. However, the game eventually becomes a casual RPG with a light story that features frequent testaments to the major moments in RPG classics. While it is a little jarring to have your little world suddenly begin to be fleshed out, it makes sense mechanically and keeps the game moving.As you journey on through this adventure, you'll play a collectible card game, solve Zelda-style puzzles, find optional collectible items, and enjoy many different modes of play. Evoland is something special, and anyone who looks upon the roots of RPGs fondly will enjoy this nostalgic love letter.			"

												When I went into this game, I was really looking forward to it. A nostolgia trip that takes you through the best of top down adventure, RPG and turn based battles. What is actually here is a brief parody game poking fun at itself and tropes across two decades of game genres and technological advances.To my dismay, Evoland bluntly tells you, you're in this era of RPGs. I guess its meant for comedy, but I just didn't care for it. You'll unlock different eras of games and different technologies, such as sound effects, music, 16 bit graphics, high definition textures, 3D battle systems and so on. Its all part of the joke. You'll see all the stereotypes and tropes here and the game will be quick to point them out to you so that you'll understand its a joke.Evoland has great graphics, and some gameplay elements that would make for a great game. This feels like a good tech demo since every era is so brief with no depth. I can understand paying $5 if they use this engine to make a real full fledged game, but you'll breeze through this game with no challenge. I would say its the perfect game for kids, but with so much hinging on nostalgia, kids might not understand.You'll play in top down Zelda segments, using a sword to cut down grass, bombs to blow up walls and arrows to transfer fire between lit and unlit candles. Eventually that top down will turn into a 3D version of itself which you can switch between using crystals. Its a nice system that I would have liked to see a lot more of if not be its own game. There are Final Fantasy 2 style towns, random battles and turn based combat, but there is no depth to combat. Its all turn based fighting where your main character has no skills. The secondary character has spells, but nothing lost for using the spells like a traditional turn based RPG would have. Eventually the old school RPG updates itself to be 3D later on in the game.Eventually, you'll find a Final Fantasy 8 style town. After that you'll find a Diablo styled dungeon with gold, health orbs and loot dropping on the ground for you to collect. It felt like a button mashing chore to get through it. Nothing intelligent to the gameplay, just button mashing.In the game you'll collect gold, cards and stars, but other than that, there's not much going on. There is little need for gold since there is barely anything to buy. The stars just go to an achievement. The cards lead to a Final Fantasy 8 inspired mini game that is nice to play where your cards have numbers on each of the four sides of the cards and you lay them down in a grid of 3 by 3 to determine who has the most cards once you've thrown down. It is a great feature to have and they went the extra mile to include it.With that said, the game just feels so hollow, all style, no substance. There is no storyline twist, such as an evil wizard devolves the land once you've easily breezed through the evolutionary eras. I knew how far I had progressed based on what evolutionary stage I was on. It just felt disappointing. Since there is no depth, the combat is really just tedium if not button mashing. The focus was on making the game feel like the other games we know and love.As a comedy game it missed its mark with me in the 3 hours it took to complete it. There were definitely highs and boring lows. If it was more difficult the game wouldn't be fun after the laughs wear off. I've gone through it twice now and disliked it more the second time.			"

												It's not often that I find myself really enjoying a game but agreeing wholeheartedly with the people who gave it a negative review. Yet, that's what I experienced with Evoland, an RPG that bills itself as a ""journey through the history of action/adventure gaming"".Evoland exists more as unrealized potential than as a genuinely good RPG. The gameplay/story elements it gets right are amazing, but it also has many problems that keep it from being a standout in the genre.The game itself takes heavy influences from the Final Fantasy games. You start out as an random knight in a forest, quickly gaining the ability to do basic things like walk in different directions, fight enemies and learn more about the plot (which is only there for the sake of an achievement joke). From there, you meet a young girl who aids you in your journey and you both set off to defeat the evil lord who's trying to take over the world. Pretty standard stuff.More than anything else in the game, the plot (and by proxy, the introduction and jokes about various RPG concepts) is really only good for the first hour. Many of the gameplay elements fall apart the further you go into the game.Chief among them is the random battle system. Not only is it incredibly annoying (you get attacked every few steps on the world map), but there's no real purpose for any of it. You can attack or heal, and you gain levels that give you more HP or magic power, but this doesn't translate to the rest of the game. There are three distinct battle systems - the standard RPG turn-based system, a Torchlight-inspired hack-n-slash with a health globe, and a Zelda-esque dungeon mode with heart containers. None of these systems have anything to do with each other, and there's no point grinding in the overworld.The same goes for the collectibles you find. There are gamecards (based off Triple Triad/Triad Master from Final Fantasy) that are scattered throughout the world, but their purpose is never clear until halfway through, and playing games with them is pointless. There's a powerful magic attack that unlocks after a boss battle, but you have to wait a very, very long time to use it, and its only use is to kill trash mobs. You get a bunch of items dumped on you during the hack-n-slash dungeon, but most of them don't do anything at all, and the minimap you gain in said dungeon doesn't even work half the time.It's frustrating, because when the game is firing on all cylinders, it's a wonderful experience. There was a moment where I was trying to figure out a puzzle in a forest, seamlessly switching between 2D Zelda-style graphics and a full 3D realization of the same forest, and marveling in awe at how fluid the transition was. Likewise, there are some amusing jokes and throwbacks to games like Final Fantasy VII and VIII that had me smirking as I played.The best part of the game is the sense of achievement you get when you find a new chest, and open it for a random surprise. This runs the gamut from increased graphics to gameplay changes, new weapons and more. It's that sense of pursuit for the next unlock that drives my enjoyment of the game.The gameplay itself is also enjoyable, and the constant belittling of the main characters by NPCs is quite amusing, especially when you can't speak to adults in the early game until you eat a magical seed that inexplicably causes you to age a decade and become an adult.In the end, I felt that Evoland was a great experience in spite of the problems associated with it, and I'm excited to see what the developers will bring to the table for the sequel (also available on Steam). The evolving gameplay and charming characterization is what sets this apart from a lot of other RPGs.Definitely worth checking out, if only for the first hour.For more reviews, visit my Curator page, Alex's RPG Recommendations!

												Might not be the best RPG around in terms of story and lenght, but it features a very interesting concept of multiple environmental and combat systems which can be found througout the history of RPG games (i.e. Legend of Zelda, Dragon Quest, Final Fantasy and Diablo game mechanics and graphics, among others). As you continue through the game, you'll unlock new mechanics and new graphic modes which resemble the next step in the genre's evolution - hence the name ""Evoland"". It's worth the price for a couple of hours of fun, a nice story and a look through the story of the genre.			"

												I feel bad giving this game a thumbs down, because it has (or had rather) lots of potential. What it turned out to be was a short, extremely underwhelming mishmash of classic games, dumbed down to the point where all of the enjoyment of the originals is gone.How can one make a game that is part Zelda, part Final Fantasy, and part Diablo that sucks? Well, take 5 minutes worth of Zelda gameplay, make the controls slightly less responsive, and stretch it out for 30 minutes. Final Fantasy? Have 3 - and only 3 - different types of enemies that require the same amount of attacks to kill whether you're at level 1 or 5. And imagine Diablo with no difficulty and pointless item drops.The whole game is an exercise in redundancy, filled with stolen famous one-liners from games we love, only to be regurgitated out of the context that made them memorable in the first place. Had the game been much, much longer, with more variation in enemies, items, and, well, basic gameplay, Evoland could have done well.			"

												My opinion: Evoland was a good game, but I was expecting way too much from it.I was sorely disappointed when the game ended. But that doesn't mean it was bad. On the contrary, it was, for the most part, pretty enjoyable. Evoland shows the history of game design (limited exclusively to adventure games) from it's very beginnings, but disappointingly stops short of modern day. This made the game surprisingly short, but they weren't kidding when they said 'A Short Story'. My major gripe with it, is that it's not the evolution of adventure games as much as it is 'The Evolution of The Legend of Zelda and Final Fantasy Games'. There's obviously more to adventure than that, and even though those two are both superb series in themselves, the spotlight could have been cast to others. And the fact that those two games are featured so predominately kind of makes the slight reference to Skyrim and League of Legends seem out of place.But aside from the limited scope, that limited scope is done fantastically. Since this is a game about gameplay evolution, new mechanics and features are introduced constantly. But their introduced so seamlessly that it feels natural. You never have to take a pause to read instructions or do a tutorial, you just get it. That's where the game shines. It sets out to show gameplay evolution, and that's what it does. If you're an veteran of video games, you'll enjoy being able to relive some past experiences that you just don't get in AAA titles today. But, if you're a veteran gamer, then you'll be annoyed at some just as you smile at others.Want to continue reading for a more in depth review?

OverviewEvoland is a game that fails to achieve its potential. With good intentions, it pays homage to the evolution of the video game industry by allowing the player to travel through iconic RPG of the past. However, behind the cute references, Evoland is severely lacking in content.GameplayThe majority of the advertised unlockable features (improved graphics, sound, or combat) happen at the beginning of the game. After that, the player is forced to battle through ♥♥♥♥♥♥ renditions of Final Fantasy, Legend of Zelda, or Diablo. 95% of the items you encounter are completely useless and combat boils down to two commands: ""attack"" or ""heal"". To boot, the level-up and currency system does nothing (read: nothing), making the random encounters both intrusive and useless.VerdictWith some fumbling around, I was able to personally discover / beat all the content to the game in a measly three hours, including the main story and all secret unlockables. I bet you could do it with just two if you really tried. There is zero replay value. It's a shame really. Evoland was one of the wishlist games I had the highest hopes for.			"

												Evoland has charm with an interesting concept to boot, traverse through gaming history. An appealing visual style encapsulating the likeness of each era, from Game Boy 8-bit to PlayStation-esque polygons, harmonised with an exceptional soundtracks re-creates an extremely nostalgic sensation for those familiar with the related retro consoles. Not only that but there are many nods and gameplay elements referencing various game franchises not limited to: Final Fantasy, Dragon Quest, Legend of Zelda, Diablo, and most surprisingly although perhaps unintentional YS. Changes to gameplay are achieved through an unlock system, one problem is that several of these feel like complete gimmicks and don't add to the game as much as others. However I will admit there has been a vast amount of improvements when compared to the original game, which can still be played on the developer's site.[evoland.shirogames.com] So if you're wanting a taster of what to expect you can try that out for free first.

												The first hour or so of Evoland is fun. Its premise -- explore a world where the graphics and game mechanics continuously evolve via treasure chest unlocks -- is a good one, and one that I don't see enough in gaming. It's nice to see the world shift around you, as you go from a monochrome, GameBoy-esque scene with only one usable button to a 3D world with prerendered graphics, and the sense of generational progress really applies to my sense of nostalgia.If only they taken that idea and run with it.About halfway through the game, when you go to 3D, the tone of the game noticably changes. The focus of the game is no longer on constantly evolving graphics and game mechanics; instead, the game tries to be a straight-faced clone of Zelda and Final Fantasy at the same time. If well-executed, this would also be a welcome development, but the game from this point onward has no depth; sure, there are Zelda-like dungeons, Final Fantasy-like random encounters and a story going on, but the dungeons have fairly basic level design, the random encounters occur WAY too frequently (one every five-six steps in the overworld), the combat draws from a miniscule pool of enemies, and the story is so shallow that I couldn't bring myself to care about anything. The first hour was great, but from there the game got very dull, very quickly.			"

												Evoland is game that is interesting for the first hour and then a tedious gimmick for the rest.  And the rest is maybe another hour and a half unless you're an achievement completionist.The premise is that you guide your character though the history of Zelda/Final Fantasy style computer games whilst saving your village from Evil.The problem is that with the exception of the early Zelda'esque gameplay Evoland is just not very fun.  There is less than three hours of game and it still feels drawn out.  The puzzle sections see you trudging backwards and forwards along the same path time and time again.  The traps are cheap and the monsters re-spawn which makes reloading and replaying the same stage a chore.Once the game has evolved to Final Fantasy style random encounters it becomes very annoying as an encounter happens every three to tens seconds on the world map.  There is almost no need for interaction during encounters as the combat is basically: hit with one character heal group with the other.  Walk through some trees.  Repeat with the next encounter.The Torchlight styled sections could have been fun but the collision detection is so utterly awful that melee hits tend to miss.  Fighting degenerates into mashing the hit button until the area attack is charged.  Again repeat.Really this game had a lot of potential but there is so little content (repeated ad-nauseam) that I do begrudge the time I spent to complete it.			"

												Evoland is a game that tries to grab your nostalgia of great classic games like The Legend of Zelda or Final Fantasy 7, but all you get while playing it is the urge to play those better games.The core concept is cool, as you play through the game the graphics get more modernized and new mechanics get added as well, but it rarely treats it as an actual gameplay concept rather than a clever visual gimmick.The game takes different gameplay styles for different dungeons. One dungeon and the world map will play like Final Fantasy, a few are like Zelda, and another like Diablo. I would look past the lack of consistency if it wasn't for each of these playstyles being a poor man's version of what they are mimicking. The Zelda sections are okay, but have clunky level design and bare-bone puzzles. The Final Fantasy sections require little strategy with your caster only knowing two spells she can spam because there is no MP (or any spell limitations outside of the hero's summoning spell for that matter). And finally, the Diablo section is just a really basic beat 'em up with a single combo.The game constantly screams unused potential, but the developers were just satisfied with offering the player minimum depth in gameplay and writing. There are clever moments, but it does nothing memorable to stand as it's own game. That may be the purpose of the entire game, but at the very least it could offer HALF of what it's trying to replicate. More spells for the turn base combat sections, one other combo for the Diablo section... I should be able to look at each of these playstyles separately and be convinced that it could stand as it's own game.Positives? The game as a whole looks decent. The pixel art in the 2D segments look like an typical SNES RPG and the 3D graphics could pass on the PS2, that's not bad for an indie title. Outside of that though I can't say any element is better than average.The game is about three hours long for the main story, you could argue it's a bit longer if you do EVERYTHING. But there's no real payoff for finding all the collectables, so what is the point outside of just collecting them? Playing a card game that randomly selects my cards? Why not just find the strongest cards and just use those?If you can get this for a REALLY low price and just want to waste a couple hours, I guess you could do worse.However, If you are wondering if you should play this game before playing the second, don't. In a lot of way Evoland 2 is what 1 should've been. A tangible plot with actual characters with more engaging gameplay elements that does more than just be there for the refrence.			"

												Evoland is an Action RPG that takes the player through the history of gaming in a thoroughly humorous and nostalgic experience. Unlike most RPGs, the game is focused less on character development and leveling up and more as a humorous experience designed to bring a smile to the faces of veteran players as they progress through the various ages of the RPG, taking in the sights and bringing up fond memories. Packed to the brim with endless references, it’s clear from the start that Evoland was made with the utmost love for games of time gone by and provides an authentic experience throughout.Evoland is a game with a lot of charm, not least due to its sincere parodies of aspects such as the linearity of open world games like Final Fantasy, complete with a suspiciously named substitute called “Kaeris”, who specializes in magic asks our hero (and the player) politely to help her save her town.  Of course the player is forced to agree as to set into motion the events of the game. The humor makes sure that the player knows that this is clearly a game made from the heart and not once do the references feel forced or contrived. What will appeal most to gamers are the faithful replications of games like Final Fantasy and Zelda. Beginning the game with nothing more than the ability to move right and with Gameboy era graphics, the player soon, “unlocks” features such as SFX, 3D graphics and HD textures which are used uniquely as an aspect of the gameplay, becoming more advanced as the player progresses through the game. It’s hard not to raise a smile when switching from 2D to 3D within a matter of seconds and such use of visuals and sound is nothing if not innovative, helping to immerse the player into a game that reads like a history book of the gaming industry.That’s not to say that the game is perfect by any means, as there are several flaws that stick out as surprising, considering the obvious care to detail within the game. Factors like the lack of a sprint unlock came as a surprise considering just how expected it is in line with the other unlocks, and in certain parts of the game, it comes across as a very much needed feature which lack of inclusion can only serve to puzzle players. The switch to Diablo-like gameplay for a dungeon is very much less polished than the rest of the game and it’s not rare to find yourself shouting out in frustration as you try to adapt to gameplay so clearly not replicated to the high standards of the battle systems for the Final Fantasy and Zelda sections. That’s not to say it’s bad by any means, but the high standards laid down previously by the game serve only to emphasize just how annoying it is to have to deal with the clunky controls that are introduced and the dungeon will have players pulling their hair out in frustration as they die many a death trying to come to terms with the controls.The balance of the game also works against it as the various unlocks, arguably the most intriguing parts of the game, are largely completed within the first third. It’s hard not to feel that they should’ve been spread out further throughout the game, as you find yourself wanting to spend more time immersed within the 2D world, which is soon eliminated to make way for 3D, proceeding to make up the bulk of the rest of the game. That’s not to say the 3D sections are any less impressive, it’s just the enjoyment of the game as an interactive history of gaming is over all too quickly and leaves the player crying out for more. Such weighting to the first third of the game can also be seen in its references, which gradually decrease as the game goes on. Early in the game everything the player interacts with has a witty remark or object leading to several genuine laugh out loud moments whereas the latter stages lack interactivity leading to a loss in the charm that the game possesses as the game becomes an almost straightforward RPG.Evoland is a unique game in that it’s impressive to see the scale of references and care to detail that is present within it. Despite several surprising flaws, it’s not often in a game where one can relive some of the greatest game-playing experiences from Final Fantasy and Zelda in a couple of hours and the combination of the two games is almost seamless in their execution. Nothing less than a love letter to the games of yesteryear, Evoland will delight players both old and new as it takes them on a journey of nostalgia through a loving send up of the best games of years past.Recommended "

												Quite an interesting approach on the visualisation of evolution of the virtual RPG standarts over time. When I just heard about this project, I thought ""wow, cool, must've been smth worth to look at!"". Then I bought it - probably at some sell event or in the bundle, as I'm sure I was not buying it the moment it got out of Greenlight. And then... I haven't touched it until now. Two years passed by, the game achieved positive background and its devs even released Evoland 2, which is basically just one more try to do the same trick - but better... So yeah, now there are some reviews which points to the Evoland 2 immidiately, like the first one Evoland is obsolete now. Is it? Nope.I have to say, one of the things that kept me away from Evoland was the fear that the devs will mess something on my ""so precious"" gaming experience over all those years. It's the same thing as touching the HD remakes of Heroes of Might and Magic 3 or Baldur's Gate - which I haven't done yet - just to not mess the memoires of good old times with another portion of disorder every reinstallation usually creates. Happily, I have to state, that's not an issue of Evoland.While it ceratinly does just as promises - showing you the evolution of trends and game mechanics in some part of virtual role-playing - it does not insists that it was Strictly That Way. You know, as it usually goes with history lessons - like when Soviets poses like it was them who beats all the Nazies - and forgetting totally about Lendlease. Or like Americans poses it was them who finished Hitler and all around - oh yeah, and with K/D ratio of 10, above all... Sorry, I'm slipping away.So, have I enjoyed the game? Certainly. Could I recommend it to buy? Only if you're already used to play wanna be jRPG projects (like RPG Maker stuff), as Evoland generally follows the ""evolution"" on the eastern tread: Legend of Zelda mixes with early Final Fantasy tunes, whereas the promised reminiscence to the Diablo feels... just slightly common. Anyway, as of ""evolution"" theme, Evoland concentrates basically on the technological stuff - like adding more and more pixels on the screen and more tones to the sound, while the story and other most basical RPG elements remains on the level of the games in early 90's.So! As of overall, speaking of ""cultural value"" of Evoland, I can say it's a good tribute, which is worth your attention, if you've been long on the gaming stage. However, if you're expecting a very good RPG experience from Evoland itself, I'm sorry, I can't see, how this can be done in project like this, with all that mixture of styles, game mechanics and other stuff! Were that game any longer, I must add, it could have been even worse than it is now. Because tribute - is always just a tribute. If you want authentic taste - you obviously need to play all those classics like Diablo or Zelda by yourself.My mark for Evoland is 7.5/10. Nice project, and easy gold on achevements. Worth its price.			"

												Evoland may seem like a good game, however after the first hour or so everything becomes really tedious. Once you've unlocked all the upgrades you're left playing a game who took basic features from several games (pokemon, final fantasy, zelda), and threw them all together, nothing new is really added. The story line is dull and short, and once you complete it there's nothing to do except discover a few easter eggs.While this game is not the worst out there, I would not recommend it.			"

												Note: I haven't 100%'d the game or played Evoland 2. I beat the game with something like 87%.  A neat concept that leans more ""overly referential"" than ""love letter.""Why don't I like this game? When I go to play a classic RPG, I think it looks beautiful, but now I want to play it on an emulator because without the option to speed up the game I just feel like I'm wasting my time. Games used to have more of a public stigma and were often called a ""waste of time."" For some reason Evoland doesn't want to move past that, but, intentionally or not, it seems to imply that /this/ is the pinnacle of gaming. These loathsome turn-based battles wherein I'm not scared I'm going to die from facing four enemies, no, I am scared of the animation of four different characters, which means each. One. Hits. Then. You. Attack. And. Oh. You. Didn't. Kill. It. So. Let's. Do. Another. Four. Attacks. For some reason Evoland stops in this weird middle-ground of floaty combat, dull puzzles, and poorly written dialogue. Evoland fails because it's either too scared to critique or because it doesn't realize we all grew up, and I don't know which is sadder.  Perhaps worse, is that this was a perfect chance to play with genre tropes and yet Evoland decides to mimic tired mechanics.  Who is this for? I don't know. If you like Big Bang Theory's or Family Guy's referential ""humor"" and you like Zelda and FF7 then I guess this the game is for you. This ""humor"" is encapsulated by the annoying ""beeping"" sound when you get to critical health. The game even points it out. ""Remember how annoying that was in Zelda? DO YOU REMEMBER?!""    Play the Ludum Dare entry and save your money and, most importantly, time.  "

												Evoland is silly nostalgic trip to anyone that has played RPGs but mainly Final Fantasy. Evoland puts you on a quest to save Evoland and you along the way you unlock tons of stuff by opening chests, it can be higher quality soundtrac, the key to move left, 3D graphics, pixelated textures, you name it, it can be pretty much anything a game needs in order to be a game, if that makes any sense whatsoever. Speaking of which, the soundtrack is amazing, specially the turn based battle theme along with the victory theme which remind me alot of Final Fantasy VII. Let's be real though, the combat is pretty clunky and you might get annoyed due to the fact that when you're travelling you get a battle every 5 seconds. Evoland is not a really good game the way I see it but the way it was executed based on the ""unlocking stuff mechanic"" (excuse me for my english) and the nostalgia that it brought to me I think that's all it needs to redeem itself and be worth the time to play it, it's a fairly short game, 3-4 hours. That said, if you're a fan of RPGs and have been playing those for a few years you should totally play Evoland, you might like it and you may not still, I think it's worth the risk.			"

Inspired by Zelda, Final Fantasy, and Diablo.The credits don't lie. Gameplay changes every few minutes, adding features that ""evolve"" the gameplay. Starting with an homage to zelda on the gameboy and ending in Final Fantasy VII, there's plenty of references for the experienced game player to enjoy.Similar to DLC-quest, this game keeps the new gameplay elements inside chests, so there's a strong incentive to explore the world. Having spread the game over so many genres, any one gameplay type is comparatively shallow. Thankfully, no aspect of the game overstays its welcome. One hour later you'll be playing a completely different game.Clocking in at 4 hours, this game is definitely worth the sale price of three dollars I picked it up for. Prepare for tonge-in-cheek humor and servicable (though constantly changing) gameplay as you expereince this expertly crafted combination of the dev's favorite classics.			"

												the game was short but it was fun!it has a mixture of final fantasy, zelda and a little bit of diablo. If you are looking for long playing RPG, this game isn't for you. and the joke is only relevant if you are FFVII player. You are playing as a hero that will save the world, the story is very shallow but that's not the selling points. It teaches you the history of RPG from era to era. at first you are in 2 bit mode (4 color with bevel) something like first gameboy and then you get 16 color then 256 color. The game are evolving each time you open treasure. I really like when you are able to explore the worldmap in mode 7 (It was introduced in FF IV SNES If I'm not mistaken). I beat the game in 4 hours, the game didn't quit correctly so it shows my playtime is over 100 hours :(.so to put if brief:pro : - great game for nostalgia- you are playing the game with different control/mechanic-  You are clink (cloud link) and your partner is kaeris. Her uncle is Sid and your enemy is Zephyros! LOLminus:- too short- the hidden object/secret are too obvious- story is too linearI recommend this game, but for the full price I personally think it's expensive for 4 hours+ game. I got mine from humble store when it was $1.99 and it was worth every penny! "

												Great fun! One of those games I didn’t put down until I was finished.So before I actually get to the game stuff, I want to point out a couple of things. The first being that this game seems like it’s a lot better when played with controller. After playing for a short while I tried to use mine and it didn’t work. I had to fiddle around with the files to actually get it to work. Which was mildly annoying and brings me to the second thing. After I fiddled around with the files to make it compatible, the Steam overlay stopped working. Which meant that Steam seemingly stopped recording my play time (hence the pathetic 39 minutes) and I could no longer take screenshots. Which I would of liked to have been able to do. Either way, I reversed what I did in the files after I finished the game to take a “100% yay me I did something pretty pointless” screenshot. So I’m fairly happy. Getting back to the game, I thought it was a lot of fun.I was pretty impressed with the whole aspect of the game’s graphics and features evolving as you played, it gave the game something quite unique about it yet they still managed to keep the story interesting enough that I didn’t just feel like I was just getting a history lesson.The humour was quite good, the text seemed rather sarky at times and us Brits love a bit of sarky. There is a lot of game references involved in this game and it made it all the more charming for me on top of everything else it has. I think I was expecting this game to be shorter than it was. I’m not 100% sure on how long I actually played it seeing as Steam seemingly stopped recording my play time. But I feel like I got a good while out of it. So it’s always nice for a game to feel like it lasted. After I finished the main game I continued playing for achievement purposes. After what felt like a few extra hours, I managed to find and do everything for the 100%. I would say it’s a very easy one to perfect so no worries achievement hunters!All in all I really liked this game, I would definitely recommend it to anyone that has a slight love for these style games or even just gaming in general. I’m not really sure what the label is for them, but the “handheld Pokémon-style RPG games” is what I’m going to go with. It was a fun adventure game and I look forward to trying the sequel. TL;DR : Although might need tampering with to get a controller to work, this game is a lot of fun. It has great graphics, of which evolve throughout you playing, a decent story, a lot of game references, sarcasm and charm. I would say this is definitely worth a go. Especially if you like this genre of game.It’s a fun little game to play through and an easy 100%.  "

												I rarely put this small of amount of time into a game before reviewing it, but I just don't see a light at the end of the tunnel.The only thing this game has are references. I admit it's neat at the beginning as you unlock things like better music, graphics and gameplay features, but that's the only susbstance it has. It has no interesting characters, no fun combat system, and puzzles are easy and unsatisfying. And even the references and humor become a negative and the game seems to hide its own faults behind being an homage.""LOL town music was bad back then!"" while this game's music consists of gratingly repetitive 5-second tracks on loop.""LOL remember random encounters?!"" while the game has an absolutely obnoxious amount of random encounters anywhere on the map. You can try out an alternate path, a battle every 5 or 6 steps, find there's a dead end, then fight another 3 or 4 battles on the way back to the fork, and get thrown into another battle before you even get to try the correct path.""NPCs are so annoying!"" As you run into characters of no substance whatsoever that can't even tell a decent joke when going for humor.And the rest of the faults are just inexcusable. The turn-based combat is entirely substance free and impossible to lose. The Zelda-style combat is dull, uninteresting, and poorly-designed (you can't even attack if holding down more than one directional movement key, and hitboxes are absolute lies). The game gives a series of fetch quests in a PS1 style town where there are loading screens between sections (not actual ones, just LOL reference ones) that you can remove if you collect a stupid amount of money. And the little game upgrades become sparse later on so the one fun thing it does just becomes too rare.The game just sacrifices so much for its references that there's nothing left to satisfy me to keep playing. If you want a retro-style reference to old RPGs, try something like Zeboyd's games. They're much more fleshed out and substantial than this.			"

												I can barely recommend this game. It has a LOT of problems. But overall I feel as a concept it does work well and did educate me into the story of RPG games.I will start by explaining all the problems I found with the game.Combat This is probably the biggest problem and will put the most people off buying the game. The combat is incredibly boring. In evoland you have 2 different combat styles. Turn based or normal 8 directional combat. The turn based combat is basically like in games like pokemon except with absolutely no depth to it. By the end of the game you only have the choice of 2 different attacks and a heal ability. The attacks don't do any kind of special effects. Each enemy only has one attack and they don't do any kind of special effects. Then the other combat system is just as boring. It basically consists of spamming the attack button and that is it. You have 1 combo that gets activated also by spamming the attack button but that's it. You also have the choice of using a bow and bombs later in the game but you probably won't be using these. Overall the combat is just not fun in the least.Random encounters There are sections of the world that when you explore you get random enemy encounters. Again similar to pokemon when you are exploring in grass. These sections are very common and will probably be where you spend the majority of the game. The problem is that you get way too many of these random encounters. You probably get them once every 10 or so steps. Attached to these random encounters is the incredibly boring turn based combat. I found myself extremely angry with the game all while exploring these sections. Story There is a kinda very lackluster story. It won't catch your attention at all really. The story is basically that you are rescueing a village from an evil attacking it. But the game's main focus isn't really in the story.Length I completed the entire game in just over 3 hours. Not incredibly long really. I would have liked more. It just seems to be over when you are just starting to get into it!Checkpoints Very bad placement of checkpoints. The final boss fight is the worst example of this. The checkpoint is placed just before the cutscene with talking to the boss meaning that everytime you die you get the experience of listening to what has to say all over again. Oh how fun! It took me a lot of tries to complete the boss so this annoyed me a lot! Another example is when exploring the dungeons. So when you die all your progress saves ,like enemies dead and doors opened, but you are spawned at the beginning of the dungeon. Why? I have no idea. It just seems like making you do meaningless exploring all over again. And the dungeons are fairly large. On top of all this the game takes you to the main menu everytime you die. There is no reason for a game to have to do this!But this game does have some merit despite all these annoying issues. Concept So the concept of evoland is to show the progression of RPG's over time. This includes every element annoying as it may be. This is one thing that it does well. I learned a lot during this. The game evolves as you play. You pick up chests that progress the game through the eras. It gives a great oversight. This is probably the reason that I managed to continue playing despite all the issues and just about redeems the game. Soundtrack There aren't too many songs in evolands soundtrack but what it does have is good. I love the main menu music in particular. They even have different styles of the same songs such as 16-bit or modern RPG style. The only is that since there are few tracks it can get a bit repetitive after some time. So if you think you are ok to put up with all the annoying issues of evoland then go ahead and buy it. You will find a game that does actually teach you a lot about the progression of RPG's. If not then you may be best with picking up evoland 2 instead which seems to be a great improvement from this. I am currently beginning to play through that myself and will have a review coming in the coming weeks. It doesn't follow on from evoland 1 either so your fine with skipping it.TheIronicGamers rating system Don't ever buy this game. Maybe consider it on a sale. An average game.A good game that should definitely be considered.A must play! "

												Evoland is as much a small parody as it is a game of it's own. It borrows heavily from other RPG games and classics (such as Final fantasy and Zelda), meaning mostly that it mocks them in that loving parody way. The game story is pretty... simple. Big evil destroying world, you must go and defeat it. Along the way, you evolve... not in power, though you do get to level up. The selling point of Evoland is the ""RPG through the ages"" bits. You start off as a pixelated character in a plain world with no enemies, and as you find chests, you start earning things. Such as enemies, the ability to level up, town citizens, pixels, and yes, 3D with nothing, then textures, and finally HD definitions. Combat is both action based and turn based; during world map encounters you will have turns, and during dungeons you will be fighting real time. The game also has one card minigame for your enjoyment. While the story is nothing to call home about, the evolving aspect of the game is fun. The graphics, even when you're just playing your pixel form, are really quite cute and very well done. The world is nice too, although the puzzles/level design/secrets are not really too difficult and everything was far too visible. I don't think they were meant to be difficult, though. The music I was not a fan of, however, it evolves as you do as well and seems to match the game perfectly, so thumbs up on that. The story is also very short and the replay value is really null unless you want to go back and do 100% achievements (which are also not terribly hard to get, but I frankly couldn't be bothered to go search for them). The parody aspect also makes it fun if you love these type of games and have a good sense of humor (see quote above and on image below for an idea of the type of humor). Actually, this was the one thing that made me rate it so high - I had great fun discovering all the chests that made the land evolve and gave me things that had funny captions, or talking to townies and seeing what they would say. I do have to say though, the battles do get a bit annoying after a while, and once you've unlocked everything and seen all the world has to offer, there's really little reason to keep playing, too. There's not much else to say about this game. Did I have fun? Yes! Exploring was fun, fighting was meh (there's really not much you can do, just attack and heal). I will full on admit I quit halfway through the last boss not so much out of frustration, but because there was really little else to do but beat him.Does it get boring if you take it seriously? Also yes. Don't even bother grinding your levels, it will not make a difference. Is it worth full price? Don't think so.Finally, if you like this type of game and get it on sale, it might be a fun little game to spend some time on for a funny, nostalgic ride into the past. Otherwise, I would recommend you pass.			"

												It's worth checking out (on sale, at least) for the first couple of hours. The gradual upgrades you get to the art style, perspective and gameplay are a charming tribute to games of old like Zelda and Final Fantasy to name a couple. Once all that is out of the way, however, it becomes a bit of a slog. I get that the random encounters and story cliches are also there  for the sake of paying tribute, but a little of the former goes a LONG way and it quickly becomes annoying (especially when you pretty much have no need to level up for the final boss). As for the latter, I would've liked a little bit more done with it rather than just a basic retread (if it went full deconstruction of the genre this could've been amazing). Still, the art style is pretty, there are some clever puzzles involving switching back and forth between gameplay modes, and the in-game card game was enjoyable.Worth a look, but I won't blame you if you give up after the first splendid couple of hours.

It's full of references to a variety of great games.

												Negative reviews will say that it's short, or a bad knock-off.  This game is what it is: a proof of concept. A throwback. An awesome revisit to the various generations of action/adventure fantasy RPGs. Get it on sale like I did, and you should not be disappointed. In any case, I thought it was awesome and I look forward to playing Evoland 2. Word to the wise: if you run Windows 8 or 10 and you have issues getting the controller to work, be aware that there is a dinput8.dll file in the game directory that is used by pad.exe to pass controller commands to the game. If you take this file out of play (by removing or renaming it) the pad.exe will work, and if run will tell you what it sees as the controller. If it's not the one you want, unplug whatever it is and repeat until it sees the right controller, and now you will have no issues playing the game with a gamepad. From what I've heard, Evoland 2 does not have that issue.			"

												This game is hard to recommend as I can see few people getting their moneys worth from the tiny bits of entertainment they will get. Evoland takes the character on a lackluster journey through various rpg games, paying homage so hard to older games that the younger folk will miss it completely and the older folk will be beaten over the head with it. And by pay homage, I mean the bad stuff too.  This game feels rushed as it just scratches the surface of things, and ultimately anything you do, you will probably only do once as the game certainly feels unfinished and hollow.  It is a real shame as this potentially would have been something amazing if more content was added and the story went somewhere long enough I could feel invested. The music is passable boarding around annoying. The enemies are trivial and bosses finicky and troublesome puzzles. I’m glad I only spent a few quarters on this game as I bought it on sale in a bundle, because that is how much this game is worth to me in its current state.			"

												Don't be misled by the 100% completion I have or the hours invested, this game is not worth playing.It starts out sort of cute and novel, the premise being that you unlock new abilities as a sort of video game history unfolds before you. But don't be fooled, the facade begins to fall apart within the first 20-30 minutes. A game pitched as a delve into gaming history very quickly unveils its true colors as a simple list of tired references to ""gaming culture"" with a few lines from movies thrown in for variety. Even if you can handle the completely unsubtle references (the earliest and most glaring one being the retrieval of the buster sword, where they literally say ""doesn't this look familiar?"" with a straight face) the game doesn't stand on its own in any fashion. The art is uninspired.The multiple battle systems suffer every issue from miserable and unfair hit boxes to simple math miscalculations for damage. It pretends to be Zelda, Diablo, FF, and more, and yet pales in comparison to the most rudimentary of battle systems (I wrote a more complex system on my graphing calculator back in 10th grade math) and has zero loot system whatsoever.The RPG system is literally nonexistant save for 3 items you can buy in the first hour. It pretends to have progression but the numbers don't effectively change anything as the whole game scales directly to you.The puzzles are long, boring, and unforgiving in required precision at times.The bosses are tedious and boring, even worse than the 20-year old counterparts they are rehashing.The random battles do nothing but draw out the length, and trigger frustratingly often.The writing is sad.The plot is nonexistant (references=/=plot).The ending is anticlimactic.And to top it all off, there's the option to use a gamepad, but it is never mentioned, let alone recommended, and without it, you are limited to 8-way movement, making much of the game much harder than it already is.I know this was originally part of Ludum Dare, but trying to pitch this for $10 is hilarious. Even at $1 I don't think it's worth playing simply because it intentionally disrespects your time by dragging things out. I'd honestly be more happy with the money I paid if it were 45 minutes long.Do yourself a favor and don't waste your time or self respect.			"

												As an older gamer who has been playing RPG's since the eighties, I really got a kick out of watching the game upgrade and evolve itself as you play. It pays homage to the gameplay styles of Zelda, Final Fantasy, and Diablo, amongst others. I was expecting the storyline to take a back seat to the evolution gimmick but it was surprisingly well implemented as a framework for everything else. If you have played a large variety of RPGs in your life, from classic JRPGs to the more modern action oriented RPGs, you will definitely enjoy not just the game, but the nostalgia that it taps into.

												This is a very interesting idea -  a computer game that evolves from 8 bit graphics, incorporating advances sequentially as they happened in real computer gaming history. Some ideas are very strong such as time travel that allows you to use different modes to solve puzzles.However, much of the gameplay is anachronistic for a reason, it's just plain bad. The game speeds through early gaming upgrades but then bogs down in a bad period of easy but irritating non avoidable fights. My motivation for labouring through these was the promise of further upgrades to the game engine, but unfortunately the game kind of just stops in 1995 gameplay. As soon as I realised I was close to the end, all interest in playing the game just evaporated.Very strong idea, initially well implemented, but it feels like the developers lost interest at around 4hrs of gameplay.

												Oh man, this game was a treat to play. It takes you on a charming homage of the development of series like Zelda and Final Fantasy over the course of a couple hours. You start out as 8 bit as can be, and throughout chests you find, you unlock sound, better graphics, enemies, and pretty much everything else. Your travels help the world to evolve to a more modern style of gaming (equivalent to the Ocarina of Time I would say). After a bit, you can go back and forth between old school and new school as a direct homage to The Ocarina of Time. Throughout the game, the developers maintained a sense of humor while not taking themselves too seriously. The game shares that in common with DLC Quest actually...and there are game development jokes in this game as well. You at one point unlock a ship which will take you wherever you want to go without random encounters and looks very much like  helicopter version of a Star Wars ship we all know and love. The battle systems also evolve and work well. Everything about this game was done right and I cant recommend this game enough. A definite 10 out of 10.			"

												Evoland, Where to start.. This game has one of the most interesting and awesome concepts i have seen in years.You start your quest in the NES days working your way up to n64-ps1 type graphics/music which you unlock from chests as you progress. I played the game 100% threw including all the achievements in about 6 hours. This is where the problems start. The game is far too short.. All the evolving takes place in the first hour or two and what your left with is a pretty bland and very rushed JRPG. The battle systems are fun MINUS the classic turned base fighting (think final fantasy) which are just horrible. You have pretty much no skills.. gaining xp is virtually pointless and you can only heal during a fight not outside and the encounter rate is about every 3 steps. Enjoy!I still am giving this a thumbs up for the amazing concept and suggest you pick it up during a sale as i don't think it's worth it's full price, If someone were to take this idea with a decent budget they could make something truly amazing! But Evoland however did not live up to it's potential.			"

												It's honestly not that bad. It's a fun little history lesson packed with references to classic games. However, perhaps because of that it is somewhat disjointed and honestly not that fun to play. Also, a big part of why I enjoy games and especially RPGs is the story and although Evoland tries to reference all the great RPGs of the past it doesn't really have a good story of it's own. Referencing many different RPG stories means that all this game really does is highlight RPG tropes and cliches. So although it is an interesting and fun history lesson/experiment overall I can't recommend it.			"

												I most certainly do not reccomend this. Evoland had been on my wishlist forever, and when i saw it was on sale a couple of days ago, no purchase button had ever been smashed so fast. I've sunk a large chunk of my time into this game, and the dissapointment grows as the game progresses. What started as a cute throwback quickly turned into refrences stitched together with awful combat and even worse playability. the traps are annoying, the dialogue is bland, and the ""random battles"" make me want to pull my hair out because it happens every 15 seconds. TL;DR dont buy it, you'll regret it.			"

												IF you played any of the original Zelda games, Final Fantasy, Diablo and so on, you should absolutely check this game out. Honestly, if you only liked Zelda and FF you should pick this up. It's a great homage to great games from the past. My only complaint is that the game felt short, but that's only because it's so much fun.			"

												Evoland is one of those joke games where you progress by unlocking a bunch of the fundamental components of video games, such as a pause menu, sound effects, save points, and color graphics. It presents the joke much better than DLC Quest did (And unlike DLC Quest, actually lasts for over fifteen minutes). However, it makes the terrible mistake of emulating some of the worst parts of the games it’s trying to pay homage to, and forcing you to unironically play through them. Such things include:Areas with random encounters every ten steps,A save point system; dying will make you lose progress and revert back to the last save,Entire rooms filled with invisible pits which only appear when you stand next to them,Enemies which teleport around you, enemies you can only attack from the back, and the ever-popular irritating bats,A painfully slow walking speed within dungeons,No minimaps (For most of the game, anyway)Secret collectables hidden behind fake walls with no hints whatsoever,A ridiculously long desert you’re forced to walk across with random encounters every five steps.The game starts out showing such promise as you unlock interesting bits of game history such as non-grid-based movement, 16-bit graphics, Zelda items, and eventually hi-def 3D graphics. You will even encounter some puzzles which require switching between 2D and 3D versions of the game. However, this all falls apart about halfway through the game, as the game seems to just run out of things to unlock. Before you know it, instead of unlocking cool stuff like minimaps and combo systems, you’ll mostly be getting messages like “You unlocked fireball traps in the next room!” or “You unlocked an enemy ambush!” …I wish I were joking.The music is nothing spectacular. Most is forgettable, intentionally generic midi-like renditions for satire's sake. Then there are the stylistic and gameplay inconsistencies. It seems like Evoland is actually 20 separate programs cobbled together in a big pile. Most unlockables will only work for certain areas of the game; Some areas keep their 2D graphics for the entire game even after 3D is unlocked. At one point, you unlock a minimap that only works for about three areas in the entire game (and not the places where you really need them). Plus, you actually have three different, independent kinds of HP which apply to different game areas (Zelda hearts, RPG HP, and a Diablo-style red orb), and getting “fully healed” in one area will only heal you for that specific kind of area. So you might get healed in the town or drink a life potion, only to discover you’re still at half a heart when you return to hunt for secrets in the mine dungeon. It’s not a very well-polished game in this regard.I give Evoland a 4.5 / 10. There was obviously a lot of soul and humor put into the game by the designers, but the joke goes a bit too far as the game forces upon you hundreds of tedious random encounters, slow-paced dungeons, and unfairly-hidden secrets. The first hour of the game is decent as a work of satire, but everything after that gets tiring fast. Recommended only for the patient.(It’s about 5 hours to fully complete for an achievement hunter, but be warned: if you’re going for 100%, you might want to forego the blind playthrough and keep an eye on the guide from the start, since the game gives no indication of which collectables you’ve found already. If you’re not careful, you might have to play the game twice.) "

If you had an NES or SNES when you were young, this game will make you feel nostalgia on so many levels.But unlike most RPG's, this game lacks any decent story which is a shame. It sticks with the NES story type in which there really isnt one which hurts the later part of the game.but over very fun and unique title 7.5/10			"

												Please, dismiss reviews that attempt to claim that  ""this is a Diablo/FF7/Zelda clone"". I don't want to sound disrespectful to other reviewers but one must be really thick for sarcasm to think that ""Boots of Vaal Undersoul"" that gives you ""+10 to hit & run tactics, for when the boss is just too strong"" is an item that pertains to a game trying to pull the Diablo tone.This game is, instead, a parody, or a humorous homage if you will. It changes its gaming style between dungeons rather quickly, starting from the most basic 2D game, and thens slowly evolving into FF7/Diablo/Zelda-like. This game doesn't give you any depth in any of these gameplay styles and that's why it is interesting: the focus is not in the combat, nor the graphics, nor the puzzles, the story, the character development, the plot... everything in this game is a parody. Take it or leave it boys, this is a parody. Got it?The achievements are fun, I had to consult a guide to get some of them. It also works natively on Linux if you follow this guide, but be warned that it is not supported.The only downside of the game is that Gamepad is not supported.

												The start of this game feels very exciting and promising but it's really just a tonne of wasted potential at almost every corner in this game, which left me feeling very uncomfortable with how little this game managed to pull off in the meager 3 hours of gameplay it offers. I'm not sure if the developers got lazy or just ran out of funding/time but it feels like something went seriously wrong less than half way through the game.The creators made some fairly decent engines for each 'era'/'genre' but ultimately they failed to maximise on anything other than a few gimmicks and some braindead puzzles.Check it out if it's ever 75% off again, otherwise don't bother wasting your time or your money.

												Evoland is a retro inspired game with lots of references to old games. Some things to make you laugh, others to bring back fond memories.At first it may look a little old and stale, of course because that's the way it's intended to look when you first start the game. But it's like DLC quest in the way you unlock game features. For example, being able to travel back and forth in time to complete puzzles or 3d mode. The game becomes very visually pleasing once you unlock a lot of the game modes that change the appearance.Give this a try for sure. It's well worth it and your time. I'm sure you'll find yourself hours later wondering where the time went.			"

												Great concept with a solid artistic and technical delivery, but featuring ludicrously shallow gameplay.Evoland delivers on all it's ideas. Its an adventure through gaming. From 8bit 2D adveture, to 2.5D ""HD"" hack and slash, to pre-rendered backgrounds, to turn based RPG, to even ARPG, etc. It accomplishes them all and presents them in a cohesive way with dashes of lighthearted homages and references to the games it is emulating. It definitely ""brings you back"" to the eras. But all of it comes with extremely shallow and downright silly easy gameplay. Turn based is unlimited heal and attack, your numbers always win. 2D adventure is single hit bland enemies with easy pathways. Most of the 2.5D adventure is actually clunky on top of being simplistic. And anything else is just button mashing. Its a shame too, because the foundation could support a skyscraper, but all we got was a hut. That being said, I still had enough fun. I spent my time searching for all the 100% achievement stuff to find the fun though. Some of the hidden chests and puzzles off the beaten path were the best bits of fun to be had. There's a couple levels where you actually actively switch between eras of game style to solve puzzles. Almost feel like with how atrocious the gameplay was otherwise perhaps this game would've been better served as more of a puzzle oriented game. Its painful to to start thinking about all the missed opportunists here, which seems to be an all too common theme amongst this genre on PC. I have reserved, but optimistic, hopes for the sequel though. And plan to play it soon. Because there is indeed that foundation there... Fingers crossed for marked improvements! The game is interesting enough in what it does accomplish conceptually that I definitely recommend it if it looks appealing to you. But pull back and reel in those expectations as far as you absolutely can when it comes to gameplay. I'll also say that I've seen it on sale for 90% off and in bundles plenty of other times (I got it in a bundle somewhere along the lines), and those are probably the only prices I'd recommend but its your money.

												Evoland is an original game, with a great idea, but to be honest, it doesn't really work as a game, no matter how small or big it is. It starts off brilliant, in black and white old school 2D. Opening treasure chests grants you access to other features, features frequently seen in other RPGs, like 3D mode, loot and NPCs. That all sounds amazing, right ? It is, but the game lets you unlock all the features way too soon. Halfway through (the game lasts about 3 hours, 5 hours max if you want to collect everything) you've seen everything there is and the game starts focusing on the story (if you can call it a story). I was a bit disappointed by that, because the things that made the game so original became unoriginal and uninspired near the end. The random battles were especially starting to annoy me, since it triggers every few seconds and it's not always clear where to go. Like I said, it's something you see a lot in other RPGs, but in Evoland it backfires. A 3 hour game shouldn't become boring that soon.Get it when it's on sale. Because even though it isn't the best game out there, the idea behind it is good and should be witnessed by others.[Rating: 66/100]			"

												Total waste of money. Game was charming and fun at first, until it showed it true colors. Whole game is just bunch of most annoying thing in RPG history glued together. You hate fetch quests where you need to walk (very slowly - no running in this game) across the town like 5 times? Lucky you - there is one here just for you! Or maybe you hate random battles what happen literally every two steps? Well, as soon as game introduces FF mechanics you will be forced to play one of 3-4 random battles every freaking step you take. And let's not even start about battles! Every FF-style battle in the game can be easily won by attacking as boy and healing as girl. You literally win every battle by just mashing A (with one down press when girl is active to switch from useless ""attack"" to the ""magic""). And did i mention that most of the game you will fight with 4 types of enemies in 1 of 10 packs? That's it. And you'll do it for 3-4 hours. And yes, there is 3D battles... But let's not talk about it, especially the boss battle. This is just too sad. Let's just say that 3D collision detecting is awful and buggy as hell.			"

That town, OMG that town. NPCs make yo go through screens over and over again. Then the Diablo-like dungeon... it was somewhat fun, but not that much. Then that forest where you need to torch some bushes over and over and over again touching crystals going from present to past... over and over and over again!I really tried to like this game.

Crammed full of jokes and references that most half-witted gamers will clap their hands and giggle at, all I can do is groan and wonder just where this miserable excuse for a game will take me next. The music manages to become increasingly grating as it ""evolves."" Simply miraculous.

												Spurned forth from the success of Evoland Classic that won the 24th Ludum Dare, Evoland is like a short love letter to gaming history. Giving plenty of nods to well known classic games that set the bar for games of their time, like Legend of Zelda, Final Fantasy, and Diablo. If you've been a long time gamer, and looking for a trip down memory lane, then look no further than this series... Though I have heard that the sequel to this game does it better.=Complete Review==The Story: 2/5= Sadly, for as innovative as the game itself is, there's not much in terms of Story. You play as Clink, who is one of the few remaining members of the Order of the Dragon Knights, a group who roams the world aiding those in need and vanquishing evil. As things have been peaceful, there's not been much for the Order to do. But, with a uprising evil, and monsters flourishing in the world, there's once again need for a hero. And, being named after two already well known heroes, it's obvious who's going to fit the bill here. So sadly, it's a pretty cut-and-dry formula. Even their sort of plot twist near the ending kinda didn't come off that surprising, given who the two main characters are kinda named after. Still, they at least get a two for trying to have some semblance of a story here, as opposed to having none. =The User Interface: 2/5= This is, yet another area that is unfortunately lacking. Aside from what's typically on the screen, such as health (once you unlock it) and swapping weapons (again, once it's unlocked) there's literally not much you're going to do with it. They have a sort of stats and item menu, but there's not much you can even do with it. Still, as lacking as it is, it's at least there. Granted, I can't really name a game where you have no sort of interface to work with... =The Gameplay: 4/5= Ahh yes, one of two of the main boasting points of the game. The gameplay, if you're a long time gamer, will definitely seem very nostalgic, as it starts off in a playstyle very akin to the old 2D Legend of Zelda games. And through advancements and progression, eventually upgrades to a older Final Fantasy RPG style, before advancing to a 3D action adventure feel, with the overworld being that of a Final Fantasy 7 styled RPG combat system with a single area being reserved for a original Diablo style of combat. And while, it doesn't bring anything overly new in those styles, It manages all of this while managing to be fully functional in each playstyle and in the same game at that. Which, getting all those functions to work smoothly in one game is impressive alone. Not only that, there are a few puzzles that use switching between 2D and 3D to overcome, which is a pretty neat idea that was executed fairly well.=The Graphics: 4/5= Like the gameplay, this was another selling point of the game. Not because the graphics are like, next generation or anything like that. But because the game improves the graphics through progression. Starting out as a black-and-green LCD-esque display a la Gameboy, and later on advancing to that of 3D chibi-ish graphics akin to, but not up to the standard of the Final Fantasy DS remakes. And, just like the game play, the graphics are done well, and seem to have been seamlessly integrated in to the same game, and even switching between 2D and 3D is managed well with only little delay. Which, is quite impressive on it's own.=The Music: 3/5= The music isn't anything that would be the kind you'd be listening long after you played the game, but it doesn't downright suck either... But, it's also clear what games' tracks they're parodying as well. But given it also advances as you go through the game, and from what I remember, it compliments the Atmosphere of the game as well, it at least deserves a even score.=The Atmosphere: 3/5= It's basically your typical RPG Atmosphere. There's forests, grasslands, caves, deserts, and places where you know just from the look of things, that intense stuff's going to go down. Sadly, there's no nice snowy lands to see in this game. Which is a shame, as I'd have loved to see how they would have handled it. But, from what I recall, the music supports the atmospheres pretty nicely. =TL;DR/Pros & Cons=ProsInnovative idea that was pulled off fairly well.Various gameplay styles integrated well in to a singular game.Atmospheres are done decently, with music and tone to match setting.Neutral/Your Mileage May VaryThe entire game is primarily made to appeal to one's nostalgia of older games.There is a LOT of parody content, even the main characters are parodies.Graphics and Music improve with game progress.A LOT of things to collect up.Plenty of achievements.ConsPretty poor storyline.Not really much of a UI.=The Conclusion: 5/10= This is another one of those games that I wish Steam had a neutral rating, as it's just too hard to make a solid call on this one. As I did find quite a bit enjoyment in the game, I will have to list it as a positive instead of a negative. There is a lot of content that is a sort of your-mileage-may-vary on if it's the kind of game that you'd enjoy or not. It is definitely the kind of game to pick up when it's on sale, as it is sadly pretty short with little to no replay value. If you're a retro game lover, then it's definitely a game that would be worth it to purchase for you. But if you prefer graphics and newer model games to the old, then this game won't really do much for you. I hear the sequel has improved by leaps and bounds over the formulae presented by the first, and I do look forward to playing it and reviewing it some day. But, for now, thank you for reading my review.			"

												The price is low and so should your expectations be. The game is both short & misleading to some extent. By the looks of the teasers you get the expression that this game will take you through a journey through the evolution of gaming from the first console till current time tech. ""Well how bad could it be"" you might ask? Lets put it this way; You bought some chips, but you quickly realize theres nothing inside. Happy times.First of all. The whole evolution process happens within a blink of a moment. Some minutes of gameplay and you're already ""HD"". Your Chiwawa was sleeping on your bed, you went to grab some water and by the time you got back your dog is suddenly a St. Bernad.-Oh boy! What awaits you now that the whole point of the game has happend and you just started?-Compressed levels inspried by the early Legend of Zelda games, but it just doesnt feel right. Why? Because they tried making their own type LoZ. How did it go? Toilet!But it gets better! Suddenly you get to do turn based combat. Horray!.. Waite... Why is the only ability i have called attack..? Thats right! No abilities, only ""chop-chop"" becuase who likes variarity!?And so it goes for roughly two to three hours cause that's how long it takes to beat this game. You can add an additional hour or two if you wish to do a 100% run. Games are supposed to give you a good time & make the time fly. This game, on the other hand, tortures you while you're playing the game. Why should you buy this game?You get to (barely) play the game in classic/ old fashion style..You see some familiarity with other great games (Legend of Zelda, Final Fantasy ect).A somewhat feeling of nostalgia.Why should you buy that bag of chips instead?You're not going to get what you think you're getting.Very Short game.There's no variarity in the game.The bag of chips does infact have chips inside of it.Do yourself a favour and buy yourself that bag with chips instead of investing here.

												You can buy an item that reduces loading times/screens. They thought that on top of slowly unlocking basic features and better graphics, it would be a good idea.Also the random encounter rate is obnoxiously high and you can't save on the world map, or maybe I didn't unlock that feature?Not worth the time.

												Evoland is awesome.  It starts off in monochrome, original Gameboy graphics and--through in-game actions--gradually becomes a 3D, high-def game with dynamic lighting.  There are homages to The Legend of Zelda, Final Fantasy, Super Mario Brothers, Dragon Quest, Diablo, even the Terry Pratchett ""Discworld"" series is given a nod.  This game is short, but it is fun and is very well done.  I recommend Evoland to anyone, but especially those who have lived through the evolution of video gaming and can appreciate seeing the technology's emulated evolution as you play.			"

												This game isn't nearly as cute as it thinks it is.One of the devs must have wrote an exhaustive list of every cliche in video games, and then put every single one in a checkbox, to use once and then ignore. Pushbutton switches? Okay, walk over one and then never see one again. An enemy you defeat by bumping into a hole instead of attacking? Great, you've got it, moving on now...Evoland never does anything interesting with any of the mechanics it shows you; it just points out that they exist and then hurries you on to the next mini-achievement or lame fourth-wall-breaking gag. I suspect the developers do this because they realize the gimmick of the game runs thin fast, and they're just trying to get you through it mercifully quickly. Hopefully, they reason, you'll be too distracted by the next flashy graphical effect to realize the game is all smirking irreverence and no substance.This attitude reveals that the devs don't understand why the games they're aping are great. People didn't like Zelda becuase it had 8-bit graphics, a sword that you can cut bushes with, and  the ability to move from one tiny corridor and cramped room to the next. They liked it because the world was expansive and interesting, the combat was challenging but fair, there were actual puzzles where the solution wasn't immediately obvious (because, haha, the JOKE is that the solution is obvious, get it? Isn't this a fun way to spend your time? Haha!)Evoland isn't a good game, and it's not even a good homage to actually good games, because it merely mimicks the surface of classic gaming. This game is the kind of mass-produced soulless single-severing Nostalgia™ that you see on ThinkGeek or LootCrate. Don't support this.			"

												The first 30 minutes to an hour are great. Afterwards, you can put it down. It tries to have a story, which pathetically weak. In summary, bad stuff is apparantly happening, though it's hard to actually tell anything is wrong. A few hours in, you find the bad guy. You immediately go to another place where you face him, and the game is over. That's the plot. None of this is in the early part of the game, and that's fine. You're too busy getting frequent upgrades to the graphics, sound, gameplay, and the UI. Unfortunately, this means there are few left to find for the majority of the game. In one dungeon, you transition from top-down Zelda style gameplay to Diablo. This even includes equipment which do absolutely nothing to your character. Oh, and this system is completely gone after that dungeon. There's no real reason why. The final boss is fought back in the top-down Zelda style, but performs quite poorly. You're stuck with 3 hearts, no manner of pausing, and you can only use your sword instead of bombs or a bow. Those upgrades you found throughout the game? Can't use them for absolutely no reason. Not even a BS reason like dropping them. You just can't. The boss is simple, but inconsistent in movement. This is compounded with framerate issues that I didn't have until that fight. It's frustrating to have a small opening to attack, but the framerate jumped, so you broke a sprinting record. I loved the concept and was hooked from the start...until they made it clear that this 3 or so hour game was made by people with only 30 minutes of good ideas.			"

												Evoland is a frustrating experience. Many reviews already cover problems with Evoland's execution, but several problems that affected me include: Two types of collectibles, stars and cards. Understandably, there is no record of which stars you have collected, but there is no reason why there should not be a record of the cards you have collected, as they are used to play an in-game card game. Immensely high frequency random encounters. An extremely poor game design choice, the random encounters occur after no more than 5 seconds of walking in the overworld and take a long time to either fight or run from.Sub-par saving system. While it can be an important part of the design of a game when saves are allowed, Evoland does not seem to be a game that aims to punish you through lack of saves, yet it does. Namely, on one of the mid-game bosses you can die on the way back to town after his defeat, which is entirely possible if you simply try to run from fights on your way back to town due to the aforementioned high frequency encounters (as one may very well do, as the game is rather boring anyway). After dying on the way back to town you will find yourself having to repeat the boss battle. As the battle is one where you are scripted to die, you will try to just die as fast as possible until you find out that you actually had to make it rather far in the battle before you die or you get a game over screen instead of story progression. Frustration thereby abounds. Honestly, the save system is adequate enough in any location except this particular boss, but is aggravating enough on that boss to have warranted a large chunk of this write-up.Very possible to softlock your game. As happened to me, it's not difficult to land the airship you get for overworld transportation towards the end of the game (which finally bypasses the random encounters!) in an area where you can no longer get back into the ship. Not a deal breaker if it was only a luxury, but it is actually required to make it to the final boss. Ultimately, this game does do a bit of what it aimed in terms of telling a tale of the history of video games, at least in the RPG genre, but several major errors with design really make it an overall unpleasant experience. For those looking at Evoland for a 100% achievement game, it will likely not be the most fun you've had perfecting games, but you will find it managable in about five hours if you remember to keep track or remember the locations of the stars and cards you have collected.

												I cannot comprehend the fact that this game was sold ten euros/dollars.I'll explain ; to me, this game is very fun at first and is a good way to learn more about how video games evolved. It's also funny in some little references to other games or persons from the video game and internet culture. Though positive points about this game end here.First of all, as I said, the price ; for a game 3-4 hours long, ten euros is too much. For the same price you'll find games like Terraria on which you'll spend hundreds of hours. Spot the difference.Then, what shocked me the most is the complete lack of personnality of that game ; it looks like Shiro Games wanted to put as many references as possible, so much that there is nothing in this game who makes it stand out from others, apart from the obvious fact that you evolve across history (though it IS fun and kind of addicting at first, it quickly gets completely useless). The gameplay has nothing special (since it's just a copy and paste of other games, with all the actual interesting stuff gone), the characters are plain annoying, moving around is painfully slow, and... Good lord, can this game be more boring? In fact, it feels more like a very long tutorial then an actual game, and I think that's what makes it the exact contrary of fun. Past the very first zones, you quickly start thinking ""Hey, when's the true game gonna start?"", and all you get is a very synthetic and really bad version of good gameplays, which you don't even have time to enjoy.Apart from the failed gameplay, the thing that angried me the most is THE FINAL BOSS. As of now, this is the worst final boss I've ever seen, adding a huge difficulty spike right at the end for free and gratuitous rage. Three phases, all more and more horribly, ridiculously, horrendously annoying, for a disappointing end. After a game full of video game puns, you'd expect a little cutscene, something to make you feel AT LEAST like you've achieved something, even if it contains a terrible joke.. Too bad ; you get nothing but credits. Thanks for the effort.As a rating, I won't recommend this game. Or at least not when it's at full price ; it'll keep you from extreme boredom for a few hours. Though seriously, at the same price? Read a book. You'll have more fun than in this insipid game.			"

												Let me start by saying this game is pretty excellent, though it has some design errors that are kinda exasperating.The game is awesome in doing what it wants, giving you nostalgia and making you remember the good old days of your childhood!The errors in design (like asking you to complete a collection of cards but showing you only X/23 instead of which cards you are missing or earning) are pretty hurtful. However the concept of this game is pure awesomeness.I personally, who would like to make my own videogames someday, enjoyed the mechanic of progression in game a lot.7.5/10 Has some flaws by trying to keep it simple but the concept is pretty awesome and its shortness allows you to not get frustrated that much by its flaws.

												Evoland's gimmick is a progression through different graphical and gameplay styles using the usual fantasy adventure and RPG tropes. As you progress through the game, you discover different graphical upgrades (from black and white to color, from 2D to 3D, etc.) and gameplay systems (now you have save points!). Different areas of the game feature different combat mechanics, from sword-swinging action to turn-based RPG battles to point-and-click ARPG encounters.Evoland is both a parody and homage at the same time, primarily riffing on the Legend of Zelda, Final Fantasy, and Diablo (but there are nods to others). It's appreciation for the source material is obvious, but it's not afraid to poke fun at the tropes, either. Some of the humor didn't hit squarely for me, and produced more eye rolls than laughs, but it didn't detract from my overall enjoyment of the game.The gameplay is neither long nor deep, but if you have an affinity for the source material it draws from, Evoland is an enjoyable way to spend a weekend.

It's not long - which is a good thing with that game actually - but still quite original and just a great way to kill some time.

												A relatively short romp through a game full of various artistic styles and JRPG cliches, shamelessly taking wholesale from retro games. The game exchanges depth for breadth, choosing to give you lots of new systems to make up for no one system having a great deal of complexity. The game is short enough to where none of it wears on too long, and if you're an avid fan of JRPGs, you'll probably catch every tongue in cheek reference along the way. For some, it could wear thing, but it didn't for me, so I had a good time with it. Your mileage may vary. The game is fun enough, but the plot is thin and serves more as a parody of RPGs than a story in its own right.Was pleasantly surprised by one particular segment towards the end of the game that gave a dramatic shift in game style for the area, and was a great change of pace.Music direction was not great for me. It felt very repetitive and monotonous, and I found myself tiring of it very quickly. It, along with the simplistic combat, and the irritation of hitboxes in the ""zelda"" sections were my main flaws I found with the game.Would recommend on sale.			"

While a short game with about 4 or 5 hours of game time if you collect everything and get all the achievements, it's still a nice game that changes visuals from the beginning to about halfway through the game.

												Evoland is a walk down memory lane for anyone who has played a flurry of early adventure and rpg games. The game mimics styles of black and white, limited color, turn based battle, & real time battle games. It cycles you through these game types in an attempt to display a timeline of the evolution of these games. Through style or substance you may find Evoland ""winking at you"" and reminding you of past gaming experiences. Near the end of the game you may find yourself searching through the various evolutions of gameplay in order to achieve a higher completion level of the game.Evoland offers real time battles and turn based battles. The real time battles can be frustrating at times and the turn based battles seem lackluster in a game with so few items and so little to gain from turn based combat. The game is fairly short but can be adequately drawn out by collecting all the cards and stars. All in all Evoland offers a unique experience but may end up making you yearn for a more complete version of one of its styles of gameplay rather than the game itself as a whole.			"

												Evoland is game about the history of action-adventure games, with a few RPG elements mixed in.The game starts as a simple, black and white, 8-bit adventure, but as you progress, you gain more elements such as music, color, 32-bit graphics, and overworld, turn-based-battles, and other elements of action-adventure games. This is by far my favorite part of the game, it's fun, humorous, and is reminiscent of early NES-SNES games. More things elements pile on, such as a partner, NPCs, shops, and currency. Eventually you gain the third dimension. However, that is when I feel the game takes the most risks, and also the experience starts to dampen. The first official dungeon in the third dimension is frustrating, the combat is slow and ineffective at some points, requiring you to run away, or face having to start over the dungeon. This is probably the most frustrating part of the game, but alas, you get to the boss. The boss is unexpectedly difficult for first-time players. Afterwards, you re-emerge in a new area of the overworld, with new enemies, and HD graphics. After this, the experience is still slowly dampening.. There is a small required side quest. If you bought an item called the ""Fast CD player"", this side-quest is much less time-wasting. Without it, the game creates fake loading screens that are nothing but unnecessary.  After this, you access two of my favorite areas of the game, an area where you use crystals to change from 2-D to 3-D, which works as a time puzzle. In this area you gain the bow, which is very useful here, but not anywhere else. Afterwards, we visit an area which both parodies Diablo and useless items in video games, such as an item that grants +300% damage to walls. Around here I should mention the humor. Evoland, is a very witty game. Making lots of jokes and some of its areas are parodies of other games.  I should also mention that whenever you gain an element, a small text box appears and says a short joke, or a relating commentary of some video games.The final boss is interesting; it uses mechanics of other games, and puts them into one boss. However, one flaw with this fight is your character's speed. At every other areas in the game, your speed is perfectly fine, but here, you sometimes make the fight too easy or too hard.There is one minigame, Double Twin, which I find to be great fun, it is a card game, requiring you to use the cards you have found all through the game. Double Twin has around 4 levels, which are all different in their own way, with the opponent using a different deck of cards every time.I feel lke $10 is a little much for a 4 hour game, but the creators did go for quality and humor for the entirety of Evoland. It is a fun game, I actually recently finished my second playthrough, which I felt was more of an achievement run. The game does have its flaws, but it also has its great moments. Evoland earns a 7/10. "

												This game takes you thru the history of video games. You start out with black and white visuals, no sound and only the ability to move right and left. Slowly it evolves through all the visuals, sounds and game plays over the years, that are seen in the so well know: Zelda, Mario, Dragon Quest, Diablo and Final Fantasy games.The early stages of the game look a lot like the old Zelda games. You start with a sword and have to hack thru bushes and monsters, all along the background music seems awfully familiar and gives a nostalgic feel. Ah those good old days and decent games, where have they been? WELL RIGHT HERE!!! Bundled in one amazing and special little game.As you play thru this game’s different game styles, you notice the small details that reference to oldies, for example: is the main character’s name by default Clink and wears a green outfit and has blond hair, does he start out as a kid and grows into an adult (might be Link’s younger brother). The currency that is used is gli... apposing the final fantasy currency gil.Along your journey you come across people in need who gladly join your team and fight the big bad monsters in some gloomy. There isn’t any deep storyline, besides the regular: girl needs help saving her village from an evildoer.If you like old-school rpg/adventure games this game will put a smile on your face. This game is a must-play!+Pros:- Reliving childhood memories of classic games.- Experience the evolution of graphics, battle system and sound in games.- Highly entertaining-Cons:- Not much of a storyline.- Simple combat system and exploration.- Can finish the game in a few hours.Score:7.9			"

												Journey from humble NES/Gameboy pixels all the way to Playstation/PS1 3D graphics. Revisit old school gameplay lifted from games such as The Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening, Final Fantasy VI/VII and Diablo.Instead of a traditional RPG, Evoland feels more like an interactive history field trip for classic RPGs. Recommend it for older gamers who experienced firsthand the major video gaming shifts of the 90s.Note that this is definitely a poor choice for younger gamers unless they have a taste for retro gaming.

												So I played got this thinking it would be one part nostalgia mixed with one part comedy and perhaps a few other elements. Instead it is five parts boring with one part nostalgia. So once you have clicked through the ""eras"" of video games it falls flat very fast and is just boring. Gimmick game. Not worth it.			"

												This game will hit you right in the nostalgia. Although short and simple, if you have enjoyed Legend of Zelda, Final Fantasy, Chrono Trigger and such, you will find yourself smiling quite a lot during this game as you journey through the evolution of the RPGs that we have all grown up with. I enjoyed it.			"

												I actually like the game to the point that I finished all the achievements.This game will take you to the evolution of (some) games in the past to the future.However, the game somewhat gets boring at times especially in the Turn Based Fighting Style mode as it gets repetitive. (Or maybe if you are a fan of turn based fighting, you will find it interesting).The story and/or game is just short and you can probably complete it by 5 to 7 hours (and can be more if you want to finish all the achievements you have not achieved).Overall, I rate this game 7/10.

												All in all this was a fun trip down memory lane. It basically plays like a mix of Zelda and Final Fantasy IV/VII, with a quick nod to Diablo for one dungeon. I liked it a lot. The only things I had issues with were the inventory being basically pointless (I would have liked to see which cards I had collected) and the frequency of random battles is ridiculously high. I mean, you finish them quick anyway, but it was all the damn time.Would definitely recommend to any fans of old RPGs or adventure games.			"

												Really well made nostalgia trip for any jRPG fan, but not necessarily a good game on its own. Evoland takes you through the ""evolution"" of the genre with ideas and mechanics taken from titles such as Zelda, Final Fantasy, and even Diablo. It's really clever, original and quite accurate, as it shows not only how the games changed from the gameplay standpoint, but also on the audiovisual level.That said, on its own Evoland is not a great game. It's simple, linear, often tedious. About halfway through you unlock the ""final"" graphics style, but there's still a lot to do. At this point the game starts to drag on, as none of the combat systems is fleshed out, enemy variety is very small, levels are hard to navigate without a map, and the story is basic and straightforward.I'd still recommend it as a cute and funny experience. Any person familiar with some of the old-school RPGs will find a lot of references here. Plus, the game isn't long, so it may be worth getting during a sale.			"

												One of very few games lately that kept my attention and kept me playing right til the end. I completed it. That's rare for me nowadays.I really don't understand all the negative reviews, I guess people are expecting a full RPG experience. The game is cheap, cheerful and short. It has many references to other games, often they are quite humorous. Gameplay at its core is enjoyable. No reems of text to read through (Random encounters do happen a little too often though).All in all, don't go in expecting a full RPG that takes itself seriously, and I think you'll be pleasantly surprised by just how much fun you get out of this.

												Evolution of JRPG from point of view of US is main concept of this game.The concept is very interesting, but this game failed to realization.Why did this game mix FF and Zelda? They are another species, it's like confusing with the dog and cat.Why did this game implement ""HD-UI"" before ""Pre-rendering graphics""?Why did this game start by monochrome graphics?  First zelda is colored.Why did this game take Diablo-style? ""Hack & Slash"" style like Diablo is not typical style of JRPG. If this game's purpose is follow all RPG, this game lose Ultima/Wizardry/Dungeon Master/Rogue/Might and Magic/And more.But, the above dissatisfaction is trivial.The biggest problem of this game is ""boring"".In FF-like part, ATB is very simple. You can win the enermy just to select 'Atack' and 'Heal'. (MP is no limit.) Strategy has been lacking this game. In addition it, In this game, frequency to encounter the enemy is very high!Zelda-like part is just deterioration version of zelda. I got flustrated by slow speed of walking. There is an excellent idea only one, that is ""switching 2D-3D"". But, that is very small part of this game.If you have strong nostalgia for JRPG, I wouldn't stop you to buy this game.But, you should be prepared to boring.			"

												The good:- Innovative game design- Whimsical, humorous romp through videogame history backed by solid gameplay- The ability to switch between 3d and 2d interface, acquired in the late game, was brilliant, and made for some interesting puzzles- The Diablo-clone section was another high point, and was a lot of funThe bad:- The game begins to drag in the second half: once you reach 3d graphics, the game more or less stops ""evolving"", and becomes a fairly typical RPG.- The most entertaining parts of the game (as above) are far too short.- Random encounters are altogether too frequent, and become irritating- A bit too easy - a competent gamer can beat the game and claim all achievements in around 6-8 hours- Low replay value: once you've played the game, there isn't much reason to do it all over againOverall: This is a wonderful game and is quite fun, so I recommend it. It has its flaws, but the experience is compelling enough to be worth the purchase.			"

It could have been MUCH MUCH better, yet it was released way too early as a small game. As mentioned before, this game was fun to play, but only because I bought it when it was here for 2,49€.

												Quick review: nice premise, poor execution.Longer reviewThis first caught my eye a while back and I liked central idea behind it - a game where collectables really do advance things. So, having seen it in a bundle the other day I snapped it up.Up until hitting the first dungeon I thought it was interesting and could pass-off the ropeyness as part of the charm and/or the intention of trying to mimic the games of the time. After hitting that first 3D dungeon though my goodwill evaporated. Awful collision-detection and hit boxes were the primary reasons but moreover none of the mechanics were well implemented.I know some folks are saying it's a parody (except it isn't funny at all), some say it is a homage (except it doesn't really do any of the games it is aping any justice); I consider it an experiment, something backed-up by the fact that the sequel is about 15-20 hours I believe. Unfortunately I find it to be a failed experiment, with the Diablo-esque segment feeling most out of place.There's no polish here; there's no depth to any of the sections, the narrative is clumsy and wafer-thing and it doesn't really chart an evolution as much as it thinks it does. I actually think it looks its best right at the start; the 3D in particular is horrible to look at.  And that final boss is awful - relying on the dodgy collision-detection again and a ridiculously small timing window for part of it - urgh.I had the sequel on my wishlist but no more; the fact that this failed to entertain me in my 3 or so hours playtime means I don't have any confidence that an extended playtime would be any more fun.

												DISCLAIMER: This is a repost from my blog at www.stanislavcostiuc.com. I don't write reviews. I write opinion and impressions pieces, meaning the detalization may vary from just general feelings about a game to indepth critique of particular game mechanics. Read if you're interested to know if I like a game or not (and for what reasons), which parts intrigue me and which parts push me away, but don't expect in-depth description of all gameplay and systems. Thank you.From the very moment I pressed ‘New Game’, I fell in love with Evoland. It’s a game that integrates evolution of the action/adventure, RPG and JRPG genres in its mechanics, starting out with a GameBoy black and white Zelda-like experience and ending with a full-fledged 3D boss battle. It’s simply amazing. But.It doesn’t really hold up as a game that well. Ironic, isn’t it? It’s a great, and, most importantly, niche experience. If you’ve played video games for the past 15-20 years at the least, or you were/are interested in a lot of old games before your time, I think you’ll find this nostalgic trip quite enjoyable. I mean, come on, you get to buy an upgrade that removes CD loading times (that were indeed put on purpose) from the PlayStation era locations. How cool is that?But the game is very basic. It’s got mechanics from Zelda, Final Fantasy and Diablo, and they all, while present a solid foundation, don’t have much depth to them. There are clever moments, don’t get me wrong, and the part where you time travel between Old and New graphics has got to be the most enjoyable section of the game, but it doesn’t feel enough. The soundtrack is really cool though, and game-related humor is amazing.Still, this brings up an interesting question. Does a game need to have flawless mechanics that do not get old quickly to truly enjoy it? Perhaps that’s a topic that requires a more detailed discussion later. But at least in case of Evoland, I can honestly say – no. No it doesn’t. I loved every second of it.			"

												A wonderful game, fun, interesting, pretty(Most of the time. Gets ugly for a bit then you upgrade the graphics again and it's better). Has a few issues however...-Pros-1: Lots of hidden stuff and the game within the game is cool and meta. 2: Upgrading the game as the story progresses is interesting.3: Cute story... once you unlock it.4: Humor that makes you grin and sometimes laugh.5: Pleasant puzzles... not hard... but fun little thoughts.6: Pretty in every form but one.-Cons-1: Too short... noticable because how fun it is. Nine dollars and ninty-nine cents worth of adventure if you go after collectables. Not a cent more included.2: TOO many random encounters in the field without them being unique enough to be worth my time.3: Too linear. After a while i was hoping for a ""Side Quests Unlocked!"" or ""Branching Plot!"" but nope. 4/5 then you hit the end and realize the fun has stopped and it drops a point. Worth the buy for the interesting concept and fun by itself. Main problem is there wasn't MORE of it in many ways. 3/5			"

Seriously, they change the whole game, literally. Fun at first, but soon traps you in an endless loop of ""Where do I go?"", and ""This again?"".Collecting everything is a pain too, so I wouldn't recommend trying to do that on your first playthrough.The cards are a waste of time and the stars give me no motivation to try to collect 'em all.Short and kind of innovative, but after you upgrade to the 3D RPG, it falls flat.

												Evoland is terrible. Do not buy it. Do not support people that make such a terrible product for the sole purpose of cashing in on the retro game type. It does a disservice the fond memories I have of older RPG styles. Instead of taking the cherished concepts of older RPGs and enhancing them while learning from or smoothing out the more archaic contrivances of older games, Evoland takes those slight annoyances you feel while re-playing an older Legend of Zeldas or Final Fantasy and makes a game out of them. Go replay an older FInal Fantasy, Legend of Zelda, or Dragon Quest instead of buying Evoland. I recommend burning your money rather than buying this game.You will be a better person for not purchasing this game.			"

You travell in a short line through the history of RPG. Started with 8-bit Graphics to unlocking colors and 3d model´s and shader´s and Antialiasing. Okay as RPG creator i can say the story was build randomly like: I think i try something and writte a old script down. But the story isn´t really the factor on this game. It´s just funny to see how the game change with time and some nostalgic players will fell really emotions to thinking about their childhood and old-school game formats.Many Tetxt, short sense:It´s only to expensiv but still worthy to play.

												Welcome to Evoland! The story a boy who starts off in the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ 2D evironments. But as he evolves, so does the world.First let me tell you what this game is:This game is for fans of Zelda and Final Fantasy type RPG's. It basically shows the evolution of RPG's, and how they start boring and 2D, to a great 3D environment. In this review I'll be giving the brief description, plot, creativity, graphics, sound, who's it good for, how enjoyable it is and the verdict. Each part of the review I will rate it out of 10 and then at the verdict, I'll give the overall score which will be an average.Description:Title: Evoland Rating: Not RatedPlatform: PCGenre: RPGPlot:Now like I said, this game shows the evolution of RPG's though still has a plot. You start of waking up and exploring the land. As this is the evolution of RPG's, this game starts off 2D and black and white. But that soon changes to colour, then 8 square movement, then soon 3D, and HD. I love the idea of that. Everytime you open the chest a new improvement happens to the game. But as you trek further into the game, you'll realise that some of these upgrades you were given, were given way too early. And by the end of the game there's barely any chests. The plot is about a boy who finds out that he is the key to saving the world of Evoland and treches through the small villages and the tricky dungeons. Thats all there really is about the plot. There is a little bit of twists and turns but not a lot to make me like the plot. What did make me keep playing was how every chest I opened I was excited to see what happened to the game. But as their are fewer chests later during the game its hard to keep playing.5/10Creativity:Well, this game is centered around the evolution of RPG games, as a video game! Hell, the game ain't perfect but this idea is EPIC!10/10Graphics:Yes, this game starts off with ♥♥♥♥♥♥ graphics. buts its supposed to give ♥♥♥♥♥♥ graphics to tell you how RPG's were back then. But as you open more chests, the game turns more modern and just the same to the graphics. The graphics are pretty good though there are some frame rate drops.7/10Sound:I haven't played this game in a while, so I can't remember the music that much, but all RPG's are expected great music. Now this music is pretty good, but, (yes I know this is an indie game) compared to other RPG's, the music stands nowhere near.6/10Who would like this game?This game incorparates two of the most famous RPG styles. Adventure and turn-based. When I mean adventure I mean Zelda style. And when I mean turn-based I mean Final Fantasy style. Now this game incorporates both, (and a bit of puzzles too), to make a pretty good game. Though who is it good for? Well if you don't like RPG's then you'll hate this game. But if you like RPG's, definitely try this. Its nowhere near those great RPG games like Pokemon, Zelda, Final Fantasy, Skyrim. But you will be satisfyed, Definetely if you are curious on how RPG games evolved. But like I said, if you dont like RPG's, don't even consider this game.How enjoyable is this game?This game is best enjoyable at the start, definitely at the start, its so fun adventuring, waiting for the other chest and then the how screen just turns into something different. The end can get quite bland though as nothing new comes and it gets really boring. I have to admit, I haven't finished the final boss fight. I just can't be stuffed.5/10Verdict:Fans of RPG games will like this. There are some downfalls, but the start will suck you in and I hope that you do play it, even if you can't be stuffed playing the end.Plot: 5/10Creativity: 10/10Graphics: 7/10Sound: 6/10Enjoyability: 5/10OVERALL: Buy this game only if your sure you will like it (6.6/10) "

												Eeh, I dunno. I like the starting parts, but after the start of the game it quickly abandons its premise of being ""a journey through the history of action/adventure gaming"" and just becomes a straight parody of a few different games, most notably Final Fantasy 7.Also, ""it's a parody of JRPGs!"" does not excuse being a terrible JRPG with bad combat. Dragon Fantasy Book 1 for Vita needs to have heard that too.			"

												Sad to say, this is like lots of games you remember fondly, except not actually good.There are much better homages to retro games here on Steam. Things that do it better, or cross the old with the new. One I would recommend is ""A Pixel Story"", though the gameplay is 2D platforming rather than RPG.We also have such things as ""Virtual Console"" and PSN and GOG nowadays selling older games, and there even some oldies here on Steam; you're much better off hunting down actual downloads of these classic games and playing them for a while.

												Evoland is a great game that will take you back through time.You'll get a chance to revisit the evolution of adventure/rpg games and perhaps even meet some of your old friends along the way. The transitions and handling of the different styles of play is beautifully accomplished and the game does everything it intended to accomplish. The story is a little simple, but that's not why we are playing Evoland. We are playing it to experience our own experiences again. And if you're too young, then you'll get a chance to see what some of us suffered through in our willingness to enjoy a great story. The game handles almost everything well except for a few things.When movement is mostly free and open, the airship can only go up/down, left/right.When features have been unlocked, sometimes they don't work in previous areas: mini-map, hp-meterBut the most important issue that plagues this game, is the controller support. This game essentially requires it, but semi-hacks are required to get controllers working. This is not a good solution. I had to give the game and pad detection program admin rights in order for it to recognize my Logitech Gamepad. Similar stories abound in the Discussion forums.Aside from these issues, this game is fun to play, and going after the achievements is not the horrible grind it could be. The game actually helps you with the two hardest ones by giving you clues to the location of things you are missing. <3Hopefully the developers will get the gamepad nonsense sorted out before they release Evoland 2, but if you haven't played Evoland it is definitely worth it. 8/10 (Primarily because of gamepad issues & backwards compatible upgrades)P.S. I'm not sure why Steam thinks I've played it so little, it probably has something to do with giving Evoland admin rights. :/ Another issue. I've 100%ed the game but Steam thinks I have 5 mins on it.			"

												An incredibly interesting concept that ultimately flops on its face. Play your way through an evolving game world that begins as basic as an NES game and ends up as advanced as an NES game with the graphics of a playstation 1 game. Combat evolves from basic ""press A to slash your sword"" into final fantasy style turn based combat that that boils down to ""press A to slash your sword...on your turn"". The story offers no explanation as to the changing game landscape and playstyle and opts for a trope heavy ""evil wizard in a dark tower torturing the countryside"" plot that really adds nothing to keep you invested in playing the game. I had to muscle hard to pay attention through just a few hours of gameplay. It seems like the developers got so excited to run with their core idea of an evolving playstyle game that they ran right past the part of development where they make the game fun or interesting beyond the original idea. The only potentially redeeming quality is if you are an extremely nostalgic person who misses playing great NES, SNES and PS1 games and wants to tumble through those same types of games without having to worry about becoming emotionally invested in characters, environment, story, or even exciting or challenging gameplay. But if you wanted to do that then your time would really be better spent on playing one of those older games instead, cause this will leave you yawning instead of satisfied.			"

												It starts really promising and keeps getting better until about half-way into the game. The idea of the game is really good and for about 2 hours it works out great... and then the game just becomes utterly boring and tedious. The game is too short, parodies its originals badly and has absolutely no replay value at all.With a play time of 5-7 hours (which will include a fair amount of grinding) it's not worth 10$. If you have a chance to get it for cheap you might want to have a look for the gimmick that it offers, but it wears off quick and the 'leftovers' of this 'game' won't keep you entertained.			"

												Don't buy this game. It thinks that making the joke/referece over and over again is a good idea, instead of just pointing at it a little and be done with it. You even have to buy an item to reduce the loading times for quite a hefty sum of gold.Evoland has the problem that even when they use a tried and true formula, it's still really boring and while I was determined to finish the game, I bumped into a game-breaking bug and was never able to finish the game. The bug was initiated backtracking to the very beginning of the game after getting the Bomb if you still want to pay for this game. I strongly advise not to, if you want to relive the quirks of old games, just pop a ROM into an emulator, you'll get much more from that.			"

												For the first half hour to an hour this is pretty fun, as you constantly ""unlock"" new game mechanics and improvements, such as scrolling screens, various eras of sound and colour, turn-based battles and 3D environments. This all comes in a quick burst however, and you quickly stop discovering anything ""new"", leaving the remaining few hours of gameplay as a cheap Legend of Zelda clone with some Final Fantasy elements and a brief Diablo-like section.At points the game pokes fun at the early days of video games, mentioning the shallow plots and 8-bit music. However, this seems to be a cheap shot, as (even if intended) Evoland has awful plot and music, and even the sound effects that you ""unlock"" are pretty terrible. As for difficulty, even the game's ""completionist"" achievements, collecting stars and cards, are mindlessly easy which leaves a rather empty feeling of accomplishment upon finishing everything Evoland has to offer.If Evoland had continued on as its first hour does, and provided the promised journey through the history of early video games, there would be a bit of potential here and could even make for a quick, fun and interesting game. As it stands though, there's little here beyond the first section, and we're left with a rather boring and pointless offering. Shame that.			"

												When it comes to humor, gaming humor is about as low-brow as it gets, as it consists on not so much jokes or satire as it is a vapid stream of obvious and shallow references. Evoland is meant to be a tongue-in-cheek love letter to classic jRPGs. Unfortunately, as a love-letter, is is a flaccid and unflattering presentation, and as a piece of gaming humor, it doesn't do much more than ape Legend of Zelda, Final Fantasy 7 and Diablo.One of the defining points of this game is that as you play through it, you collect systems that slowly update the game's graphics and gameplay, giving the impression of the game evolving through the ages. Unfortunately, of all the systems they aped for the gameplay, this game somehow manages to make them less compelling than the original material. From the janky hitboxes for the top-down gameplay system, the overall lack of enemy variety, the annoyingly high encounter rate for the random turn-based battle encounters, to the Diablo-style loot that does absolutely nothing. (Which completely misses the mark because almost every loot item in this type of game adds something new to the play style.) In fact, when the world opened up near the end of the game, I was so daunted and irritated by the tedious and frequent random encounters that I would have put the game down for good if if weren't for the fact that I am literally one fight away from finishing the game. There are a couple of good things I could say about the gameplay, and it involves the dimensional swapping mechanic, and the action RPG bit of the final boss. (Which is still not as exciting or compelling as the boss fights from Ys Origins, and lacks the dungeon crawling action that is often associated with them.)The story is the weakest point of the game, which is ironic since it's supposed to be an RPG that is a love letter to RPG games of the past that had a lot of imaginative and epic stories. In fact, it is one of the most creatively bankrupt RPGs I have ever seen as far as stories go. It is very little more than copying the tropes set by classic RPGs of the past, and the fact that the title and the world is called Evoland should be indicative of this, and that isn't as bad as it gets, believe me.The only really good point about this game is that the music is really good. On their own, they would be really fun to listen to, and I really wish that the soundtrack was more varied than it was.So do I recommend this game? No. Even if it's on sale for less than a dollar, I cannot really recommend this game because it is not only priced more than it is worth, it is also very taxing on your patience as it does nothing with the premise that is compelling or less aggravating than it was in the old games, nor does it do anything fresh, inspiring or funny with the premise, story-wise. All it does is remind me how much I hate random encounters, and how I am glad that some modern jRPGs got rid of it for something that lets players initiate battles themselves.Save your time and money. Use it to buy and play the actual old-school RPGs like Ys, Titan Quest, Diablo, The Elder Scrolls, Half Minute Hero, The Carpe Fulgur Collection, or even Final Fantasy. They would be far more worth your time and money than this vapid piece of gaming junk.			"

												Whilst the concept is promising, and the art is attractive, Evoland fails to be anything but a bland mess. It starts off with high hopes for itself, unlocking different technologies and gameplay mechanics, but never uses these in any significantly clever way. You unlock SNES-era graphics before fighting the first boss, and 3D immediately after, without exploring any of the pre-3D game eras in any depth, reducing the ""Evo"" part of Evoland to a lame gimmick.The game itself is a shallow parody of RPGs, where the only tactics you have during the Final Fantasy sections are ""Clink attacks, the girl heals"". There is no strategy involved, just pure grinding. Even when you get an attack spell for her, it's completely pointless, as healing will make you untouchable. The Zelda parts are better programmed, but suffer from a lot of technical issues, such as poor telegraphing of enemy attacks, camera angle issues, projectiles blending into background objects (such as fire over lava), poor telegraphing of trapdoors (that will instantly fall away when you are close to them, rather than at a distance where it is comfortable to react to them), and a lack of reach on your weapon, which barely covers one player length.In general, the camera is too tightly shot, making the player character huge in comparison to the screen, leaving the player to feel claustrophobic even in the most cyclopean vistas. The enemies have very poor attack patterns (the red wizards in particular, whose attack comes directly after they teleport with no antipatory action, and their teleporting away comes directly after that). The final fantasy sections have the random encounters ramped way up, and with no strategy for dealing with the enemies, it becomes boring and grindy almost as soon as you realise there's no way to defeat said enemies apart from bashing them with your sword.The Diablo area is a huge mess, using the Legend of Zelda mechanics to bitterly jab at Diablo's loot-centric and many-enemy mechanics. It is clear that the game designer doesn't like Diablo, and hasn't played for more than ten minutes. The only way to complete that area is to stay back and use the otherwise pointless combo attack, which locks you into attacking straight in front of you without invincibility frames. I would have liked to have seen a spinning attack, since the game cribs on Legend of Zelda in every other regard anyway.The final boss is a boring slog, again, too fast and not telegraphed enough for it to feel natural playing against it.The game had potential, but squandered it by not having any decent game mechanics, or a story that wasn't slapped together in five minutes to brainlessly parody Final Fantasy. If you watch the trailer you've practically got everything the game has to offer.Stay away from this non-game.			"

												This game has such a good idea going for it. And it really uses that idea effectively early on, but then it just gets dull.You start of with very minimal black and white graphics, and from then on you progress throughout mechanics and innovations in gaming over the years. It's really engaging and interesting! You slowly increase the graphics from 8bit to 32 and so on. You unlock these features through the opening of chests. And it's a really nice feeling when you stumble upon one, and get to see the big improvement. - It's really satisfying.But then about midway through it attemps to have a story and it's own unique gameplay. And it sucks. Suddenly, this nice fast paced game becomes a slow, repetitive, irratating snorefest. At one point you come into a cave - and your goal is to find a crystal to save your companion's village. (Honestly the second you get the companion ""feature"" is when this game goes downhill) So you go into this cave, and you unlock the random encounter feature (Think tall grass in Pokemon). And then every two F$%@ing steps you fight one of 3 boring monsters. It really♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥me off.Finally you get the crystal after an unnecessary amount of time. But it's not over. You travel to a dungeon.  Now your bombarded with ""uh oh you can't go in here. Go find the ""feature"" to be able to progress. (You have to, again, fight an unnessary amount of random encounter fights) unlock the passageway, then walk all the way back and fight all of the monsters ALL OVER AGAIN. And then do it again.Okay, good. Do it again.'esc' - Quit game - uninstall.Good idea, good start. Then almost unplayable about midway til' the end. "

												If you are fan of games like Final Fantasy (Sakaguchi era), Legend of Zelda or Dragon Quest and you would like to take few hours and reminisce about these gaming gems Evoland is the game you want to play. Main essence of this game is unlocking various upgrades for the game itself. So instead of finding a treasure with new equipment you might find a new view perspective or resolution upgrade. Other than that Evoland is constantly switching it's gameplay mechanics between Zelda-like adventure and classic turn-based JRPG with a few minigames and puzzles here and there. Lore of the game is not so original yet interesting and fun. The story, characters and locations are all paying an ultimate homage to the Zelda and Final Fantasy (VI and VII) games and everything is presented in very genuine and entertaining way. If you haven't played any of those games I wouldn't recommend the game to you since the references are main source of amusement for players.Gameplay is very casual and the game takes between 4-6 hours to beat and complete so don't expect to get engulfed to the long story with evolving characters. This game is no way an RPG on it's own. But if you don't have the time to go through those old Japanese masterpieces again but you want to bring up some quick nostalgia - pick up Evoland.			"

												It's...not a good game. It would have worked better as a flash animation or Youtube video. It has some laughs. The transitions between the eras look good. The nostalgia factor is there. But its major failing is that it's the sort of game that thinks simply mentioning a trope and winking is enough.The hero's a Cloud/Link mash-up named Clink. He meets a healer girl named Kaerith (spoiler). The bad guy's named...Zephyroth? Something like that. You start off as a kid. You get a huge sword. You meet a guy with an airship named Sid. You end up in a village where everyone's afraid of some nearby environment that's begun to show signs of corruption. And the list goes on and on. It never does anything interesting with these tropes, or comments on the bygone era beyond, ""That was silly, eh?""Evoland features basic versions of turn-based, adventure and ARPG combat and lasts longer than it should. In the end, it feels like an exercise more than anything. As in, if it wasn't about 3 hours long, I would have quit an hour into it.Know what game's actually successful at what Evoland tries? Half-Minute Hero. That game actually manages to be a nostalgia trip and a very interesting and enjoyable new experience at the same time. Evoland's more of a slog.			"

												First things first, if you were expecting an RPG with deep storyline and hours of amazing gameplay, go away. Now. Seriously, go try Skyrim or Final Fantasy. This is not the game for you.If you're looking for a short, silly RPG with intresting gameplay, stay here. Evoland might be up your alley. Evoland's plot is not deep and sort of silly. It also uses a lot of cliche. Deliberately so. Again, this is not supposed to be an RPG that will offer great, amazing plot and hours of gameplay. This game gives tribute to those older RPGs that will be forever. Legend of Zelda, Final Fantasy, etc. It will do that while taking you through video game evolution. It's a short game. It will take you 3 - 4 hours to complete the main storyline. However, if you play it with the right attitude, it's great.Play, however, expecting an RPG that offers hours of gameplay with a deep storyline, and you will be disappointed.6/10. Recommended.			"

												LOL holy crap this game is fun and funny. I've so far played everything from Pre-Zelda style to post FF VII style. Fan-friggin-tastic. And the jokes you only know if you played those games.... ""Claud's Sword"" or ""Sid's Airship"" or when you get hearts for health ""You don't die from one hit anymore, but don't expect any fairies"".			"

												Great concept! Love the references to other great games. Cool to see the evolution of RPG adventure games. Random forced battles sometimes were a bit much - a little less of those wouldn't hurt! But overall, awesome indie game with a good story line. 7/10			"

												This game gets better in its later stages, but thats when the game try's to take itself somewhat seriosly. While still adding jokes and comical bits and bobs it thinks your playing an actual rpg. It would be ten times better if it focused more on the jokes and less on the weird story. Its Music track is great as it keeps getting gradually better. Control scheme a bit weird turning from Zelda: link to the past swing sword kill to Turned based combat to something you would see in diablo. Its funny but if it was a bit more consistint it would be better. The graphics often change getting better and better there is this one part ""<Spoiler alert>"" when you hit a crystal and it takes you back to old graphics for a puzzle and that is one of my favorite parts of the game.I still do highly recomend it on a basis of one to ten I would give it a 8.75/10			"

												I have mixed but afterwards slightly positive feelings of Evoland.Initial concept of Evoland is interesting: you begin with very crude controls, graphics and game mechanics, to find and discover new, nicer ones along the way. This is the premise. The game play changes between Legend of Zelda like free roam fighting and associated (actually quite nice) puzzles involving arrows, bombs and ""time travelling"" mechanic, and Final Fantasy / Dragon Quest style game with frequent random battles. There's also a scenario where the game goes full Diablo for a short while.While initially entertained, I grew utterly bored after a short while into the game because of its low difficulty level and the lack of story. Granted, the latter is (albeit true-to-form) introduced only later into the game and built upon for a mediocre tale heavily inspired by Zelda / FF games. The boredom only wore off after meeting the villain for the first time. With the fast-travel by airship and an in-game guy assisting with finding of the collectables I was finally enjoying myself again. I could have sworn I had fully cleared several previously visited locations but instead found some nicely hidden puzzles.Lasting only few hours and providing mixed amounts entertainment, I'd advice getting it on a sale. You should also have played some of the early RPGs like mentioned in this review: Evoland contains loads of references you could appreciate but might find silly if uninformed.			"

												Definitely a fun little game. While I myself would have prefered it to draw out the different time periods of gaming, and also for some of the play mechanics to be slightly more fleshed-out, it can't really be held against the game but so much. Evoland is not an epoch, it's exactly what it's meant to be: a nostalgic and fun trip down memory lane. I don't imagine the younger crowd will enjoy the journey as much, but any other older gamers who grew up playing games in the 8/16-bit era will certainly have fun strapping on the old nostalgia-goggles and remembering what games were like before all the fancy bells and whistles of today. A simple little game that accomplishes it's goal of being a fun and humorous romp through the RPG's that brought us to where we are today.			"

												By necessity lacking in originality, sadly lacking in thoroughness. Expect Evoland's origins to start rather firmly in the 16-bit era, despite early trappings, and understand that its inspirations are almost purely Zelda and Final Fantasy. Comfortable with that? Then Evoland is a fun, short detour through the golden era of the RPG. Hopefully a sequell will delve deeper and play longer.			"

												Evoland is a game that reminisces about classic RPG and turn-based RPGs like Zelda and Final Fantasy. It is not a game trying to rip these ideas off, but rather take you back in time to look at the history of the two genres. It starts you off in a classic 8-bit setting, standard of the early Zelda games and works your way through to evolve into more current, cartoony 3D RPGs. And this aspect of the game works. What doesnt work is how short the game is, and how linear or unintuitive some design aspects are. I paid £1.74 for this game, and completed it, along with all achievements in 5 hours. For the sale price, I would say its worth it. But for its full price I would not. It was cheap fun and a nice tribute to days of old.			"

												Fantastic!Well worth the pick up durring a STEAM sale! Very short but fun game. Taking you back to game boy / atari esc graphics, then progressing through to a more modern twist! Fun game play, the story keeps moving and takes pokes at the genre and will surely remind you of the games of yesterday. If you were a fan of Zelda, FF, Secret of Mana, ect then you will find a nice fun mix here. I didn't notice a single bug, and while the price point is low it's not because the game wasn't cared for in development. I'd recomend it to any fan of the genre as a fun throw back to years past.

												First things first, if you were expecting an RPG with deep storyline and hours of amazing gameplay, go away. Now. Seriously, go try Skyrim or Final Fantasy. This is not the game for you.If you're looking for a short, silly RPG with intresting gameplay, stay here. Evoland might be up your alley. Evoland's plot is not deep and sort of silly. It also uses a lot of cliche. Deliberately so. Again, this is not supposed to be an RPG that will offer great, amazing plot and hours of gameplay. This game gives tribute to those older RPGs that will be forever. Legend of Zelda, Final Fantasy, etc. It will do that while taking you through video game evolution. It's a short game. It will take you 3 - 4 hours to complete the main storyline. However, if you play it with the right attitude, it's great.Play, however, expecting an RPG that offers hours of gameplay with a deep storyline, and you will be disappointed.6/10. Recommended.			"

 I Mean, It Is a Love Letter to Old RPGs... So, I got around to finally playing this and I put it down for 3 months. I decided that I needed a review and here we ♥♥♥♥ing are. How is the game? Well, you already know by the fact that Steam tells you right away what my verdict is, but let's go through anyway and you can hear my 5 paragraphs of reasons why you should get this game. Sorry, you need to read anyway and this game will make you do it too.Remember the Gameboy? No? Then sucks to be you, but if you do remember, then you'll have a nice trip down memory lane as you start off the game with a green shaded screen and sweet 8-bit graphics as the game starts granting you rights to move up and down and opening chests.Yes, this game literally has to grant you rights to do stuff. As you progress through the game, you unlock features via opening chests and some features overwrite other features like: they took my ♥♥♥♥ing Turn based battle system from me! You ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s... I don't like clunky active battle systems... They will take the normal way of opening chests and make it like how Link opens chests in Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past. This game even pays homage to Final Fantasy games for PS1 with rendered backgrounds, that's epically awesome. The game is linear however, the open world isn't open when you get into that and rather large open areas like in Final Fantasy 4 in the beginning of the game. I don't like linear in video games with the exception of the horror genre because being able to go anywhere in a horror game is like getting threatened to suffocate with a tight plastic bag over your head with holes poked in it. It just doesn't work.The graphics are everything in this. From 8-bit to full fledged 3D. Its amazing how this game changes graphics on the fly. The game probably looks its best when imitating 16-bit graphics because I think that's as polished as 2D RPGs get when it comes to graphics. I really liked that look and I still miss it. The game won't let you choose the graphics you want and will just force you to stick with one since you need them in some situations to progress. There is a puzzle that lets you switch graphics back and forth because you're ""traveling through time"" to get through certain areas. It's neat some of the things they do with the graphics.Sound is the same way. The music is very nostalgic to hear and definitely has inspiration from older games, again,  like Zelda games and Final Fantasy. I know I'm using those over and over as examples but its really the only way to describe it. They go from old to new sounding as usual. The music will evolve as you progress. Obviously, it being the name, ""Evoland"".This game is a one trip journey and has no replayability. Moving on.The game is extremely linear and it can be a fun trip down memory lane seeing how far RPGs and video games in general have come. Its a fun experience and if you can get it on sale, and you'll probably will, you cheap ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, then I highly recommend it to RPG lovers new and old. The only problem is that the game lacks replayability and is only meant for one game play experience. I can't see it having multiple playthroughs. Just like the Tiger Electronic devices you get at cheap dollar stores, meant to be played once and never again, only Evoland isn't ♥♥♥♥♥♥.			"

												I have mixed but afterwards slightly positive feelings of Evoland.Initial concept of Evoland is interesting: you begin with very crude controls, graphics and game mechanics, to find and discover new, nicer ones along the way. This is the premise. The game play changes between Legend of Zelda like free roam fighting and associated (actually quite nice) puzzles involving arrows, bombs and ""time travelling"" mechanic, and Final Fantasy / Dragon Quest style game with frequent random battles. There's also a scenario where the game goes full Diablo for a short while.While initially entertained, I grew utterly bored after a short while into the game because of its low difficulty level and the lack of story. Granted, the latter is (albeit true-to-form) introduced only later into the game and built upon for a mediocre tale heavily inspired by Zelda / FF games. The boredom only wore off after meeting the villain for the first time. With the fast-travel by airship and an in-game guy assisting with finding of the collectables I was finally enjoying myself again. I could have sworn I had fully cleared several previously visited locations but instead found some nicely hidden puzzles.Lasting only few hours and providing mixed amounts entertainment, I'd advice getting it on a sale. You should also have played some of the early RPGs like mentioned in this review: Evoland contains loads of references you could appreciate but might find silly if uninformed.			"

												Here's a game that shows promise, only to fall flat on its face at the end. The game's beginning is unbelievably charming, with a simple mechanic: gameplay evolves, bit-by-bit, slowly adding color/music/new mechanics, changing how the game looks and plays every few minutes. However, the last two hours or so, the game suddenly runs out of new things to try and just tries to be Final Fantasy 7, including unavoidable, uninspired JRPG battles (where your characters have only three or four abilities at most) that never really lead to any sense of progression, making them feel more like a chore than a core part of the gameplay. Somehow, this four-hour game (being generous) manages to feel longer and more drawn-out than many console RPGs I've played, simply due to changing its mind what kind of game it wants to be partway through.This game could have been great, but in the end all it can do is imitate what came before and hope greatness ensues from referential humor and ""classic"" gameplay. It doesn't, because the game fails to understand what made old games appealing and doesn't capitalize on its few original ideas as well as it could've. One of the greatest disappointments in my Steam library.			"

												I'm rather amazed with this game. I actually bought this while it was on sale for like $2 and decided that I couldn't lose trying it out. After reading the other reviews on it, (which are really good, by the way) I tried it out. I'm so glad that I did! This turned out to be one of the more fun games that I played. To name some of the great things about this game:Music: AWESOME. Totally inspired and changes based on your completion of the game. I don't want to give too many spoilers, so just experience it yourself.Graphics: Pretty good. It's amazing to see the evolution of how far gaming has come since the old days. This game does a great job of showing how good game development has gotten. While they aren't the top of the line graphics, I have to say that at the end, I was quite impressed with how good it had gotten.Pop-culture and cultural references: I love when games put in references to other games, developers, mention jokes that you would know and the like. It was quite fun to discover the little easter eggs and see what they had to say. Schrodinger made it in here...haha. That's all I'll say, but great job to the developers of this game to read their audience correctly. While some things are ""adapted"" from games like Diablo, Final Fantasy, Dragon Quest, and many others, it's still rather enjoyable to play in the same style, even if some of the characters and enemies have names that are strikingly similar to the enemies in other games. Though...it does add a familiarity and nostalgia to the game, so I think it fit well.All in all. A pretty sound game. I wasn't sure how it was going to play as I was buying it, but like I said before...I'm really glad I did. It's not a difficult game, nor is it a long RPG game, but I would still totally recommend this game for the fun that it brings.			"

												To say that this game is simply a bad nastalgia joke is heartless. This game made me so happy to play. It has a wonderful concept and said concept was well done. Multiple battle modes have been seen thus far, as I am not very far in the game yet. The thing I beleieve would ruin the game is playing it straight through. That sets you up for failure with any game I think. So if you are someone who likes to beat games, rather than enjoy them, surely this is not a game for you. The game is wonderful in my opinion, and did a great job at making me smile with small nastalgic jokes in every nook and cranny. So its not final fantasy, or a hyper-in-depth rpg, but that is not what it is supposed to be anyways. The games target was hit on the dot in my opinion. If you are looking for a fun little game to play, this game is surely a good one. I absolutely recommend it!			"

I agree with another reviewer saying this game is unrealized potential.  They could have made something great with this but instead it just feels like a hollow shell of a game.			"

												It's a fun 4 hour montage to Zelda, Diablo, and Final Fatasy! It does every type of game play good, but doesn't expand past a little bit than attack and maybe few spells like heal and a summon. I just wish the ending fight used more than just slash after all the different skills you learn on the way!			"

												    One word describes Evoland... Nostalgia.  Evoland respectfully pokes at the evolution of the action/adventure rpg genre.  You start with top down monochrome 8 bit graphics only being able to move right, and you have to unlock new evolutions to the game i.e. the ability to move left or up and down or music.  Every time I unlocked a new dimension to the game (in one case literally unlocking three dimensional graphics) I laughed and my inner child cheered as I memories of games I grew up with came flooding back.  They pull heavily from Legend of Zelda, Final Fantasy, Diablo, and even one liner nods to modern games like Skyrim.    My only real complaint with the game is the length.  You can easily beat it (including all of the ""secrets"" and extras) in a day.  But, that seems like a minor issue when you remember that the entire game was produced in just 48 hours.  I sincerely hope that they put out a more complete edition mostly because there are so many things still to satire.  I would love to see battle pets of a pokemon-esque nature and you never develop the abilty to jump or swim.  Still, all told I'm very happy with the what I got for only $10.			"

												If you look up the word ""tedious"" in a dictionary, you might find this game as its definition. Tedious. There's bactracking, and it's not even for miscellanous items. There are so many random encounters I have ever seen and not enough monster variety to even make it worth while, and the monsters just give EXP and money. Random encounters wouldn't even be necessary. Plot is very cliche and cookie-cutter. The only redeeming quality that Evoland has to offer is the evolution of graphics, sound and combat. It's like watching a Final Fantasy game slowly move up in the graphics and world rendering departments. The camera zoom feature could be removed. It literally makes the game an hour longer just from that short cutscene but it starts every time you open a chest.			"

												Excellent game for what it's been made - showing the evolution of games!Highly recommended for people who's interested about history of rpg games and for those who's involved with game development. Also Legend of the Zelda and Final Fantasy fans.. go for it !Pros:++ Shows the evolution of games this genre.       (means you will experience various styles and differences in gameplay)++ Quick travel back to past.++ You can ""upgrade"" the game by playing.++ Puzzles are easy, but seeing the solution is hard in some places.++ References to other games are finally done in a nice way!++ You are mentioned in credits !Cons:-- 99% playthrough takes 6 hours, what is too short in my opinion - but is acceptable     when you understand the meaning of this game.-- Price is between ""instant must buy"" and ""expensive for this content"", so if this game is on sale you know what to do.Attention!There probably will be a part where you do not enjoy playing. My advice for that is to just play through that phase.Reward is waiting in the end. It's only 6 hour game anyway.			"

This is a long review, so if you want a brief summary of why I recommend EvoLand skip to Results and read from there.Shiro Games makes an interesting game that tries to draw together the graphics of older games and mix in in with more modern aspects. The game plays like an action RPG and hits neither fantastically, but does well enough to make you want to play. Story:You play a young man named Clink who must defeat an evil darkness that his hit the land. For some reason you must go throughout the land and save the world from the evil that plagues the land. Eventually you run into a girl named Kaeris who joined your team and you agree to help her restore the Amulet that you will need to save the mana tree from being destroyed. Campaign:The campaign is rather simple; you start in birds-eye view and can only go right, you unlock the ability to go left, shortly after the ability to go any direction. Slowly as you progress throughout the campaign you gain more and more features that make the game more modern. The issue is none of these come in for any rhyme or reason. They are just randomly placed on the map as chests which you hit and suddenly it unlocks. There is no story behind why the upgrades slowly appear in, which is disappointing. The game could have started with full graphics and be the exact same. Regardless it is still interesting seeing how the game changes, even if it occurs just because of random chests spread throughout the map.Gameplay:The game plays like a typical action RPG then goes into a turn-based combat system when travelling. There are a couple boss fights which are rather interesting, but the combat gets repetitive very quickly. And as you start to unlock new features to the game you are annoyed you had to waste your time not using them in the earlier versions. Especially because some of the unlocks include a mini-map which you have in RPGs old or new; inventory which you have in RPGs old or new; etc. Regardless the combat doesn’t go on long enough for you to truly hate it, just sometimes gets monotonous and makes you take a break. Hints:>Don’t look for everything, you can go back at the end and do it later. Results:All in all EvoLand is an interesting game, I would definitely avoid getting it at full price; but, if you can get it on sale it’s not the worst decision you’ll make. The gameplay is simple and can get repetitive, the story is nothing special, but the special effect changes are unique. I loosely recommend this game to someone who has a bit of time and doesn’t mind a semi-amusing game. This won’t be the best title you own, so just enjoy it for what it is a rather simple RPG with that is just average. Pros:+The game evolves as you play it+There are some more challenging puzzles after you unlock the entire game.+The music is catchy+The card game that is included is kind of coolCons:-You don’t unlock a lot of features found in all RPGs until later in the game (mini-map, inventory, etc.)-The game evolves with no real rhyme or reason-The combat is at times a bit to directional-When traveling between areas there are way too many random battles. It’s like going through a cave in Pokémon and running into a thousand Zubats, except you can’t use a Repel to avoid the battles.-At points in the game the story is very unclear of where to go, I got lost for like at least an hour or so before I figured out I was going the wrong way.

												It was a very well made game that emulates and incorporates features from both the legends of Zelda and Final fantisy and follows the idea that, as the game progresses so does the animations and graphics. The graphics start out poor and gradualy advance to better 3d models as advertised in the discription but then stops at around the 2007 era, This was a bit of a let down as the game goes from whats advertised to following a weak and short story with 2d, simple characters. even when one dies I really couldnt have cared less. While I would recomend this game please get it on sale as I did because it, in it current condition is not worth £6.99 or even the cerrant 3.49 asked for. While I hope to see this game advance further I would still find it hard to replay but seeing all the nice changes do make it a fun charming place to spend a few hours. It also has a nice few nods to other games like Mario waste lands and Clouds sword from FF7Overall score 5/10Music            6/10Graphics       7/10Would play again: Not until further updates "

The game is a simple RPG game which, through its story takes the player through various fazes of gaming history from black and white and 2d and no sound to beautiful 3d with textures, music and effects and all sorts of nice little add-ons like inventories that you collect.  I really liked the idea of the changing of the gaming genre which kept me up one night thinking about it. I also really liked how a chest which for me in an RPG used to mean a new item here was a new texture or camera angle, or all sorts of interface improvements. Loved it. I loved the the story, fun tone, the way the game transformed and developed and I really enjoyd this game which really got me hooked from the start to the finish. Thank you developers.

Don't buy this game if you're expecting a 'game'.  Buy it if you wanna feel nostalgic or have a unique experience.  I can recommend this to people who've played or grew up with old school adventure games or to those who want to feel nostalgic or just see what games were like on the earlier hardware. Just be warned that this barely qualifies as a game & is much more like playing through an interactive documentary that jokes about older mechanics & hardware limitations as you progress.			"

												This game has a great concept, play from the oldest style of RPG games through to a much more modern RPG style. Treasure chests give you new RPG gaming features. Switch beween 2d and 3d to solve puzzles. If you have old gaming memories and still like the old games, then you will simply love this game. The game was a fun experience, especially at the start. But it is everything you love and everything that you hate about old RPGs. So expect to be frustrated! Personnaly, I always get lost in games and so the high frequency random encounters were totally irritating! As the RPG style is always changing the game constantly feels fresh and the graphics and music are constantly evolving and getting better. The story and characters are simple and forgetable but are enough to keep you playing to the end.It is not trying to be an epic RPG, it is just an enjoyable trip down memory lane.			"

												A short RPG that mixes genres with a list of obvious insperations. It goes from Zelda style gameplay, to Final Fantasy, back to Zelda, to Diablo all while shifting graphical styles greatly. This game though is more about the experience than it is directly the gameplay. The gameplay is simple, you're not going to level and get wild skills nor are you going to find much in the way of equipment. It's about traveling through the different 'eras' of game technology and styles, Gameboy to SNES to modern PC. It's all netted together with a simple but enjoyable story. They do it with a lot of charm to boot.You'll go through forest areas, dungeons, towns, more dungeons, explore caves and all the cliche stuff. My one complaint is there's no run button so the game does drag a bit because of your movement speed. It's a fun romp that will last about an 1.5-3 hours depending on your urge to explore and collect stuff.			"

Especially because some of the unlocks include a mini-map which you have in RPGs old or new; inventory which you have in RPGs old or new; etc. Regardless the combat doesn’t go on long enough for you to truly hate it, just sometimes gets monotonous and makes you take a break. Hints:>Don’t look for everything, you can go back at the end and do it later. Results:All in all EvoLand is an interesting game, I would definitely avoid getting it at full price; but, if you can get it on sale it’s not the worst decision you’ll make. The gameplay is simple and can get repetitive, the story is nothing special, but the special effect changes are unique. I loosely recommend this game to someone who has a bit of time and doesn’t mind a semi-amusing game. This won’t be the best title you own, so just enjoy it for what it is a rather simple RPG with that is just average. Pros:+The game evolves as you play it+There are some more challenging puzzles after you unlock the entire game.+The music is catchy+The card game that is included is kind of coolCons:-You don’t unlock a lot of features found in all RPGs until later in the game (mini-map, inventory, etc.)-The game evolves with no real rhyme or reason-The combat is at times a bit to directional-When traveling between areas there are way too many random battles. It’s like going through a cave in Pokémon and running into a thousand Zubats, except you can’t use a Repel to avoid the battles.-At points in the game the story is very unclear of where to go, I got lost for like at least an hour or so before I figured out I was going the wrong way.

												I'd reccomend it just for it being one sweet nostalgia trip. Fans of classic Final Fantasy and Zelda games will love it. However at the same time Evoland doesn't bring anything new to the genre and without constant references to retro games in general I'd say it would be pretty poor action-adventure-jRPG mix. Get it, but while it's discounted.			"

												It was a very well made game that emulates and incorporates features from both the legends of Zelda and Final fantisy and follows the idea that, as the game progresses so does the animations and graphics. The graphics start out poor and gradualy advance to better 3d models as advertised in the discription but then stops at around the 2007 era, This was a bit of a let down as the game goes from whats advertised to following a weak and short story with 2d, simple characters. even when one dies I really couldnt have cared less. While I would recomend this game please get it on sale as I did because it, in it current condition is not worth £6.99 or even the cerrant 3.49 asked for. While I hope to see this game advance further I would still find it hard to replay but seeing all the nice changes do make it a fun charming place to spend a few hours. It also has a nice few nods to other games like Mario waste lands and Clouds sword from FF7Overall score 5/10Music            6/10Graphics       7/10Would play again: Not until further updates "

												A short but sweet love letter to the RPGs you grew up with... assuming you grew up playing RPGs primarily in the late 80s to early 00s. I fear a lot of the game's more clever moments might be lost on anyone outside of that age group, but I'd recommend it nonetheless... so long as you've at least played Final Fantasy VII, haha.It's clunky at times, combat is often dull and just there to be there, but when the game has a good idea it's usually a great idea. I don't want to say too much, but one dungeon threw me a curve I was absolutely not expecting and I loved every minute of it.Standout points to me: the game's absolutely gorgeous 3D art, as it evolves through various styles reminiscent of 32-bit RPGs, to something more Dreamcast/PS2-like in its conclusion, and a very clever, very satisfying final boss battle that reminded me more than a little of Brave Fencer Musashi in some ways.

It combines features from games like The Legend of Zelda, Pokemon, and Final Fantasy to create a very delightful experience. Although at a particular part in the game I felt a bit lost, the overall quality and amusement of the game made up for it.

												A fun little indie game that wasn't afraid to try something new and succeed.This is an action/adventure RPG game, so if you're not a fan of that then this game isn't for you. It's also a retro AND modern game!When you start off the game, everything is 8-bit. The graphics, the sounds, the music, etc. In fact, when you start the game you don't even have that much. You don't even have music or vertical movement. But as you progress (and very quickly.. but not too quickly) you start unlocking and discovering ""upgrades"" which improves the world around you. This game pretty much starts you in the 1980s of gaming and walks you through 30 years of gaming evolution without breaking the storyline or making the game feel awkward. The experience was incorperated into the game very cleanly.For old Action/adventure RPG fans, this game will give a slight sense of nostalgia. For younger gamers of the genre this will be an insight to some of the older games, but not in an overwhelming way where it will make you lose interest.Has a good 10 hours of gameplay or so.Judge for youself if the time is worth the price.

												To skip a lot of reading: DO NOT BUY THIS GAME.I got it for about 5 bucks through the Humble Store, at about 2.7 hours in I'm already at the end of the game, the unlocks basically end about an hour and a half into the game, turning the game into a Final-Fantasy parody on the overworld, and a zelda parody for one dungeon, but then diablo on a different one, but all of the changes you make don't really matter in other zones... It's deceptive on the store page, it basically gives up on it's major draw and the rest of the game just turns into dumb references and jokes to other games... Not to spoil the twist but your other ""party member"" (In that she plays healer on the overworld BUT ONLY THE OVERWORLD and one dungeon where you have the option to play as her) is named Kaeris.... so take from that what you will...It's not offensive, but it's short, and gives up on a really fascinating idea in favor of ♥♥♥♥♥♥ references.

												First and foremost, this is a very interesting concept for a game. You start out on a monochrome screen where you can only move in one direction, and slowly unlock more and more elements of the game such as sound, color, Mode-7, and eventually full 3D HD, as if you were traveling through the history of video gaming. The only thing it really misses is the text adventures, but I'm willing to overlook that.However, there are quite a few problems this game runs into. In its attempt to include as many elements of video games as possible, it has both hack-and-slash and turn-based RPG parts, and neither of them feel particularly polished - there are only very few attacks you can use in either of the situations. Similarly the game's story doesn't feel completely developed, and by the time you start to really get into it you're already at the final boss battle. In the RPG section, your characters never learned any new attacks through level up (at least to level 10, as far as I grinded up to) and there was no way to avoid random battles in the turn-based section of the world until the very end.However, I still enjoyed this game. I enjoyed watching the world getting built up around me, and there were some Easter eggs and moments in the story that I thought were at least somewhat good. If you enjoy playing video games from different eras, this game is definitely worth a look.			"

												I love the concept behind Evoland and I wish I could say the same for the game itself, but I cannot. Clocking in at about 5 hours (optional areas included), Evoland tries to cover a lot of content without delving all that deeply below the surface on any given playstyle. A very large chunk of the game takes on the form of a 3D turn-based (well, ATB) RPG and this is by far where Evoland suffers the most as random encounters are excruciatingly frequent and rarely do fights consist of more than spamming normal attacks and sometimes tossing out a party heal. Enemies themselves each only have a single attack, missing is surprisingly frequent if you don't grind a bit, and there is no way to use heal items outside of combat. The other major part of the game, the 2D and 3D top-down Zelda-inspired areas, fairs a bit better, but not by much. You'll fight the same small handful of enemies (skeletons, not-octorocs, not-wizrobes, and a whole lot of bats) from the beginning to the very end in these areas with one or two other enemies appearing here and there. Most of the puzzles in the game are found in these segments, but like most things in Evoland, they rarely provide much of a challenge and often overstay their welcome.Other aspects of the game simply come off as rushed or otherwise unpolished. There are stars to collect, and some are even well-hidden, but they only give an achievement. There are cards to collect, but there doesn't seem to be any way to view them outside of the card game. The card game itself is somewhat similar to Final Fantasy VIII's Triple Triad, but you are given five cards at random from those you have collected, meaning that it is actually better to actively avoid collecting too many of the weaker cards early on. Some of the writing is clever, but most of it consists of running through RPG cliches and making references for the sake of making references, such as by naming mushroom-shaped enemies 'Zoombas' and having a character named 'Sid'. Of the several optional dungeons in the game, none of them ever pay off with a neat new abilitiy or an optional gameplay evolution or even an optional boss and instead only reward more stars and cards.Evoland does do a fantastic job of gradually changing up the graphics from start to finish, and both the graphics and the music are impressive at that, but it just doesn't carry this same sense of passion across to the actual gameplay mechanics. Usually, once a new genre or evolution of a genre is introduced the player is handed several new gimmicks to go along with it in rapid-fire succession and then it simply stagnates, as though the jump from 2D to 3D gameplay was the only major innovation to ever happen to RPG's. Players will never get useful things like visible enemies replacing random encounters, interesting things like skill trees, amusingly useless innovations like switching rows in combat, or even many basic functionalities like the ability to block or to use items outside of combat in the RPG sections or the ability to quickswap between items in the Zelda-like sections.At the end of the day, Evoland has a creative, fun concept which carries it for about half an hour before it falls flat on its face and never really recovers because it simply doesn't run anywhere near far enough with it.

												This game showed me much of what has happened in the three decades of Video Game History. It was a mind blowing experience for me to go from Classic action-RPG of Zelda to a 3D RPG like Final Fantasy, Diablo, and some other popular titles under those titles. When I played through certain parts, There was an mini-game which remind me of Final Fantasy VIII and IX, which was a card game. The Combat even varys as you go on through the game, giving you different experiences all together.I will have to say, This game was inspiring. Inspiring to those who loved the older RPG classics, giving them an memory lane like trip with notable easter eggs from Final Fantasy, Zelda, and Diablo. Still I wish that it could include some Platformer elements or other game elements, so it felt like it spread out more than just the RPG titles, but throughout a part of gaming history. This game is still great, even without the additional stuff I mentioned above. It's a game worth looking into, allows you relive the RPG experience of the past 3 Decades or learn of those elements from those times. The game deserves an 8 out of 10 for the experience it gives out. I doubt anyone is gonna care for my review, but I wrote it anyway.			"

It feels very lazily and hastily put together, the game itself is very basic, and the message behind the game is lost behind both the unfunny overused internet jokes like ""You can now invade people's privacy!"" (a joke that has been made by every RPG player since the mid 80's) and how grindy it is. Everything about it is subpar as it tries to exuse this with humor that just doesn't work/ isn't very well thought out.

												To be completely honest, I didn't expect much from Evoland. I got it during the Winter Sale, and thought it was going to be a straightforward RPG. To a certain extent, I was wrong.Evoland takes you through the history of the RPG genre: through Zelda, Pokemon, Diablo, and many more classics. While the gameplay itself isn't stellar, the parodying of RPG classics, along with a beatiful representation of the RPG timeline, definitely makes this game a worthwhile buy.It is rather short, and doesn't have much replayability. Furthermore, the game does get a bit ""grindy"" at times, a la Diablo. Nevertheless, it's worth it, as you explore a beautifully animated world, and changing the medium that you look at the world.I'm not trying to say this game provides Skyrim-depth plot, replayability, or graphics: but for 9.99, it's a great steal for several hours of fun! Definitely would recommend for a casual game.P.S. It says I only have 0.1 hours because of a Steam Offline Play glitch, I have about 6 or 7.			"

												Evoland is one of those games your really hesitant on clicking the purchase button, though i'm so glad I took the leap of faith. It's a great hidden gem! This game truly shows the journey role playing games have taken over time. The action is one of the main reasons why it can be called a gem. By creating alluring zones, enemies, and bosses with constantly shifting combat. The art is another factor of why this adventure is so entertaining. It changes along with the times while retaining it's own style. In my opinion replayability is why you really play a game, evoland practically defines the word replay! Don't go  buying it just yet because of course there are flaws.  Evoland has a fine story, but thats not really what it is about. The collosal fall of this game, the length. I have 6 hours on it and I have already got all the achievments. So it is short, it is sweet, it is worth the buy. 8/10			"

												If you here for a flash sale i recomend you should buy this game.The game start with old school RPG style and little develop into modern RPG game in present. If you like Final Fantasy or Zelda you will love this game.A game contain with full of parody from old RPG game (FF, Zelda) Look at the Hero's name you will see it's a combined of Cloud and Link, LOL (and his weapon look similar from someone too)			"

												Now i say WOW , this game is amazing it starts black and white and no sound and you work your way through and unlock sound and better graphics and it is amazing that when i unlocked all the models i had alot more fun with this then any of the zelda games on the 3ds . If you want to see the comparisons from pics check out my pics i uploaded they start at the 8bit part and end at the amazing looking game that it is.  Also if you like the old school rpg you will love this , at least i know i did.

												This game starts off really well, as the transition from the old 8-bit era to the 3D part is pretty cool. But this transition happens in a space of half an hour and the game turns for the worse after the game becomes 3D. After that it becomes a bad zelda and final fantasy clone.The turn-based strategy is way too easy, as your partner has a heal spell that is effective considering how little damage the enemies do. She doesn't do a whole lot of damage (except for x-crystal, but the hero can do just as well.), there is no limit on how many times you can use her spell and it heals both characters. At the moments when she isn't around, you have enough money to buy a bunch of potions to last you until your partner comes back. Because of this, the battles will get boring and mind-numming very quickly and you'll start running from battles just to get past them.The action-adventure gameplay isn't as bad, as some of the levels have intresting mechanics like shifting back and forth from 16-bit to 3D but these sections don't last as long and they don't get repeated. They should've stuck with these ideas as it could've added more puzzles and ways to get around them. Instead it focuses more on the combat, which is stiff to say the least.Overall, it takes a lot of ideas, some from other games and some entirely unique, and sticks it all together instead of getting a few ideas and expanding upon thoses to make the game feel like an exploration through the action/adventure genre rather than a game that took ideas from other games in hope of it working well. Combined the fact that the game is really short and that it's $10, this game isn't worth getting.			"

												Great game. Even though it has gotten such a low rating, I wouldn't mind playing it again. Nostalgic ftw!Also gotten it with a bundle that still is available for 4$ + 7 other games at https://www.indiegala.com/evoland. Totally worth the money. This is a game you wanna play to take a break on all the other heavy games and just grab a controller and sit in front of the tv.			"

												This game is exactly what it promises.  It's a history lesson, and a game, and a nostalgia trip.  Many of the negative reviews seem to say that the game is short, and yet also tedious.  Both are true - to a point.  The game advances through stages of RPG gaming history; at some point, yes, random encounters do come in to play.  But it isn't exaggerated.  It isn't over the top.  It's just there, because that's the point of the game.  Yes, game developers have generally moved past this in philosophy of design, yes, it has become an outdated concept - but the point of this game is to go through the stages of what an RPG is and was, and so it does that.  It was frustrating to play through the game trying to obtain everything, to backtrack and collect all of the secrets.  But it was also rewarding to accomplish.  You don't have to do it.All in all, if you're looking for an RPG, this isn't your game.  Don't get it, don't play it.  But if you love RPGs, and if you want something fun and lighthearted to reflect on the games you already have played and enjoyed?  This is the perfect game for you.  A five hour romp through the past 30 years.			"

												This is kind of a weird review considering all the negative I am going to say about it, but I will also say why I recommend it.Pros:-Great refrences to other games.-Intriguing use of evolution of gameplay.-Some puzzles were actually more 'challenging' and fun then anticipated-Art style is beautiful.-Music is simple but fun.-Get to name a worthless character.-Final boss was actually fun and troll-ish.Cons:-I wish the between the different game styles, the damage you take will transfer over. For example, in the open worl combat if you lose 1 our of 3 hearts, then during the turn base battle system, you will have 1/3 of your health missing.-Random encounter was too much for me, but I do see how this is necessary due to small maps.-Mana. Need mana for them spells. Make the game atleast a bit more challenging/interisting.-Potions and Phoenix Downs were kind of pointless.-During the turn base, your character's speacial attacks were only available until the last moment of the game. It kind of teased you, then it just became pointless.-Overall, more fine-tuned turn base system (this can mean a lot of things, but I think you'll figure out as you play)-Needs to be more challenging, or atleast have a difficulty setting. I know that this game isn't suppose to be hardcore or anything, but still...the grinding was boring.-You can move diagonally (eventually), but can't shot an arrow or swing a sword diagonally.-SFX for stepping does not match character steps. Probably not the biggest concern, but it bugged the hell out of me.-Pause button.-Disperse stars and cards more-Little kid in village running in circles keeps pushing you if you're in his way. So while talking to the card game guy at certain spots, the little kid pushes you away. Pretty far for a runt. Makes me want to punch him!- For a game about the evolution of gaming, make more refrences to other game since that's one of the heavy details going for the game.I understand that I have more cons than pros, but hear me out why I recommend this game.Summary:       I would like to call this game more like a simple adventure than a game since I found no challenge in the gameplay or combat. However, this ""simple adventure"" does its purpose and illustrates the evolution of gaming. It's funny and had an appropriate art style. My favorite part was when the game went into a dungeon crawler. Overall, I would like to have seen more effort in fixing the small details listed in my con list to make this a more polished game.Recommended:       Buy this game when it's on sale since I find $9.99 a LITTLE too much money. $6.99 would be a better price.If you have anything to add to my 'Pros' and 'Cons' list, mention it in the comments and I will look them over then edit them into my review.Thanks!

												Really cool mechanic about the evolution of the game. It had a lot of elements from a variety of different games that flowed in and out of each other really well. The constantly changing aesthetic and soundtrack was a great addition too. Although the evolution quirk gets predictable and there's no replay value, Evoland is a nice little experience.			"

The constant inovation in game development as you progress is interesting, but only for the 1st hour. Also, the game took me 3-4 hrs to beat in one sitting while streaming it.

												Evoland, A land of adventure! It sure is one and the ability to fit story in an ever changing eviroment is what makes this game great. It's terribly hard and it's not terribly easy. I haven't beaten the game yet as I write this review but I can say the concept is amazingly interesting and the minigames such as the Card game you can play versus npc's makes it feel less like a single player game and a lot more like your standard top down view mmorpg.(Somewhat Cons)I'm uncertain if the game will have much more costly items as you move along in the game but I felt asthough the loot you were given (Glis and Exp) was much too high as combat lasted up to 30 seconds versus normal encounters and 2 minutes againts bosses. When you add in your first combat partners ability to heal you and herself this gives you and unlimited supply of HP and the ability to simply farm for hundreds of thousands of ""Glis"" (The games currency) without any worry of dieing.(Somewhat Pros)The game gives you a very clear depiction on how games have evolved and managed to smoothly tell a story within that evolution and adabt to those changes as the game moves along while still making sense. And with minigames on the side the game never gets boring and the gameplay rarely gets repetitive as its constantly changing.What would I do differently with the game?I would of added note bubbles that tell you what controls do what as you move along as it took me 5 minutes to figure out how to leave the game. I'd also add in a map function like what many horror games have that will show you a map of the game or dungeon but will only show you area's that you have been in. It would make navigation throughout the world much easier.My opinion is based off of 1.7 hours of gameplay to which in those 1.7 hours I made it to the point in the game where we meet our first companion uncle for the first time. Those who have played will know what I mean by this. So yes talk my opinions litely as i have not unlocked the complete evolution of the game yet ad it is possible that what I recommend wil be unlocked by playing further into the game.I do recommend this game to those interested in experiencing a game that gives you a gameplay style from the first ever pokemon to the modern Diablo 3 Style games.

												It took me just three hours to play this game from beginning to end, however it left me feeling like there's more to find. A second playthrough confirmed that I'd missed an area. It's full of parodies and inside references, and is superficially similar to DLC Quest, but very different. The boss fights are tough, but not too tough, just tough enough to be extremely rewarding to defeat. It's funny, but not overly silly, and I totally recommend it.			"

												Interesting ideas, poor execution.The idea of switching between modes, or ""generations"" in an action/RPG hybrid sounds very interesting, but instead, the developers of this game decided to aim for cheap ""homages"" and cutesy tongue-in-cheek references. For most of the game, Evoland isn't sure whether it wants to be a Zelda clone, a love letter to Final Fantasy 7, or a history lesson on RPGs. Like I said, some of the mechanics in the game are interesting, but ultimately it doesn't come together, and much like when I collected the 30 stars to get absolutely nothing, at the end of the game, I thought: ""Well, what was the point of that?"" The ingredients are all there, it feels familiar, but something's missing: fun.			"

The game also presents this and other things in a witty way, and sometimes it even makes references to other games. The music also fits the game well, and there is just quite a bit of fun.The only bad parts about this game is that sometimes there is a long walk, and the random encoutners got super annoying because of how often they occured.

												So much waste of potential. Its an RPG that is literally half Legend of Zelda and half Final Fantasy only that everytime you find a Treasure Chest, you upgrade the game itself such as getting new graphics, NPCs, or improving the game mechanics. This is a brilliant idea with a lot of possiblities but they aren't explored at all. Because of that the game lacks any depth, complexity, or challenge. Although there is one part where you switch between 2D and 3D graphics to get past an area. I WANT THAT. I WANNA SEE MORE OF THAT. But the whole game is super charming with evolving from the past but the most it does with this idea is make other references to video games. Its also super short. Even with the extra stuff you can beat it within 4 hours. The evolution idea is fantasic but it is wasted on nothing more then what is trying to be a parody making the game average at best.

												Evoland is one of those games that tells you what to expect from the outset - and it does what it says it does on the tin. The graphics are suitable for the time periods of when each generation of the games it imitates are out and there's a lot of references to other games throughout the adventure. Even having not played it for several months now, I can recall references to Mario, Final Fantasy, Zelda, Diablo and others besides. The soundtrack is equally as engaging to the nostalgic senses in the brain and it feels like it enhances the experience that you get when you play through it.Unfortunately...it doesn't quite have much of it's own two feet beyond that. The gameplay is often an imitation of it's inspiration - and often a very limited experience of what it's imitating - and has far too much crossover for any one influence (or even it's own design) to actually cement itself as an overarching gameplay foundation. For those not floating on the nostalgic waves, this can make the game feel disjoined and maybe scattered in it's design, as if a clown was juggling too many balls to do the fancy tricks other RPG games can do to greater effect.There have also been some issues that I recall from my last experience of it (hence the 12 hours of playing) where I lost access to my airship through a world map issue and had to restart from the beginning to get full achievement completion. And where item collection doesn't become a habit of face-hugging every wall looking for that one invisible area where it might be hiding, the other time-waster is the puzzles. I will admit, the puzzles sometimes can be pretty challenging to work out and do require some measure of thought, but others bordered the line between tedium and simplistic and a few were essentially efforts to get from A to B taking as little damage as possible.For those who remember having their chunky white Game Boys in-hand in their teenage years or loved some of the original elements of Final Fantasy, this may be worth the few second-hand DVD's you'd get instead of this game simply on the nostalgic vibes it brings, but even then it may be better to just play the games this one imitates due to the imitation being the game's only strength - and not even that strong with very limited ability set to use. For everyone else, see what the reviewers are claiming this game reminds them of, read up on the games this one imitates, play those instead: You are more likely to get an immersive experience from those than this scripted love song to them.

For everyone else, see what the reviewers are claiming this game reminds them of, read up on the games this one imitates, play those instead: You are more likely to get an immersive experience from those than this scripted love song to them.

												This was certainly better and longer than expected.In its core it is mostly Zelda and final fantasy gameplaywise, with short references into other games, thus this being part of what (admittedly small) length it has.  It uses those 2 rather well though, allthough the random encounters felt far too frequent. You unlock new graphics etc. by opening chests zeldastyle.To get 100% you will probably need a couple more hours without google, since the game is pretty good at hiding goodies or even entire areas and at locking them behind puzzles. Without any sidedestractions id say you will beat this in 3 hours at most though.There isnt a reason to go 100% other than the sense of achievement either, since the game isnt exactly keen on giving away cool stuff, which is also part of what bothered me: I beat your little mini cardgame with 10 cards, in every difficulty I dont WANT the other 13, I dont WANT another hidden star, i want some cool kind of equipment. The music is pretty decent sometimes but mostly just gets the job done. Perhaps I entirely missed so many hidden audial messages in the music, aside from the expected 8-bit to 16-bit etc switch, but in case I didnt I think it would have been decent to think of something there, since this tries to represent the evolution of games and boy did music evolve with it.Graphicwise it is pretty cool that they added quite a few layers between first and final graphics (with jabs at ""HD"" versions of stuff from the past that still looked like crap), but I still feel like they could have done more steps in between, and the final graphics look kind of ugly in my opinion as well. Going fruther than that would have also enabled more steps in between.The story is absolutely not worth mentioning, it wont be why you played this, same goes for character development etc.All together I love it though, it is full of hidden references, it copy pastes gameplay from the other games in ways that work well and I love the idea in general, very decent for a part 1 gonna play part 2 now and hope a lot of things improved. Is it worth 10 dollars though? Hmmm that depends on if ""well that was kinda fun"" as a result after 3 hours is worth 10 dollars to you. I guess most would say no and should wait on a sale			"

												Starts out clever enough, tracing the early history of console RPGs at a fun clip as it introduces new mechanics and art styles at a fast clip. By around the 90-minute or two hour mark, though, it's more or less run out of gas and you're just playing a shallow, unoriginal RPG instead of a game with anything interesting to say about them. Save your time and pass on this one.			"

												A short game with an interesting concept. Seeing the game evolve from something very simple, into a 3D based game was pretty neat. Too bad everything else about it was very basic. The combat has pretty much no depth to it, and it feels very simple. The puzzles are all based on jokes usually. The boss fights are also nothing special. The random encounter rate is way too high and it feels like you get into one every few seconds. It takes around 3 hours to finish, but you can add another hour or 2 if you go for the couple sidequests it has.			"

												There was a lot of wasted potential with this game.  It was one of the first games to get put through greenlight.  I recall it mostly being like an exhibit in a museum on the evolution of the console JRPG.  Lots of Final Fantasy references and a very short Diablo-esque part.  I wanted it to be so much better because I thought it was quite charming initially.  They introduce a couple mechanics during the game for puzzle solving that were cool but you quickly move on never to use those mechanics again.			"

												6/10 - Evoland is a lot of fun for a short period of time.Evoland is a game perfectly described by its own name: As you progress through the game, you and the game itself evolve.  Starting in old NES The Legend of Zelda style, you go though a vary of stages until you get full controlls and 3D-Vision. The different stages, that kind of display the history of RPG gameplay and graphics, have a quite nostalgic effect. The only sideffect of that concept is, that it affects the players perception of the storyline: I cannot even quite recap what the story really was all about. Atmosphere, gameplay and graphics are continuously changing through the stages of the game and are always quite fitting. The playtime with about 5 hours (for 100% achievements) are a little bit weak in comparison to the price of 10€.Gameplay - 8/10Atmosphere - 8/10Storytelling - 3/10Graphics - 8/10Playtime - 4/10Total: 6/10 - Nice concept, worth a try!

												   An enjoyable gaming experience for anyone who grew with the early rpgs. This game is a great game for Redditors and fans of Family Guy as much like those things, this game brings almost nothing new and interesting to its format, and steals (relativiely poorly at that) all it's aspects from other games. Even a majority of the enemies are simply references to other games.    There are 3 games this game takes most of its gameplay mechanics directly from; Legend of Zelda, Final Fantasy, and Diablo. This would be ok if this game blended these playstyles together well, unfortunateley this is not the case. Instead you really just find yourself playing 3 different games that are really not connected to one another. leveling up in the final fantasy gameplay has no bearing on how play in the other games. The same can be said about the loot you get from the Diablo scenario.  Overall if you like those games this game will be an enjoyable playthrough (especially since it's incredibly short), but the originality leaves something to be desired, and the flow of the game is entirely too chopped up. Well worth the sale price of 2$ but hardly worth a penny more.   A solid 6/10			"

												The main idea of the game (2D/3D world transformations and upgrading graphics and the whole gameplay while playing) is the only positive thing that comes to mind. Well, some dialogs are not so bad. Problem is the world upgrades end very soon and 2D/3D focuses are too rare and similar. And other parts of the game (story, quests, fights) are too primitive and boring. Especially those JRPG-style fights - they are far too frequent and repetitive. Evoland greatly lacks content and at least a few more interesting ideas. Really sad to see such good idea lost in such mediocre game.------------------------------Ключевая идея игры (2D/3D-трансформации игрового мира и ""апгрейды"" графики и геймплея в целом по мере прохождения) - это единственный плюс, который приходит на ум. Ну, некоторые диалоги неплохи. Беда в том, что эти ""апгрейды"" быстро заканчиваются, а фокусы с 2D/3D слишком редки и однообразны. Остальные же элементы игры (сюжет, квесты, сражения) крайне примитивны и скучны. Особенно пресловутые схватки в стиле JRPG - они ну очень уж часты и шаблонны. Evoland катастрофически не хватает наполнения и ещё хотя бы пары интересных идей. Очень жаль видеть, как оригинальная идея совершенно пропала в такой посредственной игре.			"

												Cannot recommend this game. Sadly. It definitely took some work and have some nice aestethics at times. Yet, what a complete blunder both as a game and as a tribute to games. Can't say it any more nicely.Now, let's start picking this game apart. It becomes obvious from the first minutes, that this game was made with sole purpose of referencing and tributing old Action-RPG games (from 8 bit up to Diablo 1, as far as I gathered). Now, that in itself isn't a bad idea and leaves some room for leniancy when judging it as a game. Still, you cannot do sloppy job here.1) First and foremost, I personally found references to be... dull? I get what they mean, I get what they are referencing, but realization is simply uninspired. Like ""hey, remember how good it was to actually have a heart healthbar in Zelda?"". Well... yeah, I guess. So what? And this ""so what?"" remains unanswered till the very end. This is not some complete and independent game, where ""tribute"" serves sole purpose of Easter Egg. You built this game around the very notion of tributes. You can't simply reference the games and leave it at that. Simple reference can't replace gameplay, it can't be entertaining on its own without YOU, as a developer, MAKING it entertaining. Make witty remarks, push old mechanic to absurdity, demonstrating how flawed it was (or maybe better than modern?). Take your cues from ""Bard's Tale"" made in 2005. It seriously lacked in gameplay, but still kept player invested, because it provided witty remarks non-stop. It didn't simply reference ""oh, in Diablo stuff drop from mobs"". It referenced ""hey, remember when you got your rare armor from wolf? Isn't it kinda funny how wolf actually carries something worthless to itself?"". It didn't simply reference, it scrutinized, studied, demonstrated how silly and funny those things that we accepted before were (and many still are!) about Action-RPG games. Not simple notebook containing notes about old, but a full fledged monologue from developers to player, through their game. Monologue which more often than not felt like dialogue.2) Very bland and primitive gameplay. Yes, I know, I stated above that in this case some leniency may be given. But not THAT much, as per my opinion. You reference random encounters from Final Fantasy and what not? Well, okay. But why, for the love of all that is living, are you making them so boring, so dumb, so mind numbingly NOT FUN. It is one of the most controversial points of jRPGs in itself, the boring grinding, 99% fights which don't require ANY input other than mashing single button. You didn't simply reference old games. You presented some elements in the abhorent and repulsive way. And then FORCED player to play in this framework. What the hell? You can't claim you're demonstrating how boring random encounters are when you force player through them for 1/2-3/4 of the game. It completely misses the point. Either do those mechanics in an entertaining manner or refrain from pushing them onto player for the majority of the game. Take your cues from ""Cthulhu saves the world"", made not too long ago by indie developer. Yes, they to reference a lot of jRPGs, mostly jRPGs. But they also bring to the table a very solid and intresting mechanic into random encounters. Moreover, they introduce ""random encounter limit"" for each location, when after certain number of battles you are no longer forced through those fights with those enemies. You still can farm using specific option in character menu and people don't feel punished for retracing their steps and checking every corner for secrets. This is what this game should've been about. You reference old games and present solid entertaining mechanics from them while you're at it. You cannot force down the throat mechanics, that are much worse than even those you reference in the first place. And we're talking about Final Fantasy, the mother of all ""boring and uninspiring"" random encounters, the epithomy of the problem both in days of old and modern age. Yet even in those games certain steps were taken to ensure at least some interest and diversity. When you introduced Babamut in your game, it was a point where you should've made him a ""one-button-win-them-all"" ability, which would allow to travel the world and wrap up the remaining secrets. Yet even there you introduced ~5 real minute timer. Real minute. For crying out loud... why this? What purpose does it serve? You consider that at that point ANYTHING from random encounters can actually pose a threat to player big enough that it will make fight not trivial? You're wrong, your random encounter mechanic is too flawed and too primitive from the beginning. You can't exactly make a challenging fight when your character can do only two things - hit or heal. Literally.3) While the rest of the references and mechanics aren't AS bad as those described in second point, they are too bland and uninspired most of the time. This game, while trying to reference many others, falls flat at each and every one of the attempts. It never begins to come close to NES Zelda in terms of combat, it never begins to come close to Diablo. Puzzles and trap sections are way too primitive and boring, so much that I actually couldn't remember any of the location and basic order of rooms right after leaving it. It was THAT boring. Yet there was intresting mechanic, with time changing. If only developers focused on this mechanic, made it more pronounced and built game around it. But no, it mostly serves secondary purpose in some of the puzzles. The rest is a mesh of ""hey, we tried to make X reference, but kinda stopped at the very beginning"". I understand, that it would be way too hard to make many good games inside one game. Don't. Make ONE good game and shift its mechanics slightly to represent your references. You'll be surprised how much being subtle and precise will enhance your points. Consider it an uncanny valley of sort, sometimes small changes are much more pronounced because you can compare it to almost same thing.In the end, I cannot recommend this to anyone. Two games I mentioned above, ""Bard's Tale"" and ""Cthulhu saves the world"" provide much bigger impact. And even without them this game is too bland to be both the reference book and an enjoyable game. I sincerely hope that developers will try their hand once again, but this time put much more effort in concept and basic mechanics.			"

												I really want to like this game, but I just can't. I understand what they were going for. They borrowed from some of the greatest games ever made, however it still seems to fall short of the mark. The puzzles were too easy and somewhat monotonous. However, the boss fights were very good. Also, I have about 3 hours on the game and I have 85% done; it’s too short. The evolution part I feel they did very well. I really enjoyed playing in the different styles and the change in graphics was pretty cool. If I were to to rate this out of ten I would give it a six. If it’s on sale I’d recommend buying it, but not for the $10.99 asking price.			"

												The game was developed during the 24th LUDUM DARE competition, and that's the problem: 48 hours to create a game concept, and anyone can see its limits. Kudos to Nicolas Cannasse for sure, but Evoland is still a really boring game with childish structure, that mocks 3 big series (Final Fantasy, Zelda and Diablo), without even scratch the surface of one of them.""What did you expect from a 48hrs game?"". Nothing good, if not a glimpse of something that could have been good, if they had more time.The idea of a treasure trove that Evolves an old GBA game to a nowadays game (sort of) is good. The rest... ALL the rest (game mechanics, levels, interface and interaction) is not. They're just ideas joined together with tape and glue. I understand is not easy putting together something fast and with so many layers of famous mechanics, but I'm not for half-done games and boring wannabes.My compliments for the winning, but as a whole, this game is to avoid.

												Evoland is a game with a good concept but terrible execution. In Evoland you go through the different ages of video games; from 2D to 3D, and even through different styles of games like Diablo, Zelda and Final Fantasy. It sounds pretty cool right? However I was very disappointed with the game. My biggest problem with Evoland is that everything is so simple. The games Evoland are referencing are fairly complex (like Zelda and Diablo) but since Evoland lacks depth these sections quickly lost their charm and became a massive grind. Relying on the occasional funny reference to keep you playing. The worst offender was the Final Fantasy section. This area has timed battles, but the the main character can only attack and heal which made these sections so frustrating to play. There's no summons, leveling up or any of the depth that FF has (you can't even heal OUTSIDE of battle). Depth is what makes Final Fantasy fun. Like think of the difference between a level 1 and level 50 character, now you're forced to play as the level 1 character for the entire game... yay?Next the story... it sucks. Early on it's fine since stories weren't a big focus back then... but it never improves. You only ever get 2 party members and by the FF section the story is still ""the bad guy is doing bad things, kill him"". I wish the story went completely wacky and over the top (as FF's are known to do) but it never puts in the effort to improve it. The game is also filled with unmemorable and bland characters which doesn't help.The rest of the game handles fine. The music's nice with some good tunes, the controls are smooth and the artstyle changes with the different eras of gaming (from 2D to full 3D models). For anyone wondering these changes happen after you find them in a chest.Evoland relies on nostalgia and witty remarks over good gameplay and story. You might find a funny reference, but at the end of the day the game is so shallow that it just feels like a waste of money. I finished it in two and a half hours and I would not recommened Evoland.			"

												I don't know how a game that is only 2 hours long can manage to so thoroughly overstay its welcome, but Evoland achieves it with such ease that even half way through I could barely stand it anymore. The game jumps often from mechanic to mechanic, each time executing its new mechanics even worse than it did the previous ones. Starting as a clunky, imprecise Zelda clone it swiftly shifts gears into a dull and grindy Final Fantasy Clone, switching back and fourth between the two for a couple dungeons before introducing the worst possible Diablo clone ever conceived. Finishing off, it moves to a side scrolling action sequence for the last boss. The boss itself is dull and predictable, but due to unresponsive controls, tiny hitboxes, and him having more health than god, the fight with only two phases, each only having a single attack pattern can draw out for 20 minutes.The game wouldn't even be so bad if it were at least moderately consistant between mechanics, but it basically throws everything away when you move to a new section. The bombs and arrows you get in the zelda sequence can't be used in the Final Fantasy section, so you end up just mashing attack and waiting for everything to die. The potions, healing spells and phoenix downs you get in the Final Fantasy section can't be used in the Zelda, Diablo or Final boss sections, something that even contradicts the ""plot"" of the game. All the ""power"" you obtain before the final boss, a power which is supposed to help you defeat him, goes completely unused because none of those abilities are available outside of the Final Fantasy sections.Evoland is a novel idea executed in the worst possible way.

												I'm really on the fence about Evoland. This is a really awesome homage of console RPG video game history. It got alot of smiles from me. There is alot of Final Fantasy and Zelda, and little hints of Super Mario Bros., among others. You start in black-and-white with no sound or frills, and gradually earn more modern luxuries in video games. We are talking everything up to 3D and high res textures!Even though I am 'not recommending', please don't get it twisted - this game is a success. It certainly does what it set out to do. I am in love with the idea and follow-through, I am just not so happy with some of the actual gaming elements.Pros:+Super cool idea+Awesome throw-back to gaming of old that gets great smilesCons:-Fighting, which is something you obviously do alot of, is awkward and not fun-While the actual gameplay is a throw-back, gaming has evolved in many ways from 'get the key, find the door' which turns me off (it still exists but is certainly more masked)-Listen up, this is a huge complaint: the store front claims full controller support, which it has, but is very very poor. You have to muck with files to get it to work each and every single time you play. No thanks.-Storyline is super genericI got it on sale over at HumbleBundle. I don't regret it, but it is what it is.

 Evoland Evoland is a cute little game that takes you through the history of J-RPG games. Visual: 8/10 It is very difficult to review evolands graphics and art-style, as it changes multiple times...The game starts off with a simple colourless 8bit style, similar to the first pokémon games, but it quickly evolves and gains colour. Eventually the game turns 3d, and that's the end of it.The art style nails what it tries to do, which is replicating RPG games throughout the ages. I do think that it's good for what it is, but the need to replicate it makes the art-style boring. Sound 6/10 The music in Evoland is mediocre through the entire game. There aren't any memorable chiptune tracks in the earlier part of the game, or any epic battle songs in the later part of the game. Honestly I had to google the soundtrack and listen again while writing this to make sure that I wasn't talking out of my♥♥♥♥♥♥ Gameplay: 7/10 The gameplay is slightly above average. There was hardly any depth to the gameplay since they had to shove so many different combat types in the game. They started off with a style similar to The Legend of Zelda (Yes, the first one!), then they moved over to a typical turn-based J-RPG style, similar to the older final fantasy games or the pokémon games. The second reason as to why there is no depth is that the game is so shockingly short. I beat the game over the course of approximately 3 hours and I played quite slowly and looked for secrets. Time/Money: 4/10 I beat the game over the course of 3 hours (as mentioned above.) and bought it for the full 9,99€. By using the witchcraft that is commonly known as simple division, I figured out that I spent approximately 3,33€. Keep in mind that I played the game slowly, so if you enjoy speeding through games, then your cash per hour will increase. If your not comfortable to pay 10€ for 2-4 hours of gameplay that is mediocre at best, then you probably shouldn't get this game.			"

												Evoland is a game with a neat concept that ends up being super mediocre. The idea of slowly expanding and evolving the world around you is really cool, but the world itself ends up being very bland.The combat is typical, boring, and repetitive. The game spends most of its time mocking gameplay tropes and parodying Final Fantasy VII. This wouldn't be so bad, but it really feels like there's no creativity at all in the end game.The beginning of Evoland plays a lot like Zelda, then it moves into Final Fantasy, and it throws some hack-and-slash nonsense at you. And jeez is the end anti-climactic and boring.Evoland is a game that was probably way more interesting when it first came out, but at this point you are probably way better off passing this by and looking at its sequel instead.

Evoland was inspired by Legend of Zelda, Final Fantasy and a few others.  You can also find some Nintendo references in the game like plant enemies that shoot fireballs at you.  I enjoyed it.ProsGame world changes as you play the game.HumorNostalgicCan be played with Xbox controllerSimple controlsMusicConsShortThe turn-based battles you encounter in the overworld happen a bit too often.The final boss is quite difficult. Yes, final bosses should be challenging but the whole game is fairly casual then BOOM.  That boss may as well have a troll face.			"

If you like RPG turn base, and hack and slash with some unique retro still i definitly recommend this game to you :D 8/10			"

												This game seems way more interested in pointing at all of the things it's referencing and saying ""GET IT?! LIKE ZELDA!"" than actually crafting a good game. It can be cute at times, but more often than not it just ends up dredging up issues with the genre's it's calling back to. It's parlor tricks are probably worth poking at if the price is right, but it's a bummer that the game didn't come together into something fun to play.			"

												You, like I, may have been enticed by the short browser game came before this, however in this new edition they see to have forgotten what game they were actually trying to make. The entire game was initially based around the graphical evolution gimmick, and a very entertaining gimmick it is, but after the first 40 minutes or so the game just runs out of evolutions and stays where it is. What you are left with is a quite shallow experience with no worthwhile story, combat or exploration. Perhaps worth buying for the enjoyable start if it is significantly reduced in price, otherwise don't bother.			"

												This game isn't without it's quirks, and if you're a huge RPG fan like me? It's definitely worth a look at - just not for $9.99. For that price, get yourself a real game with some measure of replay value. It is completely linear, straight from A to B with no extras or possibility to deviat from a predetermined path.At best, this is the sort of game I would expect to see featured on Newgrounds for free, not one I would recommend you pay upwards of ten dollars for.

												Yeah. An interactive history lesson. Alternatively, a pile of tropes. Not a game. Don't buy this expecting a game, because it gets awards for not being a game.Also if you try to skip getting any of the upgrades to keep a particular style early on, the game will either block your progress outright or become an unplayable buggy mess, so there's only one way to play it, really.

												Special message to my little thumbs-down stalkers:  Grow some balls and grow the f*ck up.  If you're not speaking up just because you're on my block-list, that means I don't f*cking care about you.  Get a hint!(This game was provided courtesy of my good pal Crywolf.  Thanks, dude!)In simplest terms (as other reviewers have said), Evoland is essentially a tribute and a documentary about gaming, mostly involving legendary titles such as The Legend of Zelda and Final Fantasy, but with elements of Diablo, the Mana series, and Dragon Quest.  The gameplay essentially switches between a JRPG types with one exception where it becomes a WRPG.The humor in this game is fresh and the references are rich.  Evoland (as the name suggests) also evolves as the game goes on.  It starts with simple Gameboy-age gaming, becomes an NES-style game, then SNES, and so-on until it reaches the 3D age.  Although Evoland is simple and short, it's still pretty fun.  I can see myself re-installing this game in the future.  My only gripe is that the Piranha Plant enemies are a little rough, but it is a late-game area...so there's that.This game is currently priced at $10.  If priced at $5-$7.50, you'll find a more satisfactory experience for your buck.  A really good experience presented as a playable documentary dedicated to gaming.9/10  I evolved to like this game pretty quickly.  No regrets playing this one.			"

												One of the worst games I have ever played. There's so much to say about this game, that I would prefer to summarize:Take EVERY SINGLE bad, annoying, horrible, unbearable, inconsistent and awful aspect and feature from the jrpg games (but not only) of our childhood (and some more recent); and add ONE good idea (namely, the evolution of the rendering quality and gameplay as you go through the game), and you get Evoland.Note if you are the developer: sorry for the absolutely not constructive review, but I don't feel like I have any reason to put effort into a constructive review after having witnessed the astonishingly poor quality of that ""game"". Of course, if you would want to remunerate me to list all the bugs, annoyances, and other problems I have encountered in the game; I would probably accept, depending on the sum. And if such a thing would happen, expect it to take many days, if not weeks (yes, I, unlike the people who commited this atrocity, like to get my job done, and correctly).			"

												I don't recommend Evoland.I beat the game in 2-3 hours using an x360 controller. It is neat to start out with b&w 2d graphics and slowly watch them become better, but the feeling runs dry in the first hour. The game is completely linear and serves mostly as a tech demo for all the different puzzles, playstyles, and visuals that the many adventure games of the past have already done.Any type of major puzzle used to block progress that you can think of has probably been used. Burn down saplings so that they don't block your path when you teleport to the future (Oracle of Ages/Seasons.) Find the right path to walk across a room or you will fall through the floor (Link to the Past.) Bomb through cracked walls. Find all switches. Push blocks to make a path. And so on.Most combat is in 2d Zelda format, followed by turn-based, FF style battles, and some light ARPG style combat. Evoland is not unpleasant, but with no real story, it's not exactly memorable either.			"

												This game costs way to much for the little to no content in it. The game feels like it was quickly made with rpg make VII thrown together quickly just to make a fast buck and most of the positive reviews sound like they came from people selling there reviews. The action rpg aspect of this game starts out in old final fantasy game style then finishes off in FFVII. The story is not thought out and sevearly lacking any substance. You fight maybe 10 different monsters in the hour it takes to beat the game with a map so small its really shows how much was put into the game. It feels like the person who made this game only played games made in the last 15 years and didnt do much in the way of research. I would not recomend this game to me it just feels like a quick cash grab like most games on steam today			"

												Evoland is a trip through some of the worst features of games past, and reminds you why developers have since moved on to better mechanics.  Here are a few of them that the game indulges:1. One-hit game overs - You're in this mode at the beginning of the game.  Add to it that you're on a grid and so are the randomly-moving enemies, and it's a recipe for disaster.  I died at least 3 or 4 times, starting the whole game over every time, before I could reach the first save point.2. Really annoying low-health sounds - I get it that we're supposed to be careful, but come on.  It sounds like the alarm clock from hell, and I had to actually shut off the sound when it came on.  Don't believe me?  Search for it on YouTube and listen for yourself.3. Backtracking - Notice that chest that seems impossible to get to?  That's right, if you want to get 100% completion, you're going to have to backtrack a LOT.  You only get certain skills later in the game, and will have to head back to earlier areas to use them to get all the collectables.  The game world isn't massive, but the random encounters will be fighting you every step of the way.4. Loading screens - Yeah, yeah, reading data from disks on the PS1 was a tad slow, I get it.  But don't give us artificial loading screens at every one of the four area transitions in a town, and especially not in a town with...5. Multi-layered fetch quests - We need bombs!  That guy probably has some! ""Well I used to, but not anymore.  Go talk to that gal.""  ...and you finally get the bombs FIVE PEOPLE (and even more loading screens) later.6. A lack of mid-boss checkpoints - Figure out the boss's first stage, only to get stomped flat on the second?  Too bad!  You get to fight the entire thing all over again.  (I normally wouldn't complain, but the second stage is essentially random and requires a lot more luck than skill.)While interesting at least in concept, it doesn't stand up in practice.  Aside from the interesting time travel puzzle and the surprisingly functional Diablo section, it's all incredibly boring and tedious.  You're much better off playing the games it borrows from (2D Zeldas, Final Fantasy VII, Diablo), than this mess.			"

												This charming game grabs a fistful of nostalgia and hits any gamer around during the early years straight in the face. At it's core it's a fairly simple game made up of popular mechanics that tells a tale we've already heard... but considering it's made of games we've already played, that makes sense, right? The Zelda-like dungeons were clever, although I'm a little annoyed by walk-through walls to hide collectibles.I thoroughly enjoyed the game, although I'm sad it was so short. My game time is only so high because I grabbed all the achievements; the story itself could be done in probably a 2 or 3 hour session the first time. I value games on average (more or less depending on reviews/hype) at $1 per hour of gameplay, and since I got this game on the summer sale it was very much worth it. I'd probably still recommend it at the full $10 price, but it doesn't hurt to slap it on a wishlist and wait for some sort of sale or discount. Much like a Zelda game, I'll probably not touch the game again for a few years and then randomly pick it back up to play through in an afternoon or two.I'd give this game a 7.5/10.			"

												I would give this game 1/5 stars.This game was supposed to be a fun 'concept' game, making nostaligic references to the classic RPGs which we all know and love. The problem with Evoland is that it tries to be a game in itself; A very lengthy, monotonous, repetitive game where the 'evolutions' happen infrequently, inconsistently, incompatibly, and generally do not enhance the gameplay experience. The problem is that all of the evolutions and references to RPG classics are highly watered down. If anything, I would describe Evoland as the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ized version of otherwise good games. Don't get me wrong; the trailor for the game looks exciting and is the reason why I purchased this game, but the excitement stops there. Within minutes of playing, I already feel the dread of doing the same thing over and over and over again. The turn-based battles are inconsequential in that all the of money and experience you earn amounts to nothing important, and does not give you an edge in the game. The majority of the game is a primative take on Zelda 1/3ish, containing substantially fewer features than the original. If this game were significantly shortened in length, or if the puzzles weren't boring, repetitive chores, or if the gameplay experience was actually enhanced rather than watered down in relation to the referenced RPG classics, then I would recommend this game. But no; I'm afraid that this game was a complete waste of time. Out of obligation, I completed the game in five hours and unlocked the majority of the achievements (the rest would have been easy to attain if I felt like doing more repetitive gameplay), but honestly, knowing what I know now, I wouldn't have bothered playing the game if it were given to me for free. I wouldn't play the game if I were paid $25 to play it; those five hours of my life are much more precious than this waste of time.			"

Forced fights every X seconds, which are mostly a grind to get to the next chest with some random crap.

												Evoland is a fun distraction and well worth $10, however I will state it is more a commentary on video games than a game in of itself. There is little challenge in the turn-based sections of the game as your partner has a heal they can spam for literally zero mana. There are some spelling errors which while don't really distract from the game has a whole, I find it odd there wasn't a higher quality control on the script. The Zelda-Esque areas are more enjoyable, although all the puzzles are transparent and all the enemy are frustrating as your sword has a delay. Controller support is not fully implemented, which seems odd for a game like this. You can use a controller, but you'll need to map your buttons in the options.Overall I'd say this game is enjoyable, a neat little commentary on how far gaming has come. No replay value, although they tried to force some by hiding collectable ""stars"" throughout the world. (No thanks)As a game? Not so good, but I still enjoyed it as a piece of consumable media. 6/10			"

I thoroughly enjoyed this game and do recommend it. The game is very unique and makes many smart and funny references to gaming history and other games. The entire game is essentially an easter egg. It's a very fun game with great music, and I enjoyed it from start to finish. It's a brilliant idea, but unfortunately has a fairly average execution, and those looking for an amazing high quality RPG experience won't find it here.The thing is, the game could have been so much more, it had great potential that it unfortunately didn't reach. I would have liked to see more ideas and mechanics implemented, with a better than average execution. That being said, I still found myself enjoying it from start to finish. It was fun, and although I would have liked more from the combat system, I did enjoy the battles. Not to mention, the music is great and really adds to the experience. By the end, I found myself pleasantly surprised.So all in all, I did have a blast playing this game and do recommend it, however, those looking for a great RPG won't find it here, and may want to wait for a price drop before picking it up. It is a fun game that is worth picking up in my opinion, but maybe not for the full price.			"

												This is a gem you wouldn't wanna miss. While others think that the concepts became switched up mid-game and misapplied, I feel as if it has a linear progression to it. The game starts off, with the very humble begginings of how video games started. Then, you must collect upgrades which takes you on a trip through video game history, showing milestones we have achieved through time with things such as; better graphics, different point-of-views, and combat systems. It heavily references to Zelda and Final Fantasy, calling for some fine nestalgia. For the price The game is more than worth it, especially if you like upgrade games with adventuring mechanics. It's just whatd you expect out of a $10 game, but with a tad more captivity. Sure, they could have implemented more to the rather short game, but I feel to them it was more than just a game, it also traversed you through the history of video games itself and to me, was a very fun experience.

												Evoland, despite all of its negative ratings, I believe its a great RPG game. It hits nostaglia to many RPG gamers, and even gamers that arent quite as avid. As you play the game, it progresses from an old fashion, to a more modern taste. For example, you start off with no colors, then you'll advanced into a more graphical setting with color and such. It evolves, as the game may suggest, it changes from a retro aspect to an advanced taste, whether you are in a Final Fantasy perspective, Zelda perspective, or even Diablo!

												Evoland is a 3 hour or so game that has a great concept but pretty much only lives by that concept. A game of evolving Adventure/RPG elements through the times would be a great idea if executed nicely, yet this one fails to deliver on a challenging game with actual evolving of mechanics, both in gameplay and actually evolving. It seems to only ever try to be Zelda or Final Fantasy, with only one instance of it being Diablo (which played exactly like the Zelda sections only with more enemies and money drops). It only switches between the first two, and the plot is pretty much an abridged Final Fantasy VII after the initial area. Even the second character you can play as is named Kaeris. You can guess what happens to her before the end of the game.There is a fine difference between a homage and a game with references everywhere, and I'm afraid this is more of the latter. Kind of disappointed.Pick it up on a sale if you want something to do for three hours, but it isn't something you need to get to remember the old days. You aren't missing anything by passing it up, and there is no replay value after you have completed it unless you want to go achievement hunting. It drives on your nostalgia and nothing more.			"

												If you're picking up this game for the nostalgia factor, I'll give you a word of advice: Don't.I don't care if it looks cool or something that may interest you, this is just a bad game.I will admit, the graphics are pretty good and the concept's enjoyable, it's just heavily flawed and priced at $10 which feels like $5 more than I would care to give it.You see, Evoland is a game ABOUT the nostalgia factor, it embraces the tropes of its forefathers and parodies it in a delightful (if not openly obvious) manner, the gameplay takes time to be varied to show the evolution of the Adventure RPG, and it even comes with a cute little card game which is genuinely interesting. But it's ABOUT the nostalgia factor, so rather than be a game that can stand on its own, it makes itself feel like every game it ""showcases,"" just not as fun. Its most unique feature is a point in the game where you can shift between the ""past"" and the ""future"" to make it through an area, which was enjoyable! But that's literally the only unique feature it has. The rest is a lackluster adventure that is blatantly inferior to every game it pays homage to.If there's one good thing Evoland does, it serves as an example when games choose to be retro, thinking that it would be simple, and put no thought into just what made it simple and fun. While it may be funny, that isn't enough to justify a four hour slog.			"

												Great, great, GREAT concept. Fantastic art, decent music, decent gameplay. This game does not do anything that you haven't seen before... and still manages to be original.However, the game is a bit short (4 hours, 6 if you want full completion). It also suffers from a sometimes questionable level design, and a repetitive soundtrack. Finally, Evoland suffers from a pretty major pacing problem. Early on, you will keep on noting how clever the mechanics are, how cool the nods and references to videogames tropes feel, and how the world is evolving with you. However by mid-game, this sensation will be gone - not because you get used to it, but simply because the game stops throwing anything your way. It just becomes a barebone version of existing games, and by the end you may find yourself thinking you'd rather play the masterpieces Evoland references rather than Evoland itself.Evoland is a brilliant idea, and an absolutely cute game which loves to take advantage of your gamer instincts and reflexes. Sadly besides its concept, the game itself is a bit stale, if not repetitive. I didn't think I'd say this one day, but I wish the game held your hand more, because this is where the game shines. Evoland starts off strong, and ends rather weakly. The games has tones of potential, and for the prices, it is definitely worth getting a look at, but don't expect too much out of it.With all that said, I am extremely excited for the upcoming sequel.

												Evoland could have been something great, and the first 30 minutes are lots of fun, but after that it just gets boring.  The game is only 3 hours long, but even in that short time it somehow finds a way to turn into something that is not very enjoyable.  By the time I finished the game, and I realized it was only 3 hours, I was surprised (in a bad way).I do not recommend this game at the price it is being sold at.  There is no replayablility, and what is there isn't that interesting.  I'm disappointed that this great idea was not executed in a professional manner.			"

												As it turns out, the entire history of [action/adventure] video games can be summarised by mashing together Zelda and FF7. Literally that is all this game is. It starts out all interesting by going through the motions of evolving controls, graphics, sound and all that before just completely ripping off the two aforementioned with a very minor Torchlight-esque sectionette and Triple Triad card game (without even a catchy BGM to go with it). Also a nod to UT's announcer with text kill streaks popping up and a Minecraft item. Still, thats barely a handful of games.Granted, its quite impressive for a small indie team to pump out but it was perhaps too big an undertaking for them to utilise to its full potential. Its too quick to climax, forgets what it was doing and then just proceeds to end on a low. Much could have been done if it continued its tongue-in-cheek parodies while exploring other genres, even if it kept its Zelda/FF overworld, there could have been multiple dungeons covering them like it did with what it claimed to be Diablo but felt more like Torchlight.Like a firework; this game provides wonderful anticipation when lit and a grand display upon exploding but the only way to know its all over is when you hear the distant ""thunk"" of it hitting the ground in the distance. And even thats only two and a half hours worth of time. Bloody long♥♥♥♥♥♥firework, that.			"

												Evoland is a hilarious title brimming with nostalgia. The number of times it cracked a grin on my face or made me laugh was more than the number of dollars it cost... until it stopped evolving (which was maybe 90 minutes in). Then it was just ""crappy FF / Diablo / Zelda land"" with a hard emphasis on the crappy.The best hours of gameplay are the first 2, the game is pretty short (I did literally everything in 10.3 hours), and the fact that it took no effort to make its Final Fantasy random encounter battles at all interesting (which end up being a good chunk of the middle of the game) are some pretty big downsides.There are definitely some funny parts and some nostalgia pangs to be had. If you absolutely loved Final Fantasy 7 and old school Zeldas, and you find this on sale, you can probably expect to get your money's worth.You'll likely get 6-10 hours of gameplay, with no replayability except possibly to show a friend the first hour of it which is a very interesting look back into the history of game development.

												I would give this game 1/5 stars.This game was supposed to be a fun 'concept' game, making nostaligic references to the classic RPGs which we all know and love. The problem with Evoland is that it tries to be a game in itself; A very lengthy, monotonous, repetitive game where the 'evolutions' happen infrequently, inconsistently, incompatibly, and generally do not enhance the gameplay experience. The problem is that all of the evolutions and references to RPG classics are highly watered down. If anything, I would describe Evoland as the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ized version of otherwise good games. Don't get me wrong; the trailor for the game looks exciting and is the reason why I purchased this game, but the excitement stops there. Within minutes of playing, I already feel the dread of doing the same thing over and over and over again. The turn-based battles are inconsequential in that all the of money and experience you earn amounts to nothing important, and does not give you an edge in the game. The majority of the game is a primative take on Zelda 1/3ish, containing substantially fewer features than the original. If this game were significantly shortened in length, or if the puzzles weren't boring, repetitive chores, or if the gameplay experience was actually enhanced rather than watered down in relation to the referenced RPG classics, then I would recommend this game. But no; I'm afraid that this game was a complete waste of time. Out of obligation, I completed the game in five hours and unlocked the majority of the achievements (the rest would have been easy to attain if I felt like doing more repetitive gameplay), but honestly, knowing what I know now, I wouldn't have bothered playing the game if it were given to me for free. I wouldn't play the game if I were paid $25 to play it; those five hours of my life are much more precious than this waste of time.			"

												Fun to see the development of games over time, that's also the only positive thing I can say about this game. I'm not really into adventure games, but if this is how most adventure games are, I don't see me playing one ever again. Forced fights every X seconds, which are mostly a grind to get to the next chest with some random crap. Stopped playing when the fights where mostly attack-heal-attack, which involves pressing the spacebar a few times and getting a bit of pointless XP/coins.			"

												Evoland is a fun distraction and well worth $10, however I will state it is more a commentary on video games than a game in of itself. There is little challenge in the turn-based sections of the game as your partner has a heal they can spam for literally zero mana. There are some spelling errors which while don't really distract from the game has a whole, I find it odd there wasn't a higher quality control on the script. The Zelda-Esque areas are more enjoyable, although all the puzzles are transparent and all the enemy are frustrating as your sword has a delay. Controller support is not fully implemented, which seems odd for a game like this. You can use a controller, but you'll need to map your buttons in the options.Overall I'd say this game is enjoyable, a neat little commentary on how far gaming has come. No replay value, although they tried to force some by hiding collectable ""stars"" throughout the world. (No thanks)As a game? Not so good, but I still enjoyed it as a piece of consumable media. 6/10			"

												Evoland, despite all of its negative ratings, I believe its a great RPG game. It hits nostaglia to many RPG gamers, and even gamers that arent quite as avid. As you play the game, it progresses from an old fashion, to a more modern taste. For example, you start off with no colors, then you'll advanced into a more graphical setting with color and such. It evolves, as the game may suggest, it changes from a retro aspect to an advanced taste, whether you are in a Final Fantasy perspective, Zelda perspective, or even Diablo! I enjoyed the game for its considerate price, and couple hours of gameplay, so I suggest you buy it!			"

												Evoland is, definitively, the worst game I have ever played. It feels a rushed, half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥attempt to make use of a cool concept.A major fault of the game is simply in the amount of content; it says that it will take you through history of gaming. Yet the only thing it delivers on is having a couple of sections kinda like Zelda, Final Fantasy, and Diablo.Is that all the gaming history there is? What about some point and click? what about real time strategy? The other problem is the quality of the limited amount of content. Throughout the 2-4 hours of the FF section of the game, you have literally 0-1 spells. And the amount of times you will randomly encounter enemies is absurd. You will sit there spamming left click as the repetitive battle animations play for the same 2-3 enemies in the game. The difficulty in this section is either stupid-hard because your survival is based on your luck not encountering a random enemy. OR stupid-easy because you have a spell that will heal you more then enemies can damage you, so you can just spam it and live through anything.The Diablo section has only 1 button. You spam it three times to do a slightly more powerful move. You do this for about an hour after which you leave this section. ...Yup that's it.The Zelda Section is probably the best it offers so alright puzzles and some actual non-receptive crap content. However this section is less then 1/3 of the game. Not to say this section is ""good"" just not as horrendous as the others.All in all, worst game I ever played. Literally painful to play. Buy yourself some ice-cream instead it offers more enjoyment.			"

												A loving parody. Evoland is unquestionably that. It conjures memories of the all-time greatest RPGs, like Legend of Zelda, Final Fantasy, Diablo, and Dragonball Z.Yes, that is definitely all of them. No other RPGs have ever been significant.I can't help but gawk at the lack of content. This is supposed to be an homage to the history of RPGs? This feels like I paid for a tour of an art museum, and was shown three rooms before being thrown out onto the street. The laziness shows through at the seams. They didn't even bother arranging the small amount of content they had into a full map, instead clustering every location together and then filling three-quarters of the world with impassable mountains.The length of the story is also a disappointment. Part of the problem might be that it does the job of reminding you of other games too well, or at the least, too bluntly. Despite the fact that many great RPGs can be completed in a single sitting, this game fails to acknowledge those games at all, choosing instead to constantly reference series that create the expectation that both the storyline and the difficulty curve will be slowly, patiently built up. However, since this game is so short, that doesn't happen. The endgame remains pitifully easy, and the ""expected"" RPG scenes play out in quick succession without bothering to give you enough context to make anything matter.It doesn't even work as a parody. It's about on par with the ""Movie"" movies. References are not the same as jokes. The few actual jokes that could have been funny are skimmed over in favor of getting on to the next thing as quickly as possible. Don't buy this game as a gift for a friend. Buy it as a gift for an enemy. Then apologize.			"

												Evoland is a 3 hour or so game that has a great concept but pretty much only lives by that concept. A game of evolving Adventure/RPG elements through the times would be a great idea if executed nicely, yet this one fails to deliver on a challenging game with actual evolving of mechanics, both in gameplay and actually evolving. It seems to only ever try to be Zelda or Final Fantasy, with only one instance of it being Diablo (which played exactly like the Zelda sections only with more enemies and money drops). It only switches between the first two, and the plot is pretty much an abridged Final Fantasy VII after the initial area. Even the second character you can play as is named Kaeris. You can guess what happens to her before the end of the game.There is a fine difference between a homage and a game with references everywhere, and I'm afraid this is more of the latter. Kind of disappointed.Pick it up on a sale if you want something to do for three hours, but it isn't something you need to get to remember the old days. You aren't missing anything by passing it up, and there is no replay value after you have completed it unless you want to go achievement hunting. It drives on your nostalgia and nothing more.			"

												If you're picking up this game for the nostalgia factor, I'll give you a word of advice: Don't.I don't care if it looks cool or something that may interest you, this is just a bad game.I will admit, the graphics are pretty good and the concept's enjoyable, it's just heavily flawed and priced at $10 which feels like $5 more than I would care to give it.You see, Evoland is a game ABOUT the nostalgia factor, it embraces the tropes of its forefathers and parodies it in a delightful (if not openly obvious) manner, the gameplay takes time to be varied to show the evolution of the Adventure RPG, and it even comes with a cute little card game which is genuinely interesting. But it's ABOUT the nostalgia factor, so rather than be a game that can stand on its own, it makes itself feel like every game it ""showcases,"" just not as fun. Its most unique feature is a point in the game where you can shift between the ""past"" and the ""future"" to make it through an area, which was enjoyable! But that's literally the only unique feature it has. The rest is a lackluster adventure that is blatantly inferior to every game it pays homage to.If there's one good thing Evoland does, it serves as an example when games choose to be retro, thinking that it would be simple, and put no thought into just what made it simple and fun. While it may be funny, that isn't enough to justify a four hour slog.			"

However, there quickly got to be a plateau where it changed from fun to grinding, mainly when the Final Fantasy elements became the final stage. When I was getting frustrated by artificial load times and the game offered a grind-required option to disable the load times, I bailed. Pretty painful in its last third, which is why I'm not recommending it.			"

												What seems to have originally been a game jam nod towards the evolution from 8bit to cd-rom JRPGS, there's actually a bit of a story and sub card game in here.  It only took a few hours to complete, but it was a good few hours, i would highly recommend this for anyone that enjoyed playing Final Fantasy back in the day.			"

												This is a gem you wouldn't wanna miss. While others think that the concepts became switched up mid-game and misapplied, I feel as if it has a linear progression to it. The game starts off, with the very humble begginings of how video games started. Then, you must collect upgrades which takes you on a trip through video game history, showing milestones we have achieved through time with things such as; better graphics, different point-of-views, and combat systems. It heavily references to Zelda and Final Fantasy, calling for some fine nestalgia. For the price The game is more than worth it, especially if you like upgrade games with adventuring mechanics. It's just whatd you expect out of a $10 game, but with a tad more captivity. Sure, they could have implemented more to the rather short game, but I feel to them it was more than just a game, it also traversed you through the history of video games itself and to me, was a very fun experience.

												This charming game grabs a fistful of nostalgia and hits any gamer around during the early years straight in the face. At it's core it's a fairly simple game made up of popular mechanics that tells a tale we've already heard... but considering it's made of games we've already played, that makes sense, right? The Zelda-like dungeons were clever, although I'm a little annoyed by walk-through walls to hide collectibles.I thoroughly enjoyed the game, although I'm sad it was so short. My game time is only so high because I grabbed all the achievements; the story itself could be done in probably a 2 or 3 hour session the first time. I value games on average (more or less depending on reviews/hype) at $1 per hour of gameplay, and since I got this game on the summer sale it was very much worth it. I'd probably still recommend it at the full $10 price, but it doesn't hurt to slap it on a wishlist and wait for some sort of sale or discount. Much like a Zelda game, I'll probably not touch the game again for a few years and then randomly pick it back up to play through in an afternoon or two.I'd give this game a 7.5/10.			"

												This game costs way to much for the little to no content in it. The game feels like it was quickly made with rpg make VII thrown together quickly just to make a fast buck and most of the positive reviews sound like they came from people selling there reviews. The action rpg aspect of this game starts out in old final fantasy game style then finishes off in FFVII. The story is not thought out and sevearly lacking any substance. You fight maybe 10 different monsters in the hour it takes to beat the game with a map so small its really shows how much was put into the game. It feels like the person who made this game only played games made in the last 15 years and didnt do much in the way of research. I would not recomend this game to me it just feels like a quick cash grab like most games on steam today			"

												This is a fun and challenging game that you may give up on after trying plenty of times. Your arsenal in this game consists of a bow, a sword, and a bomb. In this Evoland you mainly solve puzzles and defeat bosses. You mainly solve puzzles using a Time Crystal,  (A crystal you hit with your sword, bow, or bomb that changes the old time with the pixels and the new places with HD graphics and grown trees) a bow, and a bomb. Ergo, i'd recommend this game to the puzzle solving people.			"

The story is kind of generic but you really get to enjoy the game through its references and changes among genres (from an old Zelda-style of gameplay, to a turn based RPG, to an action-rpg. And those gameplay changes make sense within the story!) Really enjoyable game for people interested in history of videogames as well as RPGs. 8/10.			"

												Evoland is a very fun game in both concept and execution. Through out the game you will be taken on a journey through the evolution of games over the years. ""Evoland = Evolution Land"".The game starts out in a retro gameplay style similar to the original ""Legend Of Zelda"", and your hero is a young boy named Clink which is rather close to Link our favorite Hyrule hero. Through the game you will see two main combat styles including: an over world random encounter much like ""Final Fantasy"" and dungeon crawling similar to ""Legend of Zelda, Diablo""Like most games it is dangerous to go alone so early on in the story you will have a heroine join your party. You also receive new items through the game that help you to solve some basic puzzles. Also if saving the world starts being a little too much to handle, take it easy and play yourself a game of double down! Evolands very own TCG game.It is up to you, save the world of Evoland from the forth coming shadow set to destroy your home. Weather you wish to complete the main story clocking in at around 3-5 hours or 100% completion including (Collecting Stars & Double Down Cards) this game has a lot to offer and will leave a positive impression on you. I look very forward to playing Evoland 2 very soon and if you would like to see the game in action check out my full Youtube playthrough/walkthrough in the link below.Evoland Playthrough/Walkthrough Playlist: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLN5UUB4p8yP7TsKZEh7AUIa78_DTJuZwLL "

												From 8 bit textures and basic movements/scrolling to fully-rendered 3D animation and combat, let us not forget about the dynamic lighting too! This is a truly one of a kind game that delivers much nostalgia to its players... I was one of them. Zelda, Diablo, Dungeon Keeper, and Final Fantasy just to name a few. OH! And Pokemon! With the turn-based battles and stuff! Yea... this is what I was like throughout the game. Now let's get into the nitty-gritty....What did Evoland do BEST?evolving from 1980's to 2014 graphics (ahem.. Evoland.. ahem)sarcastic textsa game within a game! (players will know what I'm talking about)references to classic and popular series such as Zelda, Diablo, Final Fantasy etc...great music!turn-based battles, but can get annoying after some timeboss fights are spot onWhat did Evoland lack?lackluster story, not deep and detailed (but I guess it's not about the story, is it?) finding collectables is atrocious, I had to look up a walkthroughcan't continue playing same saved game after you kill the last bossConclusionI recommend this game. Some people say it's not worth the $10, but I'm indifferent. I paid that amount and I'm satisfied. Mainly because I had to start over a few times to get all the collectibles and achievements. It delivers on its concept although the story was definitely lacking, and typical. Save the girl... skip... kill the bad guy... you're a hero!If you're just wanting to feel the nostalgia without having to play all the classics, then this is the game for you. It does very well on that front! It kinda makes me wanna play Super Mario World for some reason....My rating: 7/10 ""Got the job done"" "

												If you are looking for a long grand epic RPG, do not buy this! I have heard this game clocks in at around 3 to 6 hours depending on your playstyle. So no lengthy RPG to be found here sadly. Now that that is out of the way....Is the game any good? Yes, it is! I've not completed it yet, and this is just an early inpression after having run through around 2 dungeons, and seeing enough progression to give a proper early impression. For starters, the game delivers in the area it is intended to. And thay is by delivering an evolving adventure game. From early spritework, to 3D. You'll notice other evolutions in the game, different battle systems, different types of health meters, and more. It plays a bit like an amalgamation of various action rpg and turn based rpg games. Quite frankly, it does a decent job capturing the nostalgic feel. The first thing I dug had to be the music. It's spot on. Classic chip tune RPG tunes to start out the mix. And yes, the music evolves too!As I stated, this is not intended to be a long game. At under $10usd, it might be worth it to some. If anything, to take a trip down memory lane. For others, to see a nice history lesson on the evolution of RPGs.			"

												A quick jaunt throught history of gaming! This is basically a playable timeline of computer games (mostly focused on RPG's, but with cameos from games outside the RPG genre) that highlights the trends and breakthroughs in different ""eras"" of games. The majority of the game most cloesly resembles a mix of Final Fantasy and Legend of Zelda as you battle through enemies to defeat the ultimate baddie! The humor and presentation is cheeky and simple - there is nothing new here, but of course that is the whole point. The nostalgia value alone makes this worth a playtrhough if you enjoyed various RPG's since the 80's.			"

												It's a cute idea, it really is, and as a longtime console RPG nerd I really wanted to enjoy this more, but the concept of evolving gameplay is much stronger than the actual implementation. The pacing of the evolutions is poor, leading to an early string of flashy improvements followed by long stretches of dull gameplay that would have failed to entertain back when final fantasy clones were a quasi-legitimate genre. When it comes to references, the game tries to stick its finger in far too many pies, with Mario Bros-themed monsters in one area and Diablo gameplay in the next. The game offers weak satire of some RPG gameplay tropes while remaining absolutely true to others, compromising the humor of the former and presenting itself as blind to the faults of the latter.I mean, it's not a BAD game, it's just a highly inconsistent presentation that overstays its welcome. If the dungeons were a bit shorter, the combat just a bit flashier, and the writing a bit more clever, this would have been absolute gold. But as presented, this grab bag of references won't be much fun for anybody not looking to reminisce about a highly specific subset of console games from the 90s.			"

												This game is awesome in my opinion. It sort of shows the history of games and evolution of gaming as a whole, but in its own interesting way. You start off in a Black and White 2D platformer, then 'upgrade' your game all the way to HD. It gives homage and a tip of the hat towards many gaming greats including Legend of Zelda, Final Fantasy and even Skyrim! There's many, many refrences which probably alot I missed too! Anyway a fantastic game! I absolutely loved every single minute of it. Brought me lots of nostalgic feelings towards older games in the way it makes you grind for xp, levels, abilities and money. You need to search every corner of dungeons for loot and secrets and fight hard bosses until you learn their attack patterns and just roll them. My only problem with this game is that it is too short! Honestly you can finish the game in less than an hour. The only reason my playtime is 6 hours is because I went collecting everything and getting 100%. It's not worth the full price for that little gameplay. Try to get it on sale! :D			"

												For a game with a title like ""Evoland"", the gameplay never manages to evolve beyond mashing the A button.It's also full of embarrassing, dated references, if you can call them that. The first boss is literally named ""Kefka's Ghost."" It has nothing to do with Kefka, it doesn't look like him, and it doesn't act like him. It's just a monster named ""Kefka's Ghost."" Funny reference, right? Remember Kefka? Huh? Remember FF6? *nudge nudge*This game is a lot of that. It's also two hours long, which is great, because god, what an excruciating two hours that was.

I really want to recommend this game. But I can't. I mean, it is not bad, and at worst it is still worth your attention. Unfortunately Steam's review is completely binary, so stick with me for a moment:This game idea is great, it should be distributed in any game school as a good sum up of how games evolved and how its design did. The game's strongest point is the graphical changes, and it truly shines when you have to switch them to complete a task, if it was that for the entire time, it would truly be a remarkable master piece, I mean that.But the developer had in mind that once all the graphics were set, it should try to be parody of Final Fantasy VII and Zelda, and all I could say is ""GOD! THIS IS BORING!"".It does bring some bad habits along for the ride, like far away check points or you not being 100% what to do, but this isn't a problem as the combat.Now, I like turn based combat, Dofus, FFT, or a more similar example, Pokémon and Digimon DS/Dusk & Dawn. But here it was just an annoyance, a shallow gameplay that starts as a funny reminder to a disappointing ""Oh, we're really going to go with this?"", I really was playing at an automatic mode I didn't realize I had a sequence break of getting the second part of an amulet before the first! I was quoting Yathzee the whole time I was in the overworld:""Bloated, unwieldy, menu-driven combat: select ability, select attack, select target, wait 5 seconds for the character's brain to start working, repeat. How about we just walk up to the enemy and press one button that bonks him on the head? Or am I missing the point?""Sure, the point is to say ""it was once like this"", but it doesn't bring you any satisfaction to it, the story is shallow too for the same reason, but the story at least wasn't there only slow me down. It made me question if it was so boring back in the day and I just don't recall.What is more disappointing is the last boss you fight twice (a spoiler for your own good, believe me), where you can't beat him, so you might just as well not heal so you won't waste money on it.Later on when you have a fight with it on real time, it reminded me of a Klonoa boss fight, only worse, so my childhood probably wasn't a boring waste of time, YAY. The boss is boring, you don't know much what to do and when you figure out you REALLY get♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥because with the mechanics they gave you, it would be a LOT more fun, yet no, you can only hun and hit melee, makes you wonder why they didn't at least give you Sonic's speed.You could drop bombs so the hands could crush it and take heavy damage, you could swing the sword on the eye and then use the crossbow to hit the ball it took 15 minutes for you to confirm it was important because you couldn't see it.I dropped the game on the final boss because I was just too bored. AND THE GAME ISN'T EVEN THAT LONG! It shouldn't be able to do that! It did had a creative mechanic once you got all the graphics, and I would never think of it, it was REALLY clever, but they threw the concept down the window.If you think you can handle it, by all means buy it, because the idea behind it is really good and I think the developers deserve some credit and I would totally buy a sequel . They just need to figure out that they need to polish the thought that they can be their own thing while referencing game story, instead of aiming for a bad parody.			"

												I love so much this game! It gave me a lot of work to get all achievements, but worth it. The idea of it is different, the gameplay is very good, the music too, it's super funny... There are so many good things to talk about it I do not know where to start. The game is obviously a parody, is not made to present much difficulty, so if you are expecting a RPG to create builds, grinding and exchange equipment, you are looking the wrong game. The most he will do is lightly touch these issues because his goal is to show a little of each type of evolution rpg. And that's what makes it so different. When you leave a town, enters a turn-based RPG. Then goes to a cave, and feels playing diablo. Leaving this cave and entering another, you're playing a action RPG with a combo (space + space + space, but it's a combo). And the description of the equipment? Hilarious! Each boss you face has a different system, one at the base of turns, one in action... This creates a great diversity. Not to mention the puzzles, which are really cool too.So, yeah, o yourself a favor and buy this game now.			"

I was expecting some sort of fusion and instead you get some of FF, some of Diablo, some of Zelda -- separately -- where progression in each zone is ultimately arbitrary and amounts to nothing. Why the hell did I need gil? To level? What's the use of Diablo equipment? It's more like a slideshow of nostalgia than a game. The game is worth it, but only because compared to the early access abominations around Steam, this game is serious quality and made with care visually.

Anyway a fantastic game! I absolutely loved every single minute of it. Brought me lots of nostalgic feelings towards older games in the way it makes you grind for xp, levels, abilities and money. You need to search every corner of dungeons for loot and secrets and fight hard bosses until you learn their attack patterns and just roll them. My only problem with this game is that it is too short! Honestly you can finish the game in less than an hour. The only reason my playtime is 6 hours is because I went collecting everything and getting 100%. It's not worth the full price for that little gameplay. Try to get it on sale! :D			"

												It's good for what it sets out to accomplish but get it on sale... If you want to feel nostalgic and make fun of nearly every stereotype in the JRPG and Adventure game genre... this is the game for you.It's short, took me about 6 hours, used the collectable guides because some of the secrets were just a bit too much (invisible walls... hate those). Backtracking is pretty annoying in this game due to the random fights on the overworld so make sure you get everything on the first pass if possible.There's a card game parody of Triple Triad from Final Fantasy 8 but it's much more simplistic and it's called Double Twin... so if you enjoy card meta games, you'll enjoy that little inclusion.As for the con's it's a bit too simple, somewhat short and not overly challenging, just tricky in some parts. It also plays a bit too clunky for my liking which I didn't exactly enjoy... I was trying to use the D-Pad but I was forced to use the analog stick as it doesn't register the finer movements on the D-Pad. 7 / 10			"

												When I saw this game come out, I though “Man, that’s a cool concept, I should buy this when it’s on a sale”. However, I never did. I dunno why, but I just forgot about this game. Now, I can play it thanks to the glory of Family Sharing and… Well, I’m f#cking disappointed. The game has one of the best concepts for a game I've seen in years and then just decides to turn those ideas to a human form and shoot it on the head with a sawed off shotgun at point blank range.The biggest problem this game has is the parody it tries to be. It starts okay, being an affectionate parody to the original Legend of Zelda games, but soon enough it starts to deviate from the cool concept of recreating history and stays making a rather fanboy-looking parody of just two games: Zelda and Final Fantasy VII. The game calls itself for going through videogame history, so WHY THE HELL IT SPENDS SO MUCH TIME JUST MAKING PARODIES OF THE SAME TWO GAMES OVER AND OVER!? Not only it makes no sense, but if you don’t love EITHER of those two games, you’ll get extremely tired of the game, really fast. And while I like the 2D Zelda games, I do NOT like FFVII, I find it to be popular because, for most people, it was their first RPG, it’s characters are mostly lackluster, two dimensional, and quite honestly lame as hell. WELL GREAT, BECAUSE THE MAIN CHARACTER IS A PARODY OF CLOUD, THE SECOND MAIN CHARACTER IS A LITERAL COPY-PASTE OF AERITH AND IT EVEN HAS A CID IN BETWEEN. And if that wasn't enough, the villain is - YOU GOT IT, AN EDGIER SEPHIROTH, the only difference being that it's design takes from - YOU GOT IT AGAIN, LEGEND OF ZELDA, by looking like Ganondorf and even  being defeated by deflecting slow moving balls of magic back at him. Oh, and want to know the best part of it all?  The game doesn't even have an ending. You kill the Ganonroth-wannabe, credits roll off and that's it. You get absolutely nothing, although to this point it's what I expected.I’m not joking here, the game is short, barely 2 hours long, but yet it spends most of its time trying to be a poor-taste Final Fantasy wannabe. I was happy as hell when the game suddenly changed and finally decided to parody something that wasn’t a Nintendo game or FFVII, and it turned out that it was just a dungeon inspired in Diablo, which had special controls just for it while the rest goes back to the same crap over and over. I have to say, for a game that's supposed to be about the history of games, neither it references many different games neither it stays at just games. It just feels out of place when the game suddenly throws multiple references of Lord of the Rings, and it's even INSULTING when the villain QUITE LITERALLY THROWS A KAMEHAMEHA FOR NO REASON DURING A FIGHT. And I don't mean a similar looking attack, no. He even said ""Ka-me-ha-me-ha"" and posed the same way. It's THAT lame. Oh, and not only the parodies are boring and uninspired and the story lackluster and predictable, but it also has a few bugs. Textures stretching up to infinity and looking ugly, the game crashing when opening a chest (something you’ll be doing for half the game and that has happend to me twice on the two hours of game), that kind of stuff. You can also keep going when the Aerith-wannabe leaves to learn spells and go into the next dungeon, where you’re somehow able to play as her even though she’s NOT coming with you.But does the game has good stuff however? Yeah. Somehow. Changing the genre of the game constantly is a good way to keep it both interesting and original, even though it doesn’t happen nearly as enough and  having the final battle suddenly be something completely different feels quite stupid.The idea of a game evolving is also a really cool concept, and it’s quite fun to go back and revisit previous areas, see how they look now that instead of SNES graphics we got PSX graphics. Sadly the devs kinda messed that up, as previous places stay with the graphics you saw them, meaning if you've unlocked beautiful 3D graphics, the first town will still have SNES graphics FOR NO REASON WHAT SO EVER.The soundtrack should also be commended, as it manages to capture the feeling of the eras it tries to represent, and some of the themes are catchy enough. Is the game worth it? That’s a tough question that ultimately boils down to it’s price. 10€ is nowhere a good price for this 2 hours travesty, it’s a repetitive experience that probably only fans of either Zelda, FFVII or both will like, as the game CONSTANTLY makes fun of both. I didn’t have to pay anything thanks to Family Sharing, and I still feel disappointed by this, it’s an extremely good concept gone to hell and back, and I bet that it’s all because the writer (or writers) left their inner fanboy run rampant. I mean come on, there were other RPG games other than f#cking FFVII that made an impact! What about Earthbound, for example? NO, LET’S INSTEAD MAKE REFERENCES TO SKYRIM AND IT’S F#CKING ARROW IN THE KNEE.Don't buy this. Don't look at it. Don't even think about it. Unless you can get it for a single € or you get it as a gift, I don't see why you should even purchase and play this. This has some of the WORST writing I've seen on my entire life playing games, and that's quite an achievement.TL;DR Edition: A 10€-worth nerdgasm about Zelda and Final Fantasy VII, the games that the writer/s liked the most. If you don’t hold both of them as the pinnacle of human creation, you might wanna look away from this. Maybe the sequel is better, but I don’t care to this point.			"

The game is really dull; simplified to the point that even people who haven't played Zelda or FF would be turned away from sheer boredom. The game touts it's gameplay and the ability to visually travel through gaming history, through the styles of Zelda, Final Fantasy, Diablo and more. But the game leans so heavily upon it's gimmicks that when the gimmicks don't pan out, the game collapses in on itself. You start out in a Zelda-esque level and you have to unlock movement, sound, scrolling, color, art style and much more via chests. At first it brought out the nostalgia and was endearing to see someone poke fun at the absurtiy that was the sheer volume of items you had to collect and find to progress in the Zelda franchise. But when you have to unlock everything through chests like peoples, towns, even the creatures you have to fight, the joke gets old; quick. As soon as you finish collecting all the abilities and few treasures that you can collect with those newfound abilities (you collect stars that are useless and cards that can be used as a FF rip-0ff card game called Double Twin), you move to the overworld in the style of Final Fantasy. You unlock those monsters and you will trigger fight events in the overworld section and certain dungeons from that point on. Which gets annoying quick because you they happen often and I mean often. So much to the point that I can't accurately discribe the distance from the first level to the first town in pixels or time, but I can in fight events. About 7-16. And the distance between the two isn't large; the whole everworld is the size of an average FFVII dungeon.   Why did the developer do this? Simple; to balance out the time you play Zelda style and FF so it's somewhat even. To put it into perspective, There are Two towns, 3 main quest dungeons, 3 secret dungeons, 3 quest areas and one secret area. If you did strictly the main quest, the areas are all Zelda style and take a few minutes to complete, one dungeon, and the boss fight. these would take up maybe 20-30 minutes of total gameplay. The towns are FF type and you skirt through the first on in seconds maybe 5 minutes if you really explore it, you move to the dungeon ahead which takes up 5-10 minutes because of how many fights you trigger and  the only other town you skirt right through in about the same as the first town. So with dungeons and areas alone, maybe 20 minutes max you spend doing turn style based combat. If you tried to find all the collectables, you'd add on another 20-60 minutes for Zelda style combat based on if you have already unlocked the airship (which is owned by Cid, another FF rip-off). So you spend most of the game playing as a Link clone rather than you do as a FF clone, even though to travel to different levels, you have to travel through the overworld which is all FF combat. But there are so few enemy types and all but one uses melee and they spawn so often that you end up trying to run away. There is only one Diablo level (a main quest dungeon) but its another button masher that you can complete in 5 minutes or less.   The music and scenery have vary few variations. Added to the boring gameplay, this helps to further decrease any desire to continue playing.  The plot is just ""Hey im a Cloud clone and you're an Aerith clone. Oh noes, its an evil being named Zephyros. Oh noes, he killt you! I am mad and you die now, Kay? The end"". No effort was put into making the game interesting or good, just to look pretty.                     With that said, would I recommend this game to anyone? Only if you are some sort of Youtuber or if you use it as some sort of oddly specific social game in where you play bad games with and objective such as ""Who can play the longest with out quiting from boredom"" Or ""Who can spot the most references""  as a drinking game. Kind of like some Youtubers who have played Mario Kart 8 and the objective was to place first. If you didn't, you would drink some sort of alcoholic beverage. That's the only time I would recommend this game. It was a great idea, just executed poorly and without any enthusiasm.			"

Simple, fun, amusing and nostalgicSome games can be summarized in just a few words, Evoland is one of them. That doesn't mean it's a bad game by any stretch, but don't expect an epic journey that will last you for hours upon hours.Evoland takes us through some of the gaming we remember from our past (or have seen on YouTube, if you're not old enough), of course it is rather quick to upgrade us from very, very simple combat and graphics to more clean-looking 3D with better combat options (but certainly still not good in any way for a prolonged period of time).While people love to be nostalgic, who'd like to actually be stuck with something old?There are some amusing puzzles if you're interested in gathering all of the stars and/or cards, but it could easily be more - and that's coming from someone who is absolutely braindead when it comes to puzzles in games. In addition they have a game within the game, which is simple, yet frustrating if you get stuck with the bad cards.Overall, if you're just planning to rush through the game, you can probably do that in ~an hour (or less, I'm not sure), and as such the game might not be worth the money for you.If you however is like me, and want that little bit of nostalgic feeling while taking your time to go through the game, find all the extra bits and just be very casual about it, I would highly recommend it.

												Gee, I don't think I have a strong opinion either way with this game.On one hand, the references to Zelda and Final Fantasy are humorous if you've played them, particularly FF7, but otherwise, you won't understand the simple nods towards the two series. The throwback to the 80's, I believe, is interesting. It really makes you appreciate the progress that has happened in the last few decades. Honestly, it was eye-opening, as I didn't grow up in that era. It was fun seeing the game itself grow.Still, despite the humor and nostalgia, Evoland doesn't really offer anything new. The story is rather short and can be completed in 3-4 hours. I honestly do not remember the story. What I do remember is that I went through dungeons, found the hastily created boss, beat him once, then again in another form. The combat is boring; it's either slash, drop a bomb, or try to aim at moving enemies. There's nothing original about it. Combat in 3D mode is LoZ while open-world combat is classic FF mixed with 3D character models. It's basic, to sum it up.All in all, I suppose I'd recommend it. The Steam achievements are fairly easy to 100%, and if you're stuck, there are 3 wonderful guides to finding everything. However, it is rather short. Get it on sale if you're bored and have a few dollars lying around.			"

												Before I purchased this game I was a little skeptical due to the constant complaints about the story length and combat system, while the comments about this are slightly true this game does have its positive points one of which is the concept. The concept for this game is very unique and is executed very successfully, the game takes the player on a journey through video game history starting from the basic 2D graphics from years ago to the 3D graphics we have today. This game is not particularly difficult and could be considered a hand holder for the player but it is worth playing to watch as it shows how video games have evolved. The combat of this game is a very simple turn based system and can be rather boring at times. This game does have its flaws but at the same time it is very unique and has some good features most games lack. I rate this game 7/10. I suggest you do your research on this game before spending your money because it may not be for you, some will enjoy this game and others will not.EDITAfter playing this game a little longer I noticed some rough patches and some bad spots. When walking around you will sometimes get attcked every few seconds which gets very very annoying and the fact that each battle takes a long time to finish is an even bigger pain in the♥♥♥♥♥ Another bad point is that if you are walking around and happen to die then you get sent back to a checkpoint miles away from the place you died meaning you have to go through a whole laod of♥♥♥♥♥♥again and again.

												This is a clever idea, in theory at least, but honestly just not well executed.  The ""jokes"" are largely not funny, the gameplay shifts so much that, even if there is a part of the game you enjoy, it doesn't last long at all.  The game did have some enjoyable parts, but that was more at the very beginning when the game really was evolving.  The game may have survived better if you either stuck with one type of gameplay or just shifted and did not return.  A lot of the puzzles we're not clever, just annoying.  I just can't reccomend a game as poorly executed as this.			"

												Decent game, the main annoyance is the extremely EXCESSIVE amount of battles you get pulled into in the overhead world, while you're trying to explore. Even Final fantasy didn't throw them at you THIS OFTEN. If these turn based battles were anything more than spam spacebar to attack, maybe I wouldn't mind, but this seriously kills the game for me..Aside that, not much depth, story or stuff to collect,. the only real reason you'd want to play this is the fairly easy 100% completion achievement.Original only for the fact that there's no other game exactly ""like"" it, but it doesn't have much content of it's own that hasn't been ripped from zelda or final fantasy.

The irony of EvolandDo you know what is also a great Evolution in gaming? Fixing bugs and glitches as well as incompatibilities via patches after release.Besides of the fact that I don't get running my XBOX controller on this game, it is a nice history lesson about adventure gaming during the last decades. Recommended for people that remember those ""good old times"" and for everyone that asks himself why do people actually play retro games and why did they not have Early Access or Microtransactions back in the times... and where the heck are those DLCs after I defeated the boss?PS: The pad.exe running as administrator in Win7 compatibility mode is not working for me at all. Yeah, I know also fixing games yourself has been an EVOLUTION.  What ironic developers they are...  "

You can also play the 2D portion of the game for free as a Flash-powered game in your browser.The rest of the review:Evoland was an interesting concept that originated from a Flash-powered browser game of the same title, but the execution of this remake was rather disappointing.I was having fun with the constantly changing environment and controls and other features, but then the game slowed down.  I started having to grind my stats up to survive the random battle encounters.  I also had to grind loot to get a few of the achievements.  I wasn't seeing the constant changes any more.  I missed the fast pace of the 2D portion of the game and felt that the 3D portion of the game just wasn't as satisfying.

												At first you start in a 2D-scroller adventure, and through discoveries such as colour, music, 3D and going left, you start expanding the game. It's great fun - I finished the game 100% in one day. Not because it's too easy (though there are definitely tougher games out there), but because I didn't want to stop. A lovely homage to classics as Legend of Zelda, Final Fantasy VII and Dragon Quest.			"

 A formidable idea but a terrible realisation ( even for a 5 men team ).I had, at first, a little smile on my face while playing this game because the idea wrapping it seemed great at first.A game where you travel through gaming history while revisiting some of the most recognizable games of all time ( Zelda, Final Fantasy, Diablo ),a game where the gameplay itself evolve during your walk through the adventure, a game where...Wait, I already lied. The game stops innovating passed the first hour and starts to be redondant and to be constitute of random fights every 5 seconds;and that's the whole problem surrounding this game. The synopsis and publicity makes you think they took the best of the games it was inspired of, but it's false...They took the worse.The +:- The idea being original and meta.- The graphics evolution, from ""black and white/2D/80's"" graphics to pre-rendered backgrounds and 3D fights.- Some jokes and allusions may be funny...The -:- But the majority of them are just cringe worthy and could've been written by a 12 years old.- Talking about the writting, the story is absolutely.. I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT IT IS, BECAUSE IT'S NOT THERE!- You can basically buy two usable items ( potions and phoenix down ), a couple of swords and armors, two cards and... that's all. So much content.- Your crew will be composed of you ( a fighter ), and a mage who's only magic is heal and crystal.. *FirstShotOfWhiskey*- The music is horrible. The composer tried to copy/use FF as an influence but it's poorly done and you'll end up muting the game while listening to some Migos/Future, because these trash rappers will be candies for your ears compared to this sh*t.- The hitboxes and 3D gameplay are poorly coded, I'm pretty sure my character should've died from blunt trauma considering the number of times he took a tree right in the face.. *SecondShotOfWhiskey*- Lack of innovation after the first hour. Lack of an envy to live too.- The random encounters. Every 5 seconds. A fight. Against the same 7 ennemies. Doing the same 2 actions. Earning the same amount of XP. The same amount of Glis ( Yes, they named the currency ""Glis""... ). I swear to god, those random encounters are more frequents than homeless people in big cities. - THEY NAMED THE F***IN' MONEY GLIS MAN. GLIS. I WANNA DIE, I KNOW I WANNA DIE NOW!- *DRINKTHEWHOLEBOTTLE*- *DIE*Grade: D | Try it, it can be a good game to pay for on a bundle and you may like it. "

												The concept of this game is great, but there are just too many game-breaking bugs.  I've had to restart the game three times due to this, and it's just not worth the frustration.  If these issues were fixed I think this would be a great game, but it's been out for almost 4 years now so I'm not holding my breath.			"

												Fantastic adventure from beginning to end. The upgrades to both technical and graphical styles you obtain throughout the game are spaced out well enough that none of them overstay their welcome. The storyline could have been tighter, but Evoland wasn't about the tale being told, it was about the journey throughout various eras in RPGs. From hack and slash to turn based, from 16-bit all the way to 3D models on a prerendered background, it all felt great, which made the game an amazing experience.If you're looking for a great story, or the best combat possible, you might want to turn away, but for everyone else that just wants a fun 2-3 hour trip down memory lane, it's a blast.

												Oh... Really hard for me to write this review... -Many jokes and running gags from older games. -Really cool to see the transformation in each step. But the game itself... It is more a ""Meh"". At some point, it gets really annoying and you have no idea where to go. (The part where you can enter the ""Diablo Cave""). You walk with no idea where to go through a dessert with way to many random encounters. Half dead you come to the Diablo Cave. And this is where it gets really frustrating. No idea where to go, tons of enemys that drop only micrometers of health and no checkpoints. I've already finished the game when it was new, but i did not finish the second try.But i like the humor, like buying a ""Better CD player"" removes the annoying loading screens and stuffI would recommend it, but only for people with patience.It was a great game, but if i had the chance to get the money back (even it is only a little) i would do it			"

												Evoland is a nice original game that takes you through the evolution of gaming, from side-scrolling adventure to 3D enhanced fighting, while still being it's own adventure game. It does have a lot of influences from mostly the Legend of Zelda series and the Final Fantasy series (and they're not hiding that fact), and it works for this game!It is fairly short though, and if you're not bothering to find all the hidden stars and cards, you can get through this game in a couple hours time. But that doesn't take away the fun out of this game. It's a nice pick me up for inbetween those more serious games you like to play.			"

												I thought this was going to be something fairly cool and in someways it is, but it was also very disappointing and frustrating. Now that said $2.5 is incredibly cheap for a game so perhaps I did get my money's worth after 5 hours of play. The area that really upset me was the Diablo-like area in the middle of the game. (I don't know actually how near to the end this is.) I ended up stopping play after a couple hours of trying to fight against the lag and beat the boss. The battle of which would be hard even without lag. The lag was tied to specific areas in the game but unfortunately needing to be mobile meant crossing those areas eventually and it was a good likelihood you'd get slapped for 60-80% of your health before you could escape. This leads to a very lethal ending.The game itself is somewhat funny in its send up of various ""Roleplaying"" and Adventure gaming styles. I say that in quotes because my idea of RPGs doesn't include getting wrist strain from pounding on the keyboard. (By the way the game is played entirely on the keyboard with 0 mouse input, though it seems to have capability to interface with a gamepad.) The best parts were the transitions obtained from opening chests and the worst parts were the attempts to create a mini game that plays like a platformer with inadequate controls. I was initally attracted to the game after looking at its store page because of the image of various transitions in particular what looked like a full diabloesque inventory screen turns out to be a joke. Unfortunately the joke is on the player because it is entirely useless in the game. I don't mind jokes in games (in fact humor makes a game so much better in my opinion.) However this game takes the joke a little too far by making it at your expense. Oh the items you pick up in the Diabloesque area do nothing whatsoever and may get you killed a few times trying to get them before you realize this? OK. Ha...ha? Also a part of me thought it was a really cool idea to go from a 2d Nintendo game to a fullblown modern game with full RPG elements but alas that was merely a false impression. The last thing that makes me say ""Don't buy this"" is the fact that the devs seem entirely absent from the Steam forums now. The last response coming in April of 2013.			"

The gameplay is alright, I'd even say mediocre if that word didn't carry such a stigma, but realistically you should be playing this game for the concept, not the combat.

It was a little clunky, but you LOVED it, that adorable little chunkbuggy with it's adorable references and witty upgrades.However, as the game goes on, it slows down - the references show up less, the upgrades are fewer and far between - and by the time it hit Final Fantasy territory, it just had me wondering God Why did anyone play FF?What is presented at first as a lighthearted parody is taken way too far. I spent at least half an hour going back and forth in town through a quest line that has you talk to LITERALLY EVERYONE IN THE TOWN.It wasn't cute. It was obnoxious. It only gets worse once you get out onto the overworld, and you can't move anywhere except to fight boring, tedious monsters every few feet. I gave up on completing the game. It was far more stressful and tedious than it would have been interesting to see where it went.			"

												Though Evoland offers an interesting perspective on the evolution of (J)RPGs over the years, its very short length (2-5 hours at absolute max) means there's not a whole lot of content to explore. The obscenely high rate for random encounters (even if meant as a comical element) doesn't help either, and the game's humor grows old rather fast.It's worth looking into when it's on a sale, but at regular price, it simply does not have enough bang for the buck.

												Part Final Fantasy, part Zelda (and a small part torchlight). Neither part done with soul or depth.  Pretty disappointing. The main theme the ""evolution"" is more just the tutorial, and rather unsatisfying. Then you're just collecting stars and cards (for the crappy vs of Triple Triad  with 23 cards and only 1 opponent in the world, and nothing at stake).Bosses are lame. Loot is lame. Puzzles are lame. Not. Worth. Your. Time.			"

												Honestly, is it the a decent RPG indie game? Kinda. Is it worth £6.99? Not really. The game manages to provide sufficient entertainment for about 3-5 hours before you beat all the content. The game progresses quickly and although the transition between a bland, black and white, 2D pixel game and a vivid, engaging 3D game is entertaining and unique at first, the experience passes by so quickly that you're left really wondering whether it was worth paying for at all.Luckily, I got this in a bundle for about 50p. It's worth that much.It's bland, it's boring but it's interesting at the same time. It's intriguing to begin with, 'evolving' through the courses of RPG gaming in an easy way but it does get tiresome quick.It's good for lazy day gaming, 2am ""lmao i'm bored"" and maybe a bit of curiosity, but not much else. It's very repetitive and although the minigames such as 'Double Twin' provide some sort of variety to the endless, unavoidable, random battles and irritating enemies that end up respawning every 10 seconds; it's still not much.The game has alot of potential but it just feels unfinished. Brilliant concept, great soundtrack, unlocking system is fulfilling and entertaining at first; but lacks the excecution to turn a great concept into a great game.6/10 for a short indie game with a good soundtrack.

												""Evoland – A Short Story of Adventure Video Games Evolution"" is a well made game that does exactly what it set out to do: in just one game you will experience the evolution of adventure video games. Since the difficulty level overall is very low, this can be recommended for two types of people: those with nostalgia and those new to the genre or games in general - seasoned players won't find it challenging and will spend the most of their time trying to find all the chests in the game. For me, the great thing about this game is, that developers put in many tropes of the genre, also acknowledging the different eras of video game development - sometimes an advancement comes at a price and sometimes an advancement is, in retrospect, not that advancing but a necessary step forward.Altough there are two main influences (namely The Legend of Zelda series and the FInal Fantasy series), there are nods to others as well.One could nitpick that some steps and/or features have been left out, but that's beyond the point - the game does, what it does, well.

												At no point was there anything resembling proper difficulty. It was either mind-numbingly easy or painfully tedious. The plot was nothing but a collection of cliches, without a single attempt to actually connect the player to what was happening. It's like if Seltzer and Friedberg designed a videogame, except that they'd at least try to make things funny (and fail miserably). This just dragged on and on and on until I just wanted to get 100% completion so I could uninstall the game completely.I honestly do not understand why anybody would think that this was worth charging money for. I've played self-referential games with better jokes, better gameplay and actual plots, and they were free.			"

												Evoland is an interesting game concept. Accumulating game features as you go via chests or other means is enjoyable for a while, but after it slows down and stops you're not left with much. In some areas there is a tedious and rudimentary Final Fantasy battle system which will always threaten you with random death if you're not careful. In others there's a decent Zelda style adventure full of tedious dungeons but with inventive puzzles (especially the later one's). It's not an overly long game, but I feel like I would have gotten the point of the game with about 30% less overworld travel and maybe getting bombs earlier. Completionists be warned, you'll want to keep very close track of where you need to come back to later, as there are things you need to come back to in the endgame to get in seemingly every area. Also, the Final Fantasy card game makes an appearance, and I'm even less inclined to play it here than I was in FF8.Overall it's hard not to recommend Evoland. I had fun playing it, but replay value isn't high. My completion percentage at the end of the game was 92.9% and I didn't feel compelled to go out and get the last 2 or 3 things I missed in random chests.			"

												Evoland explores the evolution of the Zelda and Final Fantasy games. The game starts out in Gameboy monochromatic and continues to 8-bit, 16-bit, PSX styled blocky 3D, and finally hi def 3D. The dungeons are explored in the same fashion of the old school Zelda games while the overworld aspect has random battles and leveling up. The entire game is filled with parodies pertaining to not only the genres but tropes in Zelda and Final Fantasy specificially. A great game that will only take 3-4 hours but will completely be worth it!			"

												A game that pays homage to many great rpgs from the past. As you go through the game it 'evolves' through the stages that rpgs went through. It often does this using parody which makes the game funny and enjoyable.The biggest problems for me were it being easy and too short. It'd be great if it took longer to progress through the 'eras' but it went through them too fast for me.It is a fun albeit short game and definitely worth playing. There isn't much replayability so it might be better to get in a sale/bundleThis is probably a game for rpg fans though. Without the unique part of the game it would be average at best and you probably need to be an rpg fan to appreciate it.			"

												Evoland is a journey through the first few generations of video games. Starting with simple black and white 8-bit graphics that resemble the earliest GameBoys, it slowly evolves into Nintendo 64 era features. Each time the player opens one of many treasure chests scattered across the worlds, new graphical, musical, or sound effects are ""unlocked."" In this way, the game slowly progresses through the history of action/adventure video games. Obviously inspired by classics like The Legend of Zelda, Final Fantasy, and Diablo, this game appeals to fans of those games, like myself. Highlights of the game include the unique evolution style, decent music (though sometimes overly repetitive), and a great homage to classic games. On the negative side, the game was a bit too long for me, but only because I searched for every secret room and hidden items. So, without the side-questing, I am sure the game would have been less of a drag. There was included as well in the game a side mini-game, called Double Twin. This was a basic card game twist of tic-tac-toe. Again, an interesting idea, but only good for a few plays, not for prolonged play-time. This also marks the first time that I have gained all the achievements for a game on Steam... No reward for that except a little self-pride...Review originally published on https://brockpattison.blogspot.com/ "

												[Overall rating 2/5]I must begin with saying that when I first heard about this game I couldn't wait to playit, but when I finally found out my bf bought it in a bundle, the only reason I actually played for the full 4 hours was because I spent 1 of them searching for more interesting content I were convinced must be there somewhere because of the good reviews. I didn't find it. The beginning is fun and it felt accomplishing earning new dimensions and mecanics, until you get the 3D graphics, after this point the gameplay grows more teadious for every new stage and the controls are imprecise. This was for me very frustrating. I continued playing only because I waited for it to be as fun as in the beginning  (the first 20 min) again.I found the the Final Fantasy battles charming and fun at first, but also this got old quickly because of the low variation of attacks, enemies and characters, and when you finally gain new attacks the character choise immideatly shrinks, and guess what more? You no longer have any relevant battles in this style of gaming to use them in. Not. Worth. It.The boss battles are unimaginative and boring, ESCPECIALLY the last one which I completed first after a hiatous of a few weeks because it was so teadious and the controls so bad that I couldn't bring myself to finish it. When I finally did, it was only because I wanted to give a fair review.Except for the first, Zelda-esque part of the game, the absolutly only part I enjoyed was the in game card game, which I also spent about 20 min with. If that was released as a android game I probably would buy it. Would I now buy Evoland at full price? No. As a homage or satire, it's perfectly fine, but maybe at the price of a few euro.			"

												I usually hate indie games because they're bad cash-ins without anything interesting and made without any real heart on the developer's end. They're shallow and incredibly not worth the bang for the buck.This time, I found something not awful. Honestly it's fun and interesting if short. A series of RPG tropes and technology through the years. Plenty of decent references but then there's all the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ ""look @ me i'm a 90s kid guys do you remember the 90s please guys remember the 90s with me"" moments with parts of the in-game text. Gameplay is based around what era of RPG you are in. There's an achievement every five steps, but they're either incredible miniscule or they actually affect the gameplay in certain areas. It's not pretentious, but there are some EHPIK MEEMAYS here n' there. One of the few Greenlight games with a not-terrible concept.			"

												If you are a child of the 80s and 90s and need a nostalgia trip stop reading now and buy this game. Everyone else? The gameplay is short. It has no replayability. It is not innovative except for the fact that it tells the story of the history of gaming and shows how the technology of gaming has progressed over the decades. So the question is, does it sound worth it to you?I recommend this game to anyone that wants to see the story of how we went from the years after the collapse in 1983 upt and (and including) Diablo 3. How the technology has progressed. And experience some of the type of gameplay that you saw in Zelda and Final Fantasy titles. But purely as a game? No, probably not worth it.			"

												For any fan of classic retro RPG games, ranging from Zelda: Link's Awakening through Seiken Densetsu and Final Fantasy up to Diablo, Evoland is worth checking out. The game starts out with a 4-bit Gameboy feel and slowly evolves as you play through unlocking different aspects of the genre. The sentence ""You got XYZ"" will become very familiar very quickly, and I say ""very quickly"" both because the game is short and evolves as a quick pace, which is one of my gripes. While the trip down nostalgia lane is very welcome, some of the game feel is progressed very rapidly (from one screen to another I had changed to 8-bit colour, then bumped almost immediately up to 16-bit). The other issue with the game is that later on, once you have unlocked the turn based battle, XP, and a second character, the pace gets very tiresome. XP is awarded, but levelling up is pointless toward the end of the game since the final boss battle gives you a limited 12 HP hit counter anyway, GP awarded is useful to buy only a handful of items such as Potions which I never used because my secondary character has infinite MP and heal. At that point, random encounters become a time filler with no real reward, and just become a tedious chore to get out of the way.If taken as a stroll through RPG history, as more of a story or interactive showcase than a game, it works, and I found it enjoyable on the whole.

												It's more for nostalgia than gameplay, but it's fun to play too. I'm playing through it for the 3rd time. I think it's well worth the money, but if you're unsure then just wait for a sale. I would like to see a version of this idea on a large scale. Still start from the beginning, but move on even further in gaming history. It could focus on the gamplay that people are yearning for.

												There's this game called Evoland!  It parodies the conventions of JRPGs by taking us through a spin from the 8-bit era until you reach modern times and gameplay and graphics.  But it hasn't evolved debugging, so the first dungeon phases you and you can walk through walls but can't interact with the dungeon, therefore can't complete it.  I have completed all the game I can, therefore I declare myself the winner of Evoland!  1/10 - Bugged out in half hour.  Can not proceed.			"

												For being a ludum dare game, this is amazing. And it is a very novel and original concept. However, there is no getting away from that the game is frustrating to play. I didn't realize it was a jamgame until the credits rolled, (i just found it in my library somehow) so I was very dissapointed at the lack of a satisfying story as I was waiting for a twist that never appeared while gritting my teeth at weird hitboxes/feel/enemies/bugs. It's understanable but that is that. If you want to try something novel and unique, go for it. if you are looking for a game with solid gameplay and narrative, this is not it.			"

												The game has the same initial flow as DLC Quest, but with no in game currency for purchases. Slowly you evolve (get it Evoland?) from what appears to be a dotmatrix gameboy game into a decent 3D RPG. All of the elements are unlocked individually, and the game makes it very rewarding to progress or evolve your gameplay.			"

It walks you through game development from where games started to where they are now(well maybe not the beginning since it didn't have text based gameplay). It was a delight to find new chests that held new game upgrades, all the while feeling like I was playing something like Final Final fantasy or breath of fire. My only complaint is that it was to short.			"

												[Overall rating 2/5]I must begin with saying that when I first heard about this game I couldn't wait to playit, but when I finally found out my bf bought it in a bundle, the only reason I actually played for the full 4 hours was because I spent 1 of them searching for more interesting content I were convinced must be there somewhere because of the good reviews. I didn't find it. The beginning is fun and it felt accomplishing earning new dimensions and mecanics, until you get the 3D graphics, after this point the gameplay grows more teadious for every new stage and the controls are imprecise. This was for me very frustrating. I continued playing only because I waited for it to be as fun as in the beginning  (the first 20 min) again.I found the the Final Fantasy battles charming and fun at first, but also this got old quickly because of the low variation of attacks, enemies and characters, and when you finally gain new attacks the character choise immideatly shrinks, and guess what more? You no longer have any relevant battles in this style of gaming to use them in. Not. Worth. It.The boss battles are unimaginative and boring, ESCPECIALLY the last one which I completed first after a hiatous of a few weeks because it was so teadious and the controls so bad that I couldn't bring myself to finish it. When I finally did, it was only because I wanted to give a fair review.Except for the first, Zelda-esque part of the game, the absolutly only part I enjoyed was the in game card game, which I also spent about 20 min with. If that was released as a android game I probably would buy it. Would I now buy Evoland at full price? No. As a homage or satire, it's perfectly fine, but maybe at the price of a few euro.			"

												Evoland is a great journey through the evolution of game history.Its graphic style changes with the progress from a retro pixel look to 3D graphics.Its filled with little references to other games like The Legend of Zelda & Final Fantasy (VII).The main concerne about this game is the little play time it's got. In about 4 hours you can play it till end, and afterwards there aren't many thing you can do anymore, except if you like to hunt the steam achievements ;)Overall a game with a very cool idea which was nice implemented into the game, but I'ld recommend you to wait till it's on sale the next time, because of the short fun factor..The sequel is already out, and I'm looking forward to play it! :)7/10			"

												As others have said, this is NOT a game.  It's just an interactive story that forces you to relive a bunch of game-mechanics tropes that may or may not have been fun in the first place -- and certainly aren't all that interesting now.You progress through the stages with minimal effort or thought, watching each stage of gaming history unfold, failing to laugh at the jokes that arenl't terribly funny, and wishing Evoland had half the plot of any one of the games referenced by it.But sadly, no.  No game, minimal story, maximal boredom.  I've gotten far more nostalgia out of a conversation with friends than from this waste of money.			"

If you're the type of person that played few styles of old school rpg games and enjoyed it, i would definitely recommand this game if you're interested in a game that can be many styles at the same time. It sometimes look like diablo, link to the past, old FF... Edit : There seems to be a problem with using your inventory tho... I can't use it anywhere except in battle. It makes the game kinda difficult sometimes but it's manageable. Con : -Kinda short. I recommend to get this game on sale if you do.			"

If you're a newer gamer, the parts that are charming to some may be less so to you.. there is a fair bit of grinding, random monster encounters, and backtracking which we've mostly gotten rid of in current games.Overall, for $2, it was well worth the time spent playing it.

												I only found out about this game in the past week or so, and so after a bit of rummaging around, i gave it a go. Best idea i've had for a while now.This game is a very short, very sweet little homage to games such as Final Fantasy and Zelda, and it does a capital job. The game starts with you only allowed to go right in a 2d line with no music, no sound, no anything. But through getting various things in chests (the left key, sound effects, a storyline, etc) you see in front of you, how the RPG and Adventure genres have evolved over the years, hence the name. It's got it all- your hero-looking person, turn-based battling, life gauges, random encounters (lord help) and loads of pointless collectible stars. Eventually, you even get a bit of a Diablo segment, except it pokes fun at huge aspects of it- an inventory's worth of gear that all does squat, (e.g 'Turns you into a dragon. 12 months cooldown.') to the lag-inducing masses of enemies, all of which apart from the wizards are decimated by mere button-mashing.This game also has an outstanding soundtrack. It is just beautiful. From the catchy tune of the battle theme, to the emotional tune of when  Zephyros kills Kaeris  to the final boss theme, which is one of the most incredible fight themes i have heard to date.I have one major problem with this game, though, and it's that the game is really short. I've played the game once through and it took about two hours. Still, the sequel may have a longer playtime and much more fleshed-out story, but it still is one of the most charming indies i've played. In this case, size isn't everything.			"

The turn based combat so far is dissapointing only a attack and heal no mp bar only hp in  the turn basedd i am level ten with only the basic attack for the main character and a heal and ice spell for the mage. But another dissapointing thing is the auto level up incease attack defence etc. Story is pretty much non existent. The zelda style combat is a sword with a combo a bomb and a bow.			"

The quality of the experience varies a lot though:- They actually included annoying elements from the games they're parodying, such as no dungeon minimap, way too many random encounters and a stupidly hard boss battle.- Controls are bad, directional pad not responding well using an Xbox360 pad- 3d animations are bad- All gameplay elements are hastily implemented and are worse than what they imitate... it can only be pardoned if you're here for the joke, but if you expect a serious RPG expect disappointment.- The humor is so-soOverall I kind of enjoyed it, but I got annoyed several times at the game and was about to quit just before they brought in a game-changing element. At least it's short, so it shouldn't overstay its welcome too much.Oh yeah, and if you're into that you can backtrack once you're almost at the final boss to collect stars (useless) and cards (to play a minigame). I'll pass, but I appreciate that they put in the effort for those who like that.			"

												A very entertaining idea for a game. Going through the ""evolution"" of games from nice old 8-bit to some 3D graphics (and across multiple genres of gameplay) was really fun to me.The game can become a little boring for a while because it gets a little grindy, but old-school RPGs are indeed that way, so I guess you cannot really fault them for keeping to the source material.Story-wise, the game is a cliche and not that interesting other than to giggle at various events. Graphics-wise, I really enjoyed the transformations and did not care whether I was seeing the best graphics ever (particularly the 3D RPG graphics). Music-wise, the game has interesting melodies along your journey. And gameplay-wise, it fits the various genres that it goes through.All in all, a pretty interesting game to spend your time on.			"

												For being a ludum dare game, this is amazing. And it is a very novel and original concept. However, there is no getting away from that the game is frustrating to play. I didn't realize it was a jamgame until the credits rolled, (i just found it in my library somehow) so I was very dissapointed at the lack of a satisfying story as I was waiting for a twist that never appeared while gritting my teeth at weird hitboxes/feel/enemies/bugs. It's understanable but that is that. If you want to try something novel and unique, go for it. if you are looking for a game with solid gameplay and narrative, this is not it.			"

												You won't want to pay full price for Evoland, but if you can get it during a sale or within a bundle, I say go for it. It's enjoyable, but shallow. Nostalgia can only take you so far, but I still recommend this game ONLY IF it's on sale.P.S. I'm not sure why, but Steam says I've only played this game for 5 minutes. In reality, I've played it 4 different times for the span of around 5 hours.			"

												[7/10] - A charming little game that doesn't take itself too seriously. It's a fun ride, and has some really great moments and a nice soundtrack as well. it's pretty obvious the devs had thing for nostalgia, and aren't afraid to make fun of other games, but it definitely adds to the appeal. A relatively short game, but very entertaining while it lasted. There are a couple of challenging parts, but nothing a good rts/rpg player can't tackle. Overall I had a good time with this title, and would recommend it for it's unique charm and puzzle elements for anyone who wants something quick, fun, and witty.			"

												EvoLand. I thought to myself when first seeing the games title that it was going to be possibly a very GOOD Adventure/ RPGish type of game. But i then found out when Playing that it wasn't all it was cut out to making itself. Literally the way the entire game goes is you start off an a Gameboy world and collect chests that can either enchance the graphics or add other features such as taller grass housing developments and more retro type music. The game controls for the keyboard and mouse IMO are a little bit off imo. Other than that though the game its self is just... Kinda boring nothing really blows your mind, No really amazing special effects and they only go to about the amount of FFVII's graphic style. Which also your companion for the game sucks I mean really sucks shes only good for healing dont EVER USE HER TO ATTACK you'll regret it. Literally if you like only 2 Hit Damage On a Monster go ahead keep doing it. The company even resorts to having an exact replica of a statue of BOWSER from Mario in the game. Um how did they sneak that in and Nintendo didnt notice it? Seriously Nintendo needs to know about this PRONTO! I honestly had more higher hopes for this game as it was suppose to take like a Zelda and FinalFantasy game instead though the very end of the game is gonna leave you thinking ""Wow I spent 3 almost 4 hours on a game and beat it with no problem"". And thats it its very short, no special endings, and just pretty bland. If you buy this game get it when its on sale at like $5 or lower. Otherwise if you see this for higher than $9 dont get it. It will leave a little bad taste in your mouth. 5/10			"

												Wow.  This left me smiling and laughing throughout the entire game.  The premise is simple -- starting from simple right-only movement, and progress through RPG history (circa ~2000's).  There's so much overlapping and nuanced inclusion of so many RPG defining moments in this game that it left me thinking about those old RPG's as I played through this game.Nostalgia is one hell of a drug; and this game oozes it.For most RPG players, this game is a trigger mechanism to remember your favorite moments of RPG history, from many, many games.If you've played through Final Fantasy, Zelda, Ultima, Dragon's Quest, Secret of Mana, Diablo... you must play this game.If you haven't, you really need to play through all of those series to enjoy this game.5/5			"

												A great concept but overall a lackluster game. While the idea of evolving a games gameplay, graphics, etc when you pick up specific items set on a linear path is exciting, it only lasts a short time and some of the evolutions only happen once. The gameplay is super easy and the game itself is rather short. It's a fantastic experience but is short-lived. If you have any interest in this game, get it while it's on sale.			"

												This was a lot of fun! I bought it for $3 during the steam sale. Having played it, it was worth every penny. To review in one sentence: Evoland is short and sweet.It's basically a trip down 90's RPG memory lane. In the game you get upgrades. Each upgrade improves the game. For instance, there's the '256 color' upgrade, the '3d' upgrade, and even an ""HD Texture pack"" upgrade. I won't spoil any more, but there are some clever ways the game gives you to make itself more fun.As for the gameplay, it's changing so often that once you get the reference and appreciate it's implementation, it's on to the next innovation. This is not a bad thing.Lastly, there is a minor technical issue. In order to play the game with a gamepad (highly recommended) you have to set the executable and one other file to run in compatibility mode with windows 7 and run as administrator. This will hose your hours played in steam.If you're at least 25 years old, there be good gaming here. "

												The concept looked quite nice on the trailer : an RPG that evolves from the first  zelda to the state of the art as you play.  But the evolution are way too fast, after an hour of game or so you'll have reached the  last one. You would have expected some crossover between evolution, that would led to interesting situation, but no. So after achieving the last evolution, you are stuck in a very mediocre action RPG. Too bad, once again, the concept is appealing, but I would advise to save your bucks.			"

They're shallow and incredibly not worth the bang for the buck.This time, I found something not awful. Honestly it's fun and interesting if short. A series of RPG tropes and technology through the years. Plenty of decent references but then there's all the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ ""look @ me i'm a 90s kid guys do you remember the 90s please guys remember the 90s with me"" moments with parts of the in-game text. Gameplay is based around what era of RPG you are in. There's an achievement every five steps, but they're either incredible miniscule or they actually affect the gameplay in certain areas. It's not pretentious, but there are some EHPIK MEEMAYS here n' there. One of the few Greenlight games with a not-terrible concept.			"

It is not innovative except for the fact that it tells the story of the history of gaming and shows how the technology of gaming has progressed over the decades. So the question is, does it sound worth it to you?I recommend this game to anyone that wants to see the story of how we went from the years after the collapse in 1983 upt and (and including) Diablo 3. How the technology has progressed. And experience some of the type of gameplay that you saw in Zelda and Final Fantasy titles. But purely as a game? No, probably not worth it.			"

												A short but sweet game. Quite nostalgic in many ways. You get to see the progression of games....basically from the original Legend of Zelda up past FF7. Some parts are pretty boring, like the overworld FF-style combat (blech). But mostly ir's decent,4 hours and done. And that was really taking my time with going back to look for most stuff. Good way to waste a few hours.			"

												nice little rpg reminescent of Zelda games and final fantasy. For a game that was developped in 30 hours for a Ludum Dare competition, it's impressive, mad props to the devs. 100% and every achievement in about 10 hours, well worth the price!last boss could have been thought out a bit better, it's not hard per say it's just kind of silly in its mechanic in my opinion...no spoilers you'll see what I mean.

												This game is a fairly simplistic. A homage mashup of Zelda and Final Fantasy. I was able to get to the final boss within 4 hours - that boss is challenging though. The joys of this game are found in the pleasantly humorous references and how the game evolves as you progress. Definitely fun if you enjoy those games and don't mind the drop in complexity. Worth it especially on sale.			"

												This was a lot of fun! I bought it for $3 during the steam sale. Having played it, it was worth every penny. To review in one sentence: Evoland is short and sweet.It's basically a trip down 90's RPG memory lane. In the game you get upgrades. Each upgrade improves the game. For instance, there's the '256 color' upgrade, the '3d' upgrade, and even an ""HD Texture pack"" upgrade. I won't spoil any more, but there are some clever ways the game gives you to make itself more fun.As for the gameplay, it's changing so often that once you get the reference and appreciate it's implementation, it's on to the next innovation. This is not a bad thing.Lastly, there is a minor technical issue. In order to play the game with a gamepad (highly recommended) you have to set the executable and one other file to run in compatibility mode with windows 7 and run as administrator. This will hose your hours played in steam.If you're at least 25 years old, there be good gaming here. "

												if your a fan of classic Zelda and Final Fantasy games, this game is made specificity for you.  a somewhat short game, Evoland mashes a few of the most popular RPG game styles together into a fun little romp.  while the game itself isn’t particularly long or groundbreaking, it's quite a good bit of fun.  RPG staples litter this title, from turn based combat, to old school Zelda dungeon crawling, to that your the hero who has to save the world storyline.  Even time travel gets its two cents in.  if you love RPG's, this game feels almost like a love letter to you.  oh, and its got zombie goomba's in it.  so that’s fun.overall, it's an 8/10.  and for only $10, it's defiantly worth it if you just can't get enough RPG in your life.

												The concept looked quite nice on the trailer : an RPG that evolves from the first  zelda to the state of the art as you play.  But the evolution are way too fast, after an hour of game or so you'll have reached the  last one. You would have expected some crossover between evolution, that would led to interesting situation, but no. So after achieving the last evolution, you are stuck in a very mediocre action RPG. Too bad, once again, the concept is appealing, but I would advise to save your bucks.			"

I would have liked to see it say in 2D for longer and not evolve so fast in the beginning, and just all around longer. Hopefully they make a sequel that builds and expands on this.			"

If you pay attention to some subtle and not so subtle things you'll notice some tribute being paid to Mario games.  Aside from the constant pokemon looking battles that don't allow you to fully explore with out interupting you every 3 seconds, it's an awesome game.			"

												Evoland is a journey through the first few generations of video games. Starting with simple black and white 8-bit graphics that resemble the earliest GameBoys, it slowly evolves into Nintendo 64 era features. Each time the player opens one of many treasure chests scattered across the worlds, new graphical, musical, or sound effects are ""unlocked."" In this way, the game slowly progresses through the history of action/adventure video games. Obviously inspired by classics like The Legend of Zelda, Final Fantasy, and Diablo, this game appeals to fans of those games, like myself. Highlights of the game include the unique evolution style, decent music (though sometimes overly repetitive), and a great homage to classic games. On the negative side, the game was a bit too long for me, but only because I searched for every secret room and hidden items. So, without the side-questing, I am sure the game would have been less of a drag. There was included as well in the game a side mini-game, called Double Twin. This was a basic card game twist of tic-tac-toe. Again, an interesting idea, but only good for a few plays, not for prolonged play-time. This also marks the first time that I have gained all the achievements for a game on Steam... No reward for that except a little self-pride...Review originally published on https://brockpattison.blogspot.com/ "

												Evoland explores the evolution of the Zelda and Final Fantasy games. The game starts out in Gameboy monochromatic and continues to 8-bit, 16-bit, PSX styled blocky 3D, and finally hi def 3D. The dungeons are explored in the same fashion of the old school Zelda games while the overworld aspect has random battles and leveling up. The entire game is filled with parodies pertaining to not only the genres but tropes in Zelda and Final Fantasy specificially. A great game that will only take 3-4 hours but will completely be worth it!			"

												I have to say the Metacritic score of this game was right. It looked great at the LD48 compo, but sadly it fell short for a full-fledged game. The story is so bland and there's no original idea other than this ""evolution"" thing. Probably the technology of this game is pretty good, but at the same time it exemplifies so well that the technology itself doesn't make a great game.			"

												A game that pays homage to many great rpgs from the past. As you go through the game it 'evolves' through the stages that rpgs went through. It often does this using parody which makes the game funny and enjoyable.The biggest problems for me were it being easy and too short. It'd be great if it took longer to progress through the 'eras' but it went through them too fast for me.It is a fun albeit short game and definitely worth playing. There isn't much replayability so it might be better to get in a sale/bundleThis is probably a game for rpg fans though. Without the unique part of the game it would be average at best and you probably need to be an rpg fan to appreciate it.			"

												A wonderfully inventive game, Evoland features a mixture of game play between the Legend of Zelda series and the Final Fantasy series. You start out with only black and white, 2 dimensional game play. You unlock colors, graphics, 3 dimensional gameplay, sound and sound quality, gameplay features and basically everything to do with a game by finding the different and many chest found throughout the game. It also features (true to the Final Fantasy spirit), a mini card game within the game. You can find or buy cards to play it. A fun plot (once you unlock the storyline as you do everything else including basic movement), it keeps you entertained for hours. You also unlock the ability of save points found scattered throughout the land, health (which when in Zelda mode shows as hearts in the upper right hand side of the screen). When in Final Fantasy open world exploration mode with radom encounters, battles play out as made famous by the Final Fantasy series up to Final Fantasy IX. More unlocks and fun than you can imagine, the gameplay is highly addictive and keeps you smiling. Dungeons also unfold where you must move blocks onto pressure pads to open gates or put you in trap rooms where you must defeat all the monsters within to escape, and mazes unfold as well. I could not for the price range recommend many games as highly as this one for absolutely any gamers collection. On a scale of 1 to 10, 1 being horrible and 10 being the most awesome game of all time, this one would rank as a solid 9. Well worth the investment.			"

												I started playing this game giggling like a little school girl. This is such an amazing concept that I can't believe this is the first weve seen of it (to my knowledge). Which is why it pains me that this game just doesn't 'evolve'... hehe.... into what it could be.The first 45 minutes-hour have a lot of promise as you unlock new technologies and cycle through game modes... but after that it trickles out new unlocks and doesn't really go anywhere. It turns into a 'Bah-bies first Zelda clone'. I have got to be frank.... I don't like Zelda (Early titles). The gameplay just didn't do anything for me. I much prefer the strategy of turn based combat. Speaking of....There is 0 depth to this game. From the combat to the story. During turn based sections you have yourself and a girl character. The girl is the mage who only starts with heal and you a basic attack. Then, by about half way through the game she finally gets 1 magic attack that does the same damage as your sword attack and you get nothing. Thats it. Even on the Zelda side of things nothing evolves past the early Zelda titles. You get a sword, bombs, and arrows.The story is throw away.The humour seems to just consist of 'Epic Movie' type refrences. You are a lucky lucky person if you dont know what that means....Nothing is really done with the concept of evolving through the generations. I would love to see a larger scaled game maybe by some tested devs who could take this concept and just go nuts. I freaking love this idea and I hope to see it around again. Kudos to the devs for thinking of it but I really wish you would hahve developed it more.Oh, also the game is only 3 hours long. I just kind of gave up half way in because I can't play old school style Zelda without a controller and I just couldn't get controller support to work. : /Update: I noticed a You-tuber I like had a full playthrough of this so I decided to watch the rest of it to see what I missed. I have to say Im happy I gave up when I did.The game turns into a diablo like (using that phrase lightly) game after I quit. Again like with the rest of the game there is no depth to it. You pick up loot that doesnt even effect anything and you are still using the combat mechanics from zelda. You get gold drops but gold is useless and cant actually be used for anything.The story is laughable. Its so crap. I can't imagine what the devs thought when they cobbled that mess together. Maybe it was the day before release and all the writers has hangovers so they got the janitor who played an rpg once like 20 years ago to finish the story for them.You get a map finally during this section but nothing else happens. The boss fight here is just as lame and uninspiered as the rest.Then you fight the final boss and finally get a second attack for the main hero which is on a 4 minute cooldown and is only used once. The boss is in 2 sections. You get beat for the first fight and your compainion dies *spoilers but who cares*. You get an airship to get to where the boss moved to because reasons, and fight in a zelda type boss fight. Then credits roll. Thats it.I can't understand how they were able to think of such an awesome concept for the game but didnt have a single good idea other than that. I pray I see this idea take shape from devs who are actually talented.			"

If that's true of you then I doubt you'll regret buying it, and you can probably expect to want to talk to others about it. I doubt anyone would regret paying $5 or less for this, though there may be a small number of gamers who would feel the story was too short to justify spending more. It's likely to wake the little kid in you, and will probably make you want to play through your library of ""classics"", but I doubt you'll want to play through the game a second time just to find all the ""Hidden Stars"". But maybe that's just because I dislike collection quests, and so completely ignored that aspect of the game (which you can easily do!).			"

												After spending hours trying to find the upgrade that made the gameplay fun and interesting, and combing through a walkthrough, I was dismayed to learn no such upgrade exists.I gave this game way too many opportunities to redeem itself, and it never did. I saw it in the store, and it looked nice. A friend got it and played it. Told me it wasn't worth my money. So that wouls have been the end of it, but I think I ended up with a copy froma  Humble Bundle or something. It sat in my library for about a year, until, bored one day, I fired it up.It starts out in the standard manner for this sort of game - you start with one direction of movement, then unlock the others. Cheesy, but the earliest games were reestricted to lateral movement and the like, so I was game. Up until you pick up the transition from grayscale to 16 colors. The grayscale setup was a bit of a stretch, since graphics never really worked that way for early games (not counting  handhelds), but I was being lenient. 16 color made it clear that the designers had never really looked at the graphics for anyhting earlier than Playstation era. Even if the system could handle so many colors on a single sprite, it means the main character permanently occupies half the available pallette of the world. (Fun fact: Mega Man had to be composed of two sprites to support his whopping total of 5 colors).Clearly, the developers were aware of how much they messed up 16 colors, because they jumped to 256 colors almost immediately. As noted above, though, they never did the same for the gameplay. In fact, they actively made the gameplay worse than the old games they claim to emulate - as part of a cheap gimmick, you get an upgrade that unbinds you from the grid. While that should be a good thing, it means you're out of alignment with enemies more often than not. And 95% of the game still uses a grid, so you're not getting much benefit from it. Up to and including gaps between trees like the cute barrier they put in place for you to bypass - nearly indistinguishable from the normal grid barriers, and exceedingly rare.Problems like this pop up so often that it becomes clear that the immediate jump from 16 colors to 256 wasn't any sort of self-awareness; they want the game to be ""pretty"" as fast as possible. They take way too long to add a health bar to progress beyong 1 hit = death. They add a ""Loading"" screen that costs 5000 GP to get rid of - from random fights that drop 100-200 GP each (not that there's much worthwhile to spend your money on, but it's still a stupid aproach).Things start to get some hope when they drop you into a Diablo-style section, but that's msotly padding and an excuse for cheap jokes - back to the status quo after that. With one exception - you get a combo chain ability (because we all know that Diablo invented the combo chain).All in all, it starts off with some promise, but the hope for it to get better gradually fades. On top of that, 2/3 of the way through the game, you've unlocked pretty much eveything, and from that point on, it may as well be called ""Spinal Clam SE: Heaven"". Except that still gives too much credit to the story writing.			"

												It's a cute little game with a very cool concept -- start with a bare-bones, barely even playable adventure game circa the early 80s, and gradually unlock upgrades to the game's engine until you're playing essentially a reasonably polished PS1 RPG.  There have been Flash games such as Upgrade Complete that have toyed with this concept but Evoland's the first one I know of to apply it to the action-adventure/RPG genre.Sadly, there are problems on the other side of the coin; the first area is charming and innovative, and a bit past that is still fairly amusing, but it quickly becomes apparent that with a tiny handful of exceptions, the game spent the majority of its gimmick early on.  Large swaths of the (admittedly tiny) game after that starting area are simply fairly boring treks through generic locales, swapping back and forth between ultra-simple Zelda and ultra-simple Final Fantasy segments back and forth, with Ys-Lite style bosses and one singular area that offers a fun genre shift into hack-n'-slash.  There are also various smaller annoyances to add on, such as... - The random battle rate for the RPG sections and especially the overworld is way, way, WAY too high; - A few enemies (especially the wasps) dodge attacks too often, and even spells!  I see no reason why missing should have even been a mechanic in this game at all; - There's no way to use your healing magic or items outside of battle; - The healing fountains/inns are ridiculously few, far between and quite out of the way, even for such a small game; - As far as I can tell, there's absolutely NO USE to the collectible 'stars' you find throughout the game, except a pointless achievement; - LIkewise, the collectible cards only serve to let you play an extremely bare-bones ripoff of Triple Triad from Final Fantasy 8, with no rewards earned for winning even the highest difficulty except, again, a pointless achievement; - In said card game you can't organize decks and it picks at random from all cards you own, meaning it would be most efficient to only collect 5 of the strongest cards and no others, though the minigame's easy enough that it doesn't really matter; - There's really no story and not even much humor or charm in the dialogue -- it's VERY cut and dry.The game probably would have also benefitted greatly by either being even shorter and to-the-point but filled with as much love and care as the first area was throughout, or with a bit more length and substance to more fully flesh out the slightly grander ideas presented.Still, though, it's small and harmless enough to be worth checking out, and when it does do well it's really great.  Could have been better, but definitely recommended for the small time commitment and asking price considering how cool the ideas presented are.			"

It turns into a 'Bah-bies first Zelda clone'. I have got to be frank.... I don't like Zelda (Early titles). The gameplay just didn't do anything for me. I much prefer the strategy of turn based combat. Speaking of....There is 0 depth to this game. From the combat to the story. During turn based sections you have yourself and a girl character. The girl is the mage who only starts with heal and you a basic attack. Then, by about half way through the game she finally gets 1 magic attack that does the same damage as your sword attack and you get nothing. Thats it. Even on the Zelda side of things nothing evolves past the early Zelda titles. You get a sword, bombs, and arrows.The story is throw away.The humour seems to just consist of 'Epic Movie' type refrences. You are a lucky lucky person if you dont know what that means....Nothing is really done with the concept of evolving through the generations. I would love to see a larger scaled game maybe by some tested devs who could take this concept and just go nuts. I freaking love this idea and I hope to see it around again. Kudos to the devs for thinking of it but I really wish you would hahve developed it more.Oh, also the game is only 3 hours long. I just kind of gave up half way in because I can't play old school style Zelda without a controller and I just couldn't get controller support to work. : /Update: I noticed a You-tuber I like had a full playthrough of this so I decided to watch the rest of it to see what I missed. I have to say Im happy I gave up when I did.The game turns into a diablo like (using that phrase lightly) game after I quit. Again like with the rest of the game there is no depth to it. You pick up loot that doesnt even effect anything and you are still using the combat mechanics from zelda. You get gold drops but gold is useless and cant actually be used for anything.The story is laughable. Its so crap. I can't imagine what the devs thought when they cobbled that mess together. Maybe it was the day before release and all the writers has hangovers so they got the janitor who played an rpg once like 20 years ago to finish the story for them.You get a map finally during this section but nothing else happens. The boss fight here is just as lame and uninspiered as the rest.Then you fight the final boss and finally get a second attack for the main hero which is on a 4 minute cooldown and is only used once. The boss is in 2 sections. You get beat for the first fight and your compainion dies *spoilers but who cares*. You get an airship to get to where the boss moved to because reasons, and fight in a zelda type boss fight. Then credits roll. Thats it.I can't understand how they were able to think of such an awesome concept for the game but didnt have a single good idea other than that. I pray I see this idea take shape from devs who are actually talented.			"

												After spending hours trying to find the upgrade that made the gameplay fun and interesting, and combing through a walkthrough, I was dismayed to learn no such upgrade exists.I gave this game way too many opportunities to redeem itself, and it never did. I saw it in the store, and it looked nice. A friend got it and played it. Told me it wasn't worth my money. So that wouls have been the end of it, but I think I ended up with a copy froma  Humble Bundle or something. It sat in my library for about a year, until, bored one day, I fired it up.It starts out in the standard manner for this sort of game - you start with one direction of movement, then unlock the others. Cheesy, but the earliest games were reestricted to lateral movement and the like, so I was game. Up until you pick up the transition from grayscale to 16 colors. The grayscale setup was a bit of a stretch, since graphics never really worked that way for early games (not counting  handhelds), but I was being lenient. 16 color made it clear that the designers had never really looked at the graphics for anyhting earlier than Playstation era. Even if the system could handle so many colors on a single sprite, it means the main character permanently occupies half the available pallette of the world. (Fun fact: Mega Man had to be composed of two sprites to support his whopping total of 5 colors).Clearly, the developers were aware of how much they messed up 16 colors, because they jumped to 256 colors almost immediately. As noted above, though, they never did the same for the gameplay. In fact, they actively made the gameplay worse than the old games they claim to emulate - as part of a cheap gimmick, you get an upgrade that unbinds you from the grid. While that should be a good thing, it means you're out of alignment with enemies more often than not. And 95% of the game still uses a grid, so you're not getting much benefit from it. Up to and including gaps between trees like the cute barrier they put in place for you to bypass - nearly indistinguishable from the normal grid barriers, and exceedingly rare.Problems like this pop up so often that it becomes clear that the immediate jump from 16 colors to 256 wasn't any sort of self-awareness; they want the game to be ""pretty"" as fast as possible. They take way too long to add a health bar to progress beyong 1 hit = death. They add a ""Loading"" screen that costs 5000 GP to get rid of - from random fights that drop 100-200 GP each (not that there's much worthwhile to spend your money on, but it's still a stupid aproach).Things start to get some hope when they drop you into a Diablo-style section, but that's msotly padding and an excuse for cheap jokes - back to the status quo after that. With one exception - you get a combo chain ability (because we all know that Diablo invented the combo chain).All in all, it starts off with some promise, but the hope for it to get better gradually fades. On top of that, 2/3 of the way through the game, you've unlocked pretty much eveything, and from that point on, it may as well be called ""Spinal Clam SE: Heaven"". Except that still gives too much credit to the story writing.			"

												Summary: A game you'll likely play once, but enjoy every nostalgic minute of the roughly 3 hour storyline. Hours of fun: 3 hoursSuggested Retail Value: $5Graphics: 6/10Voice-acting: 6/10Music/SFX: 6/10Uniqueness: 6/10First Play-through Experience: 7/10Replay Value: 5/10Evoland is a fun game for anyone who has a love for old-school RPGs, an interest in how RPGs have changed over the last couple of decades, or just want to experience an adventure that spans several generations of RPG all in one sitting. If that's true of you then I doubt you'll regret buying it, and you can probably expect to want to talk to others about it. I doubt anyone would regret paying $5 or less for this, though there may be a small number of gamers who would feel the story was too short to justify spending more. It's likely to wake the little kid in you, and will probably make you want to play through your library of ""classics"", but I doubt you'll want to play through the game a second time just to find all the ""Hidden Stars"". But maybe that's just because I dislike collection quests, and so completely ignored that aspect of the game (which you can easily do!).			"

												A short but sweet game. Quite nostalgic in many ways. You get to see the progression of games....basically from the original Legend of Zelda up past FF7. Some parts are pretty boring, like the overworld FF-style combat (blech). But mostly ir's decent,4 hours and done. And that was really taking my time with going back to look for most stuff.

												This game is a fairly simplistic. A homage mashup of Zelda and Final Fantasy. I was able to get to the final boss within 4 hours - that boss is challenging though. The joys of this game are found in the pleasantly humorous references and how the game evolves as you progress. Definitely fun if you enjoy those games and don't mind the drop in complexity.

												I played this game on a whim while looking through my friends games in the family share. This game brought back so many fond memories of playing Diablo, Final Fantasy VII-IX, and even Shining force. If you grew up with older games then you owe it to yourself to give this game a try, if not then see what you missed. The plot of the game was 90% parodies of older games but you shouldn't come to this game looking for plot, that's not what this game is about, it's about nostalgia and it nails its goal. I also loved all the snarky jokes they threw in during each evolution. I fully plan to buy Evoland II and I hope they make a III. Enjoy a slice of history (and if you don't want Final Fantasy VII ruined play it first, though at this point who hasn't played it or had it ruined?)			"

Fun, creative game with some serious difficulty curvesEvoland is a creative game that does face a few problems. I loved the idea, starting from 8-bit, and transitioning all the way into 3D graphics. It is not limited to the graphics, and evolves as it goes along, fitting the evolutions into the story. It throws in turn-based battles, save points, and nearly any general advancement along the way. However, while all of this is cool, it has a few problems.It's too short; it only has about four hours of gameplay not counting:The difficulty curves. Some areas are waaay too hard, and can seriously hinder progress.Leveling up only counts toward turn based battles. The hard areas are a great example of this. Plus, you don't level up in these areas.Many evolutions don't stay around for very long, or aren't used very much.Overall: 7/10, still recommended to try			"

												Evoland was a fun little diversion from all of the mainstream games that I've been playing lately. It provided me with some fond memories of old school games, though it came with a few flaws. Definitely worth your time, but don't expect to fill your weekend with just this game.Good:The action turn-based combat system was very solid.There was plenty of collectables that were hidden decently well.The story did not drag on as some older adventure/RPG games tend to do.The later half of the game looks absolutely amazing.There was a fun little card based minigame that directly tied into the collectables.The Diablo inspired section was very fun.Seeing the game portrayed in all the different art styles was very fun.Bad:The Zelda inspired combat sections have wildly fluxuating difficulty.The adventure segments lacked any real puzzles.The party size was very limited compared to most RPGs.The game felt a little short, especially for an adventure/RPG game. I beat it in approximately five hours and while I didn't obtain all collectables, I still managed to beat the game with 90% completion.The card minigame's harder difficulties relied a little too heavily on RNG rather than strategy. Despite this, I still managed to beat all dificulties without collecting all the cards.The end of the game didn't really have a solid payoff, relying more on presumed emotional ties rather than a solid conclusion.

												Take a trip down nostalgia lane as this game presents to you the evolution of RPGs since the days of 'black & white' to the infamous turn-based battle system and beyond. It's a game that pays homage to how RPGs have evolved and even pokes fun at the various tropes surrounding this particular genre of gaming.As a proper game, this title falls short (literally). It's only about 4 hours long if you bother exploring and playing around a little. However, that being said, this game was made to solely sell on its ability to humour the genre and to suffocate players with its nostalgia. You'll find references to Final Fantasy, Zelda and more.Taking into account on how this game was made to sell, I can only recommend it based quite heavily on its gameplay, which for the most part, is relatively fun. I'm not one to enjoy turn-based battles but if you like that, expect quite a bit of it. Outside of that though, the real-time combat is actually quite fun albeit simple. But, as the saying goes, it's good and simple.Ultimately, it's a short but sweet experience. This game is targeted solely towards RPG gamers and if you are not one of them, I would suggest you skip it. I do not recommend picking this up at full price but when it drops down to below half, I don't see why you shouldn't spend on it.			"

You might be lucky enough not to run into it, but I can't recommend this game if you don't want to risk having your time completely wasted.(If you want details of the glitch, check the Steam discussions for the game and look for threads about ""lost ariship"", ""airship bug"", ""edel vale bug"", etc. There are several on the first page right now.)

It starts off like a cheap prototype running on some cheap MCU, than it turns into Zelda, Legend of Mana, Final Fantasy and Diablo. The game is at it's strongest when it gradually introduces elements like textures or saving we take for granted nowadays.			"

												It was an interesting experience while playing it, but I feel it was to short and only tried to use the generic mechanics other rpgs have used. With this there is only the story to hold it up, but I can't remember if there was even a story to it. Perhaps if the story was better or the gameplay was more than just interesting, I would recommend it.			"

												I played this game on a whim while looking through my friends games in the family share. This game brought back so many fond memories of playing Diablo, Final Fantasy VII-IX, and even Shining force. If you grew up with older games then you owe it to yourself to give this game a try, if not then see what you missed. The plot of the game was 90% parodies of older games but you shouldn't come to this game looking for plot, that's not what this game is about, it's about nostalgia and it nails its goal. I also loved all the snarky jokes they threw in during each evolution. I fully plan to buy Evoland II and I hope they make a III. Enjoy a slice of history (and if you don't want Final Fantasy VII ruined play it first, though at this point who hasn't played it or had it ruined?)			"

												It's hard to give a review to this game since you can't really call it ""game"".It's more like a travel from your childhoof games to actual times. The gameplay is a mix between zelda and final fantasy games, travelling from 16bit era games to our times.. It's quite fun and short too, the idea is pretty original and the story has an ironical view over those kind of games. Buy it in bundles or on sale and you'll have some hours of fun.6,5/10			"

												[DID NOT FINISH]Now I got very close to finishing this, quite frankly, very short game but I never got round to it as I didn't care enough. This game starts off very nice but in the end becomes pretty boring and a bit of a chore. When it first starts there is so much changing that it keeps you engaged but eventually it ends up just being a poor cliché adventure game with poor graphics.7/15 - ""Start's great, end's very boring""			"

												The protagonist is called Clink, and he's shortly joined by a girl with magical powers called Kaeris, who has an uncle with an airship called Sid. And they find a legendary sword called Claud's Sword, which looks like a ♥♥♥♥ing Buster Sword... you see where this is going?A game strictly aimed to the ""US GAMERS AMIRITE"" crowd, heavily seasoned with cringey references to other games and the kind of overused memes that Reddit drove into the ground back in 2012, it forces you to unlock many basic features as you explore a generic JRPG map trying to figure out what exactly is the purpose with the game. In just the very first map of the game, you go through several graphical changes which don't exactly change the quality of the game. They don't teach you anything historically significant, they're just there to make you go ""wow, the EVOlution of videogames"".Sadly, the spritework even at its pre-3D apex was nothing to write home about, as everything looked flat and unispired, with no hints at having put any effort into some basic shading. Visually, the game shines once the 3D kicks in and textures become sharper and better defined.Unfortunately for Evoland, a game cannot be carried alone on graphical artstyle. And the game itself is pretty boring. You constantly switch between random encounters with an ATB permanently set to Wait, and a bad action RPG mode that feels stiff and overly simplistic.Had this game focused on fleshing out every mode and building upon it with each graphical iteration to make it an increasingly complex game, I'd recommend it wholeheartedly. I had honestly though that this is the direction the game was supposed to go in. But, as it stands, it feels like a final high school project by someone very talented but with little experience into what makes a game good besides aesthetics.If you MUST get it, I'd recommend getting it heavily discounted on sale, or wait for it to come up in a 1 dollar bundle making sure you direct all your money to charity.

												The trailer makes this game seem much more inspiring than it in actuality is: Although the retro, evolving playstyle is unique and at first nostalgic, it's fairly clear that the developers did not have sufficient resources at their disposal to finish gradually updating the graphics to present-day, and as such, about halfway through the game, the evolution prompty stops. This is besides the fact that the progression is painfully general, at some points changing almost nothing and at others skipping whole years of the industry's steps - I'm sorry, but the change from 2d to 3d did not happen overnight, as this game seems to depict.I fancy myself as being able to appreciate games that go to lengths to make a statement, but beyond establishing it, this game does not really go any further. The game lacks a substantial or original plot, has a fairly limited interface, is laughably short, gets repetitive quickly, and has absolutely no replay value.			"

												Perhaps Evoland 2 will be better but this game coasted off of kitchy video game references and very little substance.  The game has one or two zones that are actually interesting Zelda-like Puzzles, but abruptly shifts gears and the game ends.Good ideas and amusing gameplay.  Runs out of steam very quickly.			"

												Attractive concept. In execution, a paceless parade of goodies and upgrades followed by an aggravating, bland slog to the end of the thin plot that makes this very short game feel overlong.Maybe more frustrating, despite being a kind of homage to console gaming, despite advertising full controller support, despite running in Microsoft Windows, has no idea what my Microsoft Xbox One controller for Windows is and doesn't want to know. ""Gamepad not found."" No fix in the now three years since the game's release.			"

												This game is cute and quaint, which is alright I guess; but, the problem is this game is cute and quaint.Challenge element to the game is just hovering above 0.  Sure, there are little puzzles that take a little thinking, but this one won't wear you out and if you have the slightest bit of tenacity you can probably finish the game in less than 2hrs.  A lot of people will tell you that this is a great portrayal of RPG games from FF1 & old Zelda to FF9 & newer Zelda.... and it is, if you want the most general feel of those games.  The problem is that there is no real feeling of accomplishment in this game, due to the lack of challenge, lack of any clear story, and shortness of the game itself.   The final achievements to strive for, collecting all the items and money (""glis"" based off the FF series) don't seem worth the striving.  The null-challenge battles you'd have to go through to save up 50K glis would be more annoying than satisfying, plus there are NO ITEMS in the game to spend your money on.  The char's lvling up means nothing.  If you're looking for the Diablo-like play in the game, don't get your hopes up because the one little map that is supposed to be Diablo-esque provides as little as the rest of the game--after all, the equipment and gold serve no purpose... there's no character building anywhere in this game.  The one cool feature was the challenge element of going forward and backward in time to circumvent obstacles.     This game is more like a short film to annoy you and make you laugh than it is an actual game.  If you are judging this by some other perspective than a game, then maybe it's okay.  However, if I had access to a time machine, I most definitely would go back in time and not buy this game. "

												It's important to realise when playing this game that it isn't meant to be a true RPG - it's meant to be a pisstake of the RPG genre, wherein you have to unlock everything, right down to moving, saving and battling, and it does that absolutely brilliantly. I would reccomend this game to anyone who liked the old RPGs like Final Fantasy and the like - I for one found myself chuckling heartily at the little references here and there. A brilliant little stab at the RPG genre, Evoland is so deliberately generic that it's hilarious, and any retro game fan should pick it up for its nostalgic and its comedic value.			"

												A Zelda and Final Fantasy fan love letter.This title is pretty short and full of RPG in-jokes, and that's part of its charm of course, but the real accomplishment here is the standout blend of nearly every genre defining aspect of retro (and in some ways even modern) RPGs.Evoland starts in a very gameboy-like monochrome pixelated setting, and you start by unlocking the arrow keys for movement, and then the scrolling screens so you can move to different areas, and then enemies, and then a weapon to fight said enemies. Get a little further still and you'll unlock a color display! Wow color!The unlockable everything aspect sort of reminded me of Half Minute Hero, though thankfully Evoland doesn't have that title's frantic ""time is running out constantly hurry hurry hurry!"" methodology killing its fun factor.It's neat to look back on the progression and see how things evolve as you play, and it's a fairly good reminder really to the way games of old have matured over the decades.I'd say the two plain-as-day obvious biggest influences on Evoland are the early Zelda titles, and in particular, Final Fantasy 7. However there are a number of other small references here and there to others as well: Secret of Mana, Final Fantasy 4 and 6, Final Fantasy 8 just to name a few that I was easily able to recognize.The story, well there hardly is one, and again, see Zelda/FF7 for the majority of parallels, sometimes downright ripoffs honestly. Still the concept remains interesting throughout the relatively short campaign (it took me about 8 hours for 100% completion).The fact that you don't have to sink 100+ hours into it is actually welcome. It gets the point across and manages to be enjoyable without requiring a month's worth of your spare time.If you are a fan of older RPGs and indie titles you'll definitely find something to like here. Just having multiple battle systems and graphical presentations in a single game and having it work well together is reason enough to give it a try. Not to mention the trip down memory lane.			"

												I thoroughly enjoyed the experience offered up by Evoland.  It is basically a trip down memory lane, celebrating RPG's from as far back as the C64, up to the Wii U (Sorry, i don't count PS4/Xbox one, so far).  The story is about a young boy who quickly develops as the story progresses, finding the stereotypical sword, then the ability to 'Evolve' his skills.  In summary, he has to save a small village from the darkness, and as you can tell from my playtime it is a very short game.If you feel that its asking price is too high, get it on a hunble bundle.  For me, I'd say its just right.  The experience made me smile and remember when games were made by gamers with passion, not AAA corporations milking the proverbial cash cow that is first person shooters with a lick of paint and a few extra guns.

												This is a fun nostalgia trip. Lots of the game is obviously taken from Zelda and Final Fantasy games, but what's been taken is the good stuff. The game feels rewarding thanks to finding upgrades to the game quite often (upgrades come from better graphics, audio, and gameplay elements). The acheivements are challenging and add value to the gameplay. All in all, a good game.I will say, though, that the hit detection isn't perfect with some attacks and enemies, and the controls are a little clunky at times. Also, the other minor annoyance is the fact that once you get the zoom in animation for finding items, you open the chest slightly off from where the audio plays. The story isn't exactly original, but I don't think it was supposed to be. These are mostly nitpicks, though. Once you get used to the controls, the game is well worth playing.			"

												Evoland is basically every bad old RPG rolled up into one. Boring enemies, boring combat, excuse plot, character who dies who you just don’t care about at all (or indeed, care about any of the characters at all), ect.The game is meant to poke fun at old RPGs, including Final Fantasy, Dragon Quest, Zelda, Diablo, and others, but frankly, it falls flat. All of the “humor” in the game is basically the game pointing and saying “isn’t this dumb?” It is basically explaining the joke, except there is no joke, just a reference to an older game which isn’t very funny.The game seems to suggest that you’re going to gradually move through various eras of games, but by about a third of the way into the game, you’re already up to 3D graphics, and it doesn’t really go beyond that. The game feels almost as if it has to rush through to unlock all the earlier stuff and then get to 3D for some reason, even though, quite frankly, the 3D gameplay isn’t very good (but then, neither is the 2D gameplay).Ultimately, the game is meant to be funny, but isn’t, and is meant to be fun, and also isn’t. The gameplay is as tedious as any old, poorly designed game with very little content; the JRPG overworld encounters happen every five steps or so and are pointless and tedious, while the dungeon Zelda-type movement is very basic, containing very little variety of monsters, none of which are particularly interesting to fight. The game contains three bosses, two of which are pretty boring; one of them is basically “stand there and hit it until it dies”, and another is a standard “dodge the charge and hit them” boss. Only the final boss shows any signs of real gameplay, and even there, it was kind of tepid.There’s just nothing here for anyone. If you’re looking for humor, the game isn’t funny; if you’re looking for a game which is fun to play, this isn’t. It doesn’t even feel original, as literally everything in it is referential, meaning any “originality” it might have from the whole idea of evolving into the modern day of gameplay is basically dead on arrival, buried under a pile of old video game references.

												It's a really great concept. It's awesome to start the game in black and white and slowly unlock all the upgrades that came and went in RPGs. For the most part, it also has a great sense of humor. You'll LOL as you see it implement loading screens when it goes 3D and enjoy the many references to classics like Final Fantasy, Zelda and Dragon Quest. The Zelda segments, however, drag on WAY to long, if you ask me. With very few puzzles or deep mechanics, this game feels a good hour or two too long. Most dungeons are simply a walk and press attack romp and the turn based battles require no strategy at all. I'd wait till this puppy was on sale if I were you, but if you enjoyed the 8-bit and 16-bit RPG era as much as I did, you'll be glad you played this.PROS:Awesome ConceptNostalgia OverloadCons:Too Much FillerZero Replay Value			"

												When i first saw a picture of Evoland in Steam Store i was immediatly closing it cause it shows an 8bit green-grey, C64 style. Nothing against C64, i still have one, but i wont see that in 2013.Then i saw a little review accidently where i saw 3D grahics in it. My interest was awakened.Evoland is a time-travel between the grapic engines from C64 style to today. But the biggest reference of it is Final Fantasy VII.As mentioned you start with 8bit graphic and have to learn how to walk left and right, some minutes later you will unlock sounds and shortly thereafter COLOR!!! Well, the time from C64 to your first 3D effect is not very long, your first 3D HD graphics will come after 1 hour already.The whole game took me only ~4 hours. It was good invested 4 hours for me, for the price we could fight. 10€ (Sep2013) is ok but 5€ would be more fair for that playlength.The story is kinda funny, not only cause of that much references. 7/10			"

												Pretty decent game if you've grown up with JRPGs as a kid. With particularly heavy homages to Final Fantasies 6-9. Even some Diablo, since it's technically an RPG?You'll move from Zelda like combat, to turn-based ala classic FF. And I don't want to spoil anything too heavily, but FF7 fans will notice alot of shout-outs, and one scene especially should hit pretty close to home.Only get it on sale though, IMO. And at $2.50 or less. Even at 50% off ($5), it wouldn't be worth it. I completed this game in 6 hours, and that's with all achievements cleared. If you were to do a regular playthrough I'd expect you to clock in 3-4 hours max before finishing.			"

												Fairly nice game, short, but nice nontheless.The thing about game's like this is, graphics really don't matter, because they're essentially just showing you the evolution of gaming, which is a great experience. I wish they could have moved some elements around, though, because it effects the gameplay more than one would think. I was looking for key elements in this, to seperate it from games like 'DLC Quest', 'Quest Run', 'Costume Quest 1&2', but nothing there. The key elements in this game (that I was looking for) was diversity and gameplay, they most certainly delivered, but no without faults (switching game modes)8/10 verdict, pretty good game.			"

												This game is very indicative of the landscape of terrible gaming today. No matter whether you look at indie studios or big AAA companies, there is no such thing as a complete game anymore. They are just tiny gimmicks attempting to make a brief artistic statement on some unimportant aspect of life. You spend an hour playing through a glorified tutorial before finding out that the entire game is a tutorial. All of the things that you want to do as a player are blocked off, either because you haven't earned the right to play that part of the game yet, or they decided for you that freedom is stupid and you should feel bad for expecting to have fun. Exploration should not be punished, dissapointing, or a massive chore. But that's basically this entire game in a nut shell. You're always chasing the start of the game, and never get anything short of a sick joke making fun of actual game play.And to be honest, I'd have kept this entire opinion to myself if this game didn't offer itself up as such a wonderful treat for your steam controller. Guess what. It's broken. You have to use weird work arounds to get the steam controller to work, and even when it works once, there is no gaurantee that it won't break again between turning it off and on again.If you're up for wasting time, this one is the one for you. But don't expect to have fun or get your controller to work.			"

												I actually really like Evoland.It's not a perfect game, and it's not for everyone.What I like most about this game is that it parodies old RPGs and adventure games such as Zelda and FF6/7. Evoland does what I like best. It's not afraid to be itself. It makes fun of classics like FF7, and isn't afraid to do so, while also showing apreciation to it.The gameplay is basically zelda and FF combined, but simplified. The only real shortcomings of this game are the fact that it only lasts about 3-5 hours (about 10 for 100%), and that it has low replay value.Overally, I really like Evoland, and for its very cheap price of 10 dollars, it's worth a buy.

												if i could get my money back, i would.my advice to you if you're interested in this game is to play the first half then turn it off and never play it again, even as a short game it’s not worth the money, I’ve spent less money on games with way more content so play literally anything else. but if you really must know how the game goes, it transitions rather fast through different game styles then halfway through it realizes that it has nowhere else to go so rather than try some different direction it just makes the final game boss really hard. there's only about 3 or 4 bosses in the whole game and 2 cities and about the same number of dungeons. the only great thing i can say about this game is the difficulty curb is pretty small but this is meaningless when you consider that there is nowhere to go and nothing to do. a game that truly starts off with the bare bones of gameplay and ends with the bare bones of gameplay, there is no investment for a game this criminally short and overpriced.

												Simple, but still fun.The game itself plays like five different games all merged together under one roof.  And honestly, each of those ""games"" by itself would be lacking.  Each section is simple, or even watered-down from you would get from such a title normally.  Overall, the gameplay is always shallow.  But instead of giving deep gameplay, it gives you a lot of gameplay variety.It never feels like it is trying to be challenging.  You can walk through the game without much fluster, and it won't be very demanding on your time.But the only reason these factors really seem to be present is because the game pulls in so many references and ideas from games that are demanding to our time or to our thinking.  It looks, sounds, and plays superficially just like a number of games that have deep and engaging gameplay, so if you are one of the long-time fans this game was made for, it isn't hard to notice that this game doesn't match the same depth and complexity of the games it reminds us of.But just when you reach the point where you can see that it isn't offering much, the game changes into something new and it feels like you're playing a whole new game.  It never stays on anything for too long, so it's always got something fresh to offer you.It's not revolutionary, it's not going to replace the games we grew up with.  It's just a simple homage.Even so, it still is fun.  It never makes a blunder where it reaches beyond itself.  It never even gets stale or boring.In the end, it's not great, but not bad.			"

												Jumping into Evoland I was expecting an experience very similar to 3D Dot Game Heroes, in the sense that we'd get a nice mirroring of many of our favourite nostalgic action/adventure/RPG's in a love letter to the aesthetic, gameplay and difficulty. However, going into this game I also didn't take into account that this was a mobile port so it managed to deliver about half those hopes at least.The gameplay for this game may start off (and arguably continue to be) clunky however it's extremely clever how not only the tutorial but the actual gameplay mechanics unfold. As you progress through the evolution of these genres instead of collecting weapons, armour, or loot, you collect visual elements and gameplay mechanics to progress through the decades.They do also have a cute story to accompany these elements, although not very prominent its a simple enough formula to just drop in reference after reference from all sorts of franchises from our childhoods such as (but not solely) Zelda, Final Fantasy, Pokemon, etc.I only really have two complaints with the game. It's simply too short, and there's so many other games that they could've paid tribute to especially in other genres that would've complimented the progression they created. Some may say that's asking for too much from a mobile port though, I wouldn't entirely disagree but only because the state of the mobile game industry is so abysmal right now.However with the sequel that was recently released it seems like they've fixed both of those complaints, however I'll have to get back to you on how I liked once I make it through the metric tonnes of games coming out lately.Overall though if you've played anything with weapons, armor or magic in between the 2 and 64 bit eras, you will want to see this game through to the end.

It also serves as a good introduction to what the action-adventure, action RPG, and JRPG genres were like in bygone days.Evoland is paced very well. Whenever a person lacking in patience would get tired of one mode of play, the game evolves and presents the player with something new to play with. Even completing all the side quests can be done with only a modicum of extra effort. I would reccommend this game to anyone and everyone.			"

												Endearing almost to the point of being obnoxious in a wonderfully nostalgic way.  Search through the land for chests which evolve the game you're in.  Side scrolling.  Color.  Sound.  Music.  Fighting.  For anyone who grew up with videogames, the trip Evoland offers will warm your heart and put your mind right back to where you were as a kid - fighting through a Zelda dungeon for the first time, or your first turn based battle in Final Fantasy, to that annoying as a floppy-fish boss fight.If it's a rainy day, give the game a play through.  If you're in a soured mood and want to escape for a couple hours, give it a shot.  I put off playing this game for far too long, and when I finally got around to it I wondered why I hadn't touched it sooner.  I haven't touched a controller in months, but I immediately plugged one in upon discovering what a gem this game really is.My only complaint is that it was far too short... I want more.			"

												One of the simplest yet most awesome RPG games i've ever played. The nostalgic feeling has been through the whole gameplay, going from The Legend of Zelda for the NES to Diablo, this was so creative that actually made me want to play the whole thing all over again. Highly recommend it.			"

												This game is an amazing take on the evolution of gaming. Starting from the pixelated adventures that we all use to take as kids, all the way to modern 3D games that are out today. It is a joy to play, especially with some deja vu moments here and there. It brings me back to when I was a young kid, playing the ""modern"" games. I highly recommend you play this game if you are a fan of older and newer games. "

												I loved the Idea of the Game and the first maybe 2 hours were nice. But then the random encounters popped out every 2 steps, the fights were dmg, heal, dmg, heal, even after leveling up. And then the fire pit walking here, back there, back AGAIN and AGAIN BACK TO THE START and AGAIN... omg. so annoying.The endbos was to hard... i rage uninstalled it.Nice idea, but left a very disappointing feeling behind...

												The idea is neat and somewhat interesting, however, THAT IS ALL!  If we are to treat this game as a game, then the gameplay mechanics are terrible.  It's somewhat like the older Final Fantasy games, but without any of the care that went into those games.  Everytime I try and play this game all I want to do is smash my keyboard.  Again, it is a neat concept, but the execution simply destroys any chance of hope this game had.  I cannot now, nor would I ever recommend this game.			"

												This is a very clever game with many different feels to it. Mainly it will seem like a Final Fantasy and Legend of Zelda game, defending on what you are doing. There are a few bugs and tweaks that could be done to make the game a bit less clunky at parts, but overall a very well programmed game! The soundtrack it very well done and helps get you into the game. There seems to be a good length to the game based on the cost with a lot of fun secrets and side-things added on for extra. The humor is great and/or cheesy (in a good way). Overall a wonderful game and I hope for a sequel or at least more games from this deveoper!			"

												It's a bit short and the ""history"" left off around the PSX stage of technology. It would have been nice to see things such as Real Time battles(ATB gauges), AI controlled allies, customizable skills and equipment, hotkey customization, and so forth. It is fun going back for the achievements, but I had to start back from before I beat Zephoris so I'm going to have to beat him again once I get 100%. So far I have all but four achievements though. I just need two or three cards and to play the champion card game, beat the noria boss without being hit, and collect 50k gold. Time to farm, lol. Too bad there aren't any more characters to add to my party. It would be nice to have another character replace the one that leaves the party. All in all, it's a fun game, but I didn't expect to beat it in a day. I got it from a humble bundle package, I wouldn't want to pay 10 bucks for such a short game. Once you get all the achievements, which isn't all that hard, it's not really replayable. I really think that it needs to have more content or the price should drop a lot. I wouldn't mind paying about 5 bucks for it, but for 10, the content should be doubled.			"

												Do you like Legend of Zelda Final Fantasy and many other RPG games. This game is a great short history of such games. You start off with the most basic of things in the game such as 4 way movement old 8 bit graphics and then steadily work your way up through advancements such as turn base fighting and 3D graphics. This game is a fun quick play around 4-5 exploring and completing everything. It also has so many refrences to classic games its crazy and you will get a kick out of it. If i do have to say something bad it is the fact of the overworld battles and the fact of how many times you seem to be pulled into them. Though with that being the only down side i do recommend this game to all.			"

												Nostalgia goggles still firmly in place, I can't help but rave about this game. There are so many terrific homages to the games I grew up with and loved. Nods to The Legend of Zelda and Secret of Mana gave me the most warm and fuzzy feelings. Plenty of Final Fantasy VII references made me say, ""Ah, yes."" But more than references to games, Evoland references the very culture of gaming that I was raised in. The evolution of graphics and other technological advancements is presented in such a compelling way, I'd recommend this game for classes on pop culture or video game history.Taking the nostalgia goggles off, I find this game tight, well paced and well designed. Nothing seems to be filler and evolutions happen at a rapid pace so as to keep things interesting. The tongue-in-cheek storyline unfolds neatly and with no annoying spelling or grammar mistakes. New play styles are compelling, as well.While I appreciate the brevity of the game, some may not. It's not a terribly long story though I found there to be some replay value after completion. Players expecting a full RPG that will keep them going for a whole season will not find what they are looking for here. As for me, it took an evening and a morning to clear the story and I commend the designers for not fattening the game. It feels like the right length to make the most of the gimmick without making it feel annoying.I highly recommend this game.			"

												Not a bad little game. Lasted me about 3-4 hours. I'd read some complaints about the mechanics but as long as you go in expecting a tribute to old school RPGs rather than a full-fledged game, it works great. It does turn into a fairly normal game once you get 3D, though, which is about 1/4 of the way in.My only real complaint is the random encounters on the overworld. It's one of those games where you can't take 3 steps without entering battle. There's also a cave with random encounters which makes exploring an absolute nightmare. This is only a small part of the game, though. As you probably know, the game ""evolves"" as you play and you use different battle systems and gameplay styles as you go so you don't have to deal with random encounters throughout the game, thankfully. Also, the battles are fast with enemies only taking 1-2 hits, usually.On sale, I'd definately recommend this game if you enjoyed such classics as The Legend of Zelda, Final Fantasy and Diablo. Full price is a stretch, though. I've played games way longer and more polished for $10.			"

												People can bash all they want, but the creativity behind the evolution of games sold it for me. Very good, but very short. I enjoyed the fact that I recognized certain games in Evoland, like memory lane. Although good, it was very short. I just completed it in one sitting, besides the me 'making dinner' aspect of life. I wouldve enjoyed it if they drew out the evolution of the games, like if it went like this...-evolution-evolution-evolution-fight small baddies-evolution x5etc.Shouldve made it mroe sporadic in the evolutions of the genre instead of just bombarding you with it.I got this on steam sale for $2.49, worth it IMO. Dont bother if its not on sale, but i definitely got my moneys worth.

												This game was really cool.  It started out where gaining chests would *evolve* gameplay such as improving graphics or fidelity mirroring the development of games within the last few decades but I wouldn't call this game a gimmick.  It had very fun puzzle mechanics later on in the game where you would travel between the 8-bit world and the fully developed 3D world in order to progress and it made gameplay very interesting.  The storyline is more of a tool than an actual story since gameplay and the story closely mirror FF7/Zelda but it is humorous at times.  Gameplay was pretty cool in that it featured all sorts of gameplay including a very sillly Diablo level featuring tons of gear for example a ring of item finding which had a description of ""helps you find an actually useful item"".  The bad parts I would say are the RPG gameplay sections which I feel don't develop enough, and the very short length of the game.Overall, it was a very fun game and I would buy it if it went on sale again if I were you.  You can really tell the developer put a lot of love into the game.			"

												Evoland is a great trip through the nostalgia of gaming. It may be short, and the story may be lacking, but all in all it is a great journey through time. You start out with the game looking like the pixelated gameboy games of the past, and upgrade through chests that you find, eventually leading to 3D elements. The bottom line is that this game really shines as a tribute to the evolution of gaming, and serves as a somewhat makeshift history lesson to younger generations.			"

												I really wish I would have read the reviews before buying this game. Even on flash sale, I'm not sure it was worth the money, not even as an interesting experience, because quite frankly, it just wasn't.The idea is interesting enough, and you get the impression that it's going to be a unique game that gradually introduces you into new elements of gameplay as you progress. What it actually is, is a game that has you wandering around with no clear direction until you find some hidden (some not) treasure chest with an ""upgrade"" in it. Within the first hour, you're already in the 3D world, and you don't even have time to feel nostalgic before it's taken away from you. The pacing was just plain bad, and I feel like maybe if they had worked a bit more to make a longer game, it could have been more of a success.I read a review that said they use humor as a crutch, and I'm going to go ahead and second that. It really isn't that funny though, and it feels as if they tried way too hard to make a game that would appeal to players of old-school RPGs, without actually delivering anything that made them good.Overall, I feel like a lot of work was put into the game, but it just wasn't executed well. The graphics aren't bad, and they had to make several different sprites for everything, not to mention the 3D models, and the music is all very good. I acknowledge and appreciate that work, but I still can't recommend this game in good conscience. I'd give it maybe a 5/10.			"

												Where do I start? This game has a great start when your opening treasures and its showing you how games have progressed over the years.......But that ends fast and then it falls down to a very short and boring dungeon crawlerish, zeldaish, final fantasyish type of game which at first the switching between game types was sorta cool it gets boring fast, there are 2 towns.... woooo and holy god would it have killed to have a chest that gave you running or a dash or something your character is slower then molassess. Also the random encounters in Final Fantasy mode are aggrivating I mean your in a fight about every 5-10 steps and the battles are BORING, main guy attacks and your helper girl (named after aerith from ff7, there all named after ff7 chars) just heals really cause she cant attack for♥♥♥♥♥♥or when you finally get her 1 spell thats all you do. Final boss is a joke he is easy and a let down its a hit here 3 times and he transforms then repeat boss.......... overall its meh I wouldnt play it again and I would only recommend it if your friend owns it and you have nothing to play!

												The conceit is that you play through the history of RPG/Adventure games from the 80's until now all of which are built upon the world of Evolandia.  As you open chests, you unlock either collectibles or new game mechanics/visuals progressing through the era.At first I wasn't sure if it was satire or pastiche as the game didn't really have much to say about what it was putting before you.  There are a few in-jokes about RPG and Adventure characters, as well as a few familiar tropes in what is generally the barest bones of stories, and with the pace at which you discover new things early on the game can be amusing.  But at a certain point about halfway through the play time the game kind of just gives up and throws random game mechanics at you, taken from other games in the genres it references to be sure, but ultimately just kind of attached briefly and then discarded.My final conclusion about the satire/pastiche debate is that the game wants to be satire, mocking the genres it sets up, but it ends up being too fond of them and reliant upon them to actually critique them and instead just becomes a straight-up pastiche.  And that, unfortunately, is the tragedy of Evoland and why it falls flat on its face.  Rather than criticizing and attacking the failures of the RPG genre of the past, it reminds you of BETTER gameplay in some interesting one-off segments and then immediately buries you under everything you ever hated about RPGs.Random encounters?  Check.  Too many random encounters?  Check.  The inability to run from random encounters without getting your face smashed in?  Check.  Repetitive enemies?  Check.  The inability to automate these boring random encounters and go get a sandwich?  Check.  Pity, since Breath of Fire figured out automated fights back in the early 90's.But the game takes one extra step and gives you an inventory that is totally for show.  You can't equip weapons (fair enough, it's a short game), but you also can't use healing items or abilities between fights.  Which means if you just BARELY survive a random encounter, you better hope you get to a save point before your next one because otherwise it's right back to town.If it weren't for the fact that the game has you spending 50% of the time wandering the overworld map getting attacked every 4-5 steps, it could be forgiven for the utter, mind-numbing tedium you find yourself chained to.  Late in the game there's a decent modern-day RPG fight and the final boss actually has a bit of cleverness to him, but at this point if you didn't love everything about RPGs before you will probably hate the entire genre once and for all.I bought it for 2.50 and don't feel like my money was completely wasted.  But at a price point any higher than that, stay the heck away.			"

												Imagine a game that takes you back through time, from your early RPG days on the nintendo systems all the way up to the playstation. Now imagine reliving all the little nuances of those games that you grew up with, the little tweaks that made them so great! For a shorter game, this one was made by an RPG fan who did his homework. The little things we take for granted now show with a new light in this ""short story"" of a game. I was skeptical about this game when a friend of mine told me I'd love it, but after playing it I had to get it for myself. It brought back so many memories and references. Whether you like the old RPG style of the early 90's or FF7, this is a game worth playing... If for no other reason than to appreciate where the RPG's today got their roots.			"

I'd recommend you play it because your life will be incomplete if you don't.HOWEVER, my biggest concern with this title is the unfortunate length of gameplay. Took me too short a time to finish it and I was left wanting more. This game has amazing potential to be something incredible. It's just a shameStill, I highly recommend picking this up. If you can't justify spending the full price for it, pick it up on sale. Whatever you do, indulge yourself and give it a try. You won't regret it.			"

												Hey people of SteamLets talk about the game shall we? I totally recommend the game to everyone who started playing RPG's back in the day!Not only tells the game the evolution of RPGs which is i think one of the selling points :DIt also has alot of... can i call them easter eggs? Well alot of ""cameos"" of enemys from others games""Goombas"" from super mario or the plant thingys from super mario are only 2 of the examples. And even items and people arent save from apearing in the game.. Garen from league of legends.. yaa ^^ well lets talk about the Pros/ConsPro: # Tells a nice story of the Evolution of RPGS# Alot of ""cameos"" of People/Items/Enemys of other Games# Beautifull crafted graphicand alot more..Cons:# The random battle chance is a bit to high which makes it a bit annoying# The dialogs appear to be a bit wierd atleast for me tho I think thats all.

												A nostalgic, inside-joke filled tribute to Legend of Zelda and Final Fantasy. The graphic switches, the treaure chests, and a lot of the in-game jokes are constantly referencing other video games. I've only played a few hours now, but it seems like a pretty solid little indie game. I like how you can switch between Zelda style-battles and Final Fantasy-style battles depending on whether or not you're in the overworld (FF style) or in a dungeon area (Zelda style).A few glitches, though. One of which is that Steam can't count how much time I'm logging when it charts me. Also, it's very slow in the mountain region, lots of lag, perhaps due to the large amount of  badguy NPC's the game sees.			"

												Definitely had fun with the game overall.  I loved the throwbacks the game has towards a LOT of classic rpgs (going back to the NES among others).  The random encounter rate felt a ~tad~ high and got rather aggravating because of it but the soundtrack and the rest of the game play is well done to go with each segment.  Totally loved the final boss music....had to check a few guides for the items I was missing though... >_>;Was DEFINITELY a good pickup for the short time I spent on it.Please note: The game samples from different eras of rpgs.  As long as you go into it figuring a spoof of sorts to have fun with, it'll be alright.  The storyline is as typical as they come and rather obvious what games they pull elements from.  Just have fun with it and laugh as you relive (or take part in) where rpgs came from. :)			"

It's a pretty cool combination of final fantasy turn-based battling and legend of zelda battle systems (hopefully you remember the final battle against gannondorf in ocarina of time). There are also some cute parodies of FF7 and Zelda like Chobokos = Chocobos, Clink = Link, and Kaeris = Aeris. Anyways hopefully I didn't spoil too much...

												What starts out as a celebration of the RPG quickly becomes a boring and bland romp through a game that's part Zelda and part Final Fantasy. The progression of visual and gameplay styles in the beginning is well-done, and one would be quick to compare it to DLC Quest. However, DLC Quest actually has tolerable writing, and it knows the difference between referencing something and outright imitating it. Evoland is packed with references to the point of overkill. Your character is named ""Clink"" and your accomplice is named ""Caerith."" She dies akin to Aerith in FF7.  You fight turtles, goombas, pirahna plants, octoroks, bats, and a boss named ""Kefka's Ghost"". Haha. Get it!?!?!?!?By the time you unlock 3D, the game's action comes to an abrupt plateau as you trudge through poorly-designed Zelda-inspired levels and grind through stale Final Fantasy-inspired fights. This game has absolutely no personality. The moment a story was added, the game became much more bland. I cared about nothing in the story, and I didn't get a single smile or chuckle out of the game. This game ""references"" the gameplay styles of Diablo, FInal Fantasy, Zelda, and Dragon Warrior, but it does them so half-baked that it stoops beyond boring, with some sections being ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ly easy (Diablo-style) and some being mind-numblingly difficult (Zelda-style). Aside from that, there are a lot of glitches, such as maps being hard to navigate in 3D, being able to peer into the end of a map, extensive tile cracks, and the inability to use a controller DESPITE stating the game has controller support.So, all in all, Evoland is a game with good intentions, but it's completely devoid of imagination and thinks that outright copying other game styles passes as a reference. Each and every single thing about this game is half-baked, and it is by no means worth your money.Also, your airship looks like a dong.			"

												The idea behind Evoland is cute, but it's short and clunkily executed. With some more work, it could possibly be a decent game. However, any upgrades and whatnot that you get to ""update"" the game only apply to the zones you get them in (and in some cases, the applicable zones afterwards) -- that is to say, you can't backtrack to past areas to get a new perspective on them or anything. Everything is very clean-cut, point-A-to-point-B. It really feels like an interactive showcase of a satirical look on games and how they've progressed through the years.			"

The game is fun at first, however you soon realize that the battle mechanics change very little, and to top it off, you must do a LOT of grinding in order to aford any decent items.  The game is worth a try.  Not much else though.			"

												Boy I wish I'd read the reviews.  At first, I thought, ""Oh awesome, a game that's going to involve features from my favorite RPGs!  It'll have grid based tactics and job systems and all that!""  Stop yourself there.  This is not a game, it is an FFVII fanfiction with Link inspiriations and a little bit of Diablo (probably when people got sick of hearing the publishers go on and on about FFVII).  Clink and Kaeris are not clever names.  About the time you get the Heroes sword, the feeling in my gut that this was about to turn into a bad FFVII remake was right on.Where was Final Fantasy Tactics?  Are you saying that isn't an RPG?Where was Tactics Ogre?  Are you saying that isn't an RPG?Where are the billions of other games with unique concepts?  Are those not RPGs?If you're going to describe the game as ""Evoland is a journey through the history of action/adventure gaming, allowing you to unlock new technologies, gameplay systems and graphic upgrades as you progress through the game"", make ♥♥♥♥ing sure you actually go through the history, not just ""oh hey here's FFVII there that's what everyone wants anyway right?""  FFVII left a distinct mark on the industry, sure.  Look at me, I've got a Zack Fair profile picture and I think this is dumb.This is not a parody.  This is not a tribute.  This is the developers getting down on their knees and giving a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ to a franchise that doesn't need one.Spend your 2.50 on getting a new case for FFVII or something, then play through the first Five hours of that and you've basically got the same game.

												2.5/5. The game wants really badly to be both a homage and spoof of classic games. If you've played DLC Quest, this is very similar in a lot of ways (you even start out without the ability to move left). However, Evoland doesn't have the same satire quality that DLC Quest did. Ultimately, most of the unlocks feel like the game is going ""through the motions,"" and so the iterations through different art and playstyles weren't as satisfying as I'd hoped. The game itself feels pretty generic - like a crossover Zelda/FF7 clone without the charm. (On that note, the references to other video games are very heavy handed yet feel tacked on. Like characters frequently have one letter difference from what they are from.) I had an okay time playing it, but I wouldn't recommend getting this unless it was on sale.			"

												Evoland is a game about games. It's not a good game on it's own merit, but taking it for what it is, (being a game that is meant to take you through the Action/Adventure/RPG genres) it delivers a sense of nostalgia that can only be appreciated if you have played any of the games it constantly references or jokes about.The game borrows almost every aspect of itself from successful RPG's of the past and incorporates them into this journey through the evolution of games. Although the overall idea of the game is good, the delivery of things is a little underwhelming and it leaves the game with a sense of emptiness about it. Puzzles are simple, enemies are lifeless, areas are bland and empty, and collectibles require almost no work to get. Yes, Evoland certainly does take you through the Action/Adventure/RPG genre, but don't expect it to compete with the games it borrows from. Evoland is NOT a good RPG, but it IS a good experience. If you like RPG's, you'll like Evoland.If you're looking for an engrossing, original game, Evoland is not for you.All in all, I enjoyed it, but it's not a game I'll ever revisit or feel the need to play again.

												Evoland guides you into a place that seems familiar while keeping it's own charm and appeal. It's short...really short but worth playing atleast once. It really doesn't have replayability unless you're an achievement hunter. Graphically it does well but it won't blow you away. It's not at all serious and does keep a light hearted sense of humor. Overall I would suggest this game to anyone that is a fan of old school games.			"

												Evoland was a barebones romp through the history of action rpgs. It had a lot of variety inspired by different types of rpgs, but the core of each gameplay type was very basic. The game is about 3 hours long if you go from point A to point B, but took me 7 hours total to 100% the game without the use of a guide.I would only recommend this game if you grew up with the evolution of RPGs, and want a trip down memory lane.I personally enjoyed it...Despite how basic it was... I'd love to see this concept expanded upon in a new game.			"

I look forward to each treasure chest, even when some of them make me groan, and even when the occassional gameplay makes me scream in frustration.  But it's worth it.  It's so worth it.

												This game is less of an homage to several adventure games and RPGs from the past and more a shoehorning of A Link to the Past into Final Fantasy VII with a few character names barely obscured.  Speaking of shoehorning, the plot goes from boilerplate JRPG to essentially ripping off the most major scenes from FFVII without context or emotion in the last hour.That said, it does add some of its own character through the ""evolution"" of the graphics, sound and gameplay; it's a naturally flowing romp through all your favorite visuals in the first half with a rather pleasing visceral effect on someone that grew up at the same time.Unfortunately, the second half is almost entirely everything about FFVII battles that were tedious; constant, irritating, overly showy, slow turn-based battles with literally the same 4 or 5 enemies for all but two short sections.Pros: - Smooth gameplay - Amusing ""upgrade"" system for the graphics, sound, UI, and character gameplay - High on nostalgia if you're into thatCons: - Far, far too short (6 hours for me) - Gameplay padded by irritating, repetitive battles with the same enemies (fewer than 20 in game) - Not at all challenging, other than collection side questsVerdict:I don't feel cheated at the $2.50 price point I paid during a Steam sale.  I would have at the $10 regular price.  If you want a short trip down memory lane, you could do worse than Evoland; just wait until it goes on sale.			"

												Evoland is a video game that combines different aspects of RPGs and adventure games (namely Legend of Zelda and Final Fantasy) while ""evolving"" the game itself as you progress. This unique system not only provides an entertaining way to improve your experience, but it can evoke some nostalgia with gamers who played games on the SNES and PS1. For example, one improvement you can ""unlock"" is a town view that is reminiscent of Final Fantasy VII's style. I got this game for my birthday and I absolutely love it. However, this game is too short for it's own good. While it is extremely fun to play, once you beat it you feel like the the game was rushed in the end. Nevertheless, I would recommend this game to anyone looking to try something new or is a fan of final fantasy/legend of zelda.			"

												It's tough to recommend this game.  I know lots of people do not like games with a linear story.  This is a game that is very linear.  For someone like myself, I like to play a linear game once in a while.  I find the games with a hundred different side quests and campaigns to be daunting.  Also, I don't need to spend a 100+ hours of my life playing a game.  If I want something more streamlined, this is a game I would grab.  If you want something more streamlined, then grab this.  It's simple.  It's fun.  That's about all there is to it.  The story is by no means deep and intricate.  The gameplay could use some work (even simple enemies are a pain in the butt to defeat.  Then again, maybe that's because I've been playing this game on the keyboard when it should be played using a controller).  The puzzles are not too challenging.  The references to other games are not subtle in the least, yet it is kind of fun when you catch them.  This is definitely for someone who is not looking for something too challenging, too long, or too complex.  This game is made for the gamers who remember playing FFVII, Link's Awakening, and other classic adventure games from the 90's.  With that I say, try it out.  If you're skeptical, wait 'til it goes on sale and then download it.			"

												A modern day love letter to nostalgia.Evoland is a game not without it's faults. Yes, it can be very repetative, there aren't nearly enough monsters and lastly the upgrading system; where you update and upgrade the game itself by finding things in the game world is over rather quickly is a bit of a let down. The thing is though, if you can over look all that you will find a quirky, tongue-in-cheek game which loves it's source material as much as it loves poking fun at it. Yes, it's over in 8 hours or so but if you love the nostagia of 8-bit to Playstation One era RPG/Adventure games then you should definitely check out this game. I finished it and then went back to play it more so I could 100% it by collecing all the stars and cards and completing the achievements. It's not for everyone but it just might be enough to put a smile on your face.			"

												It starts out really neat as a top-down pixel game, with chests unlocking new features like ""y axis movement"" or ""basic sound"". About half of the way through, though, all of the advancements stop and you're just in a basic 3D hack and slash with chibi graphics. So for a game that endeavours to show a history of RPGs, it stops the history halfway through. It'd be neat to see a sequel or expansion that delves more into what a MODERN jrpg is like, because the gameplay is fairly weak and it lives or dies by the strength of its concept.Play it if you can get it cheap and have a day to kill. Don't expect any revalations, though.			"

												I've only put in two hours to this game so far, but I can already tell I will LOVE playing the rest of it.  Many will play it off as a Zelda-esque game, but I LOVE the concept of moving through video game creation history along with the story.  It just adds that little twist of intrigue that keeps me interested.  Also love the little touches of concepts/characters from other games... So glad I picked this up during the Summer Sale, it's been in my Wishlist for a long time :)			"

												This was an interesting concept for a game, being a long time fan of RPG's and having enjoyed the early ones for the 8 bit era this game was a good trip down memory lane.  But that's really the only reason to buy this game, there a just a couple of characters and the story is about as generic as it could possibly be, all in all I think it was only a few hours to complete.  However I think the game was designed to really just parody various RPG's, and it does that very well.  The way you unlock extra effects, graphics, sounds, equipment, and combat styles is well done, and by the end of the game you've had a chance to play a small part of several games.  There are plenty of small nods to various games and I enjoyed that.			"

												An exciting concept with great potential for creativity, but ultimately falls flat by the end of the game.  While, the ""evolving"" landscapes/fighting styles are quirky and fun in the beginning, this mechanic eventually runs out of speed 3/4 of the way through.  Sadly, the humor dies out by the end of the game, as well, relying too heavily upon common RPG clichés and tropes to drive its story.    Also - didn't record my time playing?  ¯\_(ツ)_/¯			"

												Not having finished it and I am already in love with this game. It parodies from just about every RPG (an some non-RPG ) game out there from Legend of Zelda to Final Fantasy to Diabo. I was having nostalgic moments and out right bursting into a fit of laughter. It has a solid theme, great humor, and it reminded me about why I love these adventure games. It is a must play!			"

												I don't recommend this, but only moderately. It has plenty of positives, but doesn't really offer much to the average gamer, even to the average RPG player. You would probably be better served just playing the games it copies (I say ""copies"" since I don't know how else to describe it, but I certainly don't mean the term negatively): The Legend of Zelda and Final Fantasy, especially. If you've played those (and Evoland mostly assumes you have), just play similar games that take themselves a little more seriously.Of course, Evoland is not a huge time sink: the whole thing will take 3 to 6 hours, depending on whether you speed through or try to find all the hidden items. It is shorter than it seems, though: the high random battle encounter rate and the tedious level design (which often requires you to go way around scenery obstacles for really no reason) drastically inflate how long the game takes. This is especially true if you want to do the optional goals, collecting cards and stars. The card game, which pretty much just copies Triple Triad from FF8, is pretty fun, but relatively easy and lacks replayability. The stars are pointless: they have no real purpose in the game, aren't explained, do nothing; the only real reason for them being there is to make another achievement and make the game seem like it lasts longer than it does.The MAJOR flaw with the game, though, is that it undermines its entire premise about halfway through. The ""evo"" part of Evoland is that you collect ""upgrades"" that let the game ""evolve"" from 8bit RPG mechanics and graphics to 3-D design and more recent mechanics. This was the most interesting part of the game, and makes the game valuable as a retrospective of the history of RPGS. About halfway through, though, you pretty much stop collecting any more upgrades. Indeed, the mimicking of other games just starts to happen randomly: the Diablo level is an example, where Diablo mechanics just show up and then go away after the level. Things stop to make much sense. Not that they do for the most part to begin with: often the sequence of upgrades makes no sense in terms of any real history of gaming ""evolution."" If the game would have stuck with the idea of evolution, making some of the earlier parts last longer (you move from 8bit to 3D very quickly, then get stuck in 3D for about 3 hours without the novelty of upgrades, making the story drag) and exploring the history of RPGs after FF8 (which is where it mostly stops), then it would probably be more interesting.Lastly, the story is just pointless. At first it's interesting as a parody of older RPGs, and then just becomes absurd. It stops working as a parody and gets cliche and doesn't even really seem to try. Since it's short, this may be worth playing if you have any interest in the history of RPGs or just like FF7. It is also a decent deal on sale. Overall, though, this is an interesting concept with woefully failed execution.			"

It's somewhat short, but it spans a good variety of different types of RPGs (mostly Asian RPG archetypes) while telling a silly, but fun story with an emphasis on puzzle solving and exploration.

												While built upon an interesting premise, this game doesn't seem to use its full potential at all. It's absolutely linear and, once you've become accustomed to the fact that it upgrades its graphic style and changes some rules now and then, has no real ""point"" in playing. There is no engaging story, world or character and the gameplay itself isn't very motivating either. It's main selling proposition, traveling through the history of adventure / roleplay gaming, isn't really incorporated into its gameplay as well, except for a few designated spots - at least not within the 80 minutes I've played it. Nostalgia is all nice and good, but I didn't really feel entertained by the overall experience with Evoland.			"

												Simple, but still fun.The game itself plays like five different games all merged together under one roof.  And honestly, each of those ""games"" by itself would be lacking.  Each section is simple, or even watered-down from you would get from such a title normally.  Overall, the gameplay is always shallow.  But instead of giving deep gameplay, it gives you a lot of gameplay variety.It never feels like it is trying to be challenging.  You can walk through the game without much fluster, and it won't be very demanding on your time.But the only reason these factors really seem to be present is because the game pulls in so many references and ideas from games that are demanding to our time or to our thinking.  It looks, sounds, and plays superficially just like a number of games that have deep and engaging gameplay, so if you are one of the long-time fans this game was made for, it isn't hard to notice that this game doesn't match the same depth and complexity of the games it reminds us of.But just when you reach the point where you can see that it isn't offering much, the game changes into something new and it feels like you're playing a whole new game.  It never stays on anything for too long, so it's always got something fresh to offer you.It's not revolutionary, it's not going to replace the games we grew up with.  It's just a simple homage.Even so, it still is fun.  It never makes a blunder where it reaches beyond itself.  It never even gets stale or boring.In the end, it's not great, but not bad.			"

												if i could get my money back, i would.my advice to you if you're interested in this game is to play the first half then turn it off and never play it again, even as a short game it’s not worth the money, I’ve spent less money on games with way more content so play literally anything else. but if you really must know how the game goes, it transitions rather fast through different game styles then halfway through it realizes that it has nowhere else to go so rather than try some different direction it just makes the final game boss really hard. there's only about 3 or 4 bosses in the whole game and 2 cities and about the same number of dungeons. the only great thing i can say about this game is the difficulty curb is pretty small but this is meaningless when you consider that there is nowhere to go and nothing to do. a game that truly starts off with the bare bones of gameplay and ends with the bare bones of gameplay, there is no investment for a game this criminally short and overpriced.

												Evoland is a fun game for those who have roots and a deep love for JRPGs. It cleverly starts off from the 'dark ages', in 8-bit, allowing only the most basic movement. It, however, eventually becomes an action RPG with elements of the classic, turn-based RPG. It even has a card game VERY similar to Triple Triad. I will say one negative thing about this game. Though I am recommending it, people who aren't huge fans or have deep roots of the genre, be wary. The game is very short and, unless you enjoy this kind of genre, will feel lacking and making you want more.			"

												When they say “short story,” they’re not joking. The game plays more like a story than a game. Granted, it is kinda cool in that the game actually does “evolve” as you play it, but it does so as a sort of history lesson more than anything. The problem here is that though I can still say it qualifies as a game, it does so only barely.  I’m not even saying it isn’t interesting, it’s just that it isn’t that fun. If you’re looking for a game that shows both retro and new age stuff with a definitive oldschool feel, well, there are plenty of those out there…and this isn’t it.Now, if you’re looking for something that operates somewhat like a game, but is more a history lesson about certain types of games, hey, go nuts.  This game really didn’t appeal to me. True, I haven’t beaten it so maybe it will get better. Maybe. I’m not putting money on it getting better, though. So far all that’s happened is Gameboy Zelda turned into GBA Zelda which then turned into not quite Final Fantasy 4. It’s an interesting concept, but again, remember that it is a…”short story.”			"

												This game is less of an homage to several adventure games and RPGs from the past and more a shoehorning of A Link to the Past into Final Fantasy VII with a few character names barely obscured.  Speaking of shoehorning, the plot goes from boilerplate JRPG to essentially ripping off the most major scenes from FFVII without context or emotion in the last hour.That said, it does add some of its own character through the ""evolution"" of the graphics, sound and gameplay; it's a naturally flowing romp through all your favorite visuals in the first half with a rather pleasing visceral effect on someone that grew up at the same time.Unfortunately, the second half is almost entirely everything about FFVII battles that were tedious; constant, irritating, overly showy, slow turn-based battles with literally the same 4 or 5 enemies for all but two short sections.Pros: - Smooth gameplay - Amusing ""upgrade"" system for the graphics, sound, UI, and character gameplay - High on nostalgia if you're into thatCons: - Far, far too short (6 hours for me) - Gameplay padded by irritating, repetitive battles with the same enemies (fewer than 20 in game) - Not at all challenging, other than collection side questsVerdict:I don't feel cheated at the $2.50 price point I paid during a Steam sale.  I would have at the $10 regular price.  If you want a short trip down memory lane, you could do worse than Evoland; just wait until it goes on sale.			"

												Honestly for the length of the game it's hard to recommend at full price, however picking this up any time it comes on sale is a no-brainer. A well-crafted, unique adventure through the varied eras of rpg gaming with interesting dungeons and bosses that make you nostalgic for the days of classic Zelda and Final Fantasy games, it does however make you feel like theres something missing when it finishes due to the extremely short length.Pick it up if you feel nostalgic and maybe you need something to take a break from and more challenging format of play.

												It was an interesting idea for a game, but all their cleverness seems to have gotten in the way of the game part.  This game takes every incredibly annoying game idea for the last 30 years, mashes it together, and pretends it's humor.  ""Hey, guys!  Remember how annoying it was when X happened in old games?  Now you get to do X again for the next five minutes!  Isn't this great?"" The combat is either boring or frustrating, the visuals evolve to more annoying rather than less, and it's just generally not fun.			"

												Nice and fun and quirky, and obviously a labor of great love. The art direction is great! But about halfway through, the fun and quirk dry up and acts like it's a real game, and every element is forced to overstay its welcome. I knew I was in trouble when I had to grind FF-style battles for money to unlock the next level. It's a joke game, so there's never any tension to these fights, but it sure does make you do a lot of them. The gameplay is just too clunky to be real fun, and in the end you have to wonder if maybe the joke is on you, somewhere around the ""Talk to everyone in town while we make fun of CD loading times, remember those?"" segment.  I wanted to like this, and I have nothing to complain about because I paid sale price, but personally, I had a better time with DLC Quest. (To say nothing of the masterpiece of the genre, Frog Fractions.)			"

												While the concept of this game is interesting, its execution falls apart after the first few technology advancements and props the rest of the game up on tired references to Final Fantasy (mostly FF7), and The Legend of Zelda. There is little or no challenge to the gameplay, and I found myself towards the end slogging through the motions hoping it was going to get better. It's mechanic of advancing through the various tech ages seems to be unfocused, as later in the game it suddenly becomes some sort of time travel mechanic; prior to that they were only treated as adding technology upgrades to the game.I wouldn't recommend this game to others, but I wouldn't discourage anyone from picking it up either.

												TL;DR Buy this when it's on sale. Good game, not really sure that it's worth $10.ReviewI don't know how anyone managed to get 5+ hours on this game unless they truely enjoyed it. Not saying it's a bad game--on the contrary, I really enjoyed it--but it's a very, VERY, short game. I beat it and got ALL Achievements within 2 hours and I felt like I spent a lot of time looking around. Note also, I did all of this without a guide.Pros and Cons+ Fun run through the land of Nostalgia+ Nice looking art+ Creative use of past and present art styles+ A handful of various historical battle systems that tie in together well+ You can name your character and his love interest... and her uncle...+ Airship+ Easter Egg Heaven- Very short- When you reach the ""final"" boss you will likely feel like you are at a ""turning point boss"" and start wondering why there isn't more.- For the RPG system, the encounter rate is set way too high, so if you take 2-3 steps, you will likely end up in a battle. This becomes frustrating mostly in dungeons.- Doesn't feel like a complete game.- Little to no plot. The storyline is nothing more than a mix of cliches from various games, most notably FF7. Don't play this game expecting an amazing storyline, it was created to further the nostalgia factors.Final VerdictI really enjoyed the short time I spent with this game, and if this one is anything to go by, I really hope it's just a taste of what the sequel will be like. They have something here, they just need to add a little more content and polish.			"

												I would have to say I both recommend and don't recommend this game. But the end of this review, I'll have decided which I would rather say overall, but I'll explain my reasonings:The concept of this game is great; a journey through the history of video games where you unlock the different things through finding them in chests. This is a very charming game and probably worth playing at least a little while just for the concept. If you are huge into RPGs and even other games, such as Minecraft, you will be able to enjoy the references and easter eggs throughout. (Yes, they make a reference to Minecraft once). However, these qualities can be overshadowed by the fact that the game feels like it's just stealing a bunch of games and mashing them together and the difficulty becomes increasingly frustrating. There is also one portion where you are able to choose between the male and female characters, and I had to restart my playthrough because playing as the girl made it much more difficult than when I went to play with the guy character. And in that same region, there are some minor graphical errors. The final boss battle is also pretty frustrating. It's simple, but it gives you absolutely no extra time to put in hits. The difficulty is frustrating at times, but as are a lot of games, so that attribute can be considered both a quality and an impedement. I did enjoy the minigame ""Double Twin"", I'm not sure how original it is, but it is fun.Overall, this is a pretty fun game. Enjoyable, although it does have its downsides. If you are bored and don't have anything else to play, it's an alright option.			"

												Evoland 1 is a fun action RPG, basically a mix of Final Fantasy and Zelda through the years. The gameplay is pretty solid as you evolve along with the story, but there is very little to distinguish this game as something that stands apart from its inspirations. The story is about as derivative as it could possibly be, and I don't think there's an original idea here except the actual 'evolving' as you play. It's fun to watch the graphics and gameplay style improve as you go, but some aspects never catch up. Could I get a run button or even a back button? Where is a list of the cards or stars I've collected? I was missing one of each by the end of the game, and there's no way I want to retread the entire map with an online guide to figure out which 2 chests in the whole game I missed. Also, this would be so much better with actual controller support. It feels even more disconnected from old school games when I'm using arrow keys and the space bar. Overall, it's still fun to play, but I wish it could stand on its own a bit better.			"

												4/5 ☆Such a brilliant little game with a very nice concept. You progress from from the 'Ye Olde' times of 8-bit black and white 2D all the way through to modern 3D graphics in a beautiful fantasy world. A nice blend of different RPG formats and battle systems from top down hackin and slashin and going HYA TOA TEEUH HAAA as is the native tongue of all young heroic elven children of the land of Zelda, to turn based combat in the overworld akin to Final Fantasy, and even a bit of 'lootget' slash 'n bash similar to the likes of Diablo or your preferred poison pick of the dungeon crawler RPG category. On top of that, you have the freedom to explore, seeking out secrets and collect all sorts of collectables - it even has a card based minigame based on the Triple Triad card game from Final Fantasy 8.My one complaint is that it's a bit on the short side. I was able to finish the game and 100% all the achievements in one sitting which was a little disapointing. I didn't really want it to end, and I could see potential for things to keep going, bigger and better. But if you're looking for a good few hours to burn and reminisce of the olden days of vidja gaming, I highly recommend you give it a go.			"

												evoland is a good concept, and fun to play. essentially, it's like an amalgam of various action/adventure games of the past, from final fantasy to zelda, and even a good mix of diablo thrown in. puzzles aren't too tough to figure out, and the portions where you have to switch between 2d and 3d to solve some of them, were really a good twist.the downside of it all though, is that (understandably) the gameplay mechanics had to be simplified for it to work in the various modes ... thus making the experience a lot more shallow in some ways. this puts it in a position where one might dispute the value you get for the price you pay. of course, i can also understand the effort required to build some of these maps, as they have to come in different 'forms' and 'versions' of itself.perhaps for the nostalgia, perhaps for the comedic tribute to some of the old games, but regardless, evoland does hold good potential to be something unique. in the meantime, i guess i'd still lean towards giving this a thumbs up, if not for anything, more for the potential it holds. perhaps we'll see it evolve further in evoland2 then.

												This game is definitely worth playing if its on sale. Its a decent snapshot of the history of videogaming roughly from the late 80s to maybe the early 2000's. Its a fairly linear game where opening chests provide advances from one idea to the next. There's enough of a plot to hold things together and there are many advances that are clearly recognizable for those who have played games since the 90s. With that noted, I mentally set the bar lower when playing this game because I knew these things going in.  If you are looking for nostalgia then is great. If you're looking for cutting edge however, this might not be your type of game.			"

												Cute game,The evolution from low res black and white to 3D models with HD texture is a charming idea, but I feel like it plays out too quickly. The turn based combat sections are a nice idea, but with no Mana they're kind of a joke. Random encounters are also way too common, with some of the enemies having a stupidly high dodge rate (I've missed 5 times in a row). Some of the references and game types the game plays with are well done, I especially like the level in the grave yard.Worth the $2.50 I paid for it, having managed to squeeze 5 hours out of the game by collecting all the stars and cards, though a casual playthrough with no regard for collectables can easily be finished in 2 hours.If you're a fan of Final Fantasy, Dragon Quest, Zelda, and Diablo, then this game is worth a try.

I agree that once you finished ""evolving"" the current presentation, the rest of the game was much less interesting. Too bad. This was a very good ""first try"" at this approach. I would love to see the developers take the positive and negative reviews and really dig into a solid ""v1.0"" release. The current version feels like a really good proof-of-concept or demo, but as a full game the lack of depth and innovation and very shallow game play become too apparent during the last 1/4 or so of the game. It is so important to finish strong and unfortunately, after a lot of initial promise, this one does not.And yet, for $10 I recommend this ""game"", but only just.			"

												Evoland is a must-play for any fan of the RPG genre. It will take you on a trip through memory lane, reliving all of your favourite games, from Final Fantasy to Zelda. You start off as an 8-bit game, and will constantly find treasure chests that will evolve the game's mechanics and the world around you. It will remind you of some of the great things about those games, but is not hesitant to point out their flaws too. Of course, Evoland is not without its own flaws, but this is a parody made out of love for the genre. The nostalgia, the tongue-in-cheek approach and the ever-changing world will make this a joy to play for RPG-fans, and will surely give them a warm feeling inside.			"

												I found Evoland a fun game to play. The concept of making the “evolution” of video games an essential part of the game itself was well implemented, and I really liked the allusions to well known classics like Final Fantasy or Legend of Zelda. Although the battle system stays on a basic level, the boss fights are mostly a bit more of a challenge. Though my impression was definitely positive, I would recommend Evoland rather to people who can revel in this homage to the RPGs of “good old days”.  "

It feels more like a demo or pre-quel to something much larger and would be a great presentation demo for a bigger project. I found myself desperately wanting the game to continue evolving through more advanced-graphic RPGs, but it plateaued. I'm glad I got it on sale because while I like the game, it's not worth full price. Would not recommend paying more than a couple bucks for it.			"

												Evoland is, at its core, a game about games, and the ability to enjoy the game is based heavily on a player's ability to chuckle or even laugh out loud at each reference the game makes.  It is an action RPG/RPG that switches up its mechanics to illustrate a point, a simple and barebones fight engine in whatever form it takes, and it often pokes lighthearted fun at everything that came before and is happening now.  It starts in the black and white(ish) graphics of the old Gameboy, and each treasure chest, instead of giving you equipment or items, gives you a new feature, a game instance (such as a forced battle), a slight quip, and encouragement to continue on and exploring the world.  Or a star or card, of which the game has many; they're both linked to achievements, and after obtaining them all, it sort of made me think about all the random collections games have you do for very little reward, and I realized these were also part of the game poking fun at games.And it's all in fun.  References to the Legend of Zelda, Final Fantasy, Crystalis, Diablo and even Mario games abound, without having to be direct one-to-one examples.  More often they are not-so-subtle amalgams of the elements of those games.  And the shifting playstyles and new “Additions” to the game overall feel . . . right.  They work very well together.  This game being simple does not mean it is inferior.  However, one might feel that the battle systems are sometimes too . . . easy.  Almost like an RPG where you've leveled to 99 or a Zelda game after getting all the hearts, there is not a lot of difficulty to be found here.  But that is just as well, to me, as the game's not really about the difficulty, but where we've been.For a fun, simple romp through an interactive history of game mechanics, I say you can't really go wrong.  My only real reservation is that I don't actually feel that the game is “worth” $10; I would suggest getting it on a sale for at least 50% off.But other than that, the game is fun, provided you don't take yourself (or it) to seriously.

Within a few short minutes of starting the game up you will be blasted into a nostolgia heaven. Evoland comes from greats like the Legend of Zelda, Final Fantasy, Dragon Quest and so many more, that its witty humor will have you laughing and then crying from the laughter.  Though it will only lasts for a few hours the commitment of a few dollars to get the game will be passed over as well spent.

												With just shy of 2 hours under my belt, I'm already enjoying the heck out of Evoland. The game starts with 8-bit retro-Gameboy-spinach-green graphics and allowing you to only walk right. That's it.  And from that point on it's up to you to evolve through gaming history in terms of features, sound, graphics, and gaming styles to make your way. The game makes me think, 'what will the next unlockable be?' as I explore and find chests that could hold the next upgrade, whether it be a new feature, an upgrade in graphics, or sound. Heck, a recent one allowed me to break jars finally with my sword. You'll also be taken through various RPG battle styles, keeping things a bit more fresh when on one moment you're battle 8/16-bit Zelda style, and next you're doing random encounters and battle menus like Final Fantasy. If you're a RPG fan, or a gaming fan in general, do yourself a favor and give Evoland a shot.			"

												This game is so great and delivers in every way possible that it promises.  Basically it does deliver 'what it says on the tin', but I found great on just how well it delivered overall.  Starting off I wasn't sure what to think, but soo began to feel great playing this as the game advanced and opened up.I love the idea and how they incorperate so many RPG ideas into 1 game and do so with it still feeling fairly natural.  There are so many easter eggs that if you are a lover of the RPG genre, you will likely smile throughout the game.My only real area of improvement is I wish more was done - however this is the first of 2 so will class this as the ""pilot"" of the series.What else would I have liked to see?- More playable characters; it has a turn-based fighting style at certain points of the game, but unfortunately it falls a little short on this as there aren't many character to look forward to- More story; story was great while it lasted, however felt that due to the length of the game this started and ended pretty quickly- More secrets; it is a little game and has a few cool things, but found it pretty easy to run out of things to doThe above is really nit-picking; the game truely is great and if you enjoy things like Costume Quest, this definately fills a nice little place for those who was to have some fun.  At times the game could have been more challenging, however I feel it probably would have struggled to have balanced things and taken away the beauty of what this game is if they had.Really looking forward to playing the 2nd.

												Greetings, I just replayed this game and I must say that it is still an enjoyable experience.  In many ways this game feels more like a documentary of gaming history than a standalone game.  Regardless of that it is a lot of fun.Nostalgia:  This game pulls at the strings of not only the evolution of technology but also the evolution of RPGs.  The mechanics themselves may not be that original (or even at all, as I feel it is the intention) but they are done well and with precision.  This is one of few games that I won’t complain about precision of mechanics and controls as they are spot on.Old but New:  This game does an amazing job at presenting the various game designs of the games they tribute; the sound is solid and the graphics feel clean but within their genre.  I do wish there was more however as there is really only about 3-5 hours of play.A Story not told:  The story is more or less non-existent, the atmosphere is there and yes there is a story but you don’t really care and there isn’t much to follow; but to be honest, this isn’t an issue.  An amazingly deep story is not why you are here; you are here to relive your childhood or to at least appreciate the progression of RPGs.Overall, if you are a gamer you should get this game.  If you want to live through the history, get this game.  Really I feel this is a lesson in our history that every player should participate in, even if it is just done for learning and not for the gaming purpose.  Yes, you only get 5 hours about but it is short enough to hold your attention but long enough to demonstrate everything well.  Enjoy!			"

												Evoland is the story of video game development throughtout the years spun into a riveting game with quirky humor and satirical jabs at games like Diablo. If you've had a history of playing video games throughout your life, this game will give you bursts of nostalgia and happiness as you remember games like ""Link to the Past"" which nowadays comes off as technologically inferior. The game's success lies in the eyes of the player, because without that nostalgic feeling, it may not leave much of an impact. However, if you are looking for a fun game that's constantly changing and consistently entertaining, this is the game for you.8/10			"

I mean you can enjoy this Game pretty much, however most of this Game substance is pretty Basic to beign with. If you hear such i sentence, and i understand that, you may think: Why recommend it? Why Point it out as positive. Because in my Opinion this ""Experience"" is what this ""Game"" makes great and worth the Money. Its an Hommage and Trip to the good ol' days/classic Games which a lot of us grew up too and loved, also show the younger Audience a bit of Gaming-History, without force them too much in the classic Games. That's what this Game makes so Amazing. It may hardly have an replaybility, also is pretty short, and i won't argue with that; the only reason you may want to replay this, is to ""experience"" it again. However to see summarizing; how the Videohistory developed and evolute since back than was an pretty amazing tripp and i have to thanks the developer to give us this amazing experience.			"

However, what was at first a trip through nostalgia lane became a sad shadow of itself near the half way point of the game, where a lot of the elements, especially of the simple plot, became forced.

												This game wears out its welcome after the first fifteen minutes. It quickly jumps through the early eras of gaming, which was the only reason I bought the game, and then devolves into an insipid mishmash of poorly executed gameplay. To break it down, the game begins with a Zelda-stlye top down action game, which, while competently executed, lacks the aesthetic beauty, creativity, or excellent design which define excellent games like Link to the Past or Minish Cap. The visuals are uninspired, and the enemy design is limited to very few, extremely repetitive octorock clones and bats. There are one or two interesting boss fights, but it remains dull and uninteresting. After this you are hurled into a truly horrifically designed Final Fantasy clone. Lacking a mana system, it is utterly dull and a chore to grind through. Outdated principals like random encounters and a totally pointless item system makes this truly digusting. To make it worse, this takes up the majority of the games 5 or 6 hour lifespan, and the endgame is almost nothing but it. There are a few bright spots. Sort of clever Easter Eggs are hidden in a few spots, and the Diablo style level is both challenging and a scathing mockery of the goofy loot system in such games. Overall, however, the game is disappointing, uninspired, slapdash, and dull. There is no way in hell this thing is worth 10 dollars or your time. Heartily not recommended.			"

Overall Experience: 6.0/10Graphics: 8.0Storyline: 5.0Music/Sound: 7.5Game Mechanics: 5.0 My Personal Opinion: The game promises an experience where your game mechanics and graphics/music evolves throughout the history of RPG/Adventure gaming, and it delivers that with a good set of funny and enjoyable moments. Gaming references and easter eggs managed to pick some smiles and laughs here and there.It is capable of binding your attention for the first few hours, however, around mid-late game the overworld combat gets very repetitive and boring, since the game lacks a proper level up system and new skills. - Comments:The storyline is the very definition of clichè, but I think it was planned that way. The music is very nice, fits the situation nicely and does not affect your emotions.The mechanisms are nice, it showcases various upgrades reflecting the ones in gaming history, however it fails to specialize in any of them, making the game not as enjoyable as it could be.I recommend it if you fall into one of these categories:- you experienced the evolution of the games this one is based on - if you are a completist- if you are a patient person			"

												It's a really great game! many throw backs to games like the legend of zelda or final fantasy, it's a fun little game the only sad part is, is that it's really short. If the makers of this game would make another game like this or even just a game, I would definitly buy it!			"

												I bought this because it was on sale for like $3 and the concept looked interesting.  A story that follows the evolution of video gaming?Turns out what they meant was ""for the first 10 minutes find new textures for 3D models and then play a terrible Final Fantasy knockoff for four horus.""  Pass.			"

												I remember playing the Flash demo for this about a year or so ago and getting really excited for this. It seemed quirky, had a lot of the GOOD elements from the adventure games it was parodying and displaying, and the upgrade system was really cool. Someone already wrote a review saying it, but I'm saying it again just in case the message didn't get across: the first half is awesome. Although things like the left button and such are silly, it does a pretty decent job of taking you through the early days of video games step by step between the Adventure games like Zelda and the RPGs like Final Fantasy. However, this is cut short when you get to the part where you can finally jump into the third dimension. There's some awesome puzzles around this part where you have to go back and forth between dimensions, but any time you're on the overworld it becomes a slog of random encounters and you quickly see that along with the history of these games, the developer has left in some of the worst parts of them.It seems like to me that around the 3d stage of the game, the developer started to get lazy. The random encounters aren't balanced (or, if the point was to be just ""annoying"", the encounters aren't easy enough to shrug off since it will often pick a very unfair amount of enemies for your low level party that hasn't had a chance to buy healing items and the last save was FIFTEEN MINUTES AGO IN THE MIDDLE OF A DUNGEON ARRRGHHH) and it's at this point when the upgrades, which in the beginning are major graphical and audio and mechanics upgrades, start to just be ""Textures"" ""HD Textures"" ""Lighting"" ""DYNAMIC Lighting"". The last really cool area is to get the first part of an Amulet you need, but its followed up by the second part, which while being a very cool Diablo scenario, falls short by having it be a hack and slash fest with waves of enemies that are absolutely ridiculous- even by the standard of the game it's parodying. Maybe it's not really that hard, but the problem is that you're in a Diablo-esque combat setting with those clunky Zelda controls. And the boss is literally just hit and run, as compared to the first boss that actually had some strategy, and to add insult to injury you get items and fight a ton of stuff along the way that does NOTHING for you.When you get back into the overworld, all those monsters you fought didn't give you XP (just some gil) and the items you got were all joke items, one of them even telling you to just hit and run the boss. Not to mention, it's been probably a half hour to an hour, depending on how much you've died at this part, since the last time you saw a 2d location or gotten to do any of those sorts of puzzles.Its after this part shortly you get an airship and can travel freely around the world, and at this point I stopped. You can travel back to one of the first villages of the game and it just sort of... pops back into 2d mode. Even though it established a dimension travelling mechanic... all of a sudden it just pops you in. Maybe I have just too high expectations from the demo, but... this was just the pinnacle of laziness to me. Maybe this game can pass as a mini-history lesson about the games industry, but as anything else it falls flat on it's face and spits in the face of anyone who saw potential for this as an actual game.Last complaints: the game's buggy as hell. It has an option for a gamepad but won't actually detect it. It also never properly explains controls or let's you rebind stuff. There are a lot of times when you'll load up a save and not have some of the powerups you picked up beforehand. Like, I actually managed to walk past the random encounters chest because of a glitch, and I probably should have counted my blessings. And the UI leaves a LOT to be desired, especially in situations like the Diablo level where everything is just suddenly different (and then changes back to the original UI for certain areas when you return to them).Final verdict: I bought this game on sale, and it's barely worth that. I mostly wanted to help the developer because I remembered this seeming really cool, but I obviously should have read the reviews first. Hope this helps someone. Instead of buying a history lesson, just pick up one of those oldies and play it for yourself... or play one of the many other indie games that devote themselves to those mechanics and stick with it the whole way through to make an actual GAME.

												The A to Z of video game mechanics - you start off being able to move only to the right, and then as you progress through the game you unlock other features such as the move left key, up-down (2D movement), background music, colour, isometric view, and so on, all the way through to 3D models. About halfway through the game, all of these technologies are unlocked, on which point the game becomes a crazy pastiche of all sorts of RPG parodies and homages. (Even includes Diablo! But mostly Japanese RPGs.)I wouldn't say it is worth its full price, but it is definitely worth playing. It is very short - I finished the game and unlocked every achievement in one day - but it is also sweet. Buy it if it's on sale!			"

												Evoland is one of the many games I purchased on this Winter's Steam Sale. I never heard of it but by the 8bit graphics from the first and only screenshot I saw, it seemed worth the cheap price of that day and time. I only got around playing it now and by God was it fun!This game starts as the ""bittest"" of bit and progresses into some wonderful 3D graphics. By opening chest spread across the world you unlock new gameplay, new textures and new system and even turn-based combat made famous by games like Final Fantasy, which I never played yet have a feeling I will now.As you play you'll discover collectible stars that are just that, collectible, yet there's Double-Twin cards as well which can be used to play against an NPC in a very challeging but fun mini-game. Throughout the world, dungeons and villages, the chests you find will upgrade your combat system and nod to other games such as Legend of Zelda, Diablo and yet again, Final Fantasy. The turn-based combat and the characters are also nods to characters and system from other games.Bottom-line? Evoland reminds of DLC Quest with its upgradable graphics/sound/combat and its homage to great games makes it a nostalgic piece of history and a very enjoyable and fun game.			"

												Evoland is a unique game is every way, sane for its gameplay. Now, this might sound like a strange way to describe the game, but allow me to elaborate further.Evoland is a game wherein you start with a basic, black and white, 8-bit adventure game where you can only move right. While, like other Adventure games, you must unlock items to progress, you must also progress by unlocking game features. From features as banal as breaking pots, to as important as having a health bar, many gameplay elements which are nowadays considering traditional and mandatory, must be discovered.And this is why you WILL enjoy Evoland if you have a taste for nostalgia. The game is a clear salute to classics like Final Fantasy, Legend of Zelda, Monster Quest, and even Diablo. If you like any of those games, you'll notice at least half a dozen references and nods made to those games throughout the game. However, these are Duke Nukem style of references - heavy handed and not sly in the slightest.It's an interesting premise, and seeing the game evolve from original Gameboy graphics to a 3D cartoony style fitting for any modern indie game is rewarding in its own merit. As long as you're unlocking new things, you'll be having a blast, and chuckling when the game offers sarcastic or tongue-in-cheek humor at the expense of tropes common of old-school games.While this is all well and good, the ""combat"" is dull as a doornail. As stated earlier, the game takes inspiration from LoZ, Final Fantasy, and Diablo. There are three different ""combat"" systems that activate in specific areas, all of which are a copy of other game's combat systems, without the same depth or complexity.The Final Fantasy combat system doesn't have nearly as many party members, spells, options, or items. It doesn't even have an MP system, so you can spam spells as much as you want, making the game dreadfully easy.The LoZ combat system offers a sword that can only be swung (no charing, spinning, or anything fancy), unlimited bombs (though only one can be shot at a time), and arrows. The Diablo combat system has NO active abilities, no level ups, no meaningful looting (obsesive looting is treated as a joke in these sections, instead of as a gameplay mechanic) and not even a mana bar.These ""combat systems"" also suffer from two more fatal flaws. For one, you don't get to choose what combat system you use. If an area is a Diablo combat area, you can't run through the area again with the Final Fantasy combat system. Secondly, the game is just too easy. I only died once in the entire game, and that's simply because I didn't figure out the solution to the final boss fight before he killed me.Speaking of the final boss -- if you need a good story, don't get involved. The game is a nostalgia trip, and it plays old games having bad and cliche stories as a joke. With all the negatives aside, I will say this. Evoland is a unique, and genuinely funny experience. While the game's combat is dull, seeing what gameplay element you will unlock next pushes you through until the very end. If you need a good nostalgia hit for the days of the SNES and Genesis, look no further.			"

												So, first a caveat to this game, especially considering the words of some of the negative reviews.This is less a game and more a celebration of the earliest days of RPGs. Honestly, for most people, I think you have to hit the right age (not much younger than mid 20s or so) to really get what Evoland is all about. RPGs have evolved a lot in the past 15 years or so, and Evoland doesn't really touch too much of that. (I'd love a bigger and higher funded sequal that did though.)To those of us who grew up playing JRPGs on the NES and SNES, who played the original Zeldas, who killed so much time with the first Diablo... This game boils all those concepts down into its one step at a time pace. It was really well done, the unlocking of various graphical, sound, and gameplay features. It brought back a lot of memories and also helped really bring into focus the build up these games have had over the years.I think if you're into game development, it is especially a magnificent experience. To show you how things were played with, how they were built upon a step at a time to the modern games of today.As for the game itself, it's not going to be everyone's cup of tea. I certainly suggest not paying more than five dollars for the game, as well done as it is. It's about 5 hours worth of play time (I myself bought it and beat it in a single sitting, complete with every single achievement). And if you don't like the way that JRPGs used to be, then you might want to hold off completely. Yes, there are random encounters, and yes, the encounter rate is a bit extreme. As well, the combat is super complex, and there isn't much challenge until late in the game. But that's not really the point. Nor is the quick, standard story.It's a very hard concept to define. It's not pure nostalgia. And it's not really about gimmicky concepts. It's sort of understanding that there were and are limitations to this style of gameplay, and yet one can love it all the same. We DID love it all the same. Sure, it's frustrating in some ways, but we put up with it. We learned how it worked and we did it.I'm rambling, so I'll get to the point. It's a sale game, for sure. But for all those who put hundreds of hours into the various RPGs we had as we were growing up, I heavily suggest it. It's a nice little aside for a few hours.			"

												Evoland as the game says is the evolution of RPG through out time as you collect treasures to upgrade the game. The game borrows concepts, names, and music for games such as Legend of Zelda, Final Fantasy, and Diablo and smoothly combines it into a fun game. The only con is that the game as a RPG is very short, by short I mean seriously short, it'll take you about 4 hours to beat the game, thats including getting all the collectables and achievements in game.Overall I'd give it a respectable 4/5			"

												This game is just about perfect in content and length for RPG fans in our mid-thirties (plus or minus).  Bits and pieces of all the games we've loved packed into about 6 hours of gameplay - because that's all the time we have anymore, isn't it?  Of course along with the bits we loved come some bits that were kind of obnoxious, and there are a few lighthearted jabs at them.  The only real problems I can see with this game is that the frequency of overworld random encounters borders on the frustratingly high and the evolution of the game slows down considerably the farther along you progress.  It would have been nice to have paced the earlier evolutions a bit more slowly and had a bit more variety to the turn-based RPG combat, but it's still quite fun as it is and not a bad buy if you catch it on sale.

												I was really excited for this game, so I supported it on Greenlight and then bought it... and after getting through the first few ""upgrades"", just got incredibly frustrated with it. It would be way better if it knew what it wanted - as it stands, it just unsuccessfully combines elements from Zelda and Final Fantasy or other JRPGs, and in doing this, jumps from being very easy to being frustratingly difficult in just a few minutes. It's sad because the art style and the upgrades are done very well, but at a certain point, it just stops being engaging and gets boring and frustrating instead. I couldn't get myself to finish it.

												Evoland is a short charming journey down nostalgia road. The gameplay, graphics, and sound evolve as you progress but some areas play by different rules and sometimes you have to backtrack to an earlier video game era. It's sometimes cliche or annoying but that's the way things were so it's perfectly appropriate.I've never been very good at Zelda-style games but I managed with enough tries. Two criticisms: In 3D areas it can sometimes be hard to tell which trees you can and cannot pass between. Hidden passageways are generally really obscure and sometimes (in 3D mode) you can clearly see it's a solid wall but you can walk through it anyway.			"

												I liked this game. It was a cute game with a lot of references from the games I played as a child. I liked how it brought me back to the Final Fantasy game feeling but there are a lot of things that I think could have been better. For example, [spoilers ahead] you unlock a health bar but only for one region and it doesn't make sense. Why can't I have this health bar forever after that? All I get is these three ♥♥♥♥ing hearts? Really? Another example is the fact that the game introduces a turn base fighting mechanism and you put a lot of time in to buff up your character but in the final boss you don't even use it. Also you get this super move that you get at the almost end of the game but you can't use it during the final boss. What is up with that? It doesn't make sense.

Amazing gameplay, zelda-like feel, sometimes secret of mana-ish. Buy it when it's on sale though, as you won't be able to pull that many hours out of this. It's REALLY short.			"

												This game is...wonderful.  The graphics show an amazing progression from the early monochrome pixellated era to a type of quality we would see in 2007, all while providing an excellent sense of adventure and loads of tongue-in-cheek humour.  The game itself is a bit short, but, akin to life, it's more about the journey than the destination.  Even if the final boss theme is sick.  All in all, I would give it a 9.5/10.			"

												I wanted this game because it looked intriguing.  It is - it's clever, it's tongue in cheek, and it's outright teasing the subject around which it's built.  I look forward to each treasure chest, even when some of them make me groan, and even when the occassional gameplay makes me scream in frustration.  But it's worth it.  It's so worth it.  I keep saying I'll quit at the next save point, but I seem to forget that when I see the next one...			"

												This game is less of an homage to several adventure games and RPGs from the past and more a shoehorning of A Link to the Past into Final Fantasy VII with a few character names barely obscured.  Speaking of shoehorning, the plot goes from boilerplate JRPG to essentially ripping off the most major scenes from FFVII without context or emotion in the last hour.That said, it does add some of its own character through the ""evolution"" of the graphics, sound and gameplay; it's a naturally flowing romp through all your favorite visuals in the first half with a rather pleasing visceral effect on someone that grew up at the same time.Unfortunately, the second half is almost entirely everything about FFVII battles that were tedious; constant, irritating, overly showy, slow turn-based battles with literally the same 4 or 5 enemies for all but two short sections.Pros: - Smooth gameplay - Amusing ""upgrade"" system for the graphics, sound, UI, and character gameplay - High on nostalgia if you're into thatCons: - Far, far too short (6 hours for me) - Gameplay padded by irritating, repetitive battles with the same enemies (fewer than 20 in game) - Not at all challenging, other than collection side questsVerdict:I don't feel cheated at the $2.50 price point I paid during a Steam sale.  I would have at the $10 regular price.  If you want a short trip down memory lane, you could do worse than Evoland; just wait until it goes on sale.			"

												Do you like RPGs?  Do you enjoy irony, wit and win?  Try Evoland.I'm not sure which wall Evoland breaks when the game has you unlock gaming elements but it makes for an outstanding experience.    Players start with Gameboy-like graphics and a serious lack of options.  Both can be remedied by bumping into chests that unlock things like 16-bit graphics (which improve!) and save points.  Some more recognizable RPG elements included are FF6, Diablo, Ocarina of Time as well as similar game mechanics.  I would like the game more if any mechanic you unlocked stayed available throughout.  One early dungeon can be frustrating due to the inability to use healing potions or companion characters even if both are unlocked.Thankfully the game does not include 16-character ""save codes"" ala Metroid or Goonies II.  Some RPG elements should stay buried.9/10 for creativity7/10 for inconsistent game mechanics			"

												Jumping into Evoland I was expecting an experience very similar to 3D Dot Game Heroes, in the sense that we'd get a nice mirroring of many of our favourite nostalgic action/adventure/RPG's in a love letter to the aesthetic, gameplay and difficulty. However, going into this game I also didn't take into account that this was a mobile port so it managed to deliver about half those hopes at least.The gameplay for this game may start off (and arguably continue to be) clunky however it's extremely clever how not only the tutorial but the actual gameplay mechanics unfold. As you progress through the evolution of these genres instead of collecting weapons, armour, or loot, you collect visual elements and gameplay mechanics to progress through the decades.They do also have a cute story to accompany these elements, although not very prominent its a simple enough formula to just drop in reference after reference from all sorts of franchises from our childhoods such as (but not solely) Zelda, Final Fantasy, Pokemon, etc.I only really have two complaints with the game. It's simply too short, and there's so many other games that they could've paid tribute to especially in other genres that would've complimented the progression they created. Some may say that's asking for too much from a mobile port though, I wouldn't entirely disagree but only because the state of the mobile game industry is so abysmal right now.However with the sequel that was recently released it seems like they've fixed both of those complaints, however I'll have to get back to you on how I liked once I make it through the metric tonnes of games coming out lately.Overall though if you've played anything with weapons, armor or magic in between the 2 and 64 bit eras, you will want to see this game through to the end.

The game itself looks great with the various uses of different graphic styles. The gameplay is simple and the story is cliched. Its short, and no longer than it needs to be considering its price.

Fairly short, right around 3 hours give or take, not really perfect by any means, but definitely one to check out. 3 different styles of gameplay, Zelda-like action adventure, Final Fantasy-like turn based, and Diablo-like action RPG. Tons of classic references throughout the game, and quite enjoyable for a 1 time play through for me. Don't think I will play it again, not even to get all the stars and cards (of which I honestly had no desire to play the card game and never did,) but all in all I'd give it a solid 7 out of 10.			"

												Simple, but still fun.The game itself plays like five different games all merged together under one roof.  And honestly, each of those ""games"" by itself would be lacking.  Each section is simple, or even watered-down from you would get from such a title normally.  Overall, the gameplay is always shallow.  But instead of giving deep gameplay, it gives you a lot of gameplay variety.It never feels like it is trying to be challenging.  You can walk through the game without much fluster, and it won't be very demanding on your time.But the only reason these factors really seem to be present is because the game pulls in so many references and ideas from games that are demanding to our time or to our thinking.  It looks, sounds, and plays superficially just like a number of games that have deep and engaging gameplay, so if you are one of the long-time fans this game was made for, it isn't hard to notice that this game doesn't match the same depth and complexity of the games it reminds us of.But just when you reach the point where you can see that it isn't offering much, the game changes into something new and it feels like you're playing a whole new game.  It never stays on anything for too long, so it's always got something fresh to offer you.It's not revolutionary, it's not going to replace the games we grew up with.  It's just a simple homage.Even so, it still is fun.  It never makes a blunder where it reaches beyond itself.  It never even gets stale or boring.In the end, it's not great, but not bad.			"

												Evoland follows a fantastic idea that a lot of players and developers had had but that is seldom actually implemented, a game where not only the player and their avatar advance through a virtual world but also the game and bespoken world develop as you go along. Mechanically I'd describe the development as roughly going from Mystic Quest on the Gameboy to Final Fantasy VII - there are developments in other directions as well.+ Good music+ Okay story+ Interesting and well implemented idea+ Mostly good controls0 Rather shortThere is not a lot to be said about Evoland. It features good music developing, together with graphics, through some generations of technology. The controls are good, except for some degradation at the end, when suddenly you need to turn before attacking in order to attack in the direction of a monster as opposed to the direction of your previous movement.It's nice, that I had to figure out how to beat the final boss.It seems the developers wanted to recreate some of the stronger and not exclusively positive impressions we collected over the years. That's how I rationalise artificial loading times and the piece of the game where you're basically required to grind for some time.I think, it's due to the Ludum Dare 48h Challenge that concepts are somewhat fast-changing and that the game is overall pretty short. Nevertheless, at least the Steam version of the game - I don't know the LD version - is well-implemented and provides some hours of fun (not counting the short grinding phase)I easily recommend Evoland, especially to players of the games close in style to those games mentioned above. I'm looking forward to playing the sequel and owe thanks to Ludum Dare for bringing about the creation of games like this one.			"

												Sick of cheap flash games that copy games such as Zelda? Well I certainly am. Now, young people/those who don't have any interest in such games don't be put off by what I just said. This game has some fantastic ideas, that in my opinion were executed quite well. From 2D side scrolling to 3D combat (not spoling anything) this game really catches your eye at every turn. If you like a bit of nostalgia, or just love interesting games, then I would very much recommend this. Ok yes, sometimes it can be monotanous if you aren't very good at such games (Or just rusty in my case) due to rare autosaves, but it's an issue that didn't affect me. And with an almost puzzle sense thanks to hidden chests, you really do explore the detailed interesting levels.

												Evoland takes a fantastic concept, the evolution of the action RPG, and plays it out with mixed results. The game begins in very simplistic 2D, but soon begins to play very similarly to the original top-down Legend of Zelda games (think Link's Awakening). After more time, the game progresses into full-blown 3D, more akin to PS1/PS2 Final Fantasy games, and even further onward to open exploration, like Diablo. There's all sorts of collectibles and monster encounters as you'd come to expect, and the package is hilarious and represents its source material very well.However, the game isn't without its faults. The transition to 2D to 3D is somewhat rough, and the game starts to lose a bit of polish there. Also, at all points in the game, hit detection can act oddly, leading to your character taking hits due to some wonky hitboxes, or in some cases, pushing your character through walls in a dungeon, leading you unable to continue without restarting. These problems are obviously very annoying, and make the experience worse overall.Would I recommend the game, given the balance of positives (nostalgic value, good design) and negatives (bad hit detection, suspect 3D game mode execution)? Yeah, but not at full price. The game is great for what it is, but it's short (the game takes 2-3 hours, maybe 4 if you are trying to collect everything), and the bugs can be very frustrating. Therefore, if you're interested in things like Zelda and Final Fantasy, be sure to give Evoland a look - if you can catch it for a large discount in a sale.			"

												Evoland is probably one of the coolest ideas for a game I've seen.  When I first looked into this game however I was hit with tons of poor reviews on it, so I was hesitant to buy it.  This year's humblebundle sale had it really cheap though so I jumped in.  Evoland takes RPGs from early to recent and rolls them all into 1  crazy game.  Whenever you open a chest you never know what is going to happen.  Final Fantasy, Zelda, Diablo etc. are all referenced in this game, and generally in very humorous ways.  However it is not all good.  Though fantastic the game is rather short.  It can be beaten in about 1-5 hours, and several of the ""evolutions"" of the game come at you all at once so you go from NES level up to Final Fantasy 7 level pretty quick.   Also the game is known for being buggy.  I got stuck in a bug that left the game unplayable, by setting the airship down right next a forest that could not be exited from that side.PROsFantastic ideaVariety of graphics and gameplay updates throughoutOften hilarious upgrade notes and itemsSolid gameplay mechanics and combatCONsShort gameCan be very buggyLacks any kind of deep plotVery few sidequestsSimple item, magic and combat system leave little room for strategies.Overall I think this game is very much worth a play through at the right price.  I am very much looking forward to Evoland 2 and hope for a longer, more in depth story, with no game breaking bugs.			"

												Fun game that pays tributes to past games.  Evoland is true to its name and evolves.  It is easy to see some of the obvious tributes to games like final fantasy and zelda but there are also several inside jokes.  The only down side to the game is its lack of depth, which is to be expected for this type of game at the price point.  The game is short and while there are a few side quests to be done such as collecting stars or cards for the game, even these do not add a great deal of length.I would recomend this game to anyone who programs games, or anyone looking for a nostalgic trip of previous games.I would not recomend this game to anyone searching for a in depth, long game, or serious gaming experience.

												Evoland is cute and quick. It leans heavily on the fourth wall with lots of jokes and allusions, which is easily the strongest part of the game. The gameplay is simple, possibly to a fault. The turned based combat gets old quick, but the realtime stuff is pretty engaging, and you never get bogged down in maddeningly difficult challenges.Short, simple and tongue in cheek.			"

												The game assigns you puzzles assuming you've played both the Final Fantasy and Zelda series, but if, like me, you never liked Zelda, you will quickly tire of the extended timing- and reflex-based battles.  Bought this in the Summer 2015 sale and I'm not really sure I got my money's worth - less than 2 hours in, I'm stuck on a boss battle that I have no idea how to defeat, and no interest in running multiple times to figure out.Save points are too far between - I understand that the idea is to progress through the history of console RPGs, but mimicing one of the most panned and unnecessary characteristics seems rather sadistic on the part of the developer.  It's just poor design to stump you on a boss battle and then make you jump through hoops just to get back to that battle.  That exact combination is why I'm moving on to another game, and the extent of my remaining use of this game will be to run it at the title screen while I watch TV to collect the cards (if and only if I am ineligible for a refund).

												To make a long story short, Evoland is a hands-down thumbs-up fingers-crossed interactive documentary about the early history of the action adventure game genre. The game intentionally starts out lame and progressively improves in gameplay and graphics the further you press on, giving players a history of how action adventure started from side-scrollers to top-down hack-and-slash to turn-based action to puzzler to tactical turn-based combat to horde hack-and-slash.Veteran gamers might not get much more than a nostalgia-induced parody, but this is a good introduction for kids to the world of retro action adventure games.

												I only bought this game today, and have played it less than an hour, but I AM LOVING IT! I can hardly keep myself away. It is a great nod to the roots of gaming, and very interesting portrail of the develpment, but on top of all that it is very fun to play. I'd reccomend this to any gamer, especially those who have their own roots in what are now 'retro' or 'classic' games.It has a great mix of Styles and Genres, and if there are elements or aspects you don't like, keep playing and most likely they will change as you progress.Edit: Now I'm a few hours in, loving it even more than before. The story line has really developed a lot more at this stage of the game, and this is a MUST PLAY for any Final Fantasy fans (lots of refrences)Edit 2: Finished the game, it is only short, but it was amazing. I still havn't 100% it yet, and I plan to. Then possible replay it... So I most definatly reccomend you giving this game a shot			"

												Feeling nostalgic? This new game feels like an old friend as it walks through different stages of game technology and progresses as you move through the story. Graphically, some areas maintain a SNES-like appearance, while others move into textured, but cartoonish 3D. The overall story is simple, though it resembles a Legend of Zelda game, to which Evoland pays homage. It's doesn't take long to push through the entire game, and even though it has some tricky sections, it's not frustratingly difficult. Achievements are achievable, and some might have you scratching your head without the aid of a walkthrough. There are multiple types of battles (turn-based and real time.) Boss battles are a mix of skill and strategy, and the game plays easily on a laptop keyboard. If you're looking for a fun, but new walk through memory lane, Evoland is woth a download.			"

												This game is a great homage to rgs over the years.  It is a very original idea, and very enjoyable to play.  I couldn't wait to see the next rpg element I was going to unlock.  Big inspiration from Zelda, Final Fantasy, and a few others.  Overall, the game is not very challenging, but it never stopped me from continuing onward to see what was next.  I would love to see a sequel with more characters, towns, abilities, and overall length.  Highly reccomended to all rpg fans! "

												I couldn't finish this game, despite getting to the final stage of the last boss.It just didn't seem worth it as I ran, avoiding magic blasts up the wazoo. Everything that made me want to buy this game happened several hours ago and hasn't resurfaced since.I loved it at first, as the game gradually ""evolved"" right there in front of me, but the minute it got into 3D, the game just seemed to stop caring. It mixed genres that have nothing to do with each other, besides association with high fantasy, and most of what you encountered from that point on was just a reference to a better series.The Zelda Dungeons had inexplicably hard enemies and you were stuck with 3 heart containers all the way. The Diablo dungeons just bombarded you with those same enemies. and the Final Fantasy style turn-based stuff was simplified more than the original Final Fantasy itself, which was baffling.The most intelligent aspect of the game was the time travel mechanic, which worked well as a streamlined Link to the Past Dark World mechanic, but it was very short lived and again, not enough heart containers and once you die, it's back to the main menu and boy, I hope you found a save point somewhere along the wa-...oh...I can't deal with this anymore. This was not the game promised.Or it was, for about ten minutes.			"

												Where do I start with reviewing this game.. Evoland; The game that must had been inspired by Final Fantasy cause Choboko's are pretty similar to Chokobo's don't you think? Don't let that deter you though as the game is actually quite charming, and addictive. When I picked up the game I was almost immediately invested in the progress of the game as you literally play to continue evolving the environment you explore. I've never played Final Fantasy, but If it's turn based combat system is anything like Evoland (Call it a hunch, but I'm pretty certain it's a carbon copy) It's very fun, and refreshing from most A-List games I've been playing lately. The only con I truly have with this game is the pain of back tracking to find the one star, and double twin card to get two of my last three achievements before 100% the game. In conclusion if you can find this game for anywhere between $1.00 - $3.00; I would highly recommend you give it a shot!6.5/10			"

												Evoland is very enjoyable when played as trip down memory lane, reminding you how much you loved/hated parts of the games that inspired this one. Even if you've never played some of the iconic references, Evoland is a pretty and casual introduction to RPGs as it switches smoothly between the aesthetics and gameplay types.I was thoroughily amused with the nostalgia and if you're like me - an explorer at heart - collectables and achievements will come as you progress through the story.

												Amusing Parody, but not much of a game.While the concept is interesting, the game it self is hardly worth playing. The First Hour or so is quite entertaining, but then  the random encounters on the worldmap that need to be fought out FF style get really annoying. I personally didn't mind the fact that it is ridiculously easy, but spending 2 minutes just spamming the most basic attack is simply boring - if your requested to do so every 5 steps on the worldmap.The game itself poses not much of a challenge, for the most complex strategy just involves dodging enemies in Zelda mode and cast Heal every other turn in FF mode. There are some dungeons that need to be explored and those aswell are nothing difficult, but at least there is no ""activate this switch, go all the way back to activate that switch""-stuff happening.In the end, it feels more like a lengthy Video on gaming history rather than a game itself, but it's cutely made, so if you got a bit of time and lots of patience, you might as well give it a try.

												So I just beaten Evoland today. It was okay. That's it. I would write a review, but there is no option for 'Meh...'. Personally where I think this game could improve is if it had more of an identity. Almost anything interesting about this game is taken directly out of another. Paying homage to a game is fine, but I think Evoland takes it a bit too far. Why make something original when you can just say 'Hey! Remember this thing guys!'. If they made their own story and characters to it, I would adore it, because finding chests to literally upgrade the entire game in little ways is one of the most unique things I've ever seen in an rpg. It made me excited to see what the next chest would hold (unless it was just a star of course). It's not great, but also not terrible. A bit more of a challenge would be nice, I bought a couple Phoenix Downs but only used them during a fight where, I didn't know this at the time, I was actually supposed to lose.Personally I wouldn't recommend this just for the sake that there are better games available for the same price.

												This game is spectacular!! I started playing it at 2pm today it is now 8pm and i cant get enough of it. It is a nostalgic adventure through the history of action RPGs. This game is sure to delight anyone who has ever played a game in the genre and newcomers alike! No grinding is involved of any sort and the game is actually a fast paced adventure. The story is lacking but that is due to the short time-frame of the title and because it starts off as a original zelda-like adventure. Through progression of the game more elements of a story start to arise and it is beautiful to watch the game mechanics unfold. I found myself excited to unlock each new chest and see how it would evolve the gameplay mechanics along with an achievement with either a quarky jab at old school games or a bit of history. Highly recommended.			"

												Evoland is an interesting game, not for its look, but for its gameplay.Much like the game ""Life of Pixel"", this game centers around evolving through different eras of video games. Unlike ""Life of Pixel"", this game is more Legend of Zelda/Final Fantasy/WoW in its RPG approach of gameplay (while LoP focuses on the aesthetic of specific video game consoles from the 70s-90s using platforming mechanics). Both games are great for nostalgia factor alone.If there are any nitpicks, I was a little disappointed in how sparse the story felt, but I didn't let that keep me from enjoying the exploring. I didn't care about the villain, but I did care about the environment and the exploration.When the game was first released, it was a little buggy, and some of the bosses' hitboxes didn't trigger, which made beating the game frustrating, but I am pretty sure that was resolved since I 100% this game a few months after. The act of collecting cards and playing a variation of FFVIII's Triple Triad card game is enough to get this. If not, then appreciate all the nods to your favorite retro games of yesteryear. No matter how you look at it, Evoland is a fun game. Give it a go, then brace yourselves for Evoland II, because it looks like everything the first game is, but better. "

Extremely Exciting Evolutionary Expedition! Enjoy Evoland!Evoland is by far one of the most unique games I've ever had the pleasure to play. It takes heavy inspiration from the Zelda and Final Fantasy series of games, among others, but introduces a very creative twist. As you progress through your awesome adventure, you frequently find charitable chests that ultimately upgrade the grand game itself with new technologies and gameplay mechanics. You start out in a limited monochrome environment, only able to move to the right, and eventually move to full-blown 3D. Don't think you'll stay there the entire time though!As if that wasn't enough, the game is positively packed with plenty pretty pleasing parodies that promise to put prospective players in a state of near nonstop nostalgic bliss, especially when combined with the upgrades. Those more aware of the evolotuion of video games will be totally tickled at all the really retro references revealed~One of the most impressive aspects of this game is its origins as the August 2012 Ludum Dare winner. For those unaware, the Ludum Dare competition is one that provides particularly passionate participating programmers the perplexing puzzle of promptly producing a potential playable prototype- er, game, in 48 hours. There are no prizes, but as anyone can plainly see, they can inspire impressive innovations like this~			"

												Definitely worth picking up. Touches back to Zelda style hack and slash, to Final Fantasy turn base, and then even a bit of Diablo's style of hack and slash (1 cave). I'd say most of the game is Final Fantasy style and the rest is Zelda style. You can expect 3-5 hours of gameplay, leaning on the longer side if you are going for 100% completion. There are reference's to the popular games like Zelda and FF that are more amusing if you've played those games. I would say my only complaint with the game is the turn base battles occur very very often. On the world map you can expect combat after walking every 5-7 tiles. Although the map isnt very big, exploring causes battle spawn rate to be somewhat annoying after a little bit. The levels your characters gain in the turn base combat do not seem to help much. I had hit level 15 by the end of the game and some of the monsters still required two hits to kill. Everything else was very enjoyable!			"

												This was an interesting concept for a game, being a long time fan of RPG's and having enjoyed the early ones for the 8 bit era this game was a good trip down memory lane.  But that's really the only reason to buy this game, there a just a couple of characters and the story is about as generic as it could possibly be, all in all I think it was only a few hours to complete.  However I think the game was designed to really just parody various RPG's, and it does that very well.  The way you unlock extra effects, graphics, sounds, equipment, and combat styles is well done, and by the end of the game you've had a chance to play a small part of several games.  There are plenty of small nods to various games and I enjoyed that.			"

Orginally you are transported back to block graphics and zelda like live action with a focus on hidden areas in the map area, then you are brough into a very pretty pre-rendered final fantasy era with bueatiful soundtrack to match it. If only the game was longer... still, it's a great trip down nostalgia lane, invoking some very good memories.			"

												A great and original game, full of references and jokes about previous RPG titles. Imagine it as an evolution fo all zelda games. If you like those, you will love this game. Feels a bit like the anniversary Zelda game tbh, but much more comedy orientated.Definitely a lot of fun. Buy it, especially now that its reduced to 1.74£Okay, I checked out reviews a bit and let me say this: Obviously this isnt your traditional game. This game is heavily nostalgia comedy orientated. Its supposed to be a parody of all those other RPG games. Apparently some people dont get that and say that it doesnt have a story and whatnot. well obviously it doesn't. its a parody. it has a generic story made to ridicule the RPG stories which were all ridiculously similar.If you dont want to laugh and are looking for an ACTUAL RPG game, this isnt the thing youre looking for. If you wanmt to have fun and reminisce your younger years with a laugh, this is the game for you.This isn't a long game, but it isn't supposed to be (in fact if you look at teh undertitle it is written the ""short story of...""I do find that it is a shame that they give a lot of the unlocks too early on...To pace them throughout the story would have been better.

												i will be honest, i feel dissapointed in this game, altho it has some fun references ans is a good history lesson through iconic games of the genre, the first 20 mintues of gameplay you get almost all of the upgrades for the game, meaning that you dont actually get to enjoy every chapter of the game, (implying that there are chapter)the replay value of the game is next to none; the secrets and sidequests are short and easy overallthe leveling and currency are lousy and boring (every enemy gives 50 glis, yeah, GLIS) and leveling up is not really necesary to advance, and even tho this is not a bad thing, it gives the feeling of uselessness in the leveling up systemthe game is INCREDIBLY short and i can't say it enough, i made it through the entire game in 2-3 hours.... and for a 10 dollar game that is underwhelmingoverall, the game is not bad, is short and kinda boring, its interesting to go around leveling up the world and stuff, but you dont get to enjoy every aspect of it... this game need some love (and this is a comment for the developers who made this game) this game has a LOT of potential and i mean a LOT, but you need to let us enjoy that potencial, the game is so fast and short that we dont have the chance to enjoy itmake chapters for every era, more boss fights more characters and commands, just let us enjoy the game the way it is depicted in the trailer!to sum it up, i think this game is not worth ten dollars ... 5 at the top and im being generous i expected more and got dissapointed, still an experience to play ... if you want a rich experience in rpg like games, look somewhere else, if you want a kindof fun game with lit of quick historic content this is your game			"

												This is a tough one. During the brief period of time when I could play this game, I enjoyed it.There's a ""but"" here: the game claims to suppport Linux. This is a good thing. Unfortunately, Linux support is all but nonexistent.Of course, your mileage may vary. CHECK THE FORUMS.However, based on the slipshod ""support"" they've given in order to cash in on Linux gamers, I can't recommend this game in good conscience.			"

												An interesting and funny mix of Legend of Zelda, Final Fantasy and a couple of other games, sending you through the technical and playing evolution of video games from the 80s to nowadays. Features a couple of interesting side-quests aside of the (sadly short) main story. Worth the money.			"

												A remarkable exploration of the development of game mechanics & visual styles through gaming history. Evoland starts with little more than could be expected of a Classic 8bit Role Playing / Adventure Game later exploring more complex elements of design with comfortable development from Zelda-Style hack top-down combat to turn based combat much in the style of JRPG's of the Playstation 1 era, and later developing into a Diablo-esque hack 'n' slash.The narrative is mostly superfluous so if you're in search of a gripping story you're out of luck. What the game lacks in depth it more than makes up for in the unique charecter of the gameplay in the use of graphical and gameplay advances as player rewards.Some may find game length to be an issue and having completed it in under 5 hours I'd be inclined to feel the same, with only 5 hours of content I was left wanting more, the itteration of mechanics was rewarding enough to foster a continuation of the gaming session and as a result I completed it in only two sessions. One thing I must mention, and consiquentally penalise the final score for, is the abrubt ending so soon after a new transport mechanic is introduced, my personal reccomendation would have been to use development time expeded on the CCG minigame to expand the scope to include at a minimum an additional populated town with it's associated side-quests for an addtional hour of content.7.5/10			"

The gameplay is very basic, paying respects to RPGs of various play styles. The evolution happens more in the beginning and by the time you start getting FF7 graphics, you keep asking for more progression, but it never seems to come. Worth the couple of hours to enjoy a mashup of RPGs in one.			"

												Loved it! You start out as monochrome and slowly ""update"" into fully 3D. Lots of Final Fantasy and Zelda referrences, as well as a few Diablo ones (for a level at least). They keep it simple in terms of puzzle mechanics and boss mechanics, leaving room to revisit lots of mechanics and gimicks from the older RPGs. Gearing isnt important and the game focuses more on the story and upgrading into 3D.Only complaint I have is how short the game is. Only took me about 5 hours to reach the final boss (which is the first boss in YEARs that I just cant beat. Hats off to the people that can down him, or have).			"

												It's DLC Quest done much more correctly. It's somewhat impressive that they managed to fit these various different styles and graphical modes into a 106 MB game, but it's all rather skin deep. When you try to find depth in anything that isn't the Zelda sections, you come up empty handed. The premise is amazing, but it was poorly executed and lackluster. The action sections are nothing to write home about, it's Legend of Zelda in 2D and 3D, save for the Diablo ruins, which while fun and allows you to actually use your second character, is sadly locked to that one location. If the final boss were allowed to be done in that style, I would have been much happier... more so if I could have turn based him. That is the real deal breaker for me: the turn based combat turned out to be incredibly shallow, and ultimately, pointless. There is exactly one boss which is dispatched via turn based, after that, everything else is done in action RPG sections. Glis is only ever useful in buying the tiny handful of items needed for achievements, your level in turn based does not give you more hearts or allow you to better tank damage in the action sections. Worse, you have no access to your ability to heal (either by the potions you never use in turn base or the spell) or second character in the action sections, rendering them pointless for the majority of the game.Yes, you can get an extra heart for the action sections via the turn based battles, but that's far too little to justify its existence, especially since all it really does is make the final boss easier.I have to, almost grudgingly, give Evoland a negative vote. I hope the lessons learned here will allow for the second game to offer more substance in its play modes.			"

												So I just beaten Evoland today. It was okay. That's it. I would write a review, but there is no option for 'Meh...'. Personally where I think this game could improve is if it had more of an identity. Almost anything interesting about this game is taken directly out of another. Paying homage to a game is fine, but I think Evoland takes it a bit too far. Why make something original when you can just say 'Hey! Remember this thing guys!'. If they made their own story and characters to it, I would adore it, because finding chests to literally upgrade the entire game in little ways is one of the most unique things I've ever seen in an rpg. It made me excited to see what the next chest would hold (unless it was just a star of course). It's not great, but also not terrible. A bit more of a challenge would be nice, I bought a couple Phoenix Downs but only used them during a fight where, I didn't know this at the time, I was actually supposed to lose.Personally I wouldn't recommend this just for the sake that there are better games available for the same price.

												Buy this game if: you want a trip down nostalgia-lane.  This game brought back a lot of good gaming memories for me, from 8-bit side scrollers (a la the original Legend of Zelda) to more recent RPG romps like Final Fantasy 8,  Skip this game if: you want an experience that will last longer than 10 hours (I completed 97% of the game in about 8 hours with minimal usage of a guide), if you can't get the game on sale, if you are looking for a particularly hard game (the only thing I had to retry more than once was the final battle) or if you can't abide by the fact that the game is, ""openly inspired,"" by (i.e. rips off) other titles, such as the card battling mechanic which Evoland clearly stole from Final Fantasy 8 or the user interface it stole from 2D Legend of Zelda.  ---Extended thoughts:Though switching from 16-bit to 3D graphics was novel, it was underutilized in the game.  Moreover, though the game tried to parody many popular franchises (e.g. trash items in Diablo or forced encounters in most RPGs), it never really got past, ""remember how annoying this mechanic was?  Me too!""  I found the characters and dialogue to be underdeveloped; after hearing the villian's backstory, I found them to be the most interesting character in the game.  The camera felt a bit claustrophic for me in the 3D sections; I would have liked to see an option to pull it away from the character, even a little.  Also, I know I mentioned this game was on the easy side, but most of the puzzles in the game involved exploring every inch of a given area rather than any critical thinking or problem solving; the only exception to this was the card battling (though even that could be made considerably easier with the right cards).  Lastly, I was disappointed with how the game treated its primary female protagonist (though I will not say more to avoid spoilers).With that being said, I did complete the game and gather all of the collectables.  At the end of the day, the core gameplay was enjoyable enough that it carried me through despite my critiques.  It also doesn't hurt that I was able to pick up the game for $1.99 from the Humble Bundle sale last week.  If I would have paid full price for the game ($9.99), I would have felt a bit cheated, honestly.			"

												This is a really cool 1-2 hour game stretched beyond its means to 3-4 hours. Like, nearly every dungeon winds up being just a bit longer than the point where you started to get bored. This would be less of an issue if the mechanics where fleshed out just a bit beyond the 'this gameplay mechanic is a reference to X' to something that was at least a little engaging.Good example - there are turn based battles, but your characters only ever have 1-2 abilities... that's fine if you're doing like 4-5 battles and then you're done with that whole thing but when you're wandering the overworld looking for the next objectives and you're hitting a random encounter every 5-10 steps... it gets old.The first hour or so is actually really strong and really delivers on the premise (and I would recommend it for that when its available on sale), and when you're just navigating mazes/dungeons there is some good puzzle design, but the back half gets way to sloggy for its own good.

Every new area will say ""Remember random encounters? Didn't they SUCK? Remember forced Grinding? Didn't that SUCK? Now go do it a lot."" As a result you get the worst bits of old JRPGs with all the fun stripped right out.The pixel art is gorgeous, though, got to give it that.			"

												I wouldn't get this unless it's on sale.Basically, it wants to be a love letter to Legend of Zelda, Diablo, and Final Fantasy, and there are parts of the game that ape all three.The Diablo part I can't speak for, because I've never played Diablo.The Final Fantasy parts are, frankly, bad. There's no real story here, just a small handful of jokey lines to remind you of plot points for Final Fantasy 7 and Secret of Mana, so right away this game is missing the main draw of jRPGs of that era, but it DOES pack in all the tedium of those games, including high random encounter rates and long, non-tactical fights which you win by just selecting the fight command a dozen times and watching the same canned animations over and over again.The Zelda parts fare better, and have one of the only interesting uses of the gimmick of moving forward through video game history: There are stones that block your path in 2d mode, but in 3d mode you realize that they're just 2d textures and you can walk over them. The puzzles in these sections aren't mindblowing but they're okay, and the bosses are tough but beatable. The Zelda parts are clearly where the majority of the development time went.A big problem is that nothing comes to a head; techniques and powers from one section don't cross over into other sections, and, because the different sections are all mixed together on the overworld, there's no way of knowing when you're completely done with one kind of section. I bought a bunch of potions for the final boss fight, but it turns out the boss fight is a Zelda section, so the potions were useless, because they only work in Final Fantasy sections. You'd think the boss would be a culmination of everything you've done, but nope, it's just a Zelda boss.$9.99 is too much for this game, it's just not polished enough. If you think you might like it and it's on sale dirt cheap you'll probably get something out of it, but if you're looking for a love letter to console RPGs you should get Half-Minute Hero instead.

												Evoland is an interesting game, not for its look, but for its gameplay.Much like the game ""Life of Pixel"", this game centers around evolving through different eras of video games. Unlike ""Life of Pixel"", this game is more Legend of Zelda/Final Fantasy/WoW in its RPG approach of gameplay (while LoP focuses on the aesthetic of specific video game consoles from the 70s-90s using platforming mechanics). Both games are great for nostalgia factor alone.If there are any nitpicks, I was a little disappointed in how sparse the story felt, but I didn't let that keep me from enjoying the exploring. I didn't care about the villain, but I did care about the environment and the exploration.When the game was first released, it was a little buggy, and some of the bosses' hitboxes didn't trigger, which made beating the game frustrating, but I am pretty sure that was resolved since I 100% this game a few months after. The act of collecting cards and playing a variation of FFVIII's Triple Triad card game is enough to get this. If not, then appreciate all the nods to your favorite retro games of yesteryear. No matter how you look at it, Evoland is a fun game. Give it a go, then brace yourselves for Evoland II, because it looks like everything the first game is, but better. "

With this game you don't only upgrade your weapons and armor from treasure chests, you also upgrade the graphics, the audio, the controls, etc.  The game is hard enough to provide a challenge, but not so hard to be frustrating.  The story line isn't very original (though that too is part of the nostalgia), but the concept is.  This game is totally worth it, especially if you are a fan of classic games.			"

												Evoland is a really cool indie game !Lots of people won't like it because it feels like it is not using ALL his potential.But you have see on which context it was created and you'll understand why.It is exactly like Portal 1 and 2. The first one is experimental. It is the same here.Evoland 2 is coming out soon and I'm waiting impatiently, now !			"

												This is a short game (It took me about 5 hours to complete the game without using a guide.) but very well made. The concept behind an evolving videogame is brilliant. I enjoyed the alternating attack styles and open world concept. The final boss is easy if you know what to do. I highly suggest you play this.			"

												Evoland is cute and quick. It leans heavily on the fourth wall with lots of jokes and allusions, which is easily the strongest part of the game. The gameplay is simple, possibly to a fault. The turned based combat gets old quick, but the realtime stuff is pretty engaging, and you never get bogged down in maddeningly difficult challenges.Short, simple and tongue in cheek.			"

												Deffinately reccomend this game and it is well worth the money! This is the most creative game where you start out only being able to go left and then you slowly unlock things like the ablility to go right, color, 3D rendered graphics, breaking pots open, music, etc. Along with that the story just adds to the game. Its simple but simple enough that it makes the whole experience really delightful to play! If you have the chance i would deffinately give this game a go! :D			"

I only wish the game could have been longer, expanding their concept further into more adventure game styles etc. I'd happily play a sequel even.			"

												Evoland takes a fantastic concept, the evolution of the action RPG, and plays it out with mixed results. The game begins in very simplistic 2D, but soon begins to play very similarly to the original top-down Legend of Zelda games (think Link's Awakening). After more time, the game progresses into full-blown 3D, more akin to PS1/PS2 Final Fantasy games, and even further onward to open exploration, like Diablo. There's all sorts of collectibles and monster encounters as you'd come to expect, and the package is hilarious and represents its source material very well.However, the game isn't without its faults. The transition to 2D to 3D is somewhat rough, and the game starts to lose a bit of polish there. Also, at all points in the game, hit detection can act oddly, leading to your character taking hits due to some wonky hitboxes, or in some cases, pushing your character through walls in a dungeon, leading you unable to continue without restarting. These problems are obviously very annoying, and make the experience worse overall.Would I recommend the game, given the balance of positives (nostalgic value, good design) and negatives (bad hit detection, suspect 3D game mode execution)? Yeah, but not at full price. The game is great for what it is, but it's short (the game takes 2-3 hours, maybe 4 if you are trying to collect everything), and the bugs can be very frustrating. Therefore, if you're interested in things like Zelda and Final Fantasy, be sure to give Evoland a look - if you can catch it for a large discount in a sale.			"

												This game is just about perfect in content and length for RPG fans in our mid-thirties (plus or minus).  Bits and pieces of all the games we've loved packed into about 6 hours of gameplay - because that's all the time we have anymore, isn't it?  Of course along with the bits we loved come some bits that were kind of obnoxious, and there are a few lighthearted jabs at them.  The only real problems I can see with this game is that the frequency of overworld random encounters borders on the frustratingly high and the evolution of the game slows down considerably the farther along you progress.  It would have been nice to have paced the earlier evolutions a bit more slowly and had a bit more variety to the turn-based RPG combat, but it's still quite fun as it is and not a bad buy if you catch it on sale.

												Evoland gets away with being a bunch of half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥unoriginal games that are awkwardly glued together by gloriously celebrating every feature it has. I knew when I bought this game it would consist of references to other games and a medley of existing mechanics, but i didn't know it would be stale, boring versions of popular games in history. As soon as you unlock jrpg-style battle sequences the game goes downhill - fast. Easily one of the worst executions of battle sequences I've ever seen, the whole thing seems neglected by the designer completely. you face battles every 5 seconds and it's completely repetitive and randomly unfair, I fought every creature I've come across and currently have the best gear but I'm still far to weak to survive a trip between my current town and the next. I can't use potions between fights so I have to waste my fight moves on them.Currently on my trip to get bombs, I'll likely get one fight with 4 monsters, before my first attack they accumulate about 30-45 damage on me, and a potion heals 50, I'm usually weak from the last few fights, if I run from them with less that 60-90 health (total 105) I may die from the 2 rounds of attacks they get. which leaves me with the strategy of using about 3 turns for just potions, until I can survive 2 consecutive rounds without healing, and either attacking a bee and missing or attacking a pirhana plant for just over half its health. Then I use 3 more potions, and try again. For me the last straw was common, unfair and uncreative fight sequences combined with the fact that theres no map, so you're walking in the wrong direction aimlessly, and then backtracking.The zelda style parts of the game are way better, more thought-out, and more fun than the fight sequences but even those aren't that good. Mages spawn right next to you and attack before evasion is even possible, skeletons need to be attacked from behind but are usually fixed on looking straight at you.zAll in all, it's not only a poorly executed game, it's, like, 4 of them.

												Short version: I'm being snobby and wanted more of a deconstruction of classic games and less straight nostalgia.Evoland draws inspiration from old school RPGs, primarily the Legend of Zelda and Final Fantasy franchises. There is nothing inherently wrong with this, but it makes several gameplay mechanic choices that imitate limitations without considering why those limitations existed. In the action RPG (Zelda) sections where you directly control attack and movement, you are limited to only 1 active weapon and need to pause to switch between the sword, bomb, and bow. The original Zelda game had about a dozen useable items, but only 4 non-directional buttons to assign them to, hence the pause and switch mechanic. Evoland's implementation is mostly just an incovenience. For FF-style turn-based random combat (which, oddly, skips actual turn-based combat like the NES games used and goes straight to the Active Time Battle system of the SNES and PS era games), is pretty much devoid of options. Sure, old RPGs mainly just involved repeatedly selecting attack, but Evoland's protagonist has virtually no other options. There is a special attack that I still haven't unlocked over an hour into the game, and items, but I've only seen potions and phoenix down, which you rarely need as the enemies do almost insignificant damage. You gain an magic-using ally not too far in, who knows heal. About an hour in, she learns a basic magic attack. No elemental spells to exploit enemy weaknesses, no status effects, just boring vanilla damage. This spell makes her basic attack obsolete, as there is no MP stat, magic is free. Another issue I have with the game is that the FF-style inventory menu is completely non-interactive. You can't cast spells, look at a map, detailed character stats, or even look at item descriptions (much less use items). You don't even equip the weapons and armor you buy/find, it just automatically applies. Final gripe: in the town that first mimics Play Station era graphics, there is a disc loading delay between screens in the town as a little joking reference to the time. This joke quickly wears thin as the screen is about 2 seconds long, happens between EVERY screen in town, and then the game sends you on a fetch quest in town, repeatedly running from one end to the other. There is an in-game item you can buy to reduce the loading-screen, but I'm only assuming that because it costs more money than I had. I would have had to spend time grinding random battles, which would have taken longer than the time saved from the item.			"

												A rather short but sweet game that celebrates the history of RPGs, with a cute artstyle and passable gameplay, but very lacking story. It's not the kind of game you fall in love with, but a fun curiosity/distraction, that will tap into your retro-gaming nostalgia, provided you lived through that era of gaming. Thus, I would not recommend it to younger players that want to experience the history of the genre in a nutshell or something, this was not made for you unfortunately. Overall, the game lacks in story and quality gameplay (and maybe in length) too much to be a must-have, fortunately, there is a sequel on the horizon that aims to address all the shortcomings of this game. If you're the least bit interested in the game and would like to experience a nostalgia trip I recommend buying it and supporting the developer.			"

It was still a fun game, and I was a bit dissapointed about how short it ended up being [ignore my game time, I left it up one time planning to play it]  I wouldn't really recommond buying it at full price due to how short it really is, but if it's on sale I suggest giving it a try if you played the zelda, final fantasy, and diablo games.

												Since the game openly states that they got inspiration from Zelda and Final Fantasy, and after playing it it has become very evident that the game was much like these, this review will inevitably be more of a comparison between these. The Zelda elements were fun and recreated considerably well, with the exception of limiting you to only having one item to control at a time with the space bar. The puzzles were good, albeit a bit simple, and there was even some hand holding when it should have been obvious enough to figure things out. The Final Fantasy element just seemed stupid. The reason why I say this is that when you controlled the main character, he had 1 attack for 90% of the game. The secondary character had a heal ability and later received an attack which made the fights a bit less mindless, but for the most part the turn based combat was remarkably weak. The unlocking of RPG elements over time was cool, but the novelty was gone after a couple hours, and then the game turned into a Zelda/FF hybrid. I enjoyed the game for the mild Zelda fix it offers, but the Final Fantasy side was tedious, and the amount of game's length was a bit short (6.7 hours for me to do EVERYTHING). I'd say the game is worth it on sale for sure, but the game was too hit or miss for it to be worth full price for me.			"

												Charming game, I like the idea... but it feels like they pulled some of the evolutions off too fast, and left you in others for too long (in comparison).  Aside from a few decent dungeons and one Zelda puzzle segment, most of the game feels a little too empty.  Some of the battles and skills could've used a little more fleshing out, even if it only added 1 skill or extra ability it would've been a huge boon to some of the very repetitive fighting.  I'd give it a ~3.75/5 star rating.  Or it if it was out of 10, 7.25/10 would probably be a better rating.  Nice game, but I'd definitely pick it up on sale only.			"

												Evoland is an adorable and funny game that depicts the evolution of Adventure Video Games.You begin the game as a little pixelated lad who can only move to the right, you move to the right and collect a chest which unlocks the ability to move left. The entire form of this game is based upon unlocking various upgrades like better graphics and soundtracks and movements, even a plotline.This game has given me many hours of joy and laughs, and it really makes you appreciate how far video games have come.10/10 would evolve again.

												This is a fun little game, good for sinking a few hours into and makes good commentary on the evolution of RPG style games over the decades.  It starts out looking like an old Gameboy style game and the gameplay evolves up from there. There are lots of little in jokes for those who have played RPGs over the years and you can get a little chuckle out of them while you play. All in all not a bad game.			"

												I wouldn't get this unless it's on sale.Basically, it wants to be a love letter to Legend of Zelda, Diablo, and Final Fantasy, and there are parts of the game that ape all three.The Diablo part I can't speak for, because I've never played Diablo.The Final Fantasy parts are, frankly, bad. There's no real story here, just a small handful of jokey lines to remind you of plot points for Final Fantasy 7 and Secret of Mana, so right away this game is missing the main draw of jRPGs of that era, but it DOES pack in all the tedium of those games, including high random encounter rates and long, non-tactical fights which you win by just selecting the fight command a dozen times and watching the same canned animations over and over again.The Zelda parts fare better, and have one of the only interesting uses of the gimmick of moving forward through video game history: There are stones that block your path in 2d mode, but in 3d mode you realize that they're just 2d textures and you can walk over them. The puzzles in these sections aren't mindblowing but they're okay, and the bosses are tough but beatable. The Zelda parts are clearly where the majority of the development time went.A big problem is that nothing comes to a head; techniques and powers from one section don't cross over into other sections, and, because the different sections are all mixed together on the overworld, there's no way of knowing when you're completely done with one kind of section. I bought a bunch of potions for the final boss fight, but it turns out the boss fight is a Zelda section, so the potions were useless, because they only work in Final Fantasy sections. You'd think the boss would be a culmination of everything you've done, but nope, it's just a Zelda boss.$9.99 is too much for this game, it's just not polished enough. If you think you might like it and it's on sale dirt cheap you'll probably get something out of it, but if you're looking for a love letter to console RPGs you should get Half-Minute Hero instead.

												A brilliant concept, executed poorly. Playing through the ""history"" of RPGs in one game, adding elements like improved graphics and a new gameplay mechanic when you find them in a chest sounds great, right? Soon you'll see that's all there is to the game. Levels and maps lack any design, merely leading you to the next ""improvement"", e.g. a switch to open that gate in the same room. Combat is dull, a single swipe in the ""Zelda"" style combat and basic Final Fantasy-turn based combat in the other. The character's movement is boring, walking and swiping whichever way you're facing, no jumping or running... unless that comes in much later in the game. And during those ""Zelda"" combat bits you better hope the enemy you want to attack runs directly into your sword swipe or you're going to be chasing them around the map for the next minute.It's an incredible shame this is what the developers came up with based on such a smart concept. They're working on Evoland 2 but I'm not optimistic for that game after what I've seen here. If only a talented dev had gotten ahold of this idea. That's the game I want to play.			"

												I wanted to like this game.  I really did.  Unfortunately, in trying to recreate the gameplay of much older games, Evoland captures most of their flaws and almost none of their charm.  Hit detection is awful, combat is boring, character movement is slow, and for a game that advances through increasingly ""high-res"" graphics, the final stage of graphic advancement is a disappointing, poorly-animated style that would feel more at home on an older smartphone than on a PC game.  This feel like a game the developers whipped up to learn how to program and then tried to sell on Steam.  Ultimately Evoland has some good ideas but very flawed execution.			"

												I was extremely skeptical about Evoland at first. I wasnt sure that it was the type of game for me, and honestly, it's not. But it has little bits of what kind of games I do like, rather looks and features. I would defenitely recommend this game to anyone who enjoys small, short, but entertaining. the pro's of this game. - the graphics are exactly what you'd expect. - runs smoothly, and have zero saving issues. - if you're someone that likes to save alot, there's alot of save points. - it's fun, fast, and definitely passes the time! The con's of this game. - the forced battles become a little too much, after a while, and could cause someone to quit just based off that. - when first playing, there was an issue with my controller being compatable, but is fixable. - the music is repetative, and im not personally one for it, but some don't mind it. - as your game gets more and more evolved, you'll notice if you have a dinky laptop like me, your computer tries to explode or shuts down every now n' again. again, solvable but not the developers issue.Overall: definitely recommended, regardless of the cons, and in my opinion, worth the price.

												too short, some hit detection ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t w/ whirlwinds and fireballs in dungeons. overall very relaxing game, often puts a smirk on my face due to the references they make and how the game is self aware. some creative ideas were in there, the map design was good, especially in the later part of the game. Needs more fun elements to make it enjoyable in the longrun. a more fun and elaborate battle system would have been good, especially in the last part of the game where you stopped finding real ""upgrades"". And please get rid of the camera zoom, if I were to play it a second time I would skip the chest which gave that to me.also: options. Keymapping was fixed and I couldn't change the keys. overall: if you grew up with rpg's and old adventure games, then I highly recommend because of the obvious cliches and humor associated with it. else don't touch this peace of garbage.

Even things like the floor not rendering, or the game stopping after you die against a boss, unable to load or exit, just the main character and the boss staring each other down, panting. These things should have been tested in the alpha/beta version, and should not show up in a finished product. It's also not just those two things, but nobody wants to read five paragraphs.I would not recommend this game. However, I am very much looking forward to playing Evoland 2.

												Evoland is a smart and intelligently designed game that really showcases some of the historical development of games since the 1980s. I found it to be an enjoyable playthrough that lasted just the right amount of time and didn't overstay its welcome. Every area was designed very well with the accompanying  music of the area to fit - and the changes are reflected in a manner that is sometimes subtle. It really does make me appreciate the rise in retro gaming and the release of old time favorites like Final Fantasy and a host of others. Come for the history, stay for the game. It's short and fun.			"

												Since the game openly states that they got inspiration from Zelda and Final Fantasy, and after playing it it has become very evident that the game was much like these, this review will inevitably be more of a comparison between these. The Zelda elements were fun and recreated considerably well, with the exception of limiting you to only having one item to control at a time with the space bar. The puzzles were good, albeit a bit simple, and there was even some hand holding when it should have been obvious enough to figure things out. The Final Fantasy element just seemed stupid. The reason why I say this is that when you controlled the main character, he had 1 attack for 90% of the game. The secondary character had a heal ability and later received an attack which made the fights a bit less mindless, but for the most part the turn based combat was remarkably weak. The unlocking of RPG elements over time was cool, but the novelty was gone after a couple hours, and then the game turned into a Zelda/FF hybrid. I enjoyed the game for the mild Zelda fix it offers, but the Final Fantasy side was tedious, and the amount of game's length was a bit short (6.7 hours for me to do EVERYTHING).

												So late on this review, well I purchased this game the day that it came out or the day after not sure. Anyways it looked fun and for ten dollars, to me it looked like it was worth. So I gave it a shot, and to cut the review short to me the game is a four out of five. The different forms of combat are nice, but none of them are to extensive, which makes sense but a couple of other options would have been nice. The 3d to 2d gave an interesting puzzle or two I feel like the developers could have worked this a little more, maybe give the game more flavor. Obviously the game isn't there for a story, which is sad because. . .well I like story, the tale told in this one is generic and bland, and so are the characters. However the game is all around great, mainly because of all the awesome references, I mean how many games do you get to fly star-foxes♥♥♥♥♥♥and carry around clouds buster blade? None except this and maybe minecraft. It also had a decent boss fight at the end, and I wasn't at all disappointed by the battle, it wasn't super hard or anything but it was fun. The game is by no means hard, but defiantly has it's annoy parts, and despite it only being like a 2-4 hour game I've put more than double that into it, don't ask why, I don't know myself lol. Anyways good purchase I'd say it's worth the price if they lowered it by like three bucks. I think if a little bit more development would have been put into the combat, puzzles and story and not let references sell this game it may have been a 5 out of 5.			"

If you want a small diversion in life with some fun little RPG elements check it out.

Even on flash sale, I'm not sure it was worth the money, not even as an interesting experience, because quite frankly, it just wasn't.The idea is interesting enough, and you get the impression that it's going to be a unique game that gradually introduces you into new elements of gameplay as you progress. What it actually is, is a game that has you wandering around with no clear direction until you find some hidden (some not) treasure chest with an ""upgrade"" in it. Within the first hour, you're already in the 3D world, and you don't even have time to feel nostalgic before it's taken away from you. The pacing was just plain bad, and I feel like maybe if they had worked a bit more to make a longer game, it could have been more of a success.I read a review that said they use humor as a crutch, and I'm going to go ahead and second that. It really isn't that funny though, and it feels as if they tried way too hard to make a game that would appeal to players of old-school RPGs, without actually delivering anything that made them good.Overall, I feel like a lot of work was put into the game, but it just wasn't executed well. The graphics aren't bad, and they had to make several different sprites for everything, not to mention the 3D models, and the music is all very good. I acknowledge and appreciate that work, but I still can't recommend this game in good conscience. I'd give it maybe a 5/10.			"

												""Short, but sweet,"" is what came to mind after finishing this game. It only took me about 4 hours to beat the game, but only because I backtracked for some hidden stars and cards.I really enjoyed how the game evolves from 8-bit to 3D and its nods to various games.I wouldn't really recommend buying this at full price. Wait for it to go on sale.			"

												Simply put, fun.  I enjoyed the initial reviews when it first came out yet didn't think it was a 10$ game for the shortness of it's story.  I really enjoyed the concept with the evolution of rpg gaming and oddly enough (for me) I enjoyed the Diablo style segment the most!  Well worth 5$, a steal at 2.49			"

												Evoland was the greatest barometer I could have ever had to let me know it was time for a new computer.A love letter to RPGs of days past, Evoland tells a story that's not really too important.  Beginning with a silent, black and white, pixellated game, you will slowly unlock more and more gameplay mechanics.  Rapidly, you will gain sound, the use of a weapon, and then color, and then improved scrolling, and then better color, and on and on.  The true joy of Evoland is the anticipation of whatever's going to happen next.  With my last computer, my clunky processor ground itself to dust trying to handle the 3D graphics as soon as I unlocked them, rendering me unable to complete the game until I upgraded to a dedicated gaming rig.You progress through a number of different gamestyles, and all of the familiar RPG tropes are lovingly shoehorned in.  There's Zelda-style dungeons, and areas featuring turn-based battles - even a Triple Triad-styled card game.It's best not to expect a grand epic adventure - it's just not here.  The speed of your upgrades peaks really early and then kind of flatlines a bit - one of the biggest criticisms of the game is it gets boring once the upgrades have been seen.  That's a little true, but things pick up a bit in a late dungeon that involves time travel.  Also, this game is very short, which is a plus in this case - it's enough to give you a taste of what you came for in the first couple of hours or so, and then coasts to a pretty quick conclusion.A lovely nostalgia trip.

												If you're interested in the progression of video games or if you're like me and have seen in during your life time than this game is FOR YOU! You start out in graphics you would see on early Nintentdo games and go through the game as if it is an RPG. You find and open chests which sometimes unlock some progression and the graphics or sounds get better. Eventually you jump from the past (2D) to the present (3D) and this helps you solve puzzles through the games.Battling monsters also goes through the progession, but I won't go into that too much. While I really enjoyed this game I was sad that it seemed to end so quickly. However I recently found out that they are releasing an evoland 2!! =) I'm looking forward to it!			"

												I wanted so much to like this game, but I just can't. Evoland was obviously created with a great deal of love for games of yore, but it completely misses what made those games good in the first place: the gameplay.Evoland is not so much a game as it is an interesting idea that the creators tried and failed to turn into a game. No matter how much nostalgia they packed in, it's flat-out not enjoyable.The graphics and audio are fantastic for the nostalgia, but that's all that's good here. The gameplay is shallow and tedious. The maps are boring. The collectathons are extremely annoying.			"

												This game is just Nostalgia-Ville at its finest it has so many refrences to other Action Adventure which is one of the reasons that made even wanna play the game even more this game shows how games have changed throughout time graphics and gameplay wise, the only thing that I hated is that this game was short if it were longer I would be singing with joy but would recommend this to people who like Nostalgia at its finest. So I give this game a 8.5/10.			"

												I don't know why it wont show me how many house I put into this game but be sure I DID finish it (~6-8 hours)Like what you see in the video, this game is a mixture of The Legend of Zelda + Final Fantasy. Unfortunately, it's super short, no replay value, very few different monsters, the story is very weak, and there can be some unsatisfying grinding.If you really want to try this game, wait until it goes on sale for $2.50 USD. Anything above and you'll be giving this game a thumbs down.			"

Terrific Idea, Mediocre ExecutionEvoland purports to be a journey through the history of action/adventure gaming, but ends up being a nostalgic trip through A Link to the Past, Final Fantasy VI and Diablo.  Although I selected that I'd recommend this game, I'd really say that I'm closer to a ""Neutral"" than anything.Most of the game takes place either as an overly simple turn-based RPG or the beginning of a Legend of Zelda game.  Most of the mechanics are fairly simple:  In the RPG sections you attack, use items or cast magic (and there are only three magic spells in the game); in the Zelda sections you get a sword, bombs and a bow.  The few puzzles that exist are extremely simple, and the storyline is almost non-existent.Despite it being a simple game, Evoland is reasonably fun to play.  It's fun in the beginning to unlock new graphics types and abilities.  It also doesn't overstay its welcome...by the time it becomes apparent that the scope of the game is fairly small, it's over.  This is also a negative, however, as the entire game (including all of the optional achievements and getting 100% completion) can be easily finished in 4-5 hours.  If you can get it on sale (at least 50% off), it's a fun diversion for a few hours.  Just don't expect anything mind-blowing.Rating:  6.5/10			"

												A lot of people seem to have forgotten how to feel nostalgia for the sake of itself.Evoland is an absolute steal at this price (currently $2.49 at the time of this review).Evoland does a remarkable job of illustrating, in both sound and design, as well as function, the evolution of gaming from its inception on upwards. The only thing it does not illustrate is the brief period of time when graphics weren't even a thing, but very few of us would remember that era anyways, as it didn't last long.From the smallest of things as only moving in one direction, to transitioning to 8bit, 16bit, 32bit, 3D, etc graphics and beyond, it's like getting a history lesson in the most amusing way possible.The gameplay itself is reminiscent of Zelda, Final Fantasy, even a hint of CCG thrown in (there's a full-fledged miniature card game within the game itself once you reach a certain town). There are hidden items to find along the way, and the combat system changes with time as well. There are also a lot of interesting puzzles.I wouldn't call this game something you'll enjoy if you're looking for a huge challenge, or something incredibly fast paced or modern. This game was so obviously primarily designed to harken to days of old, so whether you're a younger individual who just wants to know or see what life was like while you were a toddler or not even born yet, or a seasoned game veteran looking for a nostalgia kick, this will be for you guys.And come on, who the ♥♥♥♥ complains about a $2.49 game?! I bought it back when it was $4.99 and the only reason I don't have more hours into it is because I have a backlog of waayyyyyy too many games to play (see Steam account, 90%+ of those aren't played fully, hah, but they are still worth every penny!).

												Fun game that pays tributes to past games.  Evoland is true to its name and evolves.  It is easy to see some of the obvious tributes to games like final fantasy and zelda but there are also several inside jokes.  The only down side to the game is its lack of depth, which is to be expected for this type of game at the price point.  The game is short and while there are a few side quests to be done such as collecting stars or cards for the game, even these do not add a great deal of length.I would recomend this game to anyone who programs games, or anyone looking for a nostalgic trip of previous games.I would not recomend this game to anyone searching for a in depth, long game, or serious gaming experience.

The plot is not very strong, but it being designed in homage to the classics left me feeling the same feelings I felt years ago playing Zelda, Final Fantasy, and my brief stint with Diablo. The transition between visuals reminded me of the awe of playing pokemon when I was younger and watching the graphical capabilities advancing with each generation. The music is amazing (especially towards the end), and the final boss battle was actually fun. I 100%'d the game in a little under 6.5 hours, so I'd say wait for the game to be on sale before buying it, as it is relatively short.			"

												Evoland is probably one of the coolest ideas for a game I've seen.  When I first looked into this game however I was hit with tons of poor reviews on it, so I was hesitant to buy it.  This year's humblebundle sale had it really cheap though so I jumped in.  Evoland takes RPGs from early to recent and rolls them all into 1  crazy game.  Whenever you open a chest you never know what is going to happen.  Final Fantasy, Zelda, Diablo etc. are all referenced in this game, and generally in very humorous ways.  However it is not all good.  Though fantastic the game is rather short.  It can be beaten in about 1-5 hours, and several of the ""evolutions"" of the game come at you all at once so you go from NES level up to Final Fantasy 7 level pretty quick.   Also the game is known for being buggy.  I got stuck in a bug that left the game unplayable, by setting the airship down right next a forest that could not be exited from that side.PROsFantastic ideaVariety of graphics and gameplay updates throughoutOften hilarious upgrade notes and itemsSolid gameplay mechanics and combatCONsShort gameCan be very buggyLacks any kind of deep plotVery few sidequestsSimple item, magic and combat system leave little room for strategies.Overall I think this game is very much worth a play through at the right price.  I am very much looking forward to Evoland 2 and hope for a longer, more in depth story, with no game breaking bugs.			"

												First off, let me start off by saying that game is fun. It's fun, but is it worth your money? The gameplay is really interesting in that it literally evolves while your progress and the story is simple (reminder of really old school jRPGs), but feels incredibly forced and rushed near the end. Which most will reach within a couple of hours. The graphics are really pleasing and you can feel the effort that must have gone into making such a huge amount of assets, but you can't help, but feel that effort cut into the game's length/story. It also bothers me that the majority of the references felt like they were from the Final Fantasy series and you could easily pass off the game as a parody of it. I did get a couple of the other references (Diablo, League of Legends, Secret of Mana), but they were far and in-between the FF ones. I feel like with some better writers and longer gameplay  and the game could of been amazing, but even so if you find the game on sale, it's a really fun way to pass a day or two and satisfy that old school RPG hunger.The Rundown+ Unique and fun graphics+ Variety of different gameplay styles+ Features are unlocked as you progress in a fun way- Short Gameplay- Limited Replayability- Below average story telling			"

												I personally can't recommend this game. It's a great concept, and it works well enough. The idea of the rpg game world evolving around is fun engaging and interesting. But it lacks in good game design. With certain area's lacking a humane checkpoint system, I found myself easily getting frustrated. But if you can see past these flaws, the humor is good and  the gameplay is engaging. The small frustrations that arose from my 2 attempted playthroughs (one back in 2013 when the game came out, and one more recently) just makes it something I can't say is worth it. Despite that, I have the hopes and faith that the developers will make a much more well executed sequel that takes the idea to the entirety of video games.			"

												This game is a lot of fun; it's a mixed bag when it comes to content because it chronicles many highlights of role-playing adventure game history. Starting with the basics and evolving graphically and mechanically as upgrades are collected, it never gets repetitive. There are many callbacks to famous entries in the genre, like The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past and Final Fantasy VII, so you may find yourself chuckling at the references from time to time. Overall, it's a really fun game that I'm glad I played. I would absolutely suggest giving it a shot if you have enjoyed role-playing adventure games in the past.			"

												Evoland could have gone in any of three directions - museum, satire, or video game. Ultimately it dabbles in all three, does not commit and succeed at any, and is an underwhelming experience.On the museum front, there are good periods where it shows the different stages of video games. At the beginning of the game these come by every 10 seconds or so and it's really just a gallery of different technical advancements without any exploration. These sometimes come in the wrong order (for instance, they leave ""objective"" until they've moved well into the SNES days, meaning that none of the earlier period had anything to play for other than exploration and technical advancement). After the first 20 minutes or so these museum developments slow way down and there are very few meaningful updates, alongside a veritable wealth of meaningless updates.As a satire, it shines in a few places. The dungeon crawler section has hilarious items with hilarious buffs. The first time in a village, the NPC conversations are spot on. Too often, though, it's sarcasm or weak humor and is never enough to sustain the game on its own.That leaves the ""game"". This was the greatest missed opportunity. Evoland does have a few highlights - the Zelda dungeon was simple but entertaining. There was a smart section with puzzles revolving around changing time periods. The majority of the game did not match these. As mentioned before, the opening 20 minutes play only as a museum, offering 20 seconds of walking and slashing before whisking you on. It misses an opportunity to recreate what made those old games great, birthing the genre. The Final Fantasy and Baldur's Gate style games rely heavily on skill trees and character development for entertainment, but Evoland omits these aspects in favor of satire, which, while funny, cannot carry the game through the long sections. Ultimately we're left with (too frequent) random encounters that offer no reward, a story that is even thinner than Final Fantasy I, and a game with too few bright points and too long of valleys between them.Hooray for the bright points, though!

												This game is a great homage to the very history of gaming. It makes countless references that are sometimes subtle and other times obvious to things like Final Fantasy, Zelda, and even Mario. While the story itself isn't perfect, the real catch of this game is the sheer enjoyment that you gain when opening a new chest and gaining something like breakable pots. I only had 2 problems with Evoland. The first problem is that you can only have 1 save file at a time and if you happen to choose new game and step on a save point then the whole game is lost from your original file. The other problem is that even though the game introduces several really cool elements to the gameplay, none of them stay long enough to really get used to them. Overall this game is great and even if it's not on sale, it's still worth it.			"

												This game tries so hard and accomplishes so little, that I strongly advise you not to buy it. You'll grow sick of it really fast, as the story is very poor and the mechanics are really bad.Oh, not to mention the ""references"" and ""puns"". I don't really understand why do all these recent titles have to try to be funny, with some pretty idiotic jokes, 90% of the time referring to more famous games (in this case, like the FF franchise). This is one of those games that can't stand up by itself, so the whole concept was: ""rip off and try to make fun of succesful releases"".But, cutting it to the chase: it's just bad.

The only down side, is that it rushed through all these steps to get you running through an unexciting storyline. The best parts were short lived and the random battle instances(which are pointless at a certain level) seem neverending. If you want something you can just pop in and out of for short instances of entertainment, this game is worth it.

												Going into this game my expectations were not too high based on the negative feedback on this game. Some of it is warranted, as things like random battles are very frequent, to the point of being slightly annoying. They aren't difficult or frustrating though so it's not a showstopper. Despite that, this game is definitely a fun diversion to play. I generally enjoyed it; the story is simple but the references to past action and rpg games are fun to discover. The various ways you can battle change things up enough to keep things from getting too stale, and the puzzle elements are fun to work out too.It's easy to beat this game in a couple of sessions, or one if you want to marathon it; so if you are looking for a short, fairly entertaining game to play you could certainly do worse than this. I picked it up on a sale, which you may want to as well since there isn't a whole lot of content as it is.			"

												THIS GAME IS ONE OF THE BEST GAMES I HAVE EVER PLAYED IN MY LIFE !Evoland, is a game that is meant to show the evolution of videogames, from the black&white, 2D, 8 bit graphics that make us remember about the old Gameboy Classic, up to the most recent technologies, that make videogames look as real as possible. But this game is not all about Evolution, you do not only search all over the map upgrades for your game, but you also have to focus on the storyline, which, I have to say is not bad. At all ! Clearly this game is a must for everybody who would like to take a look at the first videogames ever made, and then, gradually reach to a videogame that actually looks ""up to date"" . Plus, if you are a fan of Legend of Zelda, Final Fantasy, Pokemon, or Diablo, you will enjoy it even more .My opinion ? If this little review was not enough, I clearly recommend buying this game !

												I don't recommend this, but only moderately. It has plenty of positives, but doesn't really offer much to the average gamer, even to the average RPG player. You would probably be better served just playing the games it copies (I say ""copies"" since I don't know how else to describe it, but I certainly don't mean the term negatively): The Legend of Zelda and Final Fantasy, especially. If you've played those (and Evoland mostly assumes you have), just play similar games that take themselves a little more seriously.Of course, Evoland is not a huge time sink: the whole thing will take 3 to 6 hours, depending on whether you speed through or try to find all the hidden items. It is shorter than it seems, though: the high random battle encounter rate and the tedious level design (which often requires you to go way around scenery obstacles for really no reason) drastically inflate how long the game takes. This is especially true if you want to do the optional goals, collecting cards and stars. The card game, which pretty much just copies Triple Triad from FF8, is pretty fun, but relatively easy and lacks replayability. The stars are pointless: they have no real purpose in the game, aren't explained, do nothing; the only real reason for them being there is to make another achievement and make the game seem like it lasts longer than it does.The MAJOR flaw with the game, though, is that it undermines its entire premise about halfway through. The ""evo"" part of Evoland is that you collect ""upgrades"" that let the game ""evolve"" from 8bit RPG mechanics and graphics to 3-D design and more recent mechanics. This was the most interesting part of the game, and makes the game valuable as a retrospective of the history of RPGS. About halfway through, though, you pretty much stop collecting any more upgrades. Indeed, the mimicking of other games just starts to happen randomly: the Diablo level is an example, where Diablo mechanics just show up and then go away after the level. Things stop to make much sense. Not that they do for the most part to begin with: often the sequence of upgrades makes no sense in terms of any real history of gaming ""evolution."" If the game would have stuck with the idea of evolution, making some of the earlier parts last longer (you move from 8bit to 3D very quickly, then get stuck in 3D for about 3 hours without the novelty of upgrades, making the story drag) and exploring the history of RPGs after FF8 (which is where it mostly stops), then it would probably be more interesting.Lastly, the story is just pointless. At first it's interesting as a parody of older RPGs, and then just becomes absurd. It stops working as a parody and gets cliche and doesn't even really seem to try. Since it's short, this may be worth playing if you have any interest in the history of RPGs or just like FF7. It is also a decent deal on sale. Overall, though, this is an interesting concept with woefully failed execution.			"

												really fun game that peters out a little bit towards end, once you have ""evolved"" to final version of game. Other than that, cool few hours of gametime that makes you remember classic RPGs. Needles to say, art style is amazing.			"

												This game is bare bones in a way but still very good.  If you've played generations of RPGs you will appreciate this game, although I wish it had spent a bit more time in the first few generations and less on the last one, otherwise this is a short but sweet game for anyone that likes RPGs from 8-bit NES games to diablo clones.

												I loved the concept of this game. I only wish it had been more focused in execution. The gameplay alternates between Zelda and Final Fantasy styles (and a tiny bit of Diablo). I get that the game is paying homage to these franchises, but the experience feels disjoint. For example, leveling up in the FF areas has no effect on your ability in the Zelda areas, and the health systems work completely differently as well. Ultimately, the game ends before you feel any sense of progress in either mode. It forgets what made these games fun.It was cool watching the game world ""evolve"" from monochrome 8-bit graphics to a modern cartoon style (although the concept runs out of steam too quickly, I think), and it has plenty of funny moments. Just don't expect too much substance here.			"

												I had fun playing this game. The concept of reliving the evolution of adventure games is a neat one, and I think it was well executed. I would say I had a pretty smooth experience.During this short game, the humor of the references was enough to motivate me to keep going - but on the other hand the story did not really feel like a motivator at all. Because it's entirely made up of references to other known stories, it failed to be compelling in itself.That being said, I will definitely check out the next iteration of this game. I'm hoping that they will be able to incorporate a more compelling narrative so that the game also has that to offer. I think this game was good enough, and that, done right, the next one has the potential to be great.			"

												So I picked this up the other day, and I am in love. You start out in b/w pixel and you can only move right. You get chests that ‘unlock’ better graphics, music, more colors, inventory, exp, etc. So as you progress through the story you progress through the evolution of games.ALSO, references, nods, puns, parodies GALORE. SERIOUSLY. Every like 30 seconds I am grinning like an idiot because there was a reference to things I love. The default names for the characters are ‘Clink’ and ‘Kaeries,’ I found a buster sword and it’s Claud’s sword, there’s a dude with an airship named Sid,  there are mushroom monsters called Zoombas, there’s a turtle monster called A’Tuin…I can go on, but you get the point.The only thing is, the game is fairly short, but the content definitely makes up for it.ANYWAY, IF YOU LIKE RPGS, IF YOU LIKE OLD GAMES, IF YOU’RE A GIANT DORK WHO LIKES THINGS THAT ARE AWESOME, GO GET THIS GAME!!!!

												This game is extremely fun and innovative - but only while it lasts. Its core mechanic - that as the game progresses, so do all the mechanics and features in the game, is really beautiful and charming. It really motivates you to try your hardest to find them all. However, the game is just really, really short. These 2 hours I have in the game, are all the game. If you find this game discounted, or perhaps just want to see a game that celebrates the evolution of gaming as a whole (And references many games, such as Mario, Zelda, Final Fantasy and more), then buy this game. Otherwise, while most of you will find it fun, it is simply not worth the investment for 2 hours.			"

												Evoland is a journey through the history of video games. You start with no sounds, black and white, extremely pixellated, and can only move right. By the end, it's a fully working HD RPG. As you go through the game you'll find chests that when you open them, it'll give you something like ""Move Left!"" or ""HD Backgrounds!"" This game has the basics of Zelda-esque gameplay, turnbased gameplay, and Diablo-esque gameplay! Also, this game doesn't really take itself seriously, as the whole area where you play the game like Diablo, the loot is hilariously named, and hilariously defined (""+0.001% critical hit chance,"" or ""+300 damage to walls and stone."") However, the further along you go, the more sophisticated the story gets, and it's actually not a bad story. Typical for games like Final Fantasy or Zelda, but not bad.Is this game good? Yes, but not all that long. Is the game worth the money? Absolutely. If you like good nostalgic hilarious RPG Zelda Diablo type things, then this game is definitely for you.			"

												I've been eyeing this game for a while now, and am happy to report that it was everything I hoped it would be.  Let's get the cons out of the way first...  the game is short.  If you rate a game based on the hours you get out of it, this probably won't be your cup of tea.  You can probably get through it with most of the colletibles in just a few hours.  Also, at times, the controls are a little frustrating.  This became most evident on the final boss, when I felt that most of my deaths were as a direct result of the way the controls handle (I was using an XB360 pad).  Now, on to the pros, which, I feel, FAR outweigh the cons.  As a long-time fan of RPGs, going back to the 80s, I felt that this game was designed as a humorous love song to those classic games of yester-year.  I strongly felt the influences of such classics as Zelda, Final Fantasy, with even a few visual references to Mario tossed in for good measure.  Evoland starts you off with a black and white, highly pixelated charachter, like something you might have seen on the original Game Boy, but quickly introduces new graphics, music, and gameplay mechanics, as you explore the progression of the genre over the years.  This is all done while playing through a largely generic story..but I feel that most people who will appreciate this game aren't playing it for the story, but for the nostalgia and fun to be had with this short gem.  In short, if you are looking for a great experience, I highly recommend this game.  The story is light, and though it is about RPGs, the RPG elements are thin, but the fun and progression of it makes it a great game to play through on your day off of work, or the weekend.  Give it a shot!			"

												This a decent little 3D adventure game, but it's not what I had thought it was based on the description and trailer. I had hoped Evoland would be about the evolution of gaming. Going through the 8-bit/16-bit eras all the way through today. That being the focus of the game. Instead this is a 3D adventure game with the evolution aspect thrown in as an after thought. You start off in a very simple Gameboy style game, but within 5 minutes you've already progressed to the 3D adventure. That being said it plays well for what it is, the story and graphics are fine. I was just hoping for the game to be more evenly divided, not reaching the 3D aspect until half way through the game.			"

Soon you gain new ""abilities"" like going right, going up and down, free moving, colors, music and so on and so on. From zelda-like combat gmae moves to turn based RPG, hack-n-slash and more.Game contains lot of sweet puzzles and in the end when player already collected most of evolution items, game quickly change into regular rpg with small adn simple but still functional story. There isa bad guy, love, hate, revenge and more.Once you beat the game, it is over but game still has some replayability, mainly for grinders.I recommend this for unique experience and gnetle humor. Unlike many ""wanna be fun"" rpgs this one is funny while retaining originality of its own.			"

												Evoland is anything but the evolution of gaming. While the game hold true to its title, it does indeed introduce the player to how simple game mechanics, audio/visual upgrades and different game play modes had changed the industry. However, the game offers little as far as an evolution. Having played the game to the end, it was a struggle to keep interest and intrigue. I can sympathize how an indie developer would create a ""brief"" survey on how gaming evolved,  but much of the Evoland was an ill created amusement park of washed up franchise elements drawing heavily upon Final Fantasy, Diablo and Zelda.While the game has a cute art direction and zippy one liners that average gamers would chuckle at, you get what you payed for $9.99, for one person's miscontrued view of how gaming evolved.  If steam had allowed renting, this game would be on the list.			"

												A delightful little trip down memory lane, my only complaint is that it falls short in the fact that it emulates retro gaming a little TOO well!  If anything, this game made me remember why the stop-and-go pacing of JRPGs like Final Fantasy and Dragon Quest just didn't gel for me.  It always seemed like the combat was just getting in the way of the story!  Unfortunately, this game has very little story that is can actually be called compelling, so it's like all of the tedium with none of the payoff.  However, those setbacks did not stop the game from pleasantly surprising me.  All those complaints I made in the preceding paragraph?  The game knows all about them, but rather than trying to adapt those elements for a new generation, it celebrates them, shortcomings and all!  This game isn't about reinventing the wheel or even treading new ground, it's about reminiscing the past and paying respect to some of the greatest moments in gaming; the moments that defined gaming in the past, and without which we wouldn't have gaming as it today.  In that respect, this game succeeds.  It's a cheerful and lovingly-crafted tale of bygone days, and while the retro-style throwbacks in gameplay may confuse and fail to amuse the younger crowd, for us retro gamers it may spark some wonderful feelings of nostalgia.

												Having played the game that this was based on, it's great to see the idea be built upon. Great wee references to old games, but that said most of what is really good about this game is what was good about the original. The new elements are good but about half way through it pretty much decides to more literally match the games that act as it's inspiration (Legend of Zelda, Final Fantasy) rather than included references to them. All in all a nice wee(around 4 hours) game.			"

												Evoland is the tale of two games.The parody, homage, humour and writing are all top notch. If you're fan of Final Fantasy, Zelda, Monster Hunter, Diablo and the whole RPG genre there is a lot to enjoy.However, the actual gameplay and mechanics - especially once you transition to 3D - leave a LOT to be desired. Parts aren't hard because they're challenging, they're hard just because the game plays in parts like the crappy 3D shareware games from the 90s.All in all I really enjoyed myself but be warned - if struggling with a crappy 3D RPG is going to outweigh your enjoyment of this games central concept then you're gonna have a bad time. Also, check out DRM Quest for a similar approach to procedurally adding elements, albeit one lampooning a whole different part of gaming culture...			"

												As other reviewers noted, this game isn't so much a journey of action/adventure games so much as it is a journey of RPGs--notably the Final Fantasy and the Legend of Zelda series. Which, admittedly, still promised a lot of fun and engagement, but didn't really deliver the way I'd hoped it would.It incorporates both old-school turn-based RPG combat and your older ""hack-and-slack"" style combat reminiscent of early Zelda games. However, these forms of combat alternate, so that most world-map combat is turn-based, and the majority of the dungeons and forests are subjected to the hack-and-slash that can be a little jarring in transition. The turn-based follows a familiar timer system, where you cannot attack, heal, run, etc., until it's your ""time"" to do so.While it admittedly did bring me a good bit of nostalgia, the game doesn't have much to stand on beyond that. As much as I found myself enjoying the ability to ""unlock"" the advancements to the game such as 16-bit color or 3-D rendering, it quickly grew tedious and monotonous. There's not a lot of story or plot to keep you interested in long term play, let alone to replay the game, and it doesn't have that something special to set it apart from other games, as it seems to rely to heavily on the nostalgia to carry the game. I did like some of the puzzles that had you switching between the 16-bit era and the more modern 3-D game structure to move through them, but it wasn't enough to make the game stand out.Furthermore, if you're looking to play this game purely through the keyboard and mouse, you'll be a bit disappointed. The space bar acts as the action key, and movement can only be achieved by your direction keys. It makes the older style combats (particularly your hack-and-slash) a bit more difficult to pull off with finesse. In the end, I can't really say I'd recommend the game--unless you have the time and money to kill, and don't mind enduring some frustration during gameplay to do so.			"

												This game is fun, very simple, but fun. It's probably something that would be most enjoyed by people that can remember back to the days of brick Gameboys and the SNES. It was a fun game for the most part. It felt very disjointed since the gamestyle changed so frequently. It was always either going for some form of a Zelda game or a Final Fantasy game. So it ended up feeling a bit like two separate games. If this is on sale I would buy it no problem, if it's at full price I would only get it if I really really wanted some nostalgia.			"

												Charming game, I like the idea... but it feels like they pulled some of the evolutions off too fast, and left you in others for too long (in comparison).  Aside from a few decent dungeons and one Zelda puzzle segment, most of the game feels a little too empty.  Some of the battles and skills could've used a little more fleshing out, even if it only added 1 skill or extra ability it would've been a huge boon to some of the very repetitive fighting.  I'd give it a ~3.75/5 star rating.  Or it if it was out of 10, 7.25/10 would probably be a better rating.  Nice game, but I'd definitely pick it up on sale only.			"

												A nostalgic, inside-joke filled tribute to Legend of Zelda and Final Fantasy. The graphic switches, the treaure chests, and a lot of the in-game jokes are constantly referencing other video games. I've only played a few hours now, but it seems like a pretty solid little indie game. I like how you can switch between Zelda style-battles and Final Fantasy-style battles depending on whether or not you're in the overworld (FF style) or in a dungeon area (Zelda style).A few glitches, though. One of which is that Steam can't count how much time I'm logging when it charts me. Also, it's very slow in the mountain region, lots of lag, perhaps due to the large amount of  badguy NPC's the game sees.			"

The storry is pretty indicative of classic rpg's, modeled after Zelda, Final Fantasy, Dragon Quest, and a dash of Diablo. Tons of references to Final Fantasy in the musical score and names of characters and such. The game takes a lot from Zelda from a design stand point, and there's a whole level dedicated to Diablo-style games. It's a lot of fun and amuseing and you can earn 100% completion in less than 10 hours. Well worth the $10, but if you can find it on sale, definitely pick it up.			"

												Evoland is actually pretty amazing for what it is. It tries to smash all sorts of genres that evolved over many years into a single game and is fairly successful. It is short, but if you bought a $10 game thinking you were getting a CoD length game then you should probably stick to your CoDs.The gameplay was a mix of interesting/typical and the story was good. I think that most people's gripes with this game is that it was short and different. It was actually quite fun to hunt for the chests that would upgrade the gameplay from a 2D black and white game to full on 3D.			"

												The only negative thing i could possibly say about this game... is that it is too short. It's the best game of it's kind for each of the different gaming eras that it represents. Worth 10 dollars if you are a fan of any rpg's. It would just be wrong to pass this game up at 75% off. At the time of this review, there is 7:23:50 left before the deal ends. GET SOME!			"

												It's not a bad game, it's just not that good. It's not that hard either, if and only if you die, it's because you don't know how to handle the situation of the game. There are bugs however, like the texture bug in a specific Ruin area that I encountered. I wouldn't pay full price for it but I did enjoy the game. I like the concept it introduced, it's great for those who enjoy a little flashback of games that inspired plenty of great titles and it's fun to point out which came from where. It has its set of cameos from mario to zelda and some RPG references but that's all it is. The puzzles are okay, they're not difficult, but they lack of creativity. I think this game could be done better especially if it wanted to showcase the history of RPG and games.			"

												Evoland Evoland... I get the feeling that this game should be in early development still as I was expecting at least 10 hours of game play out of it however I've gotten almost everything already!  They have a great idea going here and all with being a throw back on gaming and showing how they evolved, but when I take a step back and look at it all it just doesn't sit well.  What they take from other well known games normally are the worst parts of it, meaning that you get longer load times later in the game and have to pay for them (in game money) to go away, in the MMO map none of the stuff you pick up means anything, and no creative bosses, just a dark link fight that feels underwhelming do to it being so early in the game, and not being a sword battle, but rather wait for him to do the move and hit him.  If your a fan of mario, zelda, or Final fantasy 7 then give it a look if you like.  (Also they failed on the FF8 card mini game, in FF8 you can pick your cards, here nope.)			"

												Don't bother, it took about 3.5 hrs to beat the game start to finish and the only reason I show 5 hours played is because I started over at one point.  At first, it's a fun game, the concept seems like it should be entertaining.  But it plays on your nastalgia and does little else.  I had expected at some point that it might ""evolve"" into it's own game but that never happens and it is so short that the plot and character development may as well not even exist.  You will never care about the characters or what is happening in the world of Evoland.  It's a brief little trip down memory lane but that's all it is.  They basically just mashed a whole bunch of games together into one fast tracked, half♥♥♥♥♥package that never does anything as well as the games it was trying to copy (pay homage to, if you prefer).  If it's $1 - $2 on a steam sale maybe pick it up to kill a couple hours but DO NOT drop $10 on this game.  You will not get your money's worth.  The game just feels like a cash grab to me.  There is no effort at all to be original in any area of the game.  I understand that's part of the point of it.  To trek back through time and revisit all the old stuff you used to enjoy as a kid but at some point it should become it's own game or at least attempt to bring a half way decent plot to the table.  EDIT: You can buy Terraria, Binding of Isaac, Rogue Legacy, Starbound and so many other indie games for as much or cheaper and get SO many more hours out of them.  This just seems like a waste of money.			"

												With just shy of 2 hours under my belt, I'm already enjoying the heck out of Evoland. The game starts with 8-bit retro-Gameboy-spinach-green graphics and allowing you to only walk right. That's it.  And from that point on it's up to you to evolve through gaming history in terms of features, sound, graphics, and gaming styles to make your way. The game makes me think, 'what will the next unlockable be?' as I explore and find chests that could hold the next upgrade, whether it be a new feature, an upgrade in graphics, or sound. Heck, a recent one allowed me to break jars finally with my sword. You'll also be taken through various RPG battle styles, keeping things a bit more fresh when on one moment you're battle 8/16-bit Zelda style, and next you're doing random encounters and battle menus like Final Fantasy. If you're a RPG fan, or a gaming fan in general, do yourself a favor and give Evoland a shot.			"

												Evoland is a neat concept that isn't executed very well. I lets you play through the history of RPGs flaws and all, plus some new flaws. The game ranges from mildly interesting, to boring to tedious. It's also probably the most unbalanced game I've ever played. You'll have random battles that completely destroy you, bosses that don't put up a fight at all, and a final boss that is more difficult than an Ys final boss on nightmare. The game is either way too generous or way too stingy with save points depending on where you're at in the game. It even has fake ""load times"" that you have to spend gil to get rid of. I finished the game but I wouldn't recommend it. If you can get it for a dollar or two it might be worth that, but even then there's better things to play.			"

												Fun game until the end. It's a game that does a good job of utilizing game mechanics from all our favorite console RPG games of old. By now, you probably know that it is a game that progresses through games like the Zelda and Final Fantasy series (at least the first several anyway). That's the highlight. The story is average, even the game-play throughout is merely average. Again, the highlight is the progression through all the many years of game development in a particular genre. Even then, though, this highlight becomes fairly tiresome about two-thirds of the way through the game. Bringing us to the end, where -- I won't say much about the story (it continues to be about average) -- the game-play submerges into an abysmal arcade frenzy that is full of bugs, lagging, and ultimately uninteresting style. Pick it up on sale for a few hours of fun; reminiscing of the beautiful games that propelled their successors to where they are today.			"

While, the ""evolving"" landscapes/fighting styles are quirky and fun in the beginning, this mechanic eventually runs out of speed 3/4 of the way through.  Sadly, the humor dies out by the end of the game, as well, relying too heavily upon common RPG clichés and tropes to drive its story.    Also - didn't record my time playing?  ¯\_(ツ)_/¯			"

Pick it up if it's on saleEvoland starts off very interesting. A game that starts of as an 8-bit 2D j-rpg and gradually evolves into a 3D j-rpg is a very good idea. At first everytime you get an upgrade it is exciting and you want to backtrack to see if anything new has happened. Unfortunetly that excitment wears off quickly. After having unlocked HD 3D textures I found that every upgrade I got afterwards was just... uninteresting. Nothing really major happened. Maybe I haven't played enough and more major stuff will happen further into the game. Around the Aogi City part I lost interest completely, it just felt like a pretty lame j-rpg, and I can't recommend a game that I found boring 2 hours in.Even if you, like me, like your j-rpg games and think this looks interesting I wouldn't recommend picking this game up for the full price. If it is on sale then I think you should consider it because it is definitelly interesting. "

												Evoland is a good game, and I purchased it because of its promise of seeing an ""evolving"" game, but that's just how's it. You do experience the technical progress of the game as you find items through the world, yes, but it's pretty boring that you get to think that your mere objective is to get this simple 2D monochrome world to full HD graphics, so you don't relate that much with the story nor the characters as in other RPGs. Not that the game is bad, but you shouldn't expect a rich story nor complex mechanics. It's all about upgrading the looks and ""evolving"" the RPG elements (you unlock the save points, the battle types, etc).My overall: 5/10			"

You start off with the most basic of things in the game such as 4 way movement old 8 bit graphics and then steadily work your way up through advancements such as turn base fighting and 3D graphics. This game is a fun quick play around 4-5 exploring and completing everything. It also has so many refrences to classic games its crazy and you will get a kick out of it. If i do have to say something bad it is the fact of the overworld battles and the fact of how many times you seem to be pulled into them.

												""A Short Story of Adventure Video Game Evolution"" indeed. Made short by cutting the story off around the Playstation era -- Evoland has devolved into a love letter to Final Fantasy VII long before Sephiroth kills Aeris. Err, before ""Zephyros"" kills ""Kaeris,"" that is.And that love letter? It's from the creepy, overly-attached girlfriend. But THAT'S well apparent by the time ""Clink"" picks up ""Claud's"" sword and wades through the loading screens of the pre-rendered second town (Aogai) to meet with ""Sid.""The OTHER half of the game is split between nods to Final Fantasy VI and the pre-Gamecube Legend of Zelda games ... and a ham-handed Diablo parody. And I'm not particularly fond of what implies about the various Mario RPGs. Still ... there's worse ways to spend $10 USD, I guess?			"

												This game was really cool.  It started out where gaining chests would *evolve* gameplay such as improving graphics or fidelity mirroring the development of games within the last few decades but I wouldn't call this game a gimmick.  It had very fun puzzle mechanics later on in the game where you would travel between the 8-bit world and the fully developed 3D world in order to progress and it made gameplay very interesting.  The storyline is more of a tool than an actual story since gameplay and the story closely mirror FF7/Zelda but it is humorous at times.  Gameplay was pretty cool in that it featured all sorts of gameplay including a very sillly Diablo level featuring tons of gear for example a ring of item finding which had a description of ""helps you find an actually useful item"".  The bad parts I would say are the RPG gameplay sections which I feel don't develop enough, and the very short length of the game.Overall, it was a very fun game and I would buy it if it went on sale again if I were you.  You can really tell the developer put a lot of love into the game.			"

												Everyone who grew up with (J)RPGs at some point will love this trip down memory lane. As you play Evoland you will remember all those sweet moments you had back then. I would even go as far as having Evoland mandatory in every subject kids are taught about gaming/(J)RPGs to keep that gaming history alive.			"

												An homage to the gameboy up to the playstation, Evoland is a fun, puzzling RPG with some action RPG elements.  Throughout the game, you earn graphics and gameplay elements such as having an auto-scrolling screen and an inventory.  It was a fun game, but since it only took me 6 hours to complete it, I would not reccommend paying full price for it, but it is definitely something worthy to buy when it goes on sale.			"

												The conceit is that you play through the history of RPG/Adventure games from the 80's until now all of which are built upon the world of Evolandia.  As you open chests, you unlock either collectibles or new game mechanics/visuals progressing through the era.At first I wasn't sure if it was satire or pastiche as the game didn't really have much to say about what it was putting before you.  There are a few in-jokes about RPG and Adventure characters, as well as a few familiar tropes in what is generally the barest bones of stories, and with the pace at which you discover new things early on the game can be amusing.  But at a certain point about halfway through the play time the game kind of just gives up and throws random game mechanics at you, taken from other games in the genres it references to be sure, but ultimately just kind of attached briefly and then discarded.My final conclusion about the satire/pastiche debate is that the game wants to be satire, mocking the genres it sets up, but it ends up being too fond of them and reliant upon them to actually critique them and instead just becomes a straight-up pastiche.  And that, unfortunately, is the tragedy of Evoland and why it falls flat on its face.  Rather than criticizing and attacking the failures of the RPG genre of the past, it reminds you of BETTER gameplay in some interesting one-off segments and then immediately buries you under everything you ever hated about RPGs.Random encounters?  Check.  Too many random encounters?  Check.  The inability to run from random encounters without getting your face smashed in?  Check.  Repetitive enemies?  Check.  The inability to automate these boring random encounters and go get a sandwich?  Check.  Pity, since Breath of Fire figured out automated fights back in the early 90's.But the game takes one extra step and gives you an inventory that is totally for show.  You can't equip weapons (fair enough, it's a short game), but you also can't use healing items or abilities between fights.  Which means if you just BARELY survive a random encounter, you better hope you get to a save point before your next one because otherwise it's right back to town.If it weren't for the fact that the game has you spending 50% of the time wandering the overworld map getting attacked every 4-5 steps, it could be forgiven for the utter, mind-numbing tedium you find yourself chained to.  Late in the game there's a decent modern-day RPG fight and the final boss actually has a bit of cleverness to him, but at this point if you didn't love everything about RPGs before you will probably hate the entire genre once and for all.I bought it for 2.50 and don't feel like my money was completely wasted.  But at a price point any higher than that, stay the heck away.			"

												What starts out pulling at the heartstrings of you childhood, ends in nothing but disappointment and disgust. The first hour or so of Evoland brings such hope and expectations only for them to be completely destroyed. It's worth it if its on heavy sale, but game has a total playtime of roughly 4 hours (full completion) so not worth paying full price.The concept is that as you progress through the game, you progress through the history of video game evolution, so I guess given the quality of most games today compared to the 'old' days, Evoland holds true to it's aim. It goes from dragging you in with aspects of the early FF and Breath of Fire like games, and ends simply mocking FF7 and FF8 from everything from names to events. Overall it gives the feeling that the developers were heavily interested in the game at start and by about the halfway point they just wanted to be done with it all.			"

												A charming walk from classic gaming to modern gaming - puzzles are mostly simple and people familiar with Zelda will find them pretty typical.  Very short and absolutely not worth full price - the nostalgia factor simply isn't enough to redeem slogging through random battles (at times) every 3 steps and dealing with slightly-off hit boxes in the top-down view, especially with fireballs and whirlwinds.  Other commenters have mentioned that unlocks slow down considerably after the first hour of play, and they are absolutely right.  Plenty of funny little references, but funny is not enough.  Expect about 3 hours of gameplay if you go looking for some secrets but don't go back for 100%.  It feels like there's a lot more they could have done - it's a pleasant diversion at $2.50 sale but I would have overpaid at anything more.			"

												This game is extremely fun!Although short, the game was worth every cent.With evolving graphics that showed the evolution of Rpgs, the developers kept the game new and refreshing.Although I wish they utlized their smart back-to-2D mechanism a lot more to create more puzzles.The storyline is semi-drab however.. but their focus isn't the storyline but about the evolution so that doesn't discredit them too much.My Rating - 4.8/5			"

The story is short, completely not developed, copied and pasted from Final Fantasy VII (depressing the same but at least Final Fantasy gave a rich world and a rich story with lot of twists, this one is just SAD). It would have been better without a story.I do not recommend it, mechanically could be average (a mix between Zelda and Final Fantasy) and satisfy but in the end you will ask yourself, why I have lost that time?

There were a plenty of things that made me smile.I hope that this isn't a spoiler but the end of the game was a little all of a sudden to me.

												So late on this review, well I purchased this game the day that it came out or the day after not sure. Anyways it looked fun and for ten dollars, to me it looked like it was worth. So I gave it a shot, and to cut the review short to me the game is a four out of five. The different forms of combat are nice, but none of them are to extensive, which makes sense but a couple of other options would have been nice. The 3d to 2d gave an interesting puzzle or two I feel like the developers could have worked this a little more, maybe give the game more flavor. Obviously the game isn't there for a story, which is sad because. . .well I like story, the tale told in this one is generic and bland, and so are the characters. However the game is all around great, mainly because of all the awesome references, I mean how many games do you get to fly star-foxes♥♥♥♥♥♥and carry around clouds buster blade? None except this and maybe minecraft. It also had a decent boss fight at the end, and I wasn't at all disappointed by the battle, it wasn't super hard or anything but it was fun. The game is by no means hard, but defiantly has it's annoy parts, and despite it only being like a 2-4 hour game I've put more than double that into it, don't ask why, I don't know myself lol. Anyways good purchase I'd say it's worth the price if they lowered it by like three bucks. I think if a little bit more development would have been put into the combat, puzzles and story and not let references sell this game it may have been a 5 out of 5.			"

												Evoland is a small, yet enjoyable game. An easier and quicker game to 100%(achievement wise) than most, this game follows the ""evolution"" of video game development. However, the theme of ""evolution"" quickly fades as the main story of the game unveils, reeling the player in, and persuading the player to succeed in order to save the world from destruction. With many references to Zelda, Final Fantasy, and others, the player will follow a short story full of comedic moments and an incredible production of video game evolution.			"

												Evoland was a novel idea, but mediocre game. I’ve never played a game that has shined quite as bright at moments with such long stretches of uninteresting hours to separate the before mentioned shining moments. When I first bought and started Evoland I had nothing but the highest expectations for what the game was going to be. In fact I tend to have a positive bias and fondness to developers who participate in game-jams. Especially when they decide to realize those games as full fleshed out projects.  However the benefit-of-the-doubt flame that burned inside me began to get snuffed out fairly early into Evoland.Shiro Games (developer) creates a hero out of a young boy (no, really!?) who seems to need to purge the world of a darkness from what I could put together.  The game already had an innate humor to it, but they escalate the comedy through various items and achievements.  These moments although funny seem to get washed down by the endless amounts of grinding to the point of a random encounter every 2 seconds.  I could usually handle this, since I need them xp’s! However this becomes ever more frustrating when half the game you get to use it, and the other half switches between a Diablo-esque combat system and a Legend of Zelda style which is used far more for the puzzle style dungeons.With far too little story to keep my interested I quickly found myself losing interest.  Fortunately I was rejuvenated with the introduction of Evoland’s card game Double Twin.  Unfortunately I lost interest again once I had beaten the only man to play all the way through the Champion level with basic cards and no real reward for doing so.  We’re all suckers for rewards in these games. It makes all the bad wash away.Throughout the history of traditional style RPG’s there are two things I’m looking for as a player. The first being story. A good story can make me play through the most redundant and ridiculous gameplay just to get my fix. The second is gear.  I will play a game for hours on end just grinding if it means rare drops.  Evoland did neither of these for me, except in the Diablo-esque portion of the game.  Which happens to be my favorite part of the game. If you played the Evoland then you’d know that during the Diablo-esque point in the game you get loads of loot, all fake, all hilarious.Evoland consistently suffers from the need of to hold back. If only Shiro Games decided to have less restraint than Tom Green on speed Evoland easily would be worth the time and a huge recommend.  There are a few other issues, such as pacing and bugs, that even more absurd comedic elements wouldn’t allow me to overlook and give it an 8 or 9, but it’d be a realistic 6.The game also found itself contradicting itself with what you had unlocked and the randomness of switching gameplay mechanics at awkward moments only added to the overall games confusion. The only time this switching was explained or made sense was by the use of time altering crystals, which were used very appropriately as puzzle mechanics. These frustrating moments left me bewildered, wondering if I had missed something, or if the game really was just going to continue and contradict story.  What I mean to say, and to better explain, is that the game used chests to unlock different eras that were locked away by something evil.  If this were the case, why were certain areas not changing when I went back to them after I already had unlocked a newer era? Even switching between similar visual styles was jarring, and easily dismissed if they would have just put forth an effort to explain why.  With how outrageous this game could have been, all it would have taken is to make mention of some sort of barrier covering certain areas of the world restricting mechanics and graphics.  Possibly explained to you by a NPC, which there were far too few of as it was.To end this before I start beating the cliche’d horse (or is it already too late?) there is a lot of potential from the small French developer.  This game was a stepping stone.  If they learn from their mistakes I will be very excited to learn more about their newest title.Find this review and many others at www.PunchDrunkAlley.com "

												The concept of the game is interesting. As the protagonist moves forward in his journey, the game itself evolves from 8-bits to 3D settings. The game tips its hat towards the fanbase of Final Fantasy and Legend of Zelda. Thus, one will expect to alternate between real-time combat to turn-based combat. However, the plotline is lackluster. An area is plagued by a villain and the protagonist has to defeat him. Players will be able to use a couple characters at their disposable, but there is no opportunity to upgrade one's weapons/armor. Leveling up doesn't seem to enhance one's offense. On average, the game can be completed within 3-6 hours.  Despite the cons, I try not to take this game too seriously. I haven't completed the game yet, but I could if I beat the final boss. At the moment, I am occupied with completing all the achievements. Double Twin is an enjoyable card game that can played within the game.			"

												A nice little love letter to the progress that games have made over the years, but in the end it wears out its welcome when it emulates Diablo and FF7 for too long.  Early on it was very enjoyable to have my attention directed to all of the incremental improvements that I hadn't even been fully aware of as games as a medium have evolved.			"

												This game is awesome, experiencing the accumulation of improving the gameplay as you go in deeper into the story. This game starts out to feel like a Zelda game when it came out on GameBoy and in some cases, It also feels like Final Fantasy combat style. I also love the puzzle solving methods...Having this coming to iOS or Android would be a plus if it were to happen...LETS HOPE SO!!			"

												I was really excited for this game, so I supported it on Greenlight and then bought it... and after getting through the first few ""upgrades"", just got incredibly frustrated with it. It would be way better if it knew what it wanted - as it stands, it just unsuccessfully combines elements from Zelda and Final Fantasy or other JRPGs, and in doing this, jumps from being very easy to being frustratingly difficult in just a few minutes. It's sad because the art style and the upgrades are done very well, but at a certain point, it just stops being engaging and gets boring and frustrating instead. I couldn't get myself to finish it.

												Evoland is a must-play for any fan of the RPG genre. It will take you on a trip through memory lane, reliving all of your favourite games, from Final Fantasy to Zelda. You start off as an 8-bit game, and will constantly find treasure chests that will evolve the game's mechanics and the world around you. It will remind you of some of the great things about those games, but is not hesitant to point out their flaws too. Of course, Evoland is not without its own flaws, but this is a parody made out of love for the genre. The nostalgia, the tongue-in-cheek approach and the ever-changing world will make this a joy to play for RPG-fans, and will surely give them a warm feeling inside.			"

												Evoland will forever hold a spot in my top favorite RPGs of all time. While the game certainly moves you along a linear storyline, it isn't overly forceful when it doesn't have to be. Of course the art direction in this game is incredible. The nostalgia one endures when playing the first few levels is breathtaking. Think of it this way;There was once a great and original RPG. It was known throughout the world to be the best RPG ever made, and all others were inferior to it. This is not that RPG. It's just a tribute...Four stars.			"

												This game is not so much a game as it is an experimental museum.It starts off with the most simple movement concept (left and right) displayed in almost black and white (see the first screenshot) and evolves gradually until it reaches a quite advanced level.Most ideas are directly ""stolen"" from other games and pulled off with a short comment.While it may not be a long journey (it will last a bit longer than two hours) it's definitely one of the best ways to showcase the evolution of video games.I like Evoland and can wholeheartedly recommend it - even if the admission fee of 10€ is quite steep.There simply is no game like it that I know of!

												Sick of cheap flash games that copy games such as Zelda? Well I certainly am. Now, young people/those who don't have any interest in such games don't be put off by what I just said. This game has some fantastic ideas, that in my opinion were executed quite well. From 2D side scrolling to 3D combat (not spoling anything) this game really catches your eye at every turn. If you like a bit of nostalgia, or just love interesting games, then I would very much recommend this. Ok yes, sometimes it can be monotanous if you aren't very good at such games (Or just rusty in my case) due to rare autosaves, but it's an issue that didn't affect me. And with an almost puzzle sense thanks to hidden chests, you really do explore the detailed interesting levels. Once again, also thanks to a very enjoyable soundtrack, I'd really recommend this to those looking for a trip down memory lane, ot interested in something new			"

												What Jarin said, except that as one who did not play the old console games it was fun to go through that progression. I agree that once you finished ""evolving"" the current presentation, the rest of the game was much less interesting. Too bad. This was a very good ""first try"" at this approach. I would love to see the developers take the positive and negative reviews and really dig into a solid ""v1.0"" release. The current version feels like a really good proof-of-concept or demo, but as a full game the lack of depth and innovation and very shallow game play become too apparent during the last 1/4 or so of the game. It is so important to finish strong and unfortunately, after a lot of initial promise, this one does not.And yet, for $10 I recommend this ""game"", but only just.			"

The concept of making the “evolution” of video games an essential part of the game itself was well implemented, and I really liked the allusions to well known classics like Final Fantasy or Legend of Zelda. Although the battle system stays on a basic level, the boss fights are mostly a bit more of a challenge. Though my impression was definitely positive, I would recommend Evoland rather to people who can revel in this homage to the RPGs of “good old days”.  "

												""A Short Story of Adventure Video Game Evolution"" indeed. Made short by cutting the story off around the Playstation era -- Evoland has devolved into a love letter to Final Fantasy VII long before Sephiroth kills Aeris. Err, before ""Zephyros"" kills ""Kaeris,"" that is.And that love letter? It's from the creepy, overly-attached girlfriend. But THAT'S well apparent by the time ""Clink"" picks up ""Claud's"" sword and wades through the loading screens of the pre-rendered second town (Aogai) to meet with ""Sid.""The OTHER half of the game is split between nods to Final Fantasy VI and the pre-Gamecube Legend of Zelda games ... and a ham-handed Diablo parody. And I'm not particularly fond of what implies about the various Mario RPGs. Still ... there's worse ways to spend $10 USD, I guess?			"
