												Always Sometimes Monsters stands out amongst other games. As a life simulator it is consistently challenging and nerve wracking, your journey is not a ‘zero to hero’ one where you build stats and gain money.  This is a tale of the daily ups and downs poverty. At times it is like a modern Steinbeck novel and at other times a hilarious meta comedy that plays with your expectations.The gameplay is engaging and surprisingly varied and non-linear with plenty of choices, paths to choose and lovely mini-games that never break the immersion. Most importantly, playing this game is FUN. The pixel style is lovely and its animation limitations are made up for with great dialogue and environments.This game will cause arty arguments about ludonarrative-dissonance and decision making in games. Don’t think about that too much for now, enjoy this game and get engrossed in your character’s story.Oh, and devs, I moved 40 boxes. FORTY! "

												Updated Review:This is a hard game to review. I personally enjoyed what I have played thus far which at this point is 4 hours,but have not completed it. It allows the player to make choices with no morality scale,but rather allows a sense of introspection for why we make the decisions that we do and to see how it affects the story. Although I am left feeling like many of the decisions I have made would not lead to drastically different outcomes,but rather just affects my own view of myself. Again the title ""Always Sometimes Monsters"" is pretty apparent. The game starts off showing what I have the great assumption is the ending,but it is the journey of discovering how my character got to that point that is intriguing. While also discovering what I am willing to do or not do in a video game whether it is virtual or not based upon how the characters are written. I enjoy it thus far and it has been for me worth the 9$ and supporting indie developers who created the game that is inspired on their adventure around the country. If you like choice based games and interaction then this may be one for youOriginal comment:I was promised a 3-some they left for lube and never came back :(9.999999999999999/10			"

												""Always Sometimes Monsters"" was an experience, for sure. Thought-provoking, clever, humorous, and dark in all the right places. The interactive story of people at their best and worst. But I have some serious gripes. For one, there never seemed to be any consequence for starving your character. Early on I made sure my blocky textured game self was properly fed at least one brick of bacon a day. By the end of the game, however, it didn't matter. I went the last few days without so much as entering a store. No complaints of hunger, no risk of starvation... I just kept trucking. Another complaint: pacing. Man was this game hindered by poor pacing. The game runs out of interesting tasks early on, and getting on to the next ""level"" require monotonous grinding under the guise of ""man does real life suck or what?"" And I get it. You want to buy expensive things, you've got to work for it... or be greasy enough to rob people blind. But as a game mechanic it turned the experience into a chore. But I kept on trucking, like my malnutritioned game character. I had to get to the end. Surely that would make it worth it? All of these choices - so many variables! How will my story turn out? Well, SPOILERS...It ends the same way every time. Me in an alleyway with a gun pointed at me. Did I betray my friend? Yep. Marry my girl? Yep. Did everything end up falling apart? Yep. Okay, seems logical. If you're a♥♥♥♥♥♥ you're going to get a♥♥♥♥♥♥ending. I'll do it differently! I'll help my friend. Let my girl marry him. Maybe now I won't end up all distraught in an alley? Didn't I make friends in my travels? Friends who swore they'd help me and be there for me? Wasn't I a good person? Rescuing dogs and helping old ladies? Nope. I'm in an alley, begging for the sweet release of death. Well, that isn't very fun. Again, this feels like lazy design disguised as some seriously angsty philosophy... life sucks. It doesn't matter what you do, who you are, or who your friends are, it all ends the same way: you, in an alley, hoping some guy will execute you to make the pain go away. Really unfortunate. You can be a horrible monster or a paragon and it ends the same way. What, bad guys don't win sometimes? Good guys lose, sure, but they don't EVER prevail?I may have to play this through a few more times, but what I'm seeing from other players is the same preachy, bummer ending. I'll rescind this review if need be; assuming there's a way to end it with me not sucking the proverbial barrel of a gun.Edit: As of 5/24/2014 I'm seeing that there were some finale bugs that resulted in the player character  ending up in his/her homeless predicament regardless of doggy rescuing and old lady assisting. It seems the devs have corrected this. It also seems that there are a few happy endings that require a bit of finagling... choosing arbitrary reasons for the initial break-up, choosing how to make a quick buck, either planting seeds or harvesting medicinal marijuana... I don't know why. I still can't recommend it. Some people will enjoy this. It's an interesting story with some flashes of brilliance; just not enough. If you like bummerfests (as that is likely how your story will end JUST LIKE REAL LIFE MAYBE SOMETIMES ALWAYS),  and you don't mind monotonous grinding, THIS might be the game for you.			"

												Pre-emptive warning: I haven't spoiled any major plot points, but there are some tonal spoilers for one of the game's endings.I err on the side of recommending this game, but I can't claim that it isn't very deeply flawed. Its main failing is that the story is about a lot of things, but the ending is 100% reliant on whether or not you ""win back"" your love interest. Personally, I thought it would be most satisfying to play a character initially very deeply set on reconnecting with his ex, but gradually coming to terms with the breakup and, in the end, letting the ceremony go uninterrupted. In this playthough, I had been successful in almost every aspect of my life: religiously keeping a journal, participating only in activities I believed in, and treating everyone with kindness. My character's future was promising. So, what ending did I get? The one where I'm suicidal, nihilistic and alone because I couldn't bear the pain of losing my ex-girlfriend, who I'd had every intention of getting over on the way to her wedding. This is the only ending possible if you fail to ""win her back"", regardless of your other achievements or the way you've roleplayed your character. The game as a whole could be massively improved by the removal of the framing device at the beginning and end, as, for many endings, it fundamentally doesn't make sense and stands contrary to the story's themes. There's a fine post-credits scene, but it didn't negate my confusion at my character's hysterical response to making a perfectly fair, mature decision that, in my mind, caused him no great pain. It was a very ""Huh?"" moment for me. As for the rest of the story, it's pretty good. Extremely tonally uneven (I found myself going ""Really?"" probably a dozen times) but not at all bad when you look past that, and I genuinely enjoyed most of the campaign. The trip was gruelling but satisfying, with more than its share of close calls and poignant moments, and it felt like I was coming to the end of a long journey when I finally arrived at the ex's wedding location. It's not realistic, but there's a realness to it -- something humbling about the situations you're faced with, an earnestness in the way the game presents love, friendship, and hope. I guess that's why I felt degraded by the ending... I mean, how can my character be so nihilistic when the past month has probably been the most interesting in his life? He's learned so much, experienced so much, yet the game gives me a pitch-black failstate because I didn't adhere to the arbitrary goal. It's not only unsatisfying, but also troubling philosophically. I guess I would recommend this game with the cliche that you should focus on the journey, not the desitation... or play with the LI in mind. Either way.			"

												I really really wanted to like this game. I did. I got it, I was super interested in it. It held my attention well for the most part. . . Until the ending. I know others have stated it but I absolutely loath the ending. Hands down, I really enjoyed this game until you got near the end. I enjoyed going through the turmoil with my character, watching them grow as a person, seeing the effects of the choices I made. . . But the ending is such a slap in the face. Spoiler alert for anyone wishing to play the game. Do not read beyond this point:So I pick my character, I have my love interest, I lose my love interest and my life spirals out of my hands. Not a bad start to a game. It was definitely unique so I did enjoy that aspect of the game. Then I played on and I found myself getting immersed. My character gets a job  at an advertising place, while there though I save a young man from commiting suicide simply by being honest and not judging someone I don't even know. Kudos to you game developers. I liked this.I get to the next time. I continue helping people from a transgender man to a hungry young boy to even my ""friend's"" marriage all while being reminded of my choices and what to do when I meet up with my ex. I think hands down my favorite level is with my 'uncle' whose now a pastor. How finding out that his love for me as his own child turned his life around and how he wanted to be a better man. I dunno. I really liked this part. I also liked the part where he asked me what I wanted to do. Was it to reconsile with my ex. Was I going to finally let go? What was I doing. . . Now at this point in the story my motiviation had gone from 'get back with your ex' to possibly letting them go (In my eyes the relationship wasn't that good if it ended in the direction it did) and to make a better start.and then Vegas/Ending. . . The game PUNISHES you for not going with your ex. It really does. I don't care what anyone says. I played through it and even though I had a high compatibility with my ex I decided to let them go on with their life and Bam. SHot in the head as a hobo. WTF?! Seriously. I was finally making amends with an old friend, seeing them marry my ex and I get shot in the head as a hobo cause I couldn't get over it?! FLIPPITY DO DAH AH! I hated that. I absolutely hated that. So I reload and interupt the wedding and profess my love. Get accepted, undo everything I had done (Making amends, learning to stand on my own two feet) and even that ending wasn't really rewarding. I just.  . . I hated the ending so much. I still do. It's been months since I last played it but that ending has stayed so vividly in my mind because of how much I had enjoyed the first 2/3's of the game until the end. That's basically the end of my rant. If they've updated the endings I may give the game another shot but as of right now, no. I regret owning this game and that's really sad for me to say as again I did enjoy a good chunk of it.			"

												Always Sometimes Monsters is frequently tedious and rife with things that shatter any suspension of disbelief. I had high hopes for this game, but it really fails to deliver on its promise of an open story of moral ambiguity in favor of a tedious romp through a poorly explained plot that looks like it was written by a 15-year-old going through their ""edgy"" stage. There is a lot to do, but none of it feels especially worth doing, and a lot of it affects nothing so far as I can tell. Maybe there's a point to buying crab rather than chicken apart from wasting money. Also, ideas like ""Sandwich Furtures"" traded at a terminal in a sandwich shop, banks that require a security question to make a deposit, and day care providers willing to overlook an allegation of terrorism on a criminal background check are all sufficiently stupid (and not actually funny) that they do nothing but detract from the story.The characters are too close to being parodies of archetypes to feel truly endearing, and some of them are introduced to disappear completely from the game moments later. I stayed at a girl's house for nine days and saw her exactly once, despite the fact that the she seemed like she could be an interesting and dramatic character. Meanwhile, I have to deal with the Kurt Cobain / Courtney Love analogues far more than I want. Too often, the choices I wanted to make I could not, and the questions I wanted answered were not.Production-wise, the graphics are bland and inconsistent Some characters look completely different in their close-up versions and their walking versions. The imagery is often too cartoony for how dark the subject matter is trying to be (although a lot of that ""darkness"" comes off as a ham-fisted attempt at shock value), but not cartoony enough to feel like more than a bland vaguely anime look. The sound effects are ear-bleedingly jarring at times, with obnoxious beeps and sudden bursts of animal noise contrasted by the near complete silence of the game world apart from the music (of which I have generally few complaints). Even when the sound effects are appropriate, the lack of other appropriate sound effects make them feel out of place. If that was a design decision, it was a terrible one, but judging by the overall production value, I suspect they just couldn't be bothered to put any serious work into them.I'm glad I got this as part of bundle, because I'd feel cheated if I paid for this by itself.

												A classic case of an initial concept losing its way.Play the first few hours, read reviews or previews, and you'll see an emotionally-driven story about choice and fate, where you're penniless and broken and have to go on a difficult journey to getting your life and partner back.However, all these concepts get abandoned and by the end you're left unfulfilled, with cop-outs and odd character behaviour along the way, until the game is telling you you're a broke bum who desperately wants your ex back, when in fact you the player are ACTUALLY full of money and don't give a crap about the ex because s/he's a jerk.You might go through hell and do drugs if it meant getting the love of your life back, but would you do it just to go to someone's wedding? No, but the game apparently thinks people do that.As a cop-out, you even get to make some choices about the actual plot. As in you decide who dumped who, and why. But this one 'choice' hidden away in a conversation, a couple of hours before the end, is what impacts the ending most of all, without even alluding to it. Madness.In one person's story, you dumped a girl because you wanted to bang some more chicks, then changed your mind and crashed the wedding and she came crawling back. In another player's story, you got dumped and now you're acting like a crazed stalker to see her again and ruin everything. In another, you may not give a crap about her. The game, however, is adamant that in each scenario you're going to the wedding to crash it or be a wuss and do the whole ""I just want her to be happy but I still love her"" shtick, and likely end up depressed anyway. Because the plot isn't as flexible with choice as it wants to say it is.Other little things about the game can make it frustrating. Press space to speed up the text, and you might end up accidentally making a choice that pops up without the usual pause, and you'll have to reload your most recent save. Play Blackjack and if you and the dealer have the same hand (a 'push'), you still LOSE.In hindsight, my hours would've been better spent playing something else.			"

												It's hard to review this, as it gave me a rush of MANY conflicting emotions. While I personally did not enjoy it to the level most of Steam seems to, I definitely see this game had alot of potential, as well as being an honestly original experience.""Always Sometimes Monsters"" is a strange yet human experience where (after the foreboding intro) your character, an unsuccessful story writer, is invited to their ex's wedding and you go on a quest to make your way there over the course of a month to either try and win them back or be supportive. Along the journey the player can make a multitude of choices all throughout the game which have very distinct impressions on the story, often with an obvious placement of morality as to whether they're considered good choices or bad, which is what half the gameplay is comprised of. The other half of the game being dedicated doing events & oddjobs throughout the game for expenses in order to progress to the next town AND to feed yourself, as you have an actual stamina meter... that is almost redundant because all it really decides is if you die in your sleep or not. I'm serious. I understand why this is the way progression is made, it really gets across the feeling of barely being able to scrape by as economy and almost life itself seems to be against you, and cleverly makes you feel that sometimes you feel to do questionable things such as theft to get by, but I personally feel this negatively impacts the momentum of the story, as there are portions where you might have to grind just to move the story along. There ARE minigames to mix things up should you play them, but there's one that kind of... comes out of nowhere? I lost where the story was going for a second there.The dialogue itself is fairly well written, characters DO feel human and even minor characters display personality, but alot of the characters just feel like jerks for the sake of being jerks. Or influencing players to do bad things in a few cases. Unfortunately, alot of these characters are major characters, making empathetic or relatable connections very hard to have. Since I have problems caring for the characters, I have a hard time caring for the story. Combined with how dragged out the story feels due to having to spend time managing expenses, and eventually I'm not even playing for the journey, I'm playing for the conclusion. Problem is the game seems to put more emphasis on the journey because, despite there technically being multiple endings, they're all dependant on a copout collection of choices you can make during the end of the game, making the ending also feel slapped on. Another review goes into better detail on this.As for presentation, there isn't much to say. the 16-bit graphics are detailed. It has no voice acting but I'm alright with that. The main issue I have is with the music. Not that the music is BAD or anything, but the looping for the tracks is HORRIBLE. I really don't think it should start from the very beginning every time, it sounds sloppy.Again, I didn't like the game too much. Despite the thumbs down however, I WON'T suggest people ACTIVELY avoid it. It is definitely an interesting experience. Just do yourself a favor and get it on a discount or something.			"

												Let me start off by saying that this game has a lot of potential. The idea of a game that lets you choose your own path starting from the bottom in this way is somewhat unique, and it is fun for a while. The issue with this game is that I feel that I merely have the illusion of choice (which I realize could be the point, but it still annoys me). It seems as though I can make some little decisions that mean nothing, but I am essentially forced to follow a fairly linear story for the most part. In one instance, wihtout major spoilers, I had a job moving boxes. My character repeatedly complained about the job and recommended I quit. However I decided to truck on. eventually, 96 boxes and 30 minutes later, nothing had changed. Sadly, I tried to take a screenshot using f12, and it kicked me to the start screen, losing all of my work.This leads me to my second complaint, controls. I appreciate the simplicity, but it is too much. I haven't found a way to remap keys which results in the keyboard using the arrow keys for movement, enter for actions, and escape for back and menu. Considering the constant use of the enter key, I am forced to either cram my hands together, or endlessly shift my hand. Using a gamepad does not fair much better. The analog stick is finnicky at best and for some reason the x button is action rather than a. considering the constant travel around the world that is necessary to proceed, this is a major hassle.Finally, the game doesn't run at 1080p. I didn't look too hard, but I couldn't find anything that warned me about this, and frankly, I kind of expected it to at least scale. I'm not sure what it is about this game's particular visuals, but they seriously hurt my eyes as well. I constantly feel like they are being strained despite no problems with other games or computer activities.Ultimately, I can't recommend this gam in its current state. The idea is there, and honestly, it lured me in, but it just isn't done well enough. If given another chance, I would wait to see improvement and further reviews before buying.			"

""Every man builds his world in his own image. He has the power to choose, but no power to escape the necessity of choice."" ~ Ayn RandAlways Sometimes Monsters is one of those experiences that would make you stop in a random moment of your daily life, and reminiscence some irrelevant happenstance from long past. You'd ponder, you'd sweat. You'd ask yourself if you did the right thing back then, or how your life would be turned out if you'd do otherwise. You'd feel uneasy for no relevant reason to your actuality. The only relevant reason is that your conscious decided to pay you a visit and you just got a hit on home.On a rainy night, a furious young man with a 2000 dollar suit and an Italian accent slams the door behind him as he proceeds towards the dark alley. In mere seconds, a shaky middle aged gentleman with spiteful features does follow him, and orders the Italian to come back that instant. The Italian refuses, and declares that he is done. They start to argue, as the Italian keeps walking away and the other man keeps throwing threats around like Halloween candy. Suddenly, their argument is cut short with the appearance of a faceless hobo who asks them to listen to a story, with a .45 at hand. As his ex-boss keeps yelling for the Italian to shoot the hobo, he keeps the hobo on gunpoint and makes a choice... This is the defining moment of Always Sometimes Monsters, and as you make your very first choice, the camera rolls to tell you the hobo's story.Always Sometimes Monsters is a story of someone as real and as ordinary as you or me, who'd hit rock bottom and take a journey to redefine their place and worth in this world. The narrative is excellent and compels you to take every little aspect of the game personal. I've emphasized with my character so deeply and invested in her achievements, her choices and her personality so thoroughly... I found out that I've been playing the game as myself all along. Considering the whole display of the game consists of 16 bit graphics, a repetitive techno soundtrack and a text narration, such atmosphere is a great feat by itself.The world you play is as uncanny and as simple as the real world, and nothing is sugarcoated. The game is a contemplation on human nature and the element of choice. By definition, the storyline forces you to make choices and live with their consequences at every given turn. There will be moments that would make you, and moments that would break you. You will be forced to face the ugly, cruel and downtrodden part of reality; nuances and topics that we'd better left ungazed in our daily life. Sex, drugs, language, immoral and unethical, even violent actions are only the beginning of the content you'll be forced to deal with. By the first hour of your gameplay, you'll become familiar with the term ""lesser evil"".As you may have guessed so far, the game has multiple endings and huge replay value. You are given an open world with limited time for one conquest. The journey in between is what would define you in the end. One thing that I've appreciated the most is that there are achievements only relevant to plot progress. As you'd complete one casual playthrough, you'd have every achievement. This encourages the player to experience the game with honest choices and make his/her own decisions: play the game as it is intended to be played.Bold in tone, bare in nature, ordinary in content and extraordinary in achievement, Always Sometimes Monsters is an experience. Take out a can of beer, pick your headphones and start the game. By the end, you'll discover more about your own self than you'd be comfortable with.Please also check out Lady Storyteller's Curator page here - follow for regular updates on reviews for other games!

												I am usually a fan of games that are thought provoking with branching and complex storylines, as well as ethical decisions that affect the world around you. There were some points where the game was very enjoyable and others where it taught be something about my own morals (pretty straight, but willing to hose the people who try to cheat me). And I enjoyed how the creators were meta, and stuck themselves in the game. And some points were pretty hilarious, like when I broke into a doctor's mansion to recover evidence of his teddybear fetish for blackmail.Unfortunately, there were many points in the game where I was unsure of what to do. I would spend a good half hour or more wandering around town trying to find something, ANYTHING to do to pass the evening so they game would FINALLY let me start a new day. Othertimes it was very redundant. Don't get me wrong, it was hilarious to get a job butchering pigs ALL DAY LONG... but when I've got to do that for three days in a row, it got pretty dull. I guess work is work, and that's reflective of real life. But in the end I felt it sort of forced my hand. As recommended, I named the main character after me, and the ex after my ex. But I really had no desire to travel across country to go to her wedding. I mean, inviting me to her wedding? That was a ""dickish"" thing to do. I'd rather work hard and get my life back on track... But butchering pigs was pretty dull, so in the end I bought a bus ticket, just so I could pull out a little more entertainment out of this game. Because there was literally NOTHING else I could do at that point.I also wasn't a huge fan of a lot of the dialogue. There was a lot of swearing, trash talking, etc that detracted (I felt) from the game. Maybe that's just me, but it felt overused. Also some of the dialogue and cut scenes were... long and without much substance. Maybe that's another way this game tried to mirror real life. But sometimes I felt myself skipping through scenes, thinking ""I really need a break, but I HAVE TO SAVE MY GAME!"" 15 minutes later, I finally get a chance to save.I really hate to say I don't recommend this game. You can tell a lot of thought and effort went into it. It's only $10, and a lot of people really enjoy it. You might really enjoy it too. Who knows? Maybe it's worth taking the chance. But for me, it wasn't worth the investment.			"

												This game is disappointing on many levels, but the quickest way to explain it is ""The ride was much more enjoyable than the destination"". The Good:I enjoyed Always Sometimes Monsters for how inclusive it is and the little changes it makes for the character you choose and the sexuality of that character. The attention to detail is really nice. Some parts of the game are monotonous, but I find that it completely jives with the overall theme of the game. I didn't have a problem being bored, because the boredom of mundane work is kind of the point of the game. I did enjoy the many ethic decision making the game forces upon you. I did find out something about myself that I didn't know before playing, and that experience is very rare for someone as self-reflective as me. The Bad:The end is terrible. I expected my past decisions in the game to affect how I would choose the ending, but they didn't. The ending you get depends complete on the last 3 days that are completely scripted and on rails. I was enjoying my freedom for most of the game and then suddenly everything went into this singular tunnel. A lot of the choices are binary, but it's never more apparent than at the end of the game. Another problem is I kept thinking that the time limit would be more constrictive, but I got to the goal with double digit days left over and I got no reward for showing up early. In essence, the game punished me for being efficient. This also makes it possible for you to play the game with no real reason to ever deviate from society’s moral standards. You don't have to choose between love and ethics, you're choosing between working hard and being lazy since you have a ton of time to make it to your destination. This game has the same problems as Tale Tale Game's games; choices are fun, endings that are not meaningfully impacted by your previous decisions ruins the fun. What would have made it better:More moral choices, giving how many days until certain jobs or areas open up, telling you how many towns are between you and the goal, and finally make a decent ending(s). Recommendation:Skip this game. It's pretentious and the ending will spoil any fun you'll have during the game. I am excited for the next game from this studio, but this experimental game is far from optimized. It suffers from being part of the first wave and I hope the devs will learn a lot from it and from the community response to it. "

												I was really looking forward to playing this game after I had heard about its creation: the developer was inspired by his hippy, back-packing roadtrip across the US and Canada, and sought to expand the treatment of morals in videogames. I'm a sucker for story-rich games and love ethical ambiguity (for example, my favorite game, The Witcher).But once I got into this, the play was just awful. I found myself doing stupidly simple tasks, like one job where I literally have my character just go left and right across the screen carrying boxes from a conveyor belt to a truck (over 25 times!). It seems like the creators just had very little creativity when it came to gameplay. Not to mention the self-referential jokes that started to sound haughty and overdone.Many times during the game I found myself bored and confused: why are all these shops here? What is the point of this stamina bar that LITERALLY DOES NOTHING? Why create all these items if they serve no purpose?? And the worst question for an RPG game - WHERE are all the people/dialogue??I would normally excuse these kinds of detail problems if there was a great story to hold onto...but again, this element lacks in ASM. We get a very short introduction to several characters, are told to apply moral depth and meaning to the relationship our character has with them, only to then be expected to ignore said storylines for half the game and be satisfied with a terribly shallow development/ending.To me, this game was a contrived attempt by hipsters to create something ""meaningful;"" akin to making a really great sauce while burning the meat.

												There are four kinds of pain:1) Physical pain: Injury caused to your physical body; cuts, scrapes, bruises, etc.2) Mental pain: Traumatic thought; particularly rough lines of reasoning that cause distress.3) Emotional pain: Distress revolving around the way you are feeling; pangs of sympathy for someone in an unfortunate situation.4) Soul pain: Like emotional pain, but deeper, and personal. Not simply empathy, but more of a... resonance between a person or event and yourself.This game hurt my soul.			"

												I don't write game reviews, but Always Sometimes Monsters is an exception.  This game, or life sim, more appropriately labeled, is a masterpiece.  The rarity of violence makes the few scenes that contain violence that much more intense and it is complimented by dark storylines and troubled characters.  The character development is flawless and deep and it is a delight to see your character's story play out through flashbacks and the choices you make throughout your journey.  This has all the makings for Indie game of the year and I hope it achieves this.			"

												Here is NTR the video game. It has no happy endings and only the decisions made within the last 30 minutes of the game actually matter. If you played only the last 30 minutes of the game, you'd get a more logical ending than playing through the entire thing.*SPOILER WARNING*I played a character who went through an adventure of self-discovery and learning how to love oneself + have hope for the future, supported by those who she built relationships throughout the journey with. Didn't matter. Still a depressing ending where everything the game invested into character building and plot building is thrown in the drain for a completely cheesy ""I hate myself, I am going to attempt to kill myself or die completely alone on the streets"" ending. It didn't even make any sense, as there was absolutely no reason she'd end up there after everything she went through. Literally, almost all of the choices have absolutely no consequence on what ending you'll get and how your character will turn out. I looked up the other endings and they are all pretty much the exact same, with minor differences in dialogue.Do yourself a favor. Don't buy this game. It is seriously infuriating to see absolutely nothing come from such a long and, what should have been, an enlightening journey. It's literally just an NTR bait game, where you have to decide whether you want to let someone NTR you or if you want to NTR someone else.*note*NTR stands for Netorare, which is pretty much the equivalent of ""I stole your romantic partner and flaunted our love in front of you so that you could choke on hatred and sorrow"". It is the absolute worst thing and this game forces your character into it, even if you try to make them appreciate their life and find deeper meaning/a purpose after lost-love. The worst part is that the game actually makes you think that an ending like that is completely possible, thanks to the long-lost uncle character giving you a foothold and moral support, along with making you feel like a winner in life again; teaching you that there is more to life than we let ourselves originally think. It's all about perspective.My perspective:This game is utter garbage. Don't trust the other reviewers. There is the ""Mass Effect 3 Ending"" paradigm of endings here and A LOT of completely trashed potential. It is actually quite depressing and infuriating. For the love of all that is holy, don't subject yourself to this game. You've done nothing worth being punished by this pile of wasted potential, I guarentee it.			"

I LIKE things that aren't based around world war whatever or aliens or zombies or goats.   Too many of the situations in the game come off as trite.

												Always Sometimes Monsters represents the worst kind of stupid game: it is a stupid game that calls itself a brilliant work of art. ASM is advertised as a story-driven experience, but ASM’s narrative is at best silly and at worst downright dumb. The plot involves slowly meandering through less than a handful of sparsely populated, small towns to dissuade a former lover from marrying someone else. Along the way, decisions must be made about whether to be nice or mean to uninspired, cardboard cut-out NPCs. You are never really provided a reason to care about the former lover. You are simply expected to care about her/him. This expectation applies to all the other flimsily developed NPCs as well. Sometimes they have problems involving drug-use, sex, violence, suicide, etc., but these subjects are never thoughtfully explored.  ""Mature content"" is inserted as if merely including it is enough to elicit emotional investment in the characters and story--but the trivialization of sophisticated issues only comes off as a failed attempt to be ""edgy.""Clumsy, unpolished writing also plagues the entire game. Dialogue between the protagonist and NPCs is uncreative, insipid, and dull-witted. Characters often spew unnecessary profanity like children who say “bad words” to sound “cool.” And when ASM isn’t transparently trying to be provocative, it bludgeons you with trite declarations about life, choices, and consequences. The ponderous tone of these statements gives an impression of self-importance, rather than intelligence. While playing, I couldn't help imagining the folks at Vagabond Dog spouting this stuff to each other and saying ""that's deep, man.""Actually, I didn't have to imagine much because ASM's creators apparently think shoving themselves into the game at every available opportunity is clever.Pixelated versions of the creators stand atop the Delvolver logo. They make an appearance during character selection. They show up in every coffee shop of every town. They even squeeze themselves into the epilogue. And their dialogue often consists of praise of ASM's content and comments such as “whoa, meta.” Maybe the cameos would be less irritating if there were more NPCs (and more stimulating NPCs) to interact with, but the NPC population dwindles as the game progresses. Instead of repeatedly congratulating themselves, the team at Vagabond Dog should have focused on making ASM a better game.Definitely, not recommended.			"

												Our lives are full of choices; ups and downs that dictate our destiny and forge our path through the world. They're the moments that define us, and for better or worse steer our life one way or another. Always Sometimes Monsters builds itself on this intrinsic aspect we all experience, but does so to intentionally take us down roads we would hopefully never travel down in our own lives. Unrestrained and unafraid of presenting dark and controversial moments, it's a shockingly human experience that's alarmingly introspective, making me continually question myself as I lead my character into increasingly dire circumstances, but at the same time is untraditionally relatable. I connected with my character to a degree I've rarely experienced while playing a game, and this ability to bring the player into a second life with nothing but text and pixels is what makes ASM such an unprecedented achievement.There's little I can say about story specifics as so much of it is derived from your own decisions and how you interact with the world, but in essence this is the story of one person on a journey to find where they fit into the world and what's left for them in life after hitting rock bottom. Times are tough and the situations you're placed in are the sort of moments we'd prefer to ignore and forget. The content warning in the description isn't a ploy; sex, drugs, illegal activities, foul language, and death abound and the developers make no attempt to gloss over or sugarcoat them into something palatable. Whether you get offended is not the end objective; the question of if you will is, and is what drives an story that at each moment seems to sink you deeper into insurmountable circumstances, the outcome of which is almost entirely in your own hands.The moments when I was forced to make a choice between equally unpleasant scenarios are the moments when ASM shines and accomplishes something few games have attempted, dealing with subject matter entirely unlike what we are used to seeing in games. It's not fantastical or larger than life, it's simply the story of a person and the people around them, moving emotionally from joy to suffocating depressing, to mundane daily tasks and the moments in between. It's strange to play something that so closely resembles real life, but it's even more unusual for it to be as engaging and intriguing as it is in ASM.Where the developers falter is in merging their idea of a human experience told through a game, with the limitations and exceptions of a traditional game. Sandwiched between the narrative decisions and character development are the usual, uninspired RPG standbys, from fetch quests to currency farming, or simply poor pacing and direction. I appreciate the freedom you are given to continue your story or completely ignore it and laze around doing nothing of importance, but the problem is you are rarely given enough freedom to actually warrant being left to roam around on your own. Where there a choice between being shuffled from one story moment to the next, or stumbling around trying to find it for myself with options to engage in unnecessary fluff that ultimately matters not (such as feeding your character), I'd have gladly opted for the former as at times the pacing is so slow I found it hard to continue playing for long stretches of time.For as basic as the sprites themselves may be, developer Vagabond Dog has manage to inject an exceptional amount of character and distinction to its environments and the people in it. Character portraits are drawn memorable and add a lot to the otherwise entirely text based story, and the environments you traverse sparely populated but with just enough detail to keep each area feeling unique. The soundtrack is a little less consistent, as for every excellent track there's one that's just as annoyingly repetitive and dull.Always Sometimes Monsters isn't without problems, but like the characters in it they are simply part of a whole that you can still love despite their obvious flaws. Nothing and no one is perfect, as the decisions you're forced to make in the game and your own life can hold testament, but if you're willing to look past them there's something very special laying underneath. ASM is not what it looks like, or in many ways even what it proclaims itself to be, but what it is is something that connected with me like few experiences in any medium have managed. I became invested in my character's fate and longed to see them get the happy ending they so desired, and when the moment finally came to seize it I came to the startlingly realization that maybe I had been blinded by what I really wanted. Maybe my selfish desires weren't meant to be and I was attempting to create something that could never be.But perhaps in the end that's the point of it all. To show that we're all human, that we all long to be happy, and occasionally we must become a monster to achieve it.Disclosure: Always Sometimes Monsters was reviewed using a final review copy.

												This was a real pleasure to play through. I wouldn't call this a click adventure, although there isn't much ""gameplay"", as your words speak louder than actions here. I liked the art style presented here, the basic 8 bit graphics work wonders. It'a a shame there wasn't any voice acting as this would of made the whole experience even better but I can look past this since it is so well written. The story had me gripped, there is plenty of replay value as you can have different endings from what I've worked out, although you might want to spread out your game plays since chain playing this could probably get boring fast. There is also a sense of an open world here too. You can walk around and always find something different to do.A full playthrough took me about three hours, is it worth the £6,99? definitely.			"

												The very definition of ""Punishing"" versus challenging gameplay. The good ending is nigh impossible to get on your first play through, since so many of the damn mechanics of this game are hidden from the player.That, in and of itself, could actually be palatable, hell, even desirable, if this game didn't leave a bad taste in your mouth.It's a story at the attempt of redemption. You're out to get the one who got away back before they can marry another, which already causes a schism betwixt me and the character. I had no desire to get back with my ex, they, in the story, left me for a stupid and shallow reason. And I couldn't just say ""♥♥♥♥ 'em"" and live my own life, since it becomes obvious fairly quickly that the only way for your character to move on with their life is to break up this wedding.This game has some really cool potential for story-telling moments, and their system of having the player make choices they didn't even know they had could be pretty cool, but the execution all relies on the desire to see the story through to the end, and I can honestly say that it didn't reel me in. I had no desire to finish this game, and I highly recommend anyone and everyone skip this title.			"

												It is an allright game, but if you're looking for the experience promised in the description... well, it kinda is true. But it doesn't quite feel that way.Most choices that have any kind of effect are choices between being a monster and not being one. I'm talking about things like cold-bloodedly allowing the death of someone so you can keep 100$.I'm on my third playthrough now, and I don't get the feeling that you get any agency in deciding how your character develops as a person.I also couldn't actively spend more time with the npcs I found genuinely interesting. Instead I was pushed ever towards the main storyline. Overall, I had a better ""life simulator / tough choices / Am I a monster?"" experience in a lot of free games out there, let alone professional titles like Dragon Age or Mass Effect, which despite being set in a fantastic scenario and featuring archetypical people still managed to feel more believable than what this game asked me to take at face value.You're playing a totally shitbat crazy person. If you can accept that, and don't mind (very rarely) being pulled out of the overall serious tone of the game by scenes that simply don't seem to fit well with the rest, you might give this a try.Be prepared for typos though. They won't be your constant companions, but together with the occasional confusion about your (and your ex's) gender, it does cause me to raise an eyebrow.But while I wouldn't call the production a professional quality, it still is overall clearly above your average indie title, let alone most free to play games.

												You'll notice that I only got 5 minutes on this game. Because I played the GoG version of this game already, and I just felt like increasing my game count on Steam when I got this off the latest Humble Bundle. Also because Steam requires me to play the game for 5 minutes before I can post a review. Don't let the lack of hours here influence your opinion, please. I'm sure my review below will show that I know the game. This review was also orignally going to be MUCH longer, but it turns out that Steam doesn't like it when I write too many words.ASM is a game made in RPGmaker, which already earns it negative points because RPGmaker is an awful engine, that is all about your choices, expect not really. You're allowed to pick your character from a handful of characters in a room, and then you can pick your LI from a handful of characters in another room. Yes, you can choose to be a gay man, or a lesbian, because this game wants you to think its ~progressive~ when the entire game is written to be pretenious. The game has you going from town to town and sometimes experiencing flashbacks, trying to earn money and fix the ""main problem"" in each town so you can get to your LI and try to stop her wedding. Of course, you also get dialogue choices that allow you to say ""Nah, I'm over her"", but they don't matter and I'll tell you why soon. The game has four ""towns"" for you to deal with, with the first town having the most content. It's an awful place that lets you see first hand how choices don't matter at all. You did Option A? Ending A happens. Did Option B? Ending A still happens, but with a teensy-tiny variation. The only time where the game isn't sniffing its own ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ is in the second town when it decides to correctly say Republicans and Democrats are both terrible people who are in corporate pockets.There are also flashbacks, as mentioned, about your college life and the life you had with your LI. These flashbacks, for me, only confirmed that my old college friend and my LI were both huge ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s who I would refuse to deal with if I had the choice, which I don't, because this game provides as much ""freedom of choice"" as a Fable game, but at least Fable can provide variations in the endings for each choice. Anyway, when you meet your LI, it turns out they didn't want you at the wedding, but your friend, who is marrying LI, invited you. The same friend that your LI told you to screw over and the same friend that your LI called a creepy little stalker. Turns out your friend managed to get a publishing deal even after you screwed him (guess your LI only wants to go with whomever is gonna get the deal), and the LI's father decides to confront you on your choices in the game, even through it doesn't matter, because all you can say is ""I regret it"" and ""I don't regret it"". You are also asked for the reason you're around, and I reconfirmed that I was around only to say goodbye to my LI. You're forced to go to Vegas and gamble because you probably only got $1000 to your name and you need $15000 if you want to buy a tuxedo and get the best ""ending"" for you and your friend (otherwise he dies or you lose your book deal).Wedding happens, I let the girl go so she can get married, and yet despite me saying repeatedly that I did not want to get back with my LI, I turn out to become a bum because she was my TRUE LUV and without her, despite the fact that I could easily get a job and find someone else, I'm just a useless sack of♥♥♥♥♥♥So I replayed it, this time going for the girl, slightly changing my choices, mostly taking the bad ones, dealing with that AWFUL boxing minigame in the third town, telling the parent I regret all my choices and I want the girl back, and then I win her back. Woo. Now my friend is the bum because she was his TRUE LUV even though he had his own book deal he could finish, and he was doing pretty god damn fine before he got with the girl.This game doesn't respect your choices. It doesn't even care about them. It's a game about you being in true love with a huge ♥♥♥♥♥ (or huge ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ if its a guy), your friend being a prick, and everyone you know being useless ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s, except for the cowboy guy in Town 3, who was the only person in the game worthy of any respect. I was tempted to play a 3rd time and make all the worst choices, because I suspect so long as you say ""I regret"", you want the LI back, you make sure your book deal is safe and that your ""friend"" lives, you can get the ""best end"", which is you getting back with an awful person.I regret the money I paid for for this game on GoG and regret the dollar I gave to Humble Bundle, since it included this piece of crap. 3/10, and that's only because I'm feeling generous. I wish Steam would increase the character count for reviews so I can really get into how awful this game is. Now to remove this piece of crap from my computer again.			"

												starts out fun but quickly devolves into monotony. and why should i give a ♥♥♥♥ about my ex? its the entire impetus of the story and doesn't seem to offer any alternatives, not even going to the wedding just to ♥♥♥♥ it up rather than trying to win your ex back. the choices in the game are entirely binary, which just isnt true in real life. for example: choice A - give key to landlord, choice B - run awayI wanted to run away just because I needed some extra time and I knew the landlord wouldnt give it to me. my character instead tells the landlord to ♥♥♥♥ off and calls him a miserable old man etc. wtf? choices dont need to be 100% good or 100% evil. its 2016.I refunded this game for 2 dollars			"

												UPDATE - Yup... just finished it... Awful waste of time! RPG Maker game. Lots of bugs. Waste of time.ORIGINAL POST - Sorry, can't do it! Can't recommend it! I've put hours and hours into this game, andI just don't get it. It's not hard... it's just slow. It's a game all about choices, and yet I can't seem to make the choices I want to make in real life.SPOILERS• I get locked out of my appartment. I have a crowbar in my inventory, but I can't use it on the door.• There is a faulty lever. I have a screwdriver on me, but I can't use it on the lever.At the moment I have over $1000, but I can't pay off someone's depts on their car I need. Instead I have to race around a track... but first, I need to upgrade the car, so I need transmission, chemicals, and tires.In order to get the transmission, all I need to do is help an old man with some scratch cards. Easy enough.In order to get the chemicals... my choices are ""Do drugs"" or ""Deal Drugs"". The guy is afraid I'm a cop... but he's already admitted he's in possession of drugs, as he wants me to deal. I have lots of money, so I can't just buy the chemicals... I have to deal drugs. Ok, so I do it, and that boring chore is done.Next, the tires. For some reason I'm replacing old worn out tires with old worn out tires used in a gym. First, that makes no sense at all! Secondly, again, remember all that money I have? I can't just buy the tires, no! Instead, I have to fight and win all of the boxers that are in here all day every day. With no training.I do have another option, however, I can cut the brakelines of the other driver, which will probably kill him. Not an option I'm willing to consider. However, each time I box, and each time I lose, I lose a day, and wake up to find my friends wife asking me if I want to cut the brake lines. EVERY DAY!!! THE SAME CONVERSATION!!!""I only have 16 days to get to the next city.""""That's no time at all! You should kill someone""""Hmm... you're right, that's not a lot of time... No, I won't do it. Ask me again tomorrow morning please!""Every damn day.The game opens up with you having many many choices, and not enough time in the day to do all of them. It ends with you having no choices besides grind this game, and hope that you win by luck or by killing a man. You can tell that the people that made this used RPG Maker, and moved from pen to paper to just using RPG maker to write their story. Like I said, the beginning is brillaint... but it just gets boring fast.If they can patch out the boxing, and give people more options, this game would be quite easy to recommend, but at the moment it's buggy, broken, and boring.I've invested so many hours into it, I need to go back to the god awful boxing ring and win this final fight just so I can see what my ending is. Such a waste of time... but I'm invested now, and I hate cutting my losses.			"

												Always Sometimes Monsters is an interesting game that promises to deal with the darker themes of life through the ability of choice, and its consequences and rewards. However, the game falls short.First of all the graphics, surprisingly not a problem. I'm not a huge RPGMaker fan, but the game does what it can to make the graphics good within RPGMaker's limitations. While this may be a problem for some, it really doesn't interfere with the game.The music for the game is very well made, but when it loops the audio can sometimes cut out for a few seconds which is a bit annoying. After listening to the same few loops it can get a bit annoying, but generally it's very good.Now for the main part of the game, the gameplay (really the writing). A game like this isn't bought for gameplay, which just consists of running between buildings and people and talking, choosing dialogue options, finding items, etc. The writing is where this game falls short. It's promise to deal with serious topics falls short because of the game's absolutely horrible approach to dealing with serious topics. At certain times, I can't tell if it's poking fun at the topic or seriously trying to be dark. The amount of obvious tongue-in-cheek references to other video games and video game review sites also go overboard after they start to interfere with actual writing, such as the scene in the theatre, which seems to be an obvious cash-in. From the short while I played, I really wanted to like the game, but the writing was not very good. It was goofy in too many ways, and this ruined what otherwise would have been a very good game. Maybe it'll be better if I play more, but from what I've seen I wouldn't recommend it to anyone interested in this genre of game.			"

												I REALLY enjoyed this game despite a few gripes... until the end, and no this isn't a complaint about the ending itself being potentially sad.*Spoilers*After having been a paragon of virtue for the entire game, making as few bad choices as the game would allow me, stealing nothing, helping everyone, working honestly, I reached the part where my journal was read back to me. I thought, oh cool, this guy will see that I have been super nice for the last month. Nope. He started reading out crimes and sins that I hadn't even commited. ""You gave a kid an allergic reaction and didn't help him!"" ... ""No I didn't"". ""You did this!"" ... ""Nope!"". ""AND YOU DID THIS!"" ... ""NO I DIDN'T!"".The one thing I did do is blackmail a man to save a life, because I didn't see a bag of drugs on the floor. Those drugs were not easy enough to see for me to feel bad when I was held accountable for those actions 7 hours later. AND I did NOT write about the whole situation in my diary. Yet the man still read it from there? Is this some magic diary? Designed to send you to prison for crimes you didn't commit by just inventing them?So no, I would not recommend this game after finding out that literally every choice is forgotten by the end of the game, at which point it yelled at me for the choices I did NOT actually make anyway. Might as well just yell at myself in the mirror for NOT stealing from the elderly instead.			"

												I didn't expect a lot from this game but I'm definitely glad I gave it a playthrough. It's a somewhat slice-of-life type video game where every decision you make alters what's happening. Does it change the story down the line? I haven't replayed it to find out but it at least gives the illusion that it will (TIP: Abuse the save option and save slots, you'll need it). The script is very neutral yet despite that I've had one decision screw me over (I already ""finished"" the game thanks to one decision). Overall, I loved the story and the idea that every decision you make can basically end the story for you and not just try and try again without any consequence... unless you reload your saves of course.

It's not fun. If you like poorly-thought-out minigames, grinding chores over and over, save scumming when you bankrupt yourself just to get a slightly un-♥♥♥♥♥♥ ending, and writing on par with a seventh-grader's English assignment, then you'll enjoy this game.Don't waste your money.

												I put this game off for months after buying it on sale. One night (particularly, the night I'm writing this review), I decided to play it from start to finish in one sitting.And it ruined me as a person. Many interactive story-driven adventure games draw emotions out of me, and in those games it feels like each decision I make affects the story.In Always Sometimes Monsters, the story constantly forces its way into the darkest parts of my consciousness, tears it to shreds, picks out the parts it wants, then obliterates what's left as it makes me question life itself.I've never come across a game that pushes one's morals far beyond their breaking point, a game whose story is so decision-based on what you - the player - believes in, a story so immersive is an absolute must-have.

												Always Sometimes Monsters is a game that I thought at the beginning had a lot of potential given its promise of morally complex situations. However, after watching someone else's playthrough and playing my own, I realized that the game is far more linear than it lets on, playing out more like a visual novel with a superfluous stamina mechanic.You play a person who, a year after a break-up, is still despondent and decides to travel across country -- through whatever means possible -- in order to chase their ex. The love interest you're pursuing is selfish, shallow, fickle, and absolutely unhealthy for you. Like other reviewers, for all this game's hooting about choices, I was disappointed and annoyed that there was no option to be an adult and simply move on from my ex.The drama of decision making is supposed to come in what you're willing to do in order to get the money to travel from place to place, but near the end of the game, there's a casino which lets you win large amounts of money. I won $10,000 and was able to pay off Sam's gambling debt with no problems, thus making the entire struggle for money throughout the game seem rather pointless.The Dubstown segment is probably the game's strongest part, and the narrative becomes progressively weaker and less interesting afterwards. Story-based games live or die on the strength of their writing, and Always Sometimes Monsters is no exception. There were sparks of interest here and there, and it was certainly an ambitious concept, but for the most part, the writing is just not to the level it should have been for the ideas it was wrestling with. The author insertions were ridiculous and off-putting. I can't recommend this game.			"

												I'd say that the style here is an acquired taste. I kind of hated it to begin with, the way things are done in the beginning seems so backwards. And I'm talking about the prologue and means of character selection, which is kind of counterintuitive. The game itself has a couple of really obnoxious plugs and references to a culture that really doesn't resonate with me. But once you get it going and start fishing, the game becomes more like an interactive novel with some genuine surprises. You can't please everyone, and you'll only meet your downfall for trying. With that said, there's also a lot more than you might think. I don't really like the ending of this game, but the middle was pretty darn satisfying. There's probably a whole lot that I missed out on, but I will give it another look at a later time. Finishing the game can burn you out quite a bit. Not sure I'd pay full price (got it for 99 cent) for it, and I'm not so invested that I would pay full price for the upcoming sequel, either. But if this title is on sale, you're getting well more than the value for your money.			"

												Am I enjoying the game? Not really. Am I going to play it to completion? Absolutely.I really wish they would change the name of the game to ""Always Sometimes Monotonous"". There are points in the game, if you don't make absolutely every single perfect choice (and maybe even if you do), where you will be stuck doing mindless minigame work to make ends meet, or to earn enough money to make it to the next town (which will render you pretty much broke, causing you to do the exact same thing once you get there). Maybe it's some sort of insight into the lives of those who pinch pennies just to get by, who chase after their dreams and end up facedown in the dirt. That seems like what it's trying to be. But it just isn't doing it for me. Maybe I'll finish the game and decide it was all entirely worth it, but for now, this is how I feel. I'm on a roller coaster that loops and twists between great gameplay and story development, a game that's obviously trying too hard, and punching numbers into a real-life calculator to figure out exactly how much profit I can squeeze out of an adorable pig corpse. ...Is that one... irradiated? What the hell is going on here.			"

It was only a few dollars for an rpg maker esc kind of game. In the end it just wasn't worth it. I still played it through and it was a decent enough game for a few bucks. Still, the ending was far to obvious as was the story itself. To many times I was just grinding to do something to make money and I don't think being evil or good really mattered at all. I don't think the decisions made the main character monsterous at all. Still, other people enjoy it and think the ending was gut renching. Me, I thought the ending was too predictable.

												Nice idea but the game is flawed and a misfire that corkscrews off target. Varied music sound track and a deliberate attempt in SNES era rpg graphics are a nice touch. But after that I run out of good things to say.Although it tries to focus on plot and caring about the characters in game this is totally detracted from greatly by the presence of overly smug programmers who appears in game and they are so not needed. They do nothing to advance the game or plot and it just feels pretensious, premature self-praise. The game is about choices but to be honest it is overly limited and locks you out fast if you go the wrong way. Prime example is the Jack story, you can not get information about him if you take the newspaper job despite being able to walk into his ad agency office but are unable to ask more information about him despite being able to ask other people questions before this crises, instead you must work for the ad agency to get this information. This sort of binary limiting of choices is in too many games and detracts from the game experience a lot and is a good example of terrible writing. Nice try but no cigar. Not the worst game ever but definetly flawed in major ways that detract from what could have been great. Only buy in the sale, totally not worth full price.  The overly smug attitude and inclusion of the coders was too much for me to stomach, the game itself isn't that worthy of massive praise by any means.			"

												Always Sometimes Monsters is a game that I just couldn't get into. Which is unusual for me since I'm a gamer with a lot of patience and wouldn't have bought this if I thought otherwise.Sadly from the very start I felt the game suffered from bad writing and plot pacing. The writing is simplistic in nature and will probably satisfy less picky gamers, but the game sells itself as a somewhat serious take on life followed up by mature content. However it's as if the game is trying to take itself serious at times but the writing seems to take on a different form altogether.The moral choices in the story are on the edge of black and white, and we know it's never that simple. There are also various character connections that just don't make any sense or is sufficiently explained. I can't go into detail without this turning into a spoiler review, but it feels like cheap tie-ins are made to your character in order to make you feel like your previous decisions carried weight. There is also no real connection to the characters. At times it's as if the game wants you to feel 'connected' to a certain character in the story, a character that should mean something to you. Someone important. However, due to hardly any depth given to any character background, you're left with the mindset of just not caring. Why should I care for character A, B or C if the game doesn't bother to build up a relationship? Snippets of dialogue between characters isn't enough for a game like this and it's something that the devs/writers really missed out on.The game makes the mistake of jumping you into the shoes of a random person and building their 'life' without actually filling in all the gaps. This leaves a gaping void that just hurts the overall game.If the writing and general plot pacing along with improvements to the gameplay such as the rather annoying repetitive money earnings had been much better, I'd probably be playing this a lot more and pumping more time into it.Sadly the game is a bust and I can't recommend this.

												I'm a narrative freak. I love my video game stories and I really dig a game that goes beyond the norms of gameplay to tell a potent story. ASM does tell a good story but in a form that is just a drag to experience. It takes somewhere around 10 hours to grind through the story, picking up monotonous jobs along the way which consist of boring ""work"" instead of doing anything worthwhile to move the story along in a game engine that is super limited with a super clunky UI and menu systems. Low resolution creates a huge black border around the game (even when it's set to fullscreen mode) and I feel like I'm playing some kind of a GBA ROM of a bad game. The RPG aspects are boring and underdone and don't really matter. You just need to grind for money so you can eat and sleep in your own apartment. This may be a design choice because I truly felt like a bored zombie trying to get through some days as soon as possible and get to the next. But as gameplay, this is just grueling and boring. Especially when it's presented in such a rudimentary way (both aesthetically and experiencially) that doesn't give you any incentive to keep playing unless you're really interested to see the story to its end.To be honest, the story does go to some very amusing places but it's just too much work to see it to the end. This could have been a 2-3 hour game with MUCH better pacing and I would have fallen in love with it, however ASM is just about stretching an idea too damn thin for my tastes.			"

												SOME SPOILERS BELOWTl;dr/non-spoiler version: Could've been great, but relies on the idea that your choices matter, and once you realize they really don't, there's just a shoddy story and terrible minigames backing it up.> Pick the character who seems least interested in getting Larry drunk> Am apparently lesbian> Save Dubstown> Leave Beaton a corrupt mess> Have to go to a ridiculous amount of trouble in Salt City because the printer at the bus station is broken> (Really?)> Whatever, do everything right> Get to San Verdano with about two weeks left> Figure I'll have plenty of time to get things sorted out before the wedding> Bachelorette party is on Day 17> Wake up on Day 29> 10/10 would go to 12-day bachelorette party againAlways Sometimes Monsters is a game that, in my mind, feels like it should be a lot better than it actually is. The crux of it is that for a game that prides itself on offering the player difficult choices, it does an awful job of making it feel like those choices really matter in the end. It has a specific story it wants to tell, a specific flawed narrative it wants to build, and if you try to do anything else, you end up a hobo at gunpoint (I didn't get shot, though, so maybe that's a victory?). This, mind, for taking the high road and deciding that the couple is better off together (they deserve each other, yeesh) and that the player character should just realize that's resolved, finally be able to close that door, and move on with their life. Apparently the developers think that's a totally unreasonable outcome. Whatever. I played through tedious minigame after tedious minigame because I had faith that the story would ultimately carry the game, and that faith was betrayed.To make things worse, I checked some guides after finishing the game (a bit dumbstruck that that was all there was) and it turns out that to get the 'good' ending, you basically have to stick around somewhere for ten extra days to pick up some cash. No matter what choices you make, no matter how good of a person you are, if you *actually care about the person and want to get there with time to mend bridges and assess the situation*, you'll fail because you don't have enough money. Which doesn't fit with the game at all.That said, it's pretty true in general that the game can't seem to decide what exactly it wants to be, which might be part of the problem. So much of the background of the game can't seem to exist unless it has a joke attached (the last straw might have been when the guy who's been pointing a gun at you the entire game (I mean, sort of) is literally named Checkhov) that when the game gets serious, it's very difficult to take it seriously. And if it's all just an existentialist joke, which is what it ends up shaping up as, the joke is on whoever buys it.Also, somebody else writing a bestselling novel (and getting the rights to a video game adaptation, right, much subtle, very humour) based on your journal? There are so many problems with that, but by the end, you just accept it because hey whatever that's just how this game rolls. Go through the game making friendships and being a good person? Turns out nobody cares! Turns out you don't care either and that the only thing that mattered in your life was a relationship that was kinda sketchy from the start and ended because your partner wouldn't believe in your ability to follow your dreams. Such a great message!Oh, and the title? Graffiti in a bus station that the main character repeats because it sounds like it means something. Though, to be fair, 'something that tries to be intriguing and meaningful but is annoying and pointless in the end' sums up this game pretty well, so maybe the title fits.Understand, though, the only reason I'm as frustrated at this game as I am was that I really wanted it to be great. It could've been great. And there are some elements, some moments where it just about gets there. So if you want to comb through this haystack of a game for those needles of brilliance, that's your call. Just don't expect it to live up to its potential.			"

												A mature story that deals with choice, and illusion thereof. Is life deterministic? Do we have control over our destiny? There aren't a ton of outcomes in this game, but it still takes your choice into account enough to make an enjoyable customed experience. You must be aware that this game is HIGHLY narrative-driven; but if that's what you're into, go ahead. It's one of the rare serious story well executed in a game. You will be homeless, you will have to do mundane work, you will have to sustain yourself, and so on. It might be repellent for some, but if you're not only looking for ""pure fun"" in games, and if you want to live a unique and, let me repeat it, mature experience, this game is incredible and deserve your attention.

												Definitely one of my favorite games on Steam, especially given the cheap price point, especially when on sale.  Before I explain though, note that the game is more of a Choose Your Own Adventure instead of a Roleplaying Game.  There is no combat other than a boxing part with a highly customized combat scheme that's nothing close to traditional turn-based combat mechanics.  ASM is ultimately a game about choice and consequences in the pursuit of love, and how your character is defined by one's choices.  That said, this isn't a story about the good guy winning in the end.  It's a lesson in pragmatism and compromise.  Playing a pure idealist will cause your character to suffer greatly, and there's really no way to escape it. My only wish for this game is that it became an MMO.  If thousands of players had to play it simultaneously while making difficult choices, the game mechanics could be applied to their greatest potential.  This should be a prototype for a much greater project.			"

												Starting with the positive: this game clearly succeeds in its objective. It offers the player several moral choices which influence the story. It gives the player a few opportunities to reflect on these choices or discuss them with characters in the game, and it avoids labelling any particular choice as the ""right"" or ""good"" one.There are a few things, however, which make this game difficult to recommend:* Most situations are extremely contrived, being even further removed from real-life decisions than most soap operas. Do I let my friend die or commit a major criminal offence to save his life? Do I confront a murderer or run away and never tell anyone?* The mini-games are terrible. They're more difficult and less fun to play than the 30-year-old games they imitate* The characters are a bit one-dimensional, including (frustratingly) the player character, whose emotional baggage pretty much dictates the plot of the game			"

												It's a fairly interesting game, the story is mildly interesting. The problem I have with it is that it touts ""many"" possible endings, but really there's only a few possiblities available that are mixed and matched at the end. Also, it takes a lot of time to do certain parts if you want to get a ""good"" end, which frankly isn't all that rewarding. It's also not very replayable - I played it once and I have no desire to play another gruelingly long session to get a similar ending.  Other than that, there are some fun parts and being a lesbian/gay couple is a cool option.			"

												Wow, this game really beats you down. Your character's situation starts out already depressing, then you go through many ups and downs throughout the story, but mostly on a downward trajectory lol. In the end, I lost everything, including my ex, and ended up worse off than I was at the beginning. That being said, however, I loved this game.			"

												Grindy, and tries to pound in the message that you are in a miserable situation and can only make bad / selfish choices even though there are clearly better options. Eventually makes you hate every character it presents, especially the main.			"

												Great first third of the game-- clever, interesting, multi-faceted. This is the part most people seem to be reviewing.Middle third was a mini-game slogfest. The boxing, oh, the boxing.Final third just became depressing and, depending on how you'd played thus far, thematically nonsensical.I wish I had just read the reviews and enjoyed the IDEA of the game rather than actually have the experience of it.That said, I eagerly look forward to future games from these people!

												Horribly written, smug, and pretentious. Gets a couple of points for nice art and a fun blackjack minigame (I'm a sucker for cards), but that's it. The dialogue is awful, the story is terrible. Your player character is desperate, irresponsible, and unlikeable (why don't I have an option to settle down with that nice trans character we met about halfway through the game instead of ruining my ex's marriage?). The subplot between Checkhov and Parker makes no sense and is a good illustration of the game's weaknesses: Parker is a casino boss who seems to have some kind of deep emotional investment in engineering scenarios in which the hitman in his employ, Checkhov, will have a flimsy excuse to murder people. Checkhov is apparently the only hitman on the face of the planet, spends all of his time with Parker, and Parker loses it when he tries to leave. I know it's supposed to be some kind of pretentious commentary about what it Means to make a video game protagonist you identify with kill people (in those other, lesser video games that are about *violence* and not *art*), but it doesn't work in-universe unless you want to believe that Parker and Checkhov have some kind of bizarre BDSM relationship and Checkhov is tired of satisfying his murder kink. I have a very high bar for what I consider pretentious and I look favorably on a lot of art games and indie games that are trying to Say Something, or whatever, and throwing out your story's believability so you can point out your perceived superiority is one of the only things that crosses it.Actually, you should probably go ahead and believe the BDSM thing since it's arguably the most fun you'll have with the game. It's not even a very good resource management sim.			"

												Always Sometimes NonsenseThis is game about making choices and seeing how the consequences shape the story. There are a few dreadful mini-games tossed in here and there but at its core this is a narrative game, a digital choose your own adventure that sells itself on the quality of the story and it's ability to be shaped the choices you make. Unfortunately the writing is awful. The dialog is flat, the characters are a collection of unmemorable types with no depth or originality to be found. The choices offered are contrived almost always breaking down into do a bad thing for money or give up money to be a good person. The effect on the story is negligible until its time to decide which ending you get. Do to many bad things and you are judged to be selfish don't do enough and you'll be forced to play bad mini-games for money. The final act is particularly disappointing as it is largely driven by the bad choices of others forcing you into yet another contrived choice. Tonally this game is a mess. It purports to deal with heavy social issues but the writing is too outlandish to be taken serious and the characters are too flat to make an impact. This is a deeply silly game in which you will occasionally be called a terrible slur because the creators think that this is important social commentary. It's a game that has no idea how stupid it is. The whole story is framed with a ridiculously overwrought frame narrative where the protagonist retells the games events to armed criminals in between monologues about choice that waver between ludicrous and pretentious. This is a game that forgoes gameplay in favour of a story that is awful, choices which are contrived and shallow, and thinks it is making important statements when really it’s just using some naughty words and being stupid. It’s a complete waste of time.			"

												I love story rich games. I wanted to like this. And I'll play anything if it has a good script. Telltale Games is my favorite games company. I actually have buttons for this game that I got at PAX on my wall.I finally got around to buying and playing it, and it's just awkward and clunky, script-wise. Everyone's hanging on tenterhooks. Regular conversations turn into people telling each other to go ♥♥♥♥ themselves and then going back as if nothing happened. People don't act like people, it's like a first timer's novel that's unedited. There are meme and Bob the Builder references. There are two meta-references where the game devs show up in the first 30 minutes. I finally turned it off and am returning it after reading the line ""More babes will show up so I can share my secret sauce with them!"" from a bouncer. Maybe it's because I just came from the excellently written biopic Straight Outta Compton, but this is weak.The writing in this game would be fine if there were interesting gameplay or world, but it's about the writing, and the visuals and music seem like ""default RPGMaker."" Read a book instead.			"

												This game showed so much promise and potential when I first started it, but like most of the negative reviews already written about it, it's very linear. I was hoping for twists in the plotline or thought-provoking points and that's what kept me playing it and eventually finishing it, but there was none, leaving me very disappointed at the end. The storyline was very mundane, a typical love story. I didn't feel any connection or desire to get my ex-partner back at all because I barely got to know them. Another thing I really didn't like was the game developers inserting themselves into the story. I get that it was supposed to be a tongue-in-cheek sort of way, but it just came across as egotistical to me. I also noticed multiple typos in the dialogues and programming errors (wrong portrayal of the character for the dialogue), and it just didn't feel like a polished product.			"

Posted: August 15, 2015
												First before i get to the actual review, I just want to state how i found out about this game: To set the record straight, i watched Cry's playthrough of it on youtube. So i played this game knowing most of what would happen because i had watched the playthrough (i stopped watching it after a while to play the actual game). Granted with games like this that allow you to take different paths depending on the choices you make, you can never watch the same Let's Play twice and whatever the Let's Player does shouldn't be the exclusive path you take. In general i LOVE games that allow you to take different paths with the story. I also love writing and want to be a writer and turn most of my works into webcomics. So because this game was about a writer trying to mend their relationship with a former flame, my interest was almost instant and Cry's let's play let me get a preview of what i could expect from the game.Ok, now onto the reivew:As stated above, the game is about a writer down on their luck in life and living near-poverty in a run down town called Dubstown. They're down on their luck and taking whatever jobs they can get to earn enough money to pay their rent or risk eviction. On top of that, they also find out that their ex (who they still have feelings for) is getting married in 30 days. So that puts your character on a quest to make enough money as possible and get to the wedding to mend their relationship with their ex. This concept is very good. It's rare we see games and media in general dealing with a character trying to fix a past relationship with this much effort (going on a road trip to see an ex one last time is usually something saved only for the romantic comedies, which the majority of are just chickflicks made with no effort at all). On top of that this is one of the rare oppertunities in media that we see and PLAY as a character in or near poverty, another nice change from the norm.But while the concept is well and good, it's all about the delivery that makes or breaks a story... And honestly i feel rather dissapointed...Pros of the game include:- A new perspective to the world of writing- a new perspective to the world of mending relationships and what love and romance mean- a new perspective by playing as a character in or near poverty- self aware and meta humor- good set design for an RPG Maker game- The game can get pretty philisophical when it comes to the theme of choice, which is very much appreciated.- The NPC dialouge is unique for the most part, even random ones walking around on the street and not the major ones- The choices you make in this game are pretty impressive seeing that you're playing as a writer in poverty. You're essntially homeless for a lot of the game because you're on the road, forcing you to sleep in the street and do whatever you can to find a bed at night should no one want to give you a home. Making money is also realistically hard as it would be for someone in that situation. You can help your friends or completely break people and possibly yourself in the process.AND NOW THE CONS:- a few plotholes, though likely unintentional (like if You let the drug dealer's nephew get shot and run away from the crazy drug dealer, he'll run Belinger over with his car. if you make it to the wedding however, you can see Belinger in the casino... Odd...  And in the second town  when you fall through the vents after hacking the election, the guard says 'KILL HIM/HER!' But the next day, you're not being hunted by the cops or anything. Weird... And why would you immediately kill the person rather than apprehending them and putting them in jail? Was it a failed attempt at a commentary on police brutality?- The odd jobs were likely intentionally made to be boring to make the scenerio realistic but boredum and repetion is still boredum and repetion. In addition, they don't give much reward, probably still intentional.- The illusion of choice for most of the game just sort of makes you wonder what the point in going on is after a while, which can result in more boredum.-The characters are really forgetable save for the old lady and Markansas. Everyone else is pretty much a jerk to you save for a tiny handful you are required to do quests for (like Jack, Viper, ect). Other than that, everyone else is forgettable and  Sam is the biggest jerk of all. Period.  Granted, some of the characters can be nice, but for me at least, i always ended up hating them.- There is a character in the game you'll encounter in the second town who is revealed to be transgender but that character could've been written out fo the game entirely. Their 'subplot' consists of 3 meetings and you can't even make them a love interest or invite them to the wedding, which makes you wonder why this character was put into the story if they'd have no impact on it later on. This could've given the player more choices, but instead your interactions with this character don't seem to matter. The game seems to want you to pursue this character by making the 2 meetings you have mandatory cutscenes, but after the election subplot is over, this character can be easily missed and never seen again. What was the point of introducing us to this character if you weren't going anywhere with them?- Toward the end of the game in order to get your happy ending, YOU PRETTY MUCH HAVE TO SAY YOU'VE BEEN AN ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ THE ENTIRE TIME. This pretty much kills the illusion of choice and feels like the creators want to force you to change. Did anything matter up to that point if this is how i get my desired ending regardless of what i did?   I'm honestly offended. If you didn't play the game like a pruitan, the game GUILTS YOU FOR EVERYTHING!  That's no way to talk to your audience in any form of media...- The game feels like it's trying TOO HARD to be edgy and controvercial at times. Like the spoiler example above regarding the election and if you make it to the wedding in the final portion of the game, the game feels like it's trying too hard to bed edgy and new, like it's trying to start a controversy but ends up being just 'meh' once you confront said 'controversy'. Sure the game does cover some issues like poverty but when it tries to dip into other typically controvercial things, the delivery just feels off, doesn't leave much of an impact or is just full of lost potential! This is most notable toward the end of the game when you make it to the casino/hotel for the wedding  it would've been a perfect oppertunity to introduce the issues of human trafficing in order to pay back huge debts, but the plot avoids it, opting for plain out killing those who don't pay the debt . Another example in the middle of the game:  If you screw up the job your publisher friend gave you at the second town, he won't let you stay at his place and the only other bed in town is under a bridge where you're forced to either cough up 100 dollars, blow the guy or look elsewhere. This could've delved into how poverty creates gang violence and gang activity and possibly go into human trafficking again, but this was also avoided. hell if you REALLY wanna talk about lost potential, this could've changed the gameplay and given you an oppertunity to join a gang!Honestly I'm not really sure what else to say about the game. I wanna reccomend it because at least it tries, but the more i think about it and write about it, i still feel bored with the product overall and feel this game has a lot of lost potential (which saddens me as a writer). So despite the fact i feel this game has a lot of potential, i feel it's trying to hard to be something it's not. So if you wanna try it, go right ahead, but wait until it's on sale. Overall, it's a nice concept but the final delivery just feels bland.I give this game 3 diaries out of 5.			"

												I was excited to play this game when I first saw it appear on the Steam store.  It looked like it was going to be a thought-provoking, deep experience where people would be able to compare the different choices that they had made and the outcomes that resulted from them.  I was wrong.Though on a first playthrough it is easy to believe that the choices that you are making change the story, a second playthrough (or even a bit of research) quickly prove otherwise.  At best your choices make a minor difference that lasts about as long as the next scene.  At worst, there is literally no difference at all.  Once you discover that the choices in the game don't matter all that much, your second realization is that the story is rather bland as well.  I'll avoid discussing the ending for the sake of those who are reading this review but still wish to give the game a chance but I definitely suggest not getting your hopes up.As far as the story goes, there were several parts that entertained me and (while still having the belief that choices affected the narrative in a major way) seemed promising.  On the opposite side of that, there was plenty in the game that drained the fun out of it.  The vast majority of the jobs in the game were an absolutely terrible grind.  This makes it so that earning money is less of side quest and more of 'you know, I think I'm going to skip eating today' moment.  Call that realism if you'd like, though I prefer to enjoy myself the entire time that I'm playing a game.Overall, the game was okay up until the discovery of an extremely linear storyline and downright bad after it.  It had potential to be a great game if the developers had put a little more heart into it.			"

												I'm amazed this came out of RPG Maker.I'm amazed that this game basically is The Adventures of Commander ♥♥♥♥up on Planet Anguish-Fueled Poverty. It even allows you to choose what race, gender, and sexual preference you want to be, adding little hints of flavor text that color the world around your character. I didn't notice this because I played a short-haired white male and therefore WHITE MALE PRIVILEGE MAKES THE BITTER MEDICINE EASIER TO SWALLOW, TRA LA LA LA LAIt does that thing where it turns the little mini-games that should be easter eggs and makes them a part of the game. Some of these are justified (and can even be fun), some really should have been flushed down the toilet. So you have to play Frogger in order to not ♥♥♥♥ up at a mission. Then you have to learn this confusing boxing mini-game in order to finish an objective on the straight and narrow. I hated these parts. Luckily, you can (mostly) skip these by being an unlikeable ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.Can I love the storytelling some more? ♥♥♥♥ yes, I'm going to. It's one of those games you have to play for the storytelling. The game is centered around emotional bonds and relationships and how easily you can make or break them. My playthrough took me down a horrid little path where I used a character's secret plushie porn as blackmail, ended up fixing a boxing match in the most horrid way possible, and journeyed my way to San Verano, burning bridges and narrowly avoiding one emotional, traumatic bullet only to get hit with another. On top of that, there's loads and loads of opportunities for the writing to shine here, and they are not wasted. It's the game where you can be a horrid ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ through actions and dialogue alone, like in real life! Like I did! Like I am doing right now!So if you're looking for a reason to hate yourself over a video game, make it because of something you've experienced in Always Sometimes Monsters. Don't do it because you're bad at Dota or Halo or whatever trivial ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t is the flavor of the month, do it because you accidentally took a family's lost dog and sold it to some awful dog trainers. Like I did.			"

What will you do if you have the power to go back and remake every important decision in your life?Knowing what you already know, will your choice remain the same in the safety of that knowledge?Or will you be so desperate for change to take a leap of faith only to tumble into the abyss of the unforeseeable?Review:This game lets the player explore the quantum theory of alternate timelines, if you have the patience to get past the slow beginning and endure the old school gameplay to realize this game for what it is.Rarely in our lives do we have complete control even when we believe it to be so. This game is an experiment in faith and morality. Good intentions don't always turn out well, and vice versa.This isn't a single playthrough game, or you will likely have missed various situations and decisions.

												This is another game that tries really, really hard to be art, and fails on pretty much all counts. The artwork, which was in fact made in RPG Maker, looks awful, and is yet another game that tries to use 'pixel art' to cover up a fundamental laziness with the over all design. The story is trite, comes off as having a lot of forced conflict, and has some of the worst writing I've ever seen in a game. The choices are arbitrary, making more of a cosmetic difference than a substantive one, and never really feel important.All in all, this game is a victim of the ""style over substance"" design philosophy, and ends up not even having a good style to cover the lack of substance.

												This was a far deeper and more interesting game than i expected. It's in that strange space between adventure and RPG - there are no puzzles and there is no combat, you just wander around engaging in dialog and occasionally grinding so you can buy a burger. The story is a slice of life roadtrip about a broke author who is questioning some of his life decisions. As he makes his way across the country on the way to his ex's wedding he finds time to write and reflect. I guess the protagonist could be a she too - i accidentally ended up with a black gay man, and the story worked very well for me in that role. My only complaint is the last hour or so when the narrative starts to railroad you into a tragic love story that really wasn't necessary for the experience. Because of being pushed down a path i didn't feel matched my character, some of the emotional impact of the journey was lost for me. Still, for a good chunk of the game it felt like a really great indie movie. Definitely worth a playthrough for fans of real-world drama.			"

												The greatest thing about this game is that there isn't an illusion of choice, as most choice games seem to revere. It questions the player's morality, it was easy to make the wrong decision, thereby encouraging a higher replay value. However, that brings me to the pacing of the game. For one thing, I spent SEVERAL HOURS working in a tofu factory making tofu products for extra cash and then gambling for another hour just to make a little more; makes me hesitate on picking up the game again...unless of course I can find an easier way to make money. The story makes up for it for the most part and while grinding is technically realistic, it felt a little too strenuous.Secondly, there are quite a few points in the game where you, as a player, feel very isolated and the game seems to be going nowhere - but I'd say that's pretty typical for an RPG-maker style game. This would happen if you miss a certain point in the game such as miss a job opportunity or skip the bus to get to the next town. It seems as though you can almost just stay in your home town and let the wedding go and while that says 'CHOICE', it also says boring.One weird side quest in the second town over (or the third; I can't remember) that I'd like to mention, has a fishing kid who asks you to fetch some lake crab. This felt incredibly 'RPG' and far-fetched from reality and to top it off, his sprite turns into a black kid after you finish it. I didn't know if this was just a joke but I laughed with a questioning look on my face. You gained almost no benefit from it besides gaining more fishing spots to get free food.Something I really adored about the game is the choosing your character and partner mechanic. I didn't get it at first but when I did, I was very pleased. It was unexpected and surprising but very clever.In regards to the story, it was interesting, dark, romantic, intense, sad, silly. It makes you think, it rewards you, it beats you up and kills your insides. No matter what, in the end, you'll feel like a bad person, regardless of the 'good decisions' you make. You're selfish and subtly (or not so subtly) mean and rude but in my opinion, that's realistic. The cameo of the developers, Jake and Justin, was a bit of a weird meta stretch but their conversations were pretty entertaining so it wasn't all that bad. However, it did seem a bit over confident.I'd recommend this definitely, especially if you're into a choose your own adventure visual novel-like game. If you're into the Louis CK 'local man's life gets progressively worse' theme, this is the game for you. And despite the little small weird details to the game, I can't wait until the sequel, Sometimes Always Monsters, which I got to play the demo at PAX'15 and got super excited with Justin over it.

												Great game. Can be boring (and frustrating...alot of the jobs you work suck♥♥♥♥♥ just like the ones in real life) at times, but there's alot of introspective themes that make it worth a playthrough. If you catch it on sale, give it a chance.			"

												It is not an happy game, it will not make you feel better, and probably it will not entertain you. So, why do you have to play Always Sometimes Monsters? Because, in a nutshell, it has one of the best narrative we've seen these days.Always Sometimes Monsters is one of those independent, cult-classic-to-be, games that fans of narrative storytelling should really give a chance.

												I bought this game sometime last year and finally just got around to finishing it. While I enjoyed the game for what it was, the ending seemed to fall short [for me] a bit. On the bright side, it was an overall enjoyable experience.StoryYour character is an underachiever with big dreams and little motivation, who's also a little down on their luck. Never able to get over their ex, they suddenly receive a surprise wedding invitation to their ex's wedding (DUN DUN DUN!). It is then that they decide to embark on a long journey across the country just to win them back - little did they know, just how difficult that would be. From getting kicked out of their apartment to doing various odd jobs for strange people, they are determined to make it to the wedding. Along the way, you'll meet some pretty interesting characters and will have to decide just how far you'll go for the one you love.ProsDecent, Relatable Story - The story of our main character is something almost all of us can understand or relate to. There are a lot of emotions, missed opportunities (as well as opportunistic moments), hard work, dedication, and obstacles that we all must go through in life, which even our main character is subject to. It's a little slice-of-life to get you thinking about your own.Play Time - As you can see by my hours played, it's a pretty decent chunk of time. Despite how the game looks, there's actually a lot of stuff to do that'll keep you entertained for a while, aside from the main story.Side Stuff - In certain areas, you can find collectibles called ""Indie Heroz"" hidden throughout the towns. To be honest, I'm not quite sure if they have a purpose, but they're neat references to other games. Speaking of which, you can play games too (Yes, a game within a game. Whaaaaaat?). If you come across any arcade machines or in-home consoles, then you can play. You can also work to earn money, although there are ways around that (I probably only worked twice before I realized that I can make money off sandwich stocks).Choices Matter - I'm always pleased when a choice-based game actually leaves the story up to the player's choices, and Always Sometimes Monsters certainly does that.ConsEnding - As I said before, I wasn't totally thrilled about the ending. I know the choices you make will determine which ending you get, I guess I was just hoping for something better ^^"" But what end do I expect to get after killing some random dude and letting my so-called ""best friend"" die? Oh well.Little Replayability - Unfortunately, there's not much replayability, unless you want to experiment with different characters, choices, etc., but the main story will still be the same.It's a good game overall, but of course it isn't perfect. It was quite charming though, I'll admit. However, if you're not sure that you're going to love it 100%, I'd recommend getting it on sale.			"

												Always sometimes monsters was a game i thought i would love and enjoy since I love choose your own stories and moral choices in games. Every area is amazing and have interesting quests from getting money for your apartment to a union to religion. But the biggest fault in my mind is the romance of the game.HEAVY SPOILERSTo me, i love romance but this one felt extremely forced like no tomorrow. Mainly with the person you are dating and Sam, to me it felt like it went ""hey...screw Sam"" and if you didn't they would force you to, mainly with the first flashback with the signing the contract, i tried to not sign it but the game to me in the end forced me to. Then when you find out it is sam that your love interest is marrying it went from a good game to just confusing. It felt forced the your love interest would be with Sam, a person they showed no interest when you first met her and with the contract, sam who she said ""meh, just sign it, screw sam"" then somehow decided to date sam and marry sam in under a year. To me this is heavily flawed. Then with sam itself, it just felt forced that Sam is the bad guy, the evil person and to me had nothing that showed they were a good person. Now my biggest fault is how the choices mattered. In the end you find out that all your choices till you pretty much get to the wedding means nothing in the end. Sure you can save one guy from suicide to get a free ride but it felt like i could steal from an old lady and nothing in the end changes. My biggest fault is how you get the good ending. The only way you can and still be a good person is to literally cheat. You save scrim to 10,000 just to keep your book and then some random choices decide if you get your love interest back. In the end for me it feels like you could literally be hitler but if you chose 3 choices you win her back but being the nicest guy ever and messing up 1, boom you are forever alone.The endings also are kind of crappy. Either you are with your love!...but Sam is dead and you feel like♥♥♥♥♥♥or sam is famous from what you did. Or you keep your book! but now you never get to be with your love ever again. And in the end you just screw Sam is the best ending, take everything from him and maybe kill him whe you could easily make the character move on. It feels like all the cool characters are useless when you find out they mean nothing, it goes from seeing a homeless dog and going ""i must help the dog!"" to ""oh if i sell him i get more money, meh"". In the end it just feels like nothing matters till 4 choises, 3 to your Love interest parent and the debt, anything else doesnt matter.END OF SPOILERSI wanted to love this but the story problems just held it back so much that i just don't want to play again when i know nothing changes, unless you get 2 things in the game, you will get a bad ending no matter what. You can say that is life but life isn't that way. Plus i found it weird you couldn't pick people outside to be your main character when nothing really changes if you consider all the characters you have. I say if you want to see the good, just play the first 3 area's (and get use to useless events in Benton), after that everything just becomes ""i have to do this"" over what you want to do			"

												Loved the idea and loved the actual game even more. Not your typical RPG. It contains a choice making rich story driven concept, awesome art that pays really close attention to detail, and great gameplay overall. Haven't noticed too many bugs either, which is rare for these kinds of games, definitely nothing game breaking. Even though there isn't really any combat, it's still fun. Even the music is great. Fits really well with the story. Overall I feel it's very immersive and for an RPG Maker game it's well worth the $10 price tag. Highly recommend it.			"

												Your career is slipping through your fingers, you can't afford to pay your rent, and the person you once thought would love you forever has walked out of your life. When things go so wrong so fast, it's human nature to obsess over what you could have done differently. Story-heavy RPG Always Sometimes Monsters asks what we can do instead, and specifically what choices we will make when we try to set things right.Your character's goal arrives in the post on the second day of the main story: an invitation to the wedding of their now ex-partner, in one month's time. To make it there, you'll walk from place to place, visiting and talking to dozens of different characters via some basic top-down RPG interaction and managing a simple inventory of things like the food you'll need to keep up your stamina.You'll have to balance the need for enough money or favours to get across the country with the time it takes to earn them, and face the consequences of that balancing act along the way. The day before the invitation arrives acts as a neat demonstration of that process: your landlord threatens to make you homeless unless you can bring him $500 in overdue rent by the end of the day, which you'll discover is only manageable if you do things like steal from your trusting elderly neighbour or pick people's pockets during a shift as a cloakroom attendant.Later on, you'll be able to opt for low-pay but legal manual labour, which Vagabond Dogs has made deliberately slow and tedious for the player to ensure it's about as tempting as it is in real life. But most choices in the game are less obvious. Consequences are unpredictable in this world and aim to reflect real life situations to some degree, where chatting to colleagues at your temp job about the guy you've replaced might be enough to stop him from shooting himself.Sometimes these options lack the choice that tally with your instincts or sense of logic, however. Always Sometimes Monsters cannot help but fall prey to this – you can't just phone a friend for help on that first day – but also uses it to its advantage in flashbacks that prevent progress until you make the choice your character has technically already made. You can't change the past, is the obvious point being made here, but it is dramatically effective. The flashbacks also play a crucial role in making the protagonist relatable.The chance that you'll relate to your character is also increased by the additional choice of their gender, race, and sexuality. In a clever prologue scene set at a party, you choose from a range of potential protagonists via a publisher choosing which writer to sign, and while their backstories are the same the reactions of other characters will differ. Play as a black lesbian, and you might experience a doctor accusing you of playing the race card, a 'friend' ascribing your apparent lack of fashion sense to your sexuality, and plenty of everyday sexism. “I still expect a hard day's work from you,” says the warehouse foreman, “Even if you are a woman!”The low-res RPG Maker aesthetic might seem at odds with the often stark subject matter, but the limitations of the tool help rather than hinder the game. Limited by little more than the amount of words the writer could produce and the player's imagination, Always Sometimes Monsters is able to tackle everything from homophobia to drug abuse to suicide with credibility. The focus is on the writing, sometimes overly dramatic but always engaging, and on the many branching paths down which your decisions can take you.It's refreshing to see this kind of real-life subject matter explored in a choice-based game, and presented in a way that's competitive with the best written of those types of stories. Always Sometimes Monsters' vision of the real world can be painful to experience at times, but only in a way that demonstrates the level of craft in developing this strong tale about modern life.The Verdict80100Always Sometimes MonstersA convincing examination of player choice set in an all-too-realistic modern world.

												If you enjoy eating 10 pointless hoagies every night before bed, walking laps around a shipping warehouse and knocking on 16 doors before you find the person you're supposed to deal drugs to, this might be your kind of game. Otherwise, consider the following.I do not recommend this game. It was part of a Humble Bundle I bought, but it wasn't worth the time. It's pretty short at around 8 hours, but I was never really engaged by it. Personally, I found the whole experience pretty tedious. I wanted to quit around hour 4, but I felt like I'd invested too much time to stop when it was more than half done.This game is sold with the idea that you'll be making important, conseqential choices, but they're ultimately little more than deciding which way you're going to grind your way to enough money so that you can advance to the next rigid setpiece. The pit stops along the way do little to actually show us anything about your progagonist or the other characters outside of some moral choices you can make, though they're largely inconsequential at the end.The tone of the narrative and the behavior of the characters are wildly inconsistant. When the game tries to be serious, it's unbelievable. When it tries to be irreverent, it's hit-or-miss. I often found myself mashing the spacebar to advance through about 30% of the dialogue, but it never seemed to go fast enough.Always Sometimes Monsters is a solid effort by a small studio, but it's not worth your time. In the first 90 seconds of the game, you're given the option to shoot a person who approaches you. Unless you're a big fan of boring exposition and tedious gameplay, I recommend using your weapon.

												After playing more indy games in a similar genre this game kinda sucks. It starts off hot then it cools down rapidly. The story is moderately interesting, but the bugs get in the way. You'll also find typos and poor grammar/syntax throughout the game. For a game that's almost entirely story, that's not ok.			"

												Brief impressions/Terrible writingI don't know if I like this game or not. In the very beginning you can get a bad end really fast by selecting a certain choice. Which I did choose even though I knew it was not the right one. Pretty much the basic set up is you chose a character by talking to someone during a particular party scene. It was pretty confusing at first who I was going to be playing as until I got the gist of what was happening. From what I understand the game simulates the struggle of being out of work and trying to make rent. It places a big emphasis the choices you make on how you're going to earn cash to pay rent. I don't believe there's a morality checker, so there are no right/wrong choices to make. I'm sure the player is supposed to meet some parts in the game where your moral stance on things is going to be questioned.The biggest gripe I have with this game is the lack of an options menu allowing you to change the movement to WASD. Other than that it seems like a real slog to go through which is going to run my patience quite quickly. Perhaps once I get further into the game is when it will really click for me. Overall I would recommend this game if you like role playing a person going through a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ time in their life.			"

I couldn't bring myself to finish.My score 7.5/10  for being a good idea with a ton of character.Would I recommend it?   At the $5.00 price point, sure. I'd pay that to support the dev's. At $10.00 I'd pass.			"

												It's strange the game that I don't like, but I can say that Always Sometimes Monsters is one of those, if you happen to be reading this before you've completed the game and still aren't hooked with it, do yourself a favor and stop playing, I kept going thinking it would get better and it just didn't. The game is LOOOONG and for bad gameplay reasons, since the story is relatively short, issues like movement and dialogue speed make the game feel sluggish, there are some nice story beats every now and then but ultimately they fail to deliver.The game promises a choice driven experience which is completely false, your decisions are inconsequential until the final moments of the game in which it boils down to the traditional choice structure that you've seen in a million other games.I have to give credit where its due, the game starts with promise when choosing the main character and the love interest, but it falls short just a couple of hours into the game when it becomes a snorefest of doing chores and getting X amount of money to get Y or doing X thing for Y to get something in return (which usually translates to money or quest items).The humor wasn't to my liking, some people may be into it but it felt pretty immature and cheessy. I would also have liked an option to get over your love interest, the whole story hinges on the presumption that the player wants to get back the ex, since there is no way to make your character get over him/her, this makes him/her (i.e. your character) feel unidimensional, stupid, and boring.Also the game developers appear on the game, their inclusion felt like it didn't fit at all and they wanted to give themeselves a semi-important part on the game, appearing on every single city and even on the epilogue, they felt out of place in the game and the wall-breaking wasn't to my taste.I can see what they (i.e. the developers) were trying to achieve with this but I felt ike they didn't succeed , nevertheless there are some good ideas which could be rescued and I'd like to see them expanded like documenting a journey or dynamic character interaction based on your main character, so I'll be looking forward to the next game they make, but if possible I'd skip their first stab at accomplishing their vision.I seriously can't recommend this game there are many other things I didn't like but most of the reviews I've read also cover those issues I had with the game (e.g. save scumming, bad endings all around, incoherent story, dumb stamina system, etc.), if you're planning to play a similar game with a great story and even developed on the same engine I'd recommend playing To the Moon, both your time and money would be invested better in that game.

												I put my hope high at first. that I would experienced a rich story game and had me lots of moral lesson, like butterfly-effect-movie-feel, where it doesnt matter what you choose there're times you become a monster. But instead:-the game is over if you pick wrong choices.-ridiculous story, spy, a boxing dog, mafia, fast and furious, fishing kid, packing weeds, etc.-empty towns.-walk too much.-pointless fatigue n' food variant. I only bought barnstormer the entire game. no drink. no smoke.-boring. I left the game open sleeping alot.-tedious money grinding.-I moved 100 boxes in the warehouse. -I moved 100 boxes in the warehouse! -why?! IDK noone told me to stop! or told me I've done a great job moving all those boxes and you can stop if you want!-do you know how it feels? try it and I bet you would tumbdown this game also.-some of h-games was more entertaining than this game.-try huniepop if you dont believe me or everlasting love, a free gem.-you need to patch it first tho to unlock the h-content.-last, I don't even think all bad decisions made the main character any monsterous at all.I dont want to be harsh, but tbh the game is basically just a collection of bad mini games with bad story. sorry.recommendation : buy the game while on sale.

												Few games manage to tell such a breathtaking story with such admirable minimalism as Always Sometimes Monsters does. What’s even greater is you are in control of the story, and how the game will pan out. For me, calling this a game is an understatement of what it really is. Always Sometimes Monsters is a declaration about life, about how our choices are all we really have, and about how those choices, no matter how small, can reorient our life in ways that we can never predict. In life there is regrets, happiness, anger, wishfulness and countless other human feelings. Always Sometimes Monsters shows that while experiencing these feelings is inevitable, you will never be able to travel back and reshape your life with different choices, so you have to make the best of what you have and never sink into regret with the decisions you’ve made in life, or you will never be able to move forward in the unique journey that is your life. 10/10			"

												I really wanted to like this game, because I like encouraging indie game developers and new game genres.  This was a great idea for a game that kind of went awry. It's a pure story role-playing game, where as a character you mainly make choices, have experiences and move the story forward. This part was great! However, the following dragged down the game:- Unsympathetic characters (a.k.a. losers) that were hard to like, especially the main character- Dialog that tried really hard to be deep, but wasn't- I hate it when writers write about writers (the main character is a writer). This is lazy writing. Writers really need to get out there into the world and experience things, so that when they ""write about what they know"" they actually have something interesting to say- Did I mention that the main character was a loser? We deliberately lost the game because we thought the main character was such a doorknob that they didn't deserve the love interest.- Mini games that were uninteresting and repetitive, but that you were often forced to endure- A theme of ""you only get true love once!"" UGH- I could never get the game to go fullscreen, and it was impossible to remap the controls to something less awkwardSo, it was a game with a lot of potential, but it didn't live up to that potential. I look forward to seeing other games delve into this pure story RPG genre and succeed where Always Sometimes Monsters failed.			"

 DO NOT READ ON IF YOU DON'T WANT SPOILERS, YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED.  Recently, me and my girlfriend had gone through a lot of stress together, it was very difficult for us both and we were finding it really hard to keep going.  I had picked this game up a while ago when I'd learnt it was her favourite game, but never got round to completing much due to a mistake that caused me to lose my progress. When she was at her lowest with me, and all I wanted was to see her smile and heal with me, I decided I'd play it through, to show her my care in some way. I selected the character most like me  in the initial area, and found the character most like her on the patio (which surprised me, as both characters were really rather close to our looks). I signed the card with our names, then showed her the dialogue piece of us, to which she set me on a challenge.  ""It won't end well, Sam.""  she said, which kind of gut punched me at first, but I realised it was sort of the nature of the game. Nevertheless, I intended to prove her wrong entirely through my own feeling, knowing already of some of the endings I knew there was a happy one, amongst all the others. Now set with a passion, I fell into the characters shoes and began to live the story itself through him. Or, me. Technically.  I set off with the same sparking desire to win her back as the character in the game, prepared to do anything to make that happen. Each day passing filling me with anxiety, a feeling I very rarely feel, I did everything how I would in real life, and felt every emotion doing it. Upon receiving the wedding invitation, my heart sank into my stomach, where it sat for a while. This game coupled with our situation put me in the most awful of feelings, feelings I'd rarely felt and feelings that were common as of late. I progressed, trying to make as much money as possible and spending as little as I can whilst retaining some morality, as I would do in real life. I'd prepared a nice sum of money before I took off to  San Verdano , around $17k, through working and prize fighting, I was pretty confident in finally travelling to Casey's. To every question Casey asked, I tried to answer how it likely would have happened, or how I felt. I played every scene in the game this way, but didn't know the importance of these until it was over. I went to the bachelors party, begrudgingly, only hoping to do some gambling with the money I'd mustered up, as I saw no point in having it now. After infuriatingly finding where to buy a suit, as I had been told to do, I decided to play some blackjack, but quickly got bored and decided to keep on with the story, especially since I was so close. Luckily, I'd stopped there with just over $11k in my account. Upon coming across the casino debt scene, I was able to pay his debt in cash, keeping my journal and getting rid of the money I saw no use in having anymore. I then went on to the wedding, the deciding scene. All manners of horrible feelings crept throught my body as I watched the plane transition screen, which then bolstered into pain as I saw the wedding area. I chatted with several people before the wedding started, disappointing red shirt dude because I sold his Indie Heroez thing, but returning Dareff's guitar successfully. Giving Dareff's guitar back raised my spirits a little bit, which was funny to me, as I play guitar myself, it's helped me through a lot of self-confidence issues, so I was slightly attached to it, which is why I didn't sell it.I let the wedding commence, then objected at my first chance. My heart shattered initially as she said she was sorry to me, before I realised she was saying it to Sam, not me. I'm Sam, he's Sam, I hate my name. The rush of happiness and relief as I realised I'd managed to do it flooded me, and my heart grew two sizes. I instantly began screengrabbing dialogue and ramming it into her chatbox, filled with excitement. I let the scenes keep going and saw Sam end up as the homeless man, saw me signing the book and sent mass of screenshots to her, utterly ecstatic.I really connected with the character, I think only due to our situation, but that doesn't matter to me, any game that can make me feel this way deserves my recommendation.Me and my girlfriend are better now, and a lot happier.8/10 - I can't give it a 10/10, as I can only really say I felt this way due to our problems at the time, but it get's a 10/10 personally. This is my verdict for any other potential purchasers.			"

												Always Sometimes Monsters is a RPG of sorts. You don’t fight monsters and level up. You instead make choices and these choices affect your story. It is a very interesting story with lots of decisions to make, with a couple of flaws. There are some parts that are really tedious. (Making tofu and boxing to make money are the two worst examples.) Also, there is more of an illusion of choice in some cases. That said, it is worth playing through more than once, so it is worth $10 to pick up.			"

Always Sometimes Monsters  is a slice-of-life story about a down-on-their-luck writer determined to travel across the country to win back their ex, who is to be married in a month.  Despite the beginning (which I didn't really enjoy too much) the game picked up for me and I enjoyed it quite a bit by the time I finished it.Pros-Story starts off simple and is easy to get into.-When the humour works, it works.-LOADS of branching paths and decisions really makes it feel like your character is truly unique.-The developers have really done a good job of making your journey seem like a struggle.  I mean, not like it's a BAD thing...it's trying to emulate an experience of a broken person's cross-country journey after all...Cons-In my opinion it's a bit too easy to make some decisions you'll regret regarding the ending.  You might understand this once you finish the game.  However, this can be seen as a pro as well (since the game revolves around making choices that are hard to make and could change everything).-When the humour doesn't work, it REALLY falls on its face.-People who don't care for this slice-of-life stuff would be wasting their money on this game.-The ending itself was pretty disappointing in my opinion.To sum it up: Fun game if you're into this stuff but ten dollars is a bit of a steep pricetag.  Hopefully this review helped potential-buyers make a decision.  Have a good one!			"

												I only recommend this for it's story, which is somewhat meandering but still interesting; as a game, I would not recommend this. Mostly because it is too rigid about what you have to do to get the best ending possible and far too much of it is padded out by tedium and random chance.Sprite work is charming and the music is decent, but if the same team makes another game similar, could you add a volume control, please?

												This game is what happens after Ness grows up, and his life spirals out-of-control into seven year herion binge. You give up turn-based strategy in favor of choose your own destiny, and it works. You basicly set off on this morbidly funny adventure to right the wrongs in your life...to what sounds like, but isn't, the soundtrack of Drive.Always Sometimes Monsters is freshing to me. I grew up during the NES/SNES days and some of my favorite titles looked just like this. Earthbound being one of them. I've found that as I get older..I crave a game like what I used to enjoy as a kid, but something newer, different, more adult. Always Sometimes Monsters quenched that thirst for me. I hope there will be more like it, but this game is a gem regardlesss.			"

												I absolutely love this game.  It's definitely one of the best games I've played in quite a while.  The premise is intriguing, the execution spot-on, and the story just phenomenal.  The game was crafted beautifully.  There are so many little things to explore and choices to be made.  This is definitely a game I wouldn't mind revisiting.  Which is a good thing, because I didn't get the good ending during my first playthrough.  I will keep trying until I get it, and I'll probably keep playing even after.  I really do love this game that much.I highly recommend this game to anyone who is interested in games where your decisions made a big impact on the story.			"

												This game definitely isn't BAD,but it is mediocre and I can't wholeheartedly recommend it. Dialog and scenes tend to overstay their welcome, some minigames (like the boxing one) are unfun or could use a more straigforeward explination, and the humor doesn't really do it for me. Otherwise, it's a fun adventure game with an emphesis on choice and I did feel like I had an impact on the narrative.My biggest complaint of all is that the game seemed to encourage me to want to get back with my ex, even though I didn't like him. I understand that part of role playing is playing a role but there seemed to be no rewarding option for moving on. I wish the devs considered making multiple ""good"" endings with different definitions of good.			"

												Best heartbreak simulator.I really got immersed in the game and I really felt what my character was going through, this is a game that makes you wonder about your choices in real life. I did try to play as a good person, but it was so tempting to steal or do something wrong... And yes, I did wrong things but with good purposes. I felt like Darkeff was really my friend (I wish I could give up on the ex and date him but it's a game) and I couldn't let his girlfriend die. And then, at the end looking like a lovesick psycho. The game taught me a lot of things, such as letting go and not trusting people.			"

												After completing this game in its entirety, I can't bring myself to recommend it, yet I feel compelled to share my thoughts. Beware, minor spoilers may follow. If you had asked me when I was 2 hours into my playthrough, I would have given Always Sometimes Monsters a thumbs up, but my perspective on the game changed as I neared its conclusion. It did not take long for me to realize this game is certainly out of the ordinary, perhaps purposely deviant from the typical RPG, and it is very mature, story-rich, and at times, a brilliantly written work. I certainly think a lot of thought was put into the story itself and the consequences your character's decisions have on others.  Basically, the plot involves a struggling writer who lost the love of his/her life and has a month to make it to their wedding. As such, after you get thrown out of your apartment in the very beginning, you are given a city to explore, with the goal of rounding up enough money  to get your key back and eventually buy a bus ticket to the next city. Making the money is a day-by-day process which can sometimes seem like a chore depending on how you go about doing it. I found myself going to the employment center in town to spend the day working at a tofu factory making countless soy burgers for a mediocre salary. I later found a job as a reporter, where I was faced with the decision to accept a bribe to write a fake story. It wasn't too uninteresting, if you keep in mind your final goal, but it might not appeal to someone who is looking for the story to move at a faster pace.  The biggest letdown for me was the fact that despite the numerous decisions you'll end up making during the course of the game, it seems that in the end, the options for endings are rather limited. The ending I got was not at all fulfilling for my character. The moments leading up to the ending sequences left me guessing, but I suppose I was left wanting something different. Unfortunately, some of the dialog options I was given did not really fit with what I would have personally said. I tried to be the nice guy throughout the game, yet at times this was impossible as there was a lack of ""good"" options for certain situations, making you feel like the bad guy no matter what. I appreciate Vagabond Dog's efforts here in many respects. They have produced a realistic choice-based game where one can easily relate to the character they chose to portray, and tells a lot life and people's struggles. I just wish the final product was crafted better. 6/10			"

												Uhh, well then. Another one for the neutral list. Foremost issue being the full screen mode. It was working till I accidentally hit a key while eating and now it doesn't work. At all. There is a work around, but often feels weird still seeing it in windowed mode after having it in fullscreen. If I can all this an issue, no noticeable directive or even maybe a little information on controls. Even though it may be common knowledge for most, it's often taken advantage of.If I can sum this game up in a single phrase: ""that was unexpected."" It has mature themes. With one particular incident sticking out in mind.  If you go to the ""apartment"" of the girl who wanted the happy pills, you end up walking into a scene similar to what you may find at a hostel. And you unlock the ability to stay in the apartment (on the seemingly clean couch.) I wouldn't call the story bad, but I wouldn't call it good either. As I said, I'm neutral towards it. More picking negatively for the technical issues. It's not something I would replay. It's a good once over, but due to choices, can be replayed for different outcomes. Also, if you like sandwiches, there may be a character you could get fond of. Didn't really get attached to anyone. Story seems rather shallow. Like why would I  want to stop my ex's wedding and try getting back together? Many things raise questions, but I wouldn't doubt many have realistically tried any of it.I bought this out of curiosity during a sale. You may like it or you may not. I caution however, that if you have family around, it may get awkward.			"

												The writing of the game starts out pretty well and the game does include multiple choices which affect the game later on. However, the actual gameplay leaves a lot to be desired. There is a large amount of RNG in a place that doesn't need it. The jobs are just boring and you only do them for money to progress the game. And as the game continues even the writing quality falls. Unless you can get this game for extremely cheap or get it in a bundle, this game is not worth the time.			"

Some will like that more than others, and you definately have choices in this game which will effect the outcome of your story. Even decisions that I assumed were minor, came back and bit me in the♥♥♥♥♥So if you don't mind doing a bit of exploring and grinding then its a good game to play.			"

												A really interesting concept and first couple of hours, but really falls apart after the first town. I'm all for understanding cheap indie-games for not having funding, but there are a few PAINFUL sections in this game that just demonstrate a complete misunderstanding of both games and story-telling... Far from worth the price tag, and that's sad because I was really intrigued by the initial premise.			"

												This game is really weird for me. I guess I'll start with the normal things to review:Graphically this game isn't a masterpiece, it's your normal bitstyle game.The music in this game also isn't stellar, if you aren't a fan of looping music it might even be bad. I thought it was fine but nothing I'd tell a friend about for sure.The gameplay is exactly what you'd expect for a story driven game so really I guess this is mixed with story. And the story is what made me get this game to begin with. While It's not very common for me to be emotionally invested in a game besides just wanting to see how it turns out, I was 100% invested in this game from start to finish. I'm not even really sure what it was. My character didn't look like me at all, I didn't know much about my love interest besides the fact that I wanted to get to her, but I was always invested in the game. If I had to attribute it to something I'd say that with how dialogue works and the with the choices you're given, you end up creating your own story. If that is something you can get behind, I highly, highly recommend this game. It should be known that it only took me 4 hours to playthrough the game though, so keep that in mind.			"

												Always sometimes Monsters is a game about being morally corrupt and evil to get through the game easier.From the offset you are set with the task of travelling across the country to go to your Exe's wedding to attempt to win her back and to this you need to raise large amounts of money for bus trips, make friends with people who can help you out and maybe rig an election and get some people killed on the way...It is a pretty entertaining game with a lot of content, my first playthrough lasted 6 hours which may be abnormally long so I wouldn't trust that as the average play time but the game spans 30 in game days which each have 3 sections for which you can perform actions such as working and talking with acquaintances making big decisions along the way.Overall it was a satisfying experience and seems to have a reasonable amount of re-playability if you are the kind of person who wants to see everything the game has to offer if not one playthrough is probably enough to justify its price depending on whether or not you attempt to rush it or take it at a slower pace.

												I was sure I wrote a negative review for this game once before - soon after I completed the game, in fact. But it seems to have vanished into the ether.This is a game about choice that does not respect your choices.This is a game with a message that comes off as forced and juvenile.I do not recommend this game. From what I still remember, while it does touch on some serious life issues this game does not have any great depth - and every issue you are presented with seems to boil down into a reductionist binary, to say nothing of the pretentious way they are presented.

												For me, a video game is something that I use to escape a stressful day, to get away from the high demands of life and work. With Always Sometimes Monsters I was hoping to jump into a surreal world full of death danger and decay. But it delivered an experience much like life, and rather than give it a surreal outlook it showed me how surreal it really is.Always Sometimes Monsters sends you on the road trip from hell. Broke, depressed and just about to give up hope you must travel from place to place to reach the other end of the country to stop the love of your life from tying the knot with someone else. Whilst this sounds like a pretty easy task, it isn't. And sadly, it wasn't one I enjoyed as much as I had hoped to.I know that this game is centred around choice, and on my first play though I came across a lot of hard decisions and I gather than everyone's experience will be different. But to be honest, I never found any of them to affect me or the characters in the game on an emotional level, up until the final hour so of the game. Everything I did just seemed to brush off, until you get a summary of everything you have done near the finale. Choice is something I long for in a game, but I feel as if Always Sometimes Monsters made these choices abrupt and I never really had much time to work up to them. Whilst I do gather that I have gotten a different version of the story from everyone else, I never really found anything all  that  controversial for video game standards. I was hoping with something with a little more depth, rather than just giving me a harsh re-telling of reality. I was forced to work, make friends, loose friends just like everyday life. I found the first half of the game very tedious. Moving from place to place, scrounging for scraps, living off others and just being an all round disaster of a person is not something I long for in a video game. Choices really didn't start to get serious until the latter half of the game. My version of the ending really disappointed me. It completely destroyed the atmosphere of the game, so I will be hunting around to try and change it somehow.Always Sometimes Monsters does have its good side, mind you. I don't know what living a broken life is like, but I really feel Vagabond Dog pulled it off. The atmosphere was amazing, I did really feel I was living a life rather than just watching someone’s life. I did really feel like if I didn't pay that rent, I would ruin my life even more, and I really did get motivated to stop the wedding. As well as feeling great, it also looked and sounded great. Lovely artwork, and a great sound track to supplement it. Great work.All in all, whilst it had its downs, Always Sometimes Monsters is something that I think can be enjoyed by anyone, and the multiple scenarios make it something I shall visit often. I followed this game for months, watching every video, reading every story. My hopes were very high. And whilst it was something I did have a good time with it, I wanted to love it. + Multiple choices that will effect the outcome of certain events, highly replayable.+ Great art direction and soundtrack.+ Created an immersive life simulation, and the struggles that comes with it. - Some of the game felt like a chore- Slow paced first half. Took me a while to get into- Some choices in my play through were brushed off too easily, i.e.  I killed a man with four children and seemed to show no remorse 7.5/10			"

												Overall rating: 8.4 / 10It is not good when you are at loss of words while trying to write a useful review. I have started up this game expecting a decent story that normally comes with this genre, but I have not hoped to get what I did. Developing a decent game is hard as there are many aspects to consider and implement them in a good way but is totally different to create a masterpiece.I would go as far to pin a tag ""Educational"" on this game as it will lead you through an endless really hard and realistic decisions a person may have to make during their lives. The game uses very interesting and perhaps cheeky ways of turning the character you control into yourself, a really hard achievment that makes me both love and in a weird way - hate this game. Before I realized what is going on, it was telling a story about myself.People speak of how good or bad games are and it is really rare when you just wish to say: ""Thank you"" like i do now. Thank you.---------------------------------------------------------------------Pixel art: 8.5 / 10Mostly very pleasant, detailed looking game. Every room is made beautifully and aside one counter you can walk over, everything works perfect.Story: 10 / 10While it may seem the story is slow progressing at the start, soon you come to realize it just perfect and that any word you say or any action you do or do not do may lead you into another totally different way. The game branches quite nicely and in reality speaks about you. It will throw at you the hardest possible choices and just perhaps help you find your place in the world, both in game and in real life. There are no crazy things in this game, no dragons or unicorns. Consider it a life simulator. A great one in my opinion.Soundtrack: 7.5 / 10Not memorable, not annoying. However, it sets the mood perfectly and follows you through the game quietly, allowing you to focus on everything else. I think it fits the game well.Controls: 8 / 10Like any RPG pixel game, controls are not too difficult or confusing. I have found it interesting though as you have to pause the game to access your inventory. Walking speed of the character seemed too slow at parts, but nothing of this ruins the game, especially if you have some patience and like exploring.Fun factor: 8 / 10Full recommendation!			"

This game has you breaking friendships and partnerships and occasionally brutally murdering people with consequences and it's beautifully well done. I highly recommend this to anyone.			"

												An amazing story driven game, your choices really don't matter at the end, except for the last few. It does make you realize how you went about it may or may not have been...ethical.Though I was very let down in the end, realizing that everything led up to really two choices, and those choices affected your ending. The journey was great though, sometimes felt tidious, but overall a good experience and worth checking out.EDIT: Most of the negative reviews state ""Why should I care about my ex?"" Well I put my name and the name of my actual girlfriend and it made it a lot more personal. I felt like I was actually fighting for someone I care about, and it really drove the game forward for me.Second Edit: I should add this game felt so unique and different from every other game it left me with what I like to call the ""Stanley Parable Effect"". Basically some games make you look at every other game in your library and say to yourself ""Well crap, this game just doesn't stand up, nothing is going to give me that feeling of the said games I just finished"" Just a heads up, that feeling wears off (Thank God) and eventually you will move on and find another gemstone of a game that makes you feel like this industry is still worth fighting for.

												Well, didn't expect this much fun when I bought this. The idea of this game is good - to induce self-reflection, analysing your own actions and choices and try to get you to think about yourself as a person. I think in this, it succeeds somewhat. But the execution leaves something to be desired. I think there are a few times in the game where it tries to go 'philosophical' on you, but it feels forced and therefore not particularly intelligent. And, although I've only played through once, it seems like a lot of the stuff you do doesn't really matter in the end. Though to some degree, one could say that the fact that it makes you think about the choices you made is worthy of praise. It's not bad for a first attempt. There are mistakes littered throughout the world, but for me that was part of its charm. There's a certain feeling of sincerity that can only be achieved by a small team writing about life. It's certainly a game that deserves attention. The concept is great and the story compelling. It's pretty cheap and I would say worth the asking price for the amount of enjoyment it brings. However the execution is wanting. Therefore. not everyone will like it. Some typical gamers will flat out hate it. But if you’re not typical, and if story matters to you more than twitch reflex, then by all means buy this game.  "

												Probably one of the best indie games I have ever played. Really makes you think how decisions you make in life that make the day ""easier"" come back to haunt you, and the more work you put into something, the more you get out. I feel like the game taught many valuable life lessons, and even made me think about some choices I have been making recently. A very beautiful game with an amazing soundtack, storyline, and development crew. I will forever believe this game is one of the few that actually made me rethink my life choices, and video games usually lack the ability to do such a thing. Always Sometimes Monsters is definitely worth a playthrough.			"

												Always sometimes monsters is an interesting approach to RPG story telling that touches on harsh adult topics and aspects of life that many take for granted until we stand on our own, and this game leaves you thinking about your own life in the end, unpleasant as it may be.As the player you will struggle with making money for food, finding places to sleep and working towards your goal, whatever that may be in the end and will be presented many choices as the game progresses that will test your morals.If you are one of those that are easy to depress, I wouldn't recommend this game, but if you're interested in following a harsh story with heartbreak and drama, check it out, just know what you're getting into and steel yourself.

												Where to start?This game is a very.. unique one. I want to say it was ""cute"", but honestly, it wasn't all fun and happy. (It's style is very cute and neat 2D though!) It can get very boring and tedious at certain points in the story, but was overall entertaining. It's not your typical, get in the game, git muny, git rich- kind of game. You are relatively poor throughout it, and through hard work and choices you make you can go up or down. The choices are very important in this game and can affect the outcome of the entire game. So pick what you believe would be the best, I suppose. (-: It took me a couple play throughs to get a good ending but really was worth it in the end. The only cons to this that I faced were the tediousness of your tasks, the choices, etc. A main con would have been how I felt like I was just flying through the story with no handles on everything. I felt like I wasn't doing the story right, but there was no ""right"" way to go through the story. (that was point of it wasn't it?) It was very engaging, fun, and lasted me 15 hours of trying to figure out where the hell and what the hell to do. I throughly enjoyed it though. q:-)			"

												This game was initially very fun, but it left me feeling disappointed and unsatisfied no matter which ending I got. I love choice games but without giving anything away I will say I was sort of annoyed to find there were no endings that were even remotely happy... Now I don't want or need sunshine or rainbows and this game definitely didn't need the ~happily ever after~ but every ending is just downright depressing. And all over a love interest. I sort of expected it to be either a story of winning back your love or getting over a love. I would have particularly loved the second option, myself. But the way that your character's happiness clearly hinges on another person and whether or not they love them just leaves me uncomfortable, to be honest. The gameplay itself isn't bad and it's an interesting concept. It's just poorly executed and very unsatisfying. I really wanted to like this game, but it just wasn't my cup of tea.			"

												There are very few titles around that dare touch on the themes explored in ASM.  Poverty and unemployment, teenage angst, prejudice, inequality, guilt. The game draws on RPG Maker style and mechanics, but shapes its own unique representation of contemporary urban experiences in western ""developed"" societies. And despite the seriousness of the topics explored, the game never loses its sense of humour, lending a sweet taste of comedy even in some of the story's darkest moments. As most reviewers have already remarked, in ASM every choice matters, from the moment when players decide their avatar (together with 2064 RAM the only game in my knowledge that is 100℅ LGBT friendly) up to the story's climatic end. Being a die-hard adventure gamer I am all for story-rich scenarios even at the cost of hi-end visuals or length, and therefore I couldn't hold my enthusiasm when I first landed on Dumbstown (the first town you will encounter in your journey). Faced with practical as much as moral dilemmas that most of us encounter in real-life scenarios I could not wait to find out the cost and consequences of the paths I chose in the game's carefully crafted day-night cycles. Different endings depend on choices you make early in the game, while the options are numerous enough to make a second or even third playthrough worth the effort ( for better or for worse, achievements do NOT require second playthroughs but come naturally as the game progresses).Yet, this is where my reservations and second thoughts began emerging. Quite soon, I realised that the binary system of choices (most of the times based on a loosely defined moral standard) had little effect on the story's linear thread. It wasn't long before I felt tired of pressing the enter button only to  follow long dialogues that added philosophical dimensions on the game's ""difficult"" choices. All this did little to help me identify with my character's journey of self-doubt, and here is where I think the game's greater weakness lies. It is surprising, for example, that although much of your effort will be focused on completing a personal journal, nowhere in the game will you be able to read or write it. For a game that is so well-crafted in its literal aspects this  striked me as an unnecessary omission. Perhaps less or shorter dialogues and more opportunities for introspective reflections would allow players to immerse deeper in the protagonist's world.Nonetheless, I believe the strength of ASM lies more on its context rather than its actual content, which might appear quite swallow at times. Every little detail on the pixelized cities and interiors conveys messages and connotations: from the backyards of modern slums to avant-garde patios of middle-class affluence, Always Something Monsters has something to say about the world we live in when we turn our PC off. For this reason alone, it deserves your full attention.			"

												Always I aim for the best ending, and I ended getting the worst in the first playthrough lol. Thanks to my trusty friend Standby422216 (my other gamer buddy) for joining me for this ride by my side <3. Here's my thoughts and review of the game, along with my expirience. No spoilers, promise.So I played it through once, choosing answers and choices that I would normally choose, and then played it again following a guide to get the best of both worlds. I definitely recommend you doing the same. It's how I got a full experience. :)Not having any strategy guide (or any guide in particular) was difficult at first, especially with how oblivious I am as a person, so you could only imganine how many wrong turns I took going at it. LOL. Anyway, given how it's supposed to be a realistic ""pick and choose/your choice determine the outcome"" type of game, not having a guide would actually make sense, seeing as how life itself doesn't come with a guide. Back to the game, however, I give it a 9/10. The storyline is absolutely amazing and delivers a better show of how reality can be tough while still adding a little flavor of that romantic fantasy like feel. I've always been a sucker for ""choose the outcome"" type of games, so I was really happy when I found this gem. (Many thanks to Cryaotic on YouTube for introducing me!) Also another reason is how the game made me feel very touched to each of the characters. Each character (that mattered) was very well rounded and I appreciated every one of them. Another reason was how the game had me at the edge of my seat with every choice I made. It reminds the player that once you make a choice, you can't go back. (Of course, you can here, because hey, save files, but that doesn't really work irl does it?) The game kept me involved and coming back for more each time. I played it twice to get the full feel, and I seldom play games twice this quickly.Now as for the downside or the 9, I have to say that some parts of the game were extremely tedious and unnecessarily long, such as working to farm money. I mean, sure, working irl can be tedious and boring, but it feels a bit draggy in a videogame. Also, I wouldn't have minded perhaps a more juicy/romantic scene as a reward for getting the best ending (because it's a tad difficult to accomplish) but hey, again, I'm a weird gal and that's just my opinion. Once again, 9/10. Great game overall. Thanks for the memories, Vagabond Dog!			"

												I can tell that a lot of thought went in to making this game, but that doesn't mean that it's good. It's just okay. I wasn't compelled enough to finish through the entire thing. I made it to boxing gym and gave up at that point. I didn't care enough to write down the counter-attacks/etc.. and follow through on the boxing matches. There was really nothing in the game that made me to move forward.The artificial pauses in this game are infuriating. If you do another title like this, please have less of them.			"

												Always Sometimes Monsters may look like an ineteresting, grim, 8-bit Soap Opera on its surface, but it misses its mark with  lackluster, out-of-place humor, extensive dialogue that mires down the gameplay, and anti-climatic missions that leave you asking why you're wasting your time with all of it.  Even the storyline, which is what should carry this game like this forward, is so flat and contrived you simply feel nothing by the time the experience is over.  It's simply a disappointment.			"

The soundtrack is completetly beautiful. really suits the games, the scenes, sets the atmosphere really well.Didn't really mind the whole complete dialouge after dialouge after dialouge becasue for me it helpeed set what was happening in that particular part of the story.really enjoyed the fact you have to work your butt off in each city to progress onto the next. money wasnt ""easy"" to make but it wasnt hard either.all in all as others have said, minus the ending which was a REALLY big let down, i do highly recommend this game, for $0.99 you can't complain much.

												(This is just a snippet. Watch the whole review by clicking here.)Always Sometimes Monsters is definitely not a game that has disappointing moral choices, as it most certainly lives up to every expectation I leveled at it, and performs more than admirably in it's execution. And what a treat it is that the moral choices in Always Sometimes Monsters are so complex, because this gem which can be seen as inaccessible at times and obtuse at others, tells a story that is a standout title in video games as a whole, one that confronts the player with mature subject manner that is almost never discussed in games, the exact stuff that anyone who loves video games has been begging to see for years. Always Sometimes Monsters is complex, potentially one of the most layered and intricate games I've ever played. It was even explained in an interview with the devs I was privy to that the average player will see less than 50% of the game. Rarely is a game so ambitious to try to explore such a complex story in a complex way that is actually meaningful, and you would be a fool to not see how uniquely Always Sometimes Monsters accomplishes this goal.

												I'm going to start this by saying that I got the Humble Bundle as an early Christmas present and while trying to decide which one of its awesome games to play first, I set my hands on Always Sometimes Monsters just because it was an RPGMaker-made game (and I have a huge soft spot for their minimalistic supremacy). Also, this review is going to be an unusually long one for me because I haven't spazzed over a game of this category in so long, even if it looks pointless.A crudely beautiful game, Always Sometimes Monsters is what they call ""a life simulator"", setting you up in one of the worst life scenarios possible: broke, jobless, homeless, loveless. Trying to fight back all the obstacles and win back the love of your life, you decide on your own destiny with every single option you make, which is the essential point of this game. All the elements of storyline, pixel graphics, and soundtrack construct step by step an immersive feeling into the plot, which is unfolded, again, with every step you take and every option you make.The story starts off with an interesting allusion, which then brings you into the game experience itself. It's hard, it's stomach-churning, even far-fetched sometimes when striving over the edge to be real, but it never fails to serve its primary goal: life isn't meant to be easy. Gamers up for a good story will know this one isn't disappointing... until you reach the end of the game. With so many choices in-game it's nearly impossible to know you're doing what's right according to the game without a walkthrough (I am guilty of that, but solely because I wanted my love back), though this was an element that really hurt my feelings as I was suffering along with nearly everyone in the story, and even after replaying the game with different characters, I was still left quite confused and unsatisfied with the elements of the ""eternal ending"". The fact that the interpretations are left open for the player to make is a nice thought, but I still am not sure I enjoy this in games. Moreover, the small easter egg popular arcades are a nice touch, although most likely not replayable and serving their purpose for the image and only. (Swedish Pac-Man with meatballs anyone? Damn yes!)Nevertheless, all the choices possible raise up this game's replayability for me, so I will definitely spend more time into it. I also have to congratulate the developers on their initiative to create a ""character selection"" box regardless of gender, race or sexual orientation, as well as on the implementation of the selection as a node into the allusion that starts it all. I also enjoy the fact that they actually put themselves in the game, since, in my opinion, their dialogues construct extra food for thought concerning the game. I know I'd love to do that if I was a game developer.The average decent RPGMaker pixelly graphics are able to set up a real-like atmosphere in the city, combined with the morose darkness of the backstreets, but there's nothing else to say about them. As for the dialogues, they're captivating yet full of orthograph mistakes (and I really am someone who doesn't like being a grammar nazi) which should be fixed.The soundtrack... What could I possibly say about the soundtrack?! Fresh, stylish, retro feeling while still modern enough, rinvigorating and immersive! Laser Destroyer Team outworked themselves on it and it's undoubtedly a fine piece of work. Every little piece or loop helps set the mood and captivate the player, it's really catchy. It's a nice thing the LP is available through Steam as a preview of their work, although it's really worth it to support them on their Bandcamp and get the EP and XP too (in all honesty, I'll always wish for a physical copy... Christmas wish found!). It's a complete and on the spot soundtrack.Long story short, this game had a huge impact on me as I'm quite sure it has on many others. Intriguing storyline and graphics, smooth gameplay, disappointing ending, stunning soundtrack.This game has made me question the severity a lot of things in life. There was one day I was at the supermarket and I saw a vagabond roaming around the aisles, so I stopped and thought just for a moment, what if that was me? It was actually another confidence boost to show myself that there is tougher stuff out there that can be overcome, and for that I couldn't be happier. I'll definitely replay this game more than once, because I really want to find all the secrets, and totally suggesting it to anyone who likes themselves a good story, so long as they can forgive the mistakes in its existence. This game has changed me and I'm grateful for that, and I'm really interested in clearing out anything hidden in the game. And who knows, ""maybe I could translate the game for free""! Haha. Or probably make a comic about it. With a personally envisioned happy ending to satisfy those who didn't like the one in the game, haha.Thank you sincerely for this little experience of a game.			"

Wonderful game that makes you think deep  about your decisions in real life as well as the game. This is definately going to be a classic.			"

												A lot of this game was ♥♥♥♥♥♥ writing with the promise of a fantastic story where your choices actually matter. Truth is the only choices that actually do matter are the ones you make at the casino and wedding at the end of the game. The game seemed to force the idea that good choices aren’t always easy by making the good choices set you back, making you doing hours about hours of grinding to get any farther, while most of the bad choices help you complete the game faster. Those bad choices don’t even really matter at the end as the choices that actually do matter are the ones you make at the casino and wedding. Along with some poor dialogue the “great story” was heavily weighed down. Sometimes I wanted to make choices that were totally reasonable and logical but I was forced into situations I wouldn’t choose.  Potential Spoilers Poor writing caused this game to suffer, like how Sam and Rose got together even though she was totally weirded out by him, to the point where she wanted me to tell him to stop because it was bothering her but somehow they end up together, I don't understand. I don't think any ending is really the good ending, someone always ends up in that alley. I don't think really any of these characters would ever be happy in this story, Rose was so broken with losing Sam that I can’t help but think she was always broken and would be still in every ending no matter if they showed it or not. Overall This game had great promise but ruined it by focusing on quantity and trying to enforce an unrealistic moral code.			"

Played about 10 hours without replaying it.Too bad you have to read every dialog yourself, gets a bit exhausting after a while.There a lot of choices which all affects your story. But there is no false choice, only easy or hard, good or evil.Some parts are annoying, like the boxing. You have to sacrifice yourself to the RNG-Gods.But overall, a very nice, entertaining game.

												This is one of the best games I have ever had the pleasure of immersing myself in.I dont think I even have words to describe the in depth emotion I felt while playing this game. The fact that I couldnt put it down for more then a few moments speaks volumes as my attention is getting harder and harder to keep these days (yes, I am old).Although on a second play through I must say it is a touch more guided then I would have thought at first but still has a ton of options to carve your own path. All in all I would suggest this to everyone and anyone I happen to meet that likes video games			"

												First of all this my opinion. I didn’t like this game because it was boring, repetitive, and the ending was terrible. The story was not interesting and ultimately lead to an unsatisfactory ending. The dialogue was terrible as well, along with the choices involved in the dialogue. Choices barely mattered. I can’t even describe the gameplay. This game had little effort put into it.  I strongly would advise not spend your money or time on this game even if the game was free. I love story based games, but this game was neither story nor game. Please save your money and time. This game is not beyond terrible.			"

												Going to agree with the sentiment that people have that there is a lot of potential here and it does have some quality stuff, but ultimately Always Sometimes Monsters ends up being a long-winded grindy slog. The game starts off interesting enough but then get more and more sparse as you progress, replacing more in-depth missions with just grinding out money. The main plot is also really make or break because your ex is essentially a plot device and you're expected to care with little to go on. So if you don't care and just want to move on with your character's life  the game just lassoes you into doing it anyway (I didn't do this, but I'm sure a good amount of people did.) The writing is prone to serious navel-gazing that rather borders on pretension. There is good writing but it gets drowned in the grind and wallowing a bit too much in pessimism and self-pity.I give them credit for trying for something different, even if they ended up kind of failing. It is priced pretty well, so maybe if you really interested you can give a shot, but I don't think most people will like it.			"

												I thought I would enjoy this game initially starting it. I'm a sucker for 'romance' and 'starting-at-rock-bottom' plots in RPGs.After playing a few hours it just didn't hold up. Most of the things my character was tasked to do were meaningless in driving the story forward and felt redundant. Due to all the filler content the game had my character doing, I ended up not caring enough about the main plot to even finish the game.In the time I spent playing Always Somtimes Monsters, I didn't see anything groundbreaking with morality or decision making, and the game wasn't all that 'edgy' as it claims.I don't recommend this game.

												First things first, Always sometimes Monsters is a serious emotional rollercoaster.This game is sad and a tragedy, it puts you in such tough situations and throws difficult decisions at you making you think what's going to happen if I do this, what will happen if I say that? I did my best choosing the right decisions and making money when I had too and chasing after my love interest / romantic other but in the end it was all in vein and even though in my ending we both had a happy-ish ending after that the happiness quickly faded away. Honestly this game is quite slow paced at first and if you rush things it won't do you much good because you have to do many things carefully to make sure things turn out the way you want. Always sometimes Monsters have various and many endings but sadly my first ending wasn't the happy one and I ended forever alone. I enjoyed this game and it made me sad, happy and anxious to what events were to come due to the choices I made.I would recommend this game to those who have the time to spare to play this game.			"

												My feelings towards this game swung drastically back and forth while playing it. At first I thought it was ok, showing some promise. Then, after about an hour in I realized it might not live up to that promise. Several hours later and I was loathing the experience. I almost gave up. But I'm glad I didn't. The final hour or so made everything worth it by putting the rest of the game into perspective.If you don't like slower-paced games or can't stand tediousness then you should avoid Always Sometimes Monsters. It is unbearably slow and boring at points, so if you don't think you can stomach that then stay away. But if you can, what you go through to get to the end does serve a purpose. I'd go so far to say that it's a necessary part of the journey.This is an adventure game that more closely mimics real life than is comfortable at times. You live as a homeless person. You have to make tough choices and sacrifices to move forward. Money matters way more than it should.I do have some major problems with it: it's not always obvious how to progress, and that can slow down an already slow game. Some of the situations are overly contrived. The minigames are far too repetitious. And there are bugs, including with the sprint button, making the game literally move even slower.And yet the hardships of the journey made me absolutely abhor a character at the end. It was one of the most raw emotions I've felt in gaming - certainly the most negative one. And it was directed at an imaginary person, based on events that never really happened. But I went through them. I experienced them. And that makes it real in some sense. Real for me.In a game where your decisions actually do matter I'd also like to point out that the developers made the achievements based on your progress rather than your choices or going down particular paths. This was the right move. It meant I didn't have to worry about multiple playthroughs or if I should be consulting a guide. I just experienced the game without worrying about anything outside of it. And that helped contribute to its impact.I don't think I'm ever going to replay Always Sometimes Monsters. At least not anytime soon. But it provided a singularly unique look at the world, through the lens of gaming. I can't ask for more.			"

												Just how vital is writing, the actual crafting of words, when it comes to presenting a great story and motivating listeners to keep watching? That’s a question Always Sometimes Monsters distills back to its core, with a 16-bit era roleplaying game (RPG) seen through text boxes, no voice acting and a pace dictated by hundreds of conversations. It’s thanks to consistently interesting characters entering the stage and down to earth yet surreal moments that this adventure manages to captivate all the way to its end. Having a say in a lot of the direction in which the tale unfolds just makes it that much greater, even if it’s not ideal.Full review: http://www.noobfeed.com/reviews/1074/always-sometimes-monsters

												Full disclosure: I didn't get very far in this game. I really wanted to like it. Everything I had heard about the game made it sound like a pretty interesting storytelling experiment. Unfortunately, the gameplay really drags this game down.Gameplay-wise, this thing is a grind. You're always performing odd jobs to gather the requisite money to reach your next goal. As I said, I didn't get very far into this game, but after playing through two days where I had to go do odd jobs to get money to attain my objectives, I had really had enough. Jobs are done via simple mini-games that just aren't any fun. Part of the issue is just the limitations of RPG maker, but honestly, I would have taken an option to just get a random result from the jobs rather than play them. A coat check minigame particularly grated on me.As far as story goes, I had high expectations. I'd heard lots of praise of the mature storytelling and complex themes of morality and agency. What I've seen so far was fine, I guess, but pretty much nothing is done to establish your character as someone you would want to root for or like. I realize that the point of the game isn't to be a hero, it's to show a life spiralling out of control, how circumstances can make anyone into a monster. But nothing of real substance is established about the main character before the slide, which for me diminished the emotional impact of the story and the choices. This is not to say the story is bad. It is a cut above the writing in a lot of games, but it just wasn't enough for me to get over the gameplay.I may come back to this game at some point just to see how things turn out, but so far, it's a slog.Verdict: Go read some Dostoevsky instead.

												When I first saw this game on Steam I had no interest in it whatsoever. I just looked at it's name and dismissed it as some Rogue-lite style game, without even bothering to check up what it actually was. I'm happy that I did decide to check it out a second time.If you enjoy a dark and depressive game with an incredible storyline then this is the game for you! It doesn't matter that it's graphics may not be impressive in any way because if you let yourself get immersed in the game then you're in for one hell of a ride. But beware, if you do give this game a chance and happen to like it then you'll have a hard time shutting it down until the story has reached it's end. I thought I had figured it out from the start, but I was thrown off by some unexpected twists in the plot, results of the choices I had made earlier in the game.When we're on the topic of choices, this game has plenty of them! And even if it may not be something that you consider to be a huge decision then it will have an impact on the story, subtle or less so. Some of the choices are hilarious, some are disturbing and some of them will make you feel like a miserable wreck. What's not to love about that?The game also contains some quite funny humour and interesting pop culture references. If I had to sum up this game in a single sentence then it'd be along the lines of: The darkest and most immersive RPG that I have played up to date. I sincerely hope that this game gets the fame that it deserves because it is truly a masterpiece in my eyes.And with that I'll end my review right here and jump straight into my second playthrough, thanks for taking the time to read it!EDIT: Corrected some of the many typos.

Traditional rating : 6.5/10Personal Rating : ""Worth trying""Well, it brings back memories of playing an old RPG game on snes. Probably teenage from 2k era hardly enjoy this.The story itself is fine, not so much to tell, and the gameplay seems like repetitive after a while. The game is made on RPG Maker, there's not many good games made from them, but this one is an exception.I will divide this in pro & cons.Pro+ 16bit music, you know, for nostalgia reason?+ Text based dialogue, you know, for nostalgia reason?+ The story is the main courses in this game, It's not the story about you crush zombie's head or killing the monster, it's about you fighting your way out of this cruel world. Yes, the ""Monster"" is our society. You're trying to survive from harm of our social integration.Cons- Sometimes there's a choice in dialogue that if you choose wrongly it will end (game over) the game and start again from save points. This game only auto-save your progress between map/stages , the choice sometimes appear at the middle of the playthrough. It really sucked to start all over again. You know, if there's a choice it should be having a different outcome of the story, not end or make it ""game over"".- Some events only triggered if you walk over it (old styles) and you can literally don't know what to do if there's no event triggered. So yeah, you will walk almost all over place to make the event triggered and thats kinda cheap trick, I belive I can make event triggered by any other means in RPG Maker.TL;DRAnything else is so-so, the story was fine, the artworks kinda meh, the soundtrack is more of nostalgia thing rather than good cover.

												I think I would give this game an 8/10. I stayed up very late to finish it lol. Its nice to take a break from all of the first person shooter games and racing and simulators. This game was different. It expelled strong emotions you real feel for the characters. You have a lot of choice over what happens in this game. It would have been nice to be able to go back through  and do more once you've completed it, but there are 9 save file slots so if you save at certain points you can do that anyway. All in all I highly highly reccomend this game. It had a suprisingly long length to it taking around 10 hours for me to complete. I HOPE A SEQUEL IS MADE!!!!			"

												Industry jokes, easter eggs, glitchy content, typos galore, sections with artificial difficuty, and a lot of scenes that drift into preachiness, sometimes literally, Almost Sometimes Monsters is, well, an indie game. Leaning on retro graphics from the SNES era, ASM relies primarily on its story to get you hooked, opening with a choice that'll either end the game as soon as it began, or drop you into a tutorial-free experience (as, the creators tell you in game, Life has no tutorials) to choose your protagonist from an array of partygoers and then pick their significant other, suffer an off-camera (for the moment) break-up, and set you on a quest to break up a wedding and try to win them back. ASM touts the power of choice in the game, with some conversations literally meaning life or death, while others are borderline-transparent attempts at character development. The freedom to be LGBT is definitely one of its selling points, normalizing LGBT relationships by showing they're just as fraught with difficulty, though racism plays an element as well, as picking a Latino or African-American character will definitely get you a different gaming experience than a white male. All of the phobic comments are casually made, with the player given no option to refute or call people out on them, likely to simulate the day-to-day casual comments that are made that minorites are forced to suffer through to make their way in society. But for myself, the career scenes hit pretty close to home. While I'm not qualified to speak on the experience anything other than a white male playing this game, I can definitely attest that the concerns and insecurities of being a writer, and how they affect relationships will cause some players to feel as if they're watching a scene from their lives play out on the small screen.   Reading the text of my in-game boyfriend dumping me because he was tired of seeing our relationship written on the page, well, a LOT of writers, particularly creative non-fiction writers, know all too well the inspiration and danger of mining their relationships for material. It was these scenes that carried me through the tougher sections, and by tougher, I mean artificially tougher. Some missions will be enormously aggravating and send players running to the forums to shatter immersion because they can't figure out the most convoluted vent system in North America, or because they find themselves losing precious days to a wedged in fighting game that will find some players shouting at their screens, ""CAN'T I JUST *BUY* THE STUPID TIRES!?!"" Sections in the 4th act will require save-scumming to make any reasonable progress, and the angstier scenes that bookend the story will sometimes find your cursor lingering over ""Shoot"" longer than it probably should. So, it's not a masterpiece, not quite a diamond in the rough, more a cubic zirconia in the gravel, but there are still scenes that will drive you to the next, questions to the story that will make you want to find the answers, and conflict jarring just enough to make you ignore the cheesiness. Going back through to try different choices is always an option for replayability, but personally, I found it a one-and-done. Still, as Marla Singer said, ""It's cheaper than a movie and there's free coffee.""			"

												10.5/11 (If you need that extra push...)Always Sometimes Monsters is a game about life and the harshness and crewlness of the world. You must make choices and take risks to survive, but at the cost of the ultimate outcome that is soon to be. Make friends, make enemies, make lovers, make success, make death, but attitudes effect actions.The game itself has it's ups and downs at times, such like plopping you right into the game, no tutorials. I can see why the game developers did this, but hell it was confusing. This could also draw into one of the game's neumorous metaphors they crammed in to explain life lessons that we all face in life. The soundtrack is great as well as the artwork and the storyline, being one for a good romance story, is one that can be changed through the actions you make. Pros Great storyGreat soundtrackFunny easter eggsGreat artworkMetaphorsHumbleBundle makes it 1$ Cons Confusing controlsMetaphorsNot worth 10$If you believe these are redeming features then no cons!

												Admittedly I do not normally play games like this, but I was intrigued by the premis and it was cheap so I decided to give it a try.   I've only done one complete playthrough and may play through again to see another ending and outcome determined by the choices I make.  Especially knowing the impact of certain decisions I was able to ascertain where exactly the story was headed early on, but it did not disuade me from continuing to play it out in hopes from some surprises along the way.  Not to say that the writing was contrite or anything but given the medium and the probable limitations on time and the software as well as budget to fleshout the story any further and making it any more intricate just doesn't seem feasable although I would like to see something similar with some of the same mechanics but on a much broader and potentially open ended scale someday.  Given that it is still a lot better than the usual fair that we find in games these days and the narritive does give you a bit of pause as to what really you your self would evne do when placed in a similar position as the protaganist.Always Sometimes monsters is a peculiar break from the typical fair and it's presentation is decent despite some of the tedium that I would like to see altered, primarily the balance involving food/stamina (do I really need to eat 100 sandwiches  at $6 each to gain full stamina? - slight exaggeration ) and I'm sure many others have gone over some of the other tedium in the game that makes it less fun like the well mentioned warehouse scene with the boxes, and other things that just seem like a grind or busy work to artificially extend the length of the game.  It adds no value to the story or otherwise.Regardless it is worth at least one play through I would say, and is a nice take on things with decent potential if you are looking for a decent story game and the journey to go along with it.

 DISCLAIMER: This is a full review, and NOT a first impressions review like all my other reviews, if you want a better full review, then please read better reviews then mine Always Sometimes Monsters is a game developed by Vagabond Dog and published by one of my favourite publishers Devolver Digital using RPGMaker engine, the same game engine as To the Moon and Bird Story were developed with, however, as opposed to the heartwarming story that both To the Moon and Bird Story offer, Always Sometimes Monsters offers very realistic situations including sex and relationships, violence and drugsThe story is okay, nothing special. The characters you create and the game offers not only a man and woman relationship, but also a man and man relationship and a woman and woman relationship which includes a huge number of diversity in relationships and the choices you mkae can greatly affect the story, what I chose could be completely different than to what I saw on a YouTube video onlineThe game as a whole is like an interactive story, there isn't really much to do, The game is dialogue heavy and a few actions can change the course of the game completely. I liked this a lot, however, the game can get boring just seeing the same stuff with the heavy amounts of dialogueAlways Sometimes Monsters is a very mature themed game and includes a lot of mature content which some people may find disturbing or offensive, but for people like me who are not easily offended or disturbed, this game is a good mature themed gameThis game is not for everyone, the heavy amounts of dialogue and samey missions and stuff as well as the long length for a RPGMaker game can be boring for some people, however, Always Sometimes Monsters is not like any other dialogue heavy game I've played and deals with mature content fairly and maturely, as well as offers huge options and consequences for players to decide  RECOMMENDED :)  "

												Love-hate relationship with this game. There are so many ways to play. Even after several playthroughs there are unexplored paths left; just when I think I've seen every option, something new happens. You can play plenty of times without getting bored and the player's adventure always gets me thinking- the main character has a pretty common backstory: they're a struggling artist. That could've just been it, and in real life that's pretty much as far as it goes, but instead they end up on an adventure. It feels realistic in the sense that anybody playing COULD do something like that, but they won't, but as they play they can't help but wonder ""What if I did, though?""The gameplay itself is great; equal parts lighthearted and serious, compelling, many ways to play, and overall good enough to overlook what I'm about to say, but I'm still saying it: The story doesn't make sense. The devs put so much time into character development early on and then just throw it away for the sake of moving things along towards the end. The characters do things that go totally against their development for the sake of setting up a twist ending. The thing about twist endings is that it's supposed to be shocking at first, but then the player thinks about it and has a eureka moment where they realize all of the subtle little hints and nagging things throughout the game that now make sense. It's supposed to ultimately make sense once it sinks in, and this one doesn't.Despite that, it's an enjoyable game and I'm happy to own it.			"

												Always Sometimes Monsters is the sort of retro-styled game I can get behind, mostly because the gameplay and narrative is pretty ingenious.  This isn't a story about saving the world, rescuing a princess, or beating a giant baddy.  it's a game about trying to win someone back, about lost love and time.  It's never quite as cleverly written as it could be, but it's engaging in a way very few other game narratives are simply by the nature of the day-to-day choices I was given.  Should I spend my time mowing the yard or playing video games?  Should I steal from an old woman or help her out?  Both? Also fascinating too are the frequent hints of some overarching plot lines that are delightfully ambiguos in nature.  This is a world where big plots are happening around the fringes of this little love story, and I cannot stress enough how cool of a notion that is.  Instead of focusing on the mysteries of the aurora borealis problems, the nefarious organizations and politics surrounding a quiet little city, or the like, these are given just enough little winking moments to get me intrigued into the world without actually pulling me into a trite ""save the world"" story.  It's kind of brilliant.My only real problem with the game stems from a sometimes annoying fatigue system.  You have to eat food on occasion to survive, but often times, just walking from a restaurant to your bed will fatigue you enough that you can't sleep.  The meter drains just a little too fast, and I can't help but think that it should be eliminated entirely in favor of a ""eat twice per day"" simpler system.  At the very least, it needs tinkering.That very minor quibble aside, I think the game's fantastic.  I'm not usually one for retro-styling, but the graphics are a complete non-issue and the 16-bit-esque music is pretty fantastic.  I love that theme song.  It's a terrific little gem, and I cannot recommend it enough to anyone looking for a clever slice-of-life type game with big aspirations.			"

												While not for everyone, if you're into games that are less about escaping into a fantasy world and more about the hellish real world...then you'll definitely enjoy this game. It did get a little too dramatic for my tastes (especially near the end and a few points during the election that happens mid-game), but it's just an overall really unique experience (and I personally LOVE the soundtrack).Also, the character selection is really clever and subtle, as well as the selection as to who your romantic partner is/was. There are a ton of choices of characters of different sexes and races, and you candecide what sexuality your character is. I played as a lesbian and there were some rude comments directed at me from other characters, which sort of made the experience feel a little more personal and real.Overall, this game is just a joy...well, I suppose ""depressing"" is a better word to use...but it's a good experience and is now among my favorite games.

												10/10 - Would steal the bride and get punched in the face againNow, being a bit more serious, Always Sometimes Monsters is a decent game. It's not perfect, true, as some parts of the game feel slow and not so interesting, and despite telling you to make choices, sometimes they are worth nothing - independently of what you choose, the game will just tell you ""oh, sorry, it has to be this way because of reasons"".However, that's not enough to make this game bad, in fact, it's quite the opposite. Despite its flaws, it is still enjoyable, so, if you're feeling like you want to try something different, give it a try.Just one last thing: This game will punish you if you decide to rush through it.My final rating: 8/10 "

												Early on in the game I save-scummed for money by getting all winning $50 scratch cards and winning constantly at rock-paper-scissors. ""Haha!"" I told the game, ""I am beating your system and successfully keeping my character from ever doing anything monsterous or ending up in too bad a position!""Then I realized that it was me all along. The person always sometimes being a monster was me as the player gaming the system to give my character a good pool of money she wasn't supposed to have to dip into. So I went ""Well then, let me be evil!"" and outright used Cheat Engine to give myself thousands of dollars, because if I was going to feel like the game was judging me for my actions I might as well go all out!I'm recommending the game because it has a well-written story that kept me interested until the end, but let you warn you going in that it can be a slog. The game is full of unpleasant characters and situations that always try to go worse for your character. Even if you try to keep your hands as clean as you possibly be can a good hunk of the game characters will still treat you like dirt (although, to be fair, that is realistic for folks who are trying to turn their lives around after hitting rock bottom). And if you try to keep your funds up the honest way you'll quickly find that the minigames you do for work are dull as ditchwater, in a deliberate commentary on how mindnumbing minimum-wage jobs can be by the developer. Don't play this unless you don't mind a story that treats you like that! But for me personally I found it a fun challenge to try to hunt down (in most cases just having money isn't the answer, my cheatiness mostly just kept me from having to do unpleasant things for food) the ""good"" choices through any given scenario when they weren't spelled out for you, and I imagine that other people would have an equally fun time seeing just how monstrous they could become!

												Whether or not I can truly reccomend this game is a tough call to make. While I have a lot of fun with this game, partly due to playing with a friend and making fun of it, and also because the game itself is fun enough on its own as well as the choices you make gives an experience different enough to add some replayability.In short: the game has many interesting concepts (such as having a pessimistic view of the world, interesting choices that branch off into fairly surprising events) and carries a lot of potential, it does not live up to all it promises to be, sporting a predictable story (with some redeeming factors), sub-par writing and boring mini-games.Of course this game has quite a lot of problems. First off I should mention that the mini-games or side activities, whether they be arcade mini-games or jobs your character does, are incredibly boring. I understand jobs being boring is related to how part-time jobs in real life are boring, but in a game that level of tedium should not extend for too long, which this game does. Also mini-games should be better designed.Another issue this game suffers from is, with most games that follow the concept of having a diverse storyline that changes depending on your choices, is the illusion of choice. You have all these choices with all these different outcomes introducing you to all these different characters. But the characters are boring, stale and two-dimensional, and in the grand scheme of things it does not matter as the events are overall the same with minor alterations, and though the changes are significant enough to add some replayability, when I replay I find myself skipping most of the dialogue due how little is changed, despite choosing a different main character and love interest.This game is not all bad though, the game itself is not boring as I can play it for hours without falling asleep, and some of its concepts are fairly interesting. One thing that should be noted about this game is that almost everyone in this world are not pleasant people, and you as the protagonist will have to choose things that bring your morality into question and being on the side of angels does not guarantee the best ending, something I can respect as that was always an issue with most choice-based games. However the story itself is fairly bland and its themes are very not subtly thrown at your face. Often the script presents itself as some philosophical, thought-provoking or ""deep"", but instead it sounds more like it is just running around in circles spewing out words that feel as shallow as the characters saying them. It tries to be clever, but all it does is repeat messages found in a B-rated hollywood film. While these messages are not inherently bad, some are true enough in our modern society that it should be addressed, the delivery could be better. "

												Admittedly I do not normally play games like this, but I was intrigued by the premis and it was cheap so I decided to give it a try.   I've only done one complete playthrough and may play through again to see another ending and outcome determined by the choices I make.  Especially knowing the impact of certain decisions I was able to ascertain where exactly the story was headed early on, but it did not disuade me from continuing to play it out in hopes from some surprises along the way.  Not to say that the writing was contrite or anything but given the medium and the probable limitations on time and the software as well as budget to fleshout the story any further and making it any more intricate just doesn't seem feasable although I would like to see something similar with some of the same mechanics but on a much broader and potentially open ended scale someday.  Given that it is still a lot better than the usual fair that we find in games these days and the narritive does give you a bit of pause as to what really you your self would evne do when placed in a similar position as the protaganist.Always Sometimes monsters is a peculiar break from the typical fair and it's presentation is decent despite some of the tedium that I would like to see altered, primarily the balance involving food/stamina (do I really need to eat 100 sandwiches  at $6 each to gain full stamina? - slight exaggeration ) and I'm sure many others have gone over some of the other tedium in the game that makes it less fun like the well mentioned warehouse scene with the boxes, and other things that just seem like a grind or busy work to artificially extend the length of the game.  It adds no value to the story or otherwise.Regardless it is worth at least one play through I would say, and is a nice take on things with decent potential if you are looking for a decent story game and the journey to go along with it.

												*No Spoilers*Always Sometimes Monsters is a very emotional, deep hearted story driven game that is in my opinion, very, very beutiful. Once you start the game, you will find yourself pulled back to it untill you finish your first play through. And once you finish that go around you will more likely than not be compelled to play through it one more time to really get the ending that you want to see. The choices that this game puts on you are often very shocking, and will likley leave you deeply pondering what you think is the best decision. And i gaurantee that by the end there will be more than one decision that you find your self regretting. But to keep this review short for times sake, I whole heartedly recomend this game to anyone who cares at all about a game with an amazing story. As well as a character that you will probably consider a part of yourself more than just a character in a game. Its an amazing experience, but dont take my word for it. The only way to understand this very unique game is to just dive into it yourself. I promise you wont be dissapointed.  "

												I'm going to try a new thing and not hit the recommend or don't recommend buttons until I'm done writing this because this is, at least to me, a complicated game to process. So I'll just talk through my impressions and decide at the end.I've played it out of my obsession to play games that are ""different"" and can can say at least this much: It's ambitious.The game aims to tell a story about low-income living, poverty and other current social issues contained within the main character's journey to find some closure with his or her ex. The game runs much like a dating sim with it having essentially several turns over a number of days that you have available. You usually need to grind enough money to move to the next stop along your journey and occasionally use your turns to get involved with some plot points, such as swinging an election, breaking a strike, helping either a megacorporation to demolish the projects to build a cinema complex, or the residents in exposing the company's nefarious plot to...uh...make money, I guess.Where the game excels is in portraying some of the chilling aspects of poverty and low-income jobs. It will not be uncommon, at least during your first few days, to be forced to sleep on a trash matress on account of having been evicted from your apartment, and the jobs you take to make money are just soul-crushingly boring and repetitive mini games. Just like in real life.The biggest failure of the game, however, is sadly its biggest ambition. It fails to be anything but transparent and heavy handed in its delivery. I love seeing games having a mature attitude towards sexuality, gender and social status, but when the game just stops dead in its tracks to essentially look at the screen and say ""PREJUDICE IS BAD"", some of the impact is lost. It also has a bit of an agenda when giving you two day jobs in each location one clearly meant to be ""good""and one clearly meant to be ""evil"". The meat processing factory pays decently and you have to slaughter them piggies for a shorter span of time than you have to spend at the tofu factory doing the same thing but hey, if you power through it, the reward will be far greater. In cash. Nice job being subtle, game.The story and dialogue are fine, thematically, and the way you tailor the story by playing is satisfying, but the actual writing leaves a bit to be desired. The game lacks a proper full screen mode and the menus can be a ♥♥♥♥♥ to navigate, especially with little to no tutorial telling you which the three or four keys you'll be using are. Sound and music are minimalistic, ok, but nothing to write home about.At the end of the day, however, I did play it through to the end. It's interesting if nothing more, and I am going to give it a reluctant thumbs up, with the mention that you should wait for it to go on sale.			"

												I really do like this game, but even the best end leaves you a bitter taste in your mouth, but I have to say that that is not necessarily a bad thing. Not all stories had to go along with the Happy Ever After.I played a lot with different characters and approaching, and that one of the things I like the most. There are not a lot of video games where you can play as a LGBT+ character, and here you can. You can choose your character, your partner, and the way the story goes. In the graphics and gameplay part it is true that fails a little, but that is not the part that caught me the most in a video game. I am thrilled by an argument and the story, and when I can choose how can it can change, even if it's mean that everything it is going to go terribly bad, I cannot ask for anything more.If a have to give you some advice, I would say to you that you should at least try it out. It is not expensive, especially in sales, and we don't give an opportunity to little indie companies, what are our alternatives? Bugisoft? EAvil?			"

												An amazing mix between a great storytelling Visual Novel and a classic RPG. A true rollercoaster of emotions.If you're inclined to play a mature game with mature decision-making, I highly recommend Always Sometimes Monsters. The game smartly tests how effectively your choices were: it contains some ""dead ends"" if they were too bad and the outcome of your choices will influence deeply the final act. It has a very deep and moving plotline for self-reflection and melancholy. A true masterpiece.---""We both needed her love, but in the end she didn't choose me.Perhaps because in wanting her so bad, I had become something less than human.(...)Without that love in my life, what happiness is there for me?There is no other for me, there never would or could be.(...)I came out here to die.(...)So here I'm, at your mercy.I'm ready to be judged, the choice is all yours!(...)Do I deserve the death I long for? Or are we always sometimes monsters?""			"

												No game has made me feel sadder, meaner or more depressed than this one right here... But it has also at the same time made me feel like a decent human being.Music contributes well to atmosphereMany choices to make that will change the outcome of the gameYou will feel horrible.10/10Play it and cry.

												This can be a very good game, depending on how you play it, as it is a very choice based game, and it's not just the ending that is affected by your choices, your gameplay is as well. This game has very varying gameplay, very great character choices, but it can be quite confronting.Sometimes when you play the game you will be faced with a difficult choice, and what you choose will not only affect the storyline of the game, but also the gameplay. So for example, if you choose to work in a tofu factory instead of a meat factory for temp work. If you work in the meat factory you will get more money, which will help massively in the rest of the game, but the gameplay will be a lot more boring, as you cannot leave until work is finished. But in the tofu factory you can leave anytime you want, so if you get bored of the gameplay, you can leave, but you get less money overall, which may affect your game. Also making a choice may also affect your morality. If you make a 'good' decision, as opposed to an 'evil' decision, things will turn out very differently. If you deicde to do something, it might mean you cannot do another thing. You might end up missing out on oppitunities and experiences. So experiences require you to do boring tasks, while other require you to do exciting and interesting things. It's really up to you.The character choices are quite good. You are allowed to play as a homosexual couple, an interracial couple or a heterosexual couple. Obviously you will experience different things depending on what you pick. The game will even let you be transgender! This is very important if you want to have your character as close to yourself as possible, or if you want to try and understand the situtation that others are in. It will not make you completely understand the complexity of another person's mind and experiences, but it will at least give you a chance to empathise. Having a character that it like yourself will (in my case at least) make you feel closer to the character and become more involved in the story. Despite all this great stuff, the game is quite confronting in many places. This can be seen as a good or a bad thing. It can be seen as a good thing to make an impact and to get you more emotional about the story/game, but it can also make you feel very uncomfortable to play. If it does make you feel uncomfortable, it is just a game, that you can turn off, and leave for as long as you want, before you can continue playing again (if you wanted to continue playing). The game has some slurrs mixed in to the dialogue, and some harsh statements as well, they don't come up extremely often, but often enough to make a bit of an impact. I have probably not experienced all the harsh statments myself, as I have not done that many playthroughs, but be warned that if you pick a gay couple, a woman, or a person of colour, you might run into some slurrs and/or harsh words, so to avoid confrontation I guess you could play as a straight, white couple and a man, but don't feel obliged to. Outside of the character choices, you will still hear some words, but not as often.This is a pretty good game, not just in the basics of the characters, the dialogue and the choices, but it is quite beautiful, even with the style. It also has some pretty good music. The storyline is the classic 'must get my lover back', but you can also choose to just ignore them and focus on yourself. The only big problem with it is how tedious it is to start a new game, as you need to click through a lot of text boxes at the start, but it can also be quite fun to replay, as there are so many ways to play the game.

												I'd like to recommend the game, but the concept is far too poorly executed.  The story just isn't enough fun to go through.  The devs' conversation in the coffee shop reads to me like nothing so much as the gaming equivalent of a line in a bad detective novel like ""Jake shook his head, it was like something out of a bad detective novel"".  ""Are you sure we made the right decision not to put in a tutorial?""  Yeah, that's a huge sign that you should have had one.Maybe if I cared more about the main character's predicament.  But the game seems determined to present them as someone who's entirely screwed themselves over with no extenuating circumstances to make me feel sympathy for them and to stick with them through the dull ""gameplay"" segments.  I can't care about them, I can't care about their friends, and I can't imagine replaying this game to see all the alternate paths.  For a story game this is a critical flaw.Watch someone's Let's Play instead.			"

												Its so boring!Either the writers hate normal people or theyre ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s, cause everyone, including you, is an ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. The humour isnt clever or witty, its dry and dull. It almost feels like theyre being ironic, especially when the first thing you come across is their ingame dev office where you call them indie hipsters. But thats seems to be what they are, the cinematic attempts in this game are pitiful. Its kinda like a VN meets Sims Bustin' Out, except it looks like they did ♥♥♥♥ all research into VNs, at the start the fact theres choices is shoved in your face and theres no speech marks around speech. On the other aspect it just falls flat, its more like one of those city exploring flash game than a... good one.Its seems they focused VN choices and just went ""oh we're an indie company thats come up with the main idea, ♥♥♥♥ the rest.""I'm really suprised Devovler picked this up.Idled for cards/10Oh and theres no ♥♥♥♥ing settings.

												This is a weird one for sure. I think it's almost completely made in RPGMaker and it shows, but at the same time it's published by Devolver so it has kind of a big pedigree. And I've heard a lot of people talking about it over the past few years so I was kind of looking forward to it. I'm...not exactly sure how I feel about it. It certainly tries something different, and I have a good deal of appreciation for that sort of ingenuity that comes along with working against extreme constraints. But at the same time I'm not entirely sure I want to play a game about living through extremely stressful times when I could just stop playing the game and do that for real.The writing is the star here, and it actually is pretty nice for a game so far, but the limitations of RPG Maker and their attempts to push them kind of make the game not as fun to play as it could have been if they'd had a little bit of a budget to work with. That said, I'm glad to see that the concept of player morality is still something that developers are trying to pin down. In too many cases, it still boils down to a choice between kicking orphans into crocodile pits or donating your still beating heart to Africa because it's the only cure for AIDS or some♥♥♥♥♥♥ But we seem to be edging slightly closer to having actual meaningful moral decisions in games, and maybe basing an entire game around them like in ASM is a step in the right direction. Shoot for more ambiguity, devs (in general), because that's what makes a moral decision an interesting one.I may or may not continue playing, but I'm leaning toward the latter because it didn't really snare me right off the bat. I do think these guys show some promise as devs though, and hopefully they can get some more money behind them in the future.			"

												Let's start by saying this - this game is not an actions rpg, where you fight monsters, gain exp etc. This is game about choices. About... life, really. It's pretty intriguing title, that I've stumbled across by complete accident. This game is definitely different. Special. At the begging, we're choosing are character and his/her love interest - happy times, but the true story begins, when our protagonist are alone in shi*ty apartment, have problems with money and... finds out that his/her ex is going to marry someone. Yeah, that's not good. Since protagonist still love his/her ex, he/she decide to be there on they're wedding day and this decision is a beginning to many different choices.Is this game boring? Yeah, to be honest, it can be. Works are boring (well, true life I guess). Some parts of the story are too. And for a story with a lot of choices... There aren't that many of those. What's even worse is that the choices seems to be lacking in the moments and situations where they would fit very well and actually be pretty important.Pros:+ length (especially if you would like to explore everything, do additional quests, find all collectibles etc.)+ graphic - most of characters have their own portraits and they're look good+ individual treatment - if you choose someone of the same gender as your lover, you will receive few comments about this here and there. Same goes for your race and gender+ plot can be surprising+ this game is unique, really one of it's kind.Cons:- you don't have option to truly shape your character's personality, which would be so much more interesting - ... this may cause issues with relating to your character - honestly, I couldn't relate to mine at all- parts of main story and some other quests can get pretty boring- there's something missing... maybe stats? More impactful choices? I'm not really sure, but when I was playing, I couldn't get rid of feeling, that this game could be so much more interesting and challenging at the same time- not enough choices. Especially in important or even crucial events- some choices are just to trivial.			"

												Describing this as a game is difficult, so I'll use the developer's own description: ""a story-driven experience"". The graphics and gameplay, both neither good nor bad, are not the focus of the game. If ASM has your attention it's because you're looking for a story to be told, a story you can shape with the decisions you make (and the ones you don't), a story where the world is built upon the path you select. And ASM gives you precisely that. And much more.Put in simple terms, ASM is a love story gone to hell. Your story starts at the pit of broken dreams, and everything is piling up to get much worse. As you start a journey to seek what could possibly be the last bit of hope left in your life, you'll be faced to make choices that will define who you are, who you were and more importantly, who will you become. It gives you the building pieces of your past and asks you ""How did it all go wrong?"", and then it makes a wonderful job at creating a story out of what you've done.I'm not going to say ASM is something I'd recommend to anyone. Story-driven game with an unremarkable gameplay paired with the laundry list of trigger warnings the story has, it's likely most people will simply ignore this and move to something else. But for those that are still willing to try ASM, I can recommend this game for you. It is an enjoyable experience you will not want to miss.			"

												I will admit to having never written a review before but this game was so good that I simply couldn't not.Always Sometimes Monsters delivers what it promises. It gives an experience where, based on race, gender and sexuality, your experiences change. However, this isn't all it provides. The story itself is gripping and amazing, with lots of different paths and lots of different consequences for your actions. I will admit that the story is somewhat stream-lined in that it's city to city to city, with fixed cities, however there is still plenty of room for diverging paths. On top of this, it provides an experience where you're often wondering whether or not you will be able to get through it; not because the game's that hard, but because the story twists in so many ways. On top of this, it also has some interesting moments when characters delve into philosophy.There are some cons however, the first being the potential for grinding. I'll give you an example. I was in a factory, loading boxes, told I could keep going until I was finished. The counter is 2 digited, so I assumed it wouldn't be too many. I loaded 101 boxes before giving up, with no indication that there was an end or not. As well as that, the jobs can be a bit boring/monotonous, but I suppose that's part of the game so I can't judge it for that. Also, I whilst I found Easter Eggs winking at the fourth wall clever, the heavy-handedness of this at the end was not to my taste.All in all, a fantastic game, indicated by the fact I'm going in for my second run now.

												I love this game. First of all, I'm a big fan of those RPG-Maker like games and this is just one hell of a good game. It makes me want to play the game over and over again to gain new paths, new endings, new reactions and the 'What if?' is always a luring voice in your head that makes you keep playing and once you finished it, you just want to do it again to see what will happen if you do it the other way. Always Sometimes Monsters is funny, real and yet surreal on the same time. Either you can be the hero or the anti-hero. Decide for your friends, your benefits or do whatever you want and send all of them to doom with choosing a way that would break friendships, relationships and futures. Nowadays most people always take the save way, this game shows what could go wrong or what you could gain if you choose the extreme or you do it the way our society does and keep things low. I really recomment this game. It's a fun, intense experience and for people who like to choose for themself it's a big hit. The mini-games are awesome, you have many things to do for a living, explore and meet interesting characters you just have to love, to hate or...well...sometimes you can't even judge a book at the cover. You have to think or let your heart decide before you choose and that is something most games can't: Make you think about the choices you did. The 'What if', regrets, fun in choosing.. 10/10 from me for sure. Great game. I hope the developers will bring games like this to us more often. I would buy them for sure. Great job!			"

												Always Sometimes Monsters is a heavily narrative focused adventure game that visually appears much like a classic Final Fantasy title but plays more like a point and click adventure. You take the role of an aspiring writer whose career and relationship collapse and you travel across the country to win him/her back.During your journey you will constantly be making extremely difficult decisions in very grey areas. The entire experience of shaping this character's journey is unbelievable and unlike most “chose the red option for bad and blue option for good” narratives, Always Sometimes Monsters makes you dig into your own conscious, having to make tough calls when facing a challenging (but not outrageous) time constraint.All the way through the adventure, you must balance moral choices, making enough money to get by, patching together your last hope of a writing contract, and making sure you don’t starve in the streets. The developers should be incredibly proud of the story they've crafted through Always Sometimes Monsters.			"

												This is one of those rare games that hits you right in the heart and haunts you well after you finish it. For people who say a game can't be art because it can't emotionally effect you' I submit Always Sometimes Monsters as a game that qualifies as art. There are few games that cause you to question the decisions you make when playing and to even question your own humanity like Always Sometimes Monsters. Be warned every decision will have a consequence and sometimes it feels like you just can't make the right call. This is the beauty of Always Sometimes Monsters. In a market flooded by games where you heroically save the day and are always the good guy this game stands out. Most of the limitations of this game aren't necessarily its own faults; but more the limitations of RPG Maker. Ignore the reviews saying the ending seemed forced and the plot silly or forced. I suspect that they truly wanted a completely good ending that made all the characters happy. Not every game needs to  It truly is a wonderful game but I warn you it is not a happy ride yet you would be remiss not to play it.			"

												I never finished a game made with RPG Maker before this. Always Sometimes Monsters delivers a interesting tale with many choices the player has to make, and a huge number of secrets to find.The game puts players in the role of an author who receives notice that the love of their life is marrying someone else across the country within a month. After being evicted from their apartment on the east coast, players then head to the west coast in order to intercept the wedding and win back the love they lost.The soundtrack is also worth mentioning, since it keep my interest throughout the whole series.

												Sometimes Always Monsters is a nice break away from the abundant carbon copy rpgs.  The pixel art is nice and fits the game well. The branching story line in Sometimes Always Monsters is one of the most appealing aspects to this game as well as on of the most infuriating. I love games that make me question my own morality.			"

												This is a weird one for sure. I think it's almost completely made in RPGMaker and it shows, but at the same time it's published by Devolver so it has kind of a big pedigree. And I've heard a lot of people talking about it over the past few years so I was kind of looking forward to it. I'm...not exactly sure how I feel about it. It certainly tries something different, and I have a good deal of appreciation for that sort of ingenuity that comes along with working against extreme constraints. But at the same time I'm not entirely sure I want to play a game about living through extremely stressful times when I could just stop playing the game and do that for real.The writing is the star here, and it actually is pretty nice for a game so far, but the limitations of RPG Maker and their attempts to push them kind of make the game not as fun to play as it could have been if they'd had a little bit of a budget to work with. That said, I'm glad to see that the concept of player morality is still something that developers are trying to pin down. In too many cases, it still boils down to a choice between kicking orphans into crocodile pits or donating your still beating heart to Africa because it's the only cure for AIDS or some♥♥♥♥♥♥ But we seem to be edging slightly closer to having actual meaningful moral decisions in games, and maybe basing an entire game around them like in ASM is a step in the right direction. Shoot for more ambiguity, devs (in general), because that's what makes a moral decision an interesting one.I may or may not continue playing, but I'm leaning toward the latter because it didn't really snare me right off the bat. I do think these guys show some promise as devs though, and hopefully they can get some more money behind them in the future.			"

												Let's start by saying this - this game is not an actions rpg, where you fight monsters, gain exp etc. This is game about choices. About... life, really. It's pretty intriguing title, that I've stumbled across by complete accident. This game is definitely different. Special. At the begging, we're choosing are character and his/her love interest - happy times, but the true story begins, when our protagonist are alone in shi*ty apartment, have problems with money and... finds out that his/her ex is going to marry someone. Yeah, that's not good. Since protagonist still love his/her ex, he/she decide to be there on they're wedding day and this decision is a beginning to many different choices.Is this game boring? Yeah, to be honest, it can be. Works are boring (well, true life I guess). Some parts of the story are too. And for a story with a lot of choices... There aren't that many of those. What's even worse is that the choices seems to be lacking in the moments and situations where they would fit very well and actually be pretty important.Pros:+ length (especially if you would like to explore everything, do additional quests, find all collectibles etc.)+ graphic - most of characters have their own portraits and they're look good+ individual treatment - if you choose someone of the same gender as your lover, you will receive few comments about this here and there. Same goes for your race and gender+ plot can be surprising+ this game is unique, really one of it's kind.Cons:- you don't have option to truly shape your character's personality, which would be so much more interesting - ... this may cause issues with relating to your character - honestly, I couldn't relate to mine at all- parts of main story and some other quests can get pretty boring- there's something missing... maybe stats? More impactful choices? I'm not really sure, but when I was playing, I couldn't get rid of feeling, that this game could be so much more interesting and challenging at the same time- not enough choices. Especially in important or even crucial events- some choices are just to trivial.			"

 10/10 Must play for all! This game is honestly all about human interaction. It so perfectly captures what it is like to be a human all in one short, what took me, 13 hour video game. The various choices with which the player is faced are identical to the choices a person will be faced with throughout their life. Towards the end the player is made to think about the various decisions they've made and this forces the player to think, ""if that were really me, how would I feel about my choice."" This is also a great game for someone with identity issues because certain questions/choices in the game make you think about your own life and your own beliefs. Overall, this game is great for anyone; and everyone should play it! Major props to the people at Vagabond Dog for almost making me cry at that ending!P.S I should add that for anyone looking for major exciting gimicks this might be a tough game for you to enjoy. But for the person who wants to actually take something out of any game they play than definitely play it. Either way it doens't hurt to give the game a try! "

												I was in the mood for something different and bought this game as a result. Though, I have to admit that I appreciated the experience more the second time around than the first, my overall opinion now is quite favorable. Because once you really understand how the game works, it can change your perspective on it's choice based narrative, affecting the way that you play, and altering the experience accordingly. Seeing some of the results of those different choices play out is the main draw with this one. Your ability to make choices, a lot of which you can't tell whether they're important or not,  alter the story in significant ways. It has old school 16-bit era console gaming graphics (RPGMaker), and muisc, and the gameplay itself is rather simplisitc, but I found it worthwhile for the journey itself, because with this one getting there is what makes it worthwhile.

Not that this needed one.My only gripe was the slight grinding to get money aspect closer to the beginning of the game.

												For those who are looking for a shortish (~8 h) story-driven game that features a dynamic plot, Always Sometimes Monsters will be a satisfying experience.  There are dozens of permutations based on character choices that will affect not only the ending but also the plotline, which gives repeat playthroughs a purpose.  It also has a diverse cast that includes a variety of genders and sexualities.There are a few factors that detract from the experience, however.  The game's RPGMaker appearance may bother some, though it features original sprites throughout.  The mechanics of the minigames are tedious at best and frustrating at worst.  As opposed to Cart Life, which has rote tasks that are easily and quickly done but performed ad naseum, ASM's work simulations eat up a lot of time for little payoff.  (That might be the point, but it is difficult to wade through, regardless.)  Perhaps my biggest complaint is that the content per city is uneven.  The first city has a plethora of storylines and activities, but the following cities are minimal in comparison, usually featuring the main plot and a couple of side quests.Ultimately, the value of the game will depend on the player's ability to invest in the protagonist and the central conceit.  If you can get past the grinding for cash and the clunky minigames, there's a worthwhile story being told here...with a generous dash of fourth-wall-breaking meta-awareness, which might either be another selling point or cloying element to ignore.

												I played through ASM twice, trying different things in the process, and I really enjoyed how your story could change depending on your choices. It was actually quite a bit longer than I expected it to be, which is always a nice surprise with indie games. The music is also pretty nice, which is a MUST with me. If it doesn't have good music, I literally cannot get through it.That being said, this game didn't hold my attention enough to make me want to play the whole game at once. If you like that sort of thing, this game is definitely for you, but I generally enjoy games that I can get really immersed in and want to complete in one session. I normally wouldn't recommend a game that didn't hold my attention, but the story was very good and made for an interesting casual game.			"

Honestly, that makes no sense even if you assume someone could be that pathetic, you had total control over him up until that point, always sometimes monsters creates a situation where someone has to be a victim, but the events leading up to that point often make no sense			"

												Always Sometimes Monsters is definitely worth your time and money if you're into text-based adventures or games with a heavy emphasis on choice.I quickly found this game immersive by the subjects it decided to tackle and the setting it did them in. The writing is truly commendable, with the writers being able to convey a multitude of interesting and relatable personalities and situations that make the game fascinating and enveloping. I consistently found myself wondering what would happen next, and putting a great deal of thought behind my choices throughout the game. This game can easily be replayed multiple times, and is enjoyable and interesting from start to finish.			"

												I was very lost and confused upon playing it the first two times, but I decided not to give up. This game is tied and held together by its rich and powerful story. I was positively surprised by the storyline and by the posibility of things you could do in this. Despite the graphics (which I liked), there was no tutorial and the aim of the story is quite unclear/confusing at the beginning, but it unfolds as you play. I ended up liking the game but could not play it without a walkthrough or a guide. Therefore, I took the liberty of making one.+ Story rich+ Everything you do has some sort of consequence+ Gender-friendly, you can be a guy/girl dating a guy/girl+ Easy Achievements+ Trading Cards (Emotes/Backgrounds)+ Interesting dialogues and values portrayed in the game- No tutorial or clear aim of what you are supposed to do- No Steam User Interface (no F12/Shift-Tab access)Personal Ranking: 4/10 "

												Much like the film industry it often imitates, in the videogame world the definition of an “independent” creation operates on a sliding scale. Outside of the sheer volume of a games production budget, there are also the questions of the development team’s size, their planned distribution, and sometimes even the concept. After all, even Bungie now qualifies as an independent company while piloting multi-million dollar projects.Whatever your requirements for triple-A autonomy may be though, it’d probably be a safe wager that Vagabond Dog and their project Always Sometimes Monsters qualifies in nearly every way, and in this gamer’s opinion, almost all of them are good.The premise of Always Sometimes Monsters, on the very surface, is actually very direct. You are playing a down-and-out artist who just finished losing everything after trying to make it big. With no job, no cash, and very little hope, your character receives a letter in the mail detailing that the last thing he or she cares about is slipping their grasp forever. With nothing to lose, you set off on journey to seize whatever happiness may still await you… or very possibly die in the process. The twist that makes this title extra-special however, come from the challenges that await your hero: everyday life…Now admittedly, there isn’t much a person could think of that would seem like more of a mundane time-sink than a game about trying to make ends meet, performing great sacrifices for little reward, and the in-and-out stresses of paying your bills or doing the right thing. But Always Sometimes Monsters manages to keeps this tale engaging because your hero only has so much time to get any one thing done and achieve their ultimate goal. This creates a lot of pressure both morally and otherwise as you pilot your way past the various difficulties your hero is confronted with and what outcomes await you. Also, while many titles claim to feature it, Always Sometimes Monsters is a narrative adventure truly about choices and how through either action or inaction the course of your characters life will be changed. Choices like how not helping your kind elderly neighbor in order to keep a promise to your friend also means never seeing her again, or how protecting your integrity as a journalist means not making enough money to pay your rent. This isn’t a title simply attempting to mimic life, its mimicking a seedy variant of life that only certain individuals can empathize with but many should be able to imagine, a world where your life’s gone wrong and in the process your vision of “wrong” has become something other than what it used to be. While at times it’s more than a bit dismal, primarily it’s captivating.As far as presentation goes, from the moment the opening logos have faded and the title screen music has begun, everything about Always Sometimes Monsters feels like an 1980’s throwback. The dialog is delivered through a series of slides beside an image of the speaker in question, your 8-bit characters move along gridded trajectories against largely un-interactive objects, and unless you scribble it down yourself there is no journal function or maps to speak of. This is bare-bones gaming by any modern standard and for the very newest generation, maybe even archaic. But in no small measure does this minimalist approach encapsulate Always Sometimes Monsters’ intriguing appeal. This game was purposefully made to be a simple creation with complex guts; dynamic enough that, if you so choose, the entire journey can fully and functionally be over within the first ten minutes with the real-world press of a button and a virtual pull of a trigger. This dynamic element however, is also where Always Sometimes Monsters can sometimes lose it grasp on your imagination.The more options any game or story offers a person, especially tales which are supposed to mimic “real life”, more options and choices a person is going to want. Always Sometimes Monsters, in its simple virtuoso of substance over style, at times paints itself into a corner with that very question of; “ I could do this, why can’t I do that?"" Also, the interactions with objects and NPC’s can feel a bit haphazard at times, proving cumbersome beyond titles implied dogma of “even the simplest tasks can prove a challenge”. As a matter of fact, if you happen to locate them in-game, there are a pair of avatars modeled after the developers who will tell you as much themselves.However, all of this only matters as much as player actually likes the story itself. Sure, Always Sometimes Monsters has to roll the dice on whether or not a player will like it’s narrative as much as any other title that bothers to have one. However, in games which are only about the narrative, lacking any actual “gameplay” to speak of, this becomes a much larger concern. If you can’t get beyond playing a lonely vagabond, who at times needs to sleep on the street to stay alive… sell some drugs to win someone’s trust, or even believe in true love, there won’t be much here to hold you. However, if you love a good story and want a really creative way to take part in telling it, there is little reason not to toss this title in your shopping cart and bring it home. At the very least to give its hero a place to sleep tonight.			"

												So I don't usually write this sort of stuff but I felt like this game deserved an exception. So what I have to say about this game... Always Sometimes Monsters is simply engaging. Whitout giving away to much of it's stoyline, which frankly it is nearly imposible to spoil anything, this was one of the few games I've played lately that made made me actually care for my character and their outcome in the story. Maybe it's because you can be whomever you want and pick any choices you feel like, or maybe because this is a regular story about a regular person. Your character is not a hero, it's not a villian, they are just trying to get on with their lifes trying not too make any wrong choices, which is also kind of difficult because life is like that, at the end, you always have one or two wrong choices. So, as a tl;dr, this game is one lil' neat indie game that explores so many issues, many of them feel wrong, some of them feel right. Just like life itself. I would recommend this to anyone wanting to expercience a different kind of story.			"

												Always Sometimes Monsters is a RPG where you play as a guy or gal that you choose at the beginning of the game who is trying to stop his or her true love marrying someone else.This game is pretty damn good. At the beginning of the game you can choose which character to play as and who is your love interest. Every combination you make leads to a different outcome in some parts of the game: there is racism against interracial or homosexual couples,people interact differently, etc. The bad aspect is that these changes from playthrough to playthrough aren't as big as one might expect. Nonetheless, there are many choices throught the game that can lead to different paths.The gameplay is similar to real life: you can do some small jobs to gain money, you have to eat regularly, you can pawn objects, go to the movies, play at the arcade and so on. It is a risky move and I understand why some people don't like it. However, I found it very fresh and interesting.The original score by Laser Destroyer Team is really good and worth buying.Overall, Always Sometimes Monsters is a solid RPG. The different choices and characters to choose from give the game high replayability, also thanks to its humor and soundtrack.SCORE: 85/100			"

												This game was... Wow. Emotionally moving.It was definitely different from the typical video game, where the good guy gets the girl and everything is happy. It was actually really thought-provoking. The dialogue and storyline is definitely a 10/10.The only things I didn't like would probably be some of the ingame actions, and the dialogue-interrupting emoticon bubbles. They aren't terrible, but they are a little bit annoying and slow. Other than that, this is definitely my #1 favourite game at the moment. I'm definitely going to replay it many times, after my mind can recover from the emotional, psychological, and philosophical overload it just experienced from this game.10/10, would strongly recommend this amazing game.

												I was constantly bored or frustratingly wondering what the heck I'm supposed to be doing while playing this game. Despite trying to be a game about choices and stuff like that, there's a lot of hard triggers that you need to activate to advance the story. There's a stamina/hunger mechanic that isn't talked about at all so I have no idea what the importance of that is. Finally, I just found the story to be uninteresting and dull. I didn't play for longer than an hour though, so maybe it gets better, but there's lots of really fun games out there that don't feel like I'm wasting my time waiting for some payoff, and I just don't have the time to devote to this game. I can tell a lot of thought was put into the story in this game, and maybe I would be willing to give it a chance when I feel like I have more free time, but it's just not enough fun/minute to justify playing right now for me.Give it a try if you like thoughtful, interesting story-driven games and don't mind if the visuals aren't super high-quality, and don't mind slow paced or relatively low-thrill games.

												Would I recommend this game? Only if you enjoy emotional massochism and completely absurd awful life choices and consequences. More the consequences than the choicecs cuz even though you have choices, the consequences often are unprecidently awful. Or if you always wanted to commit crimes and simply needed a reason. Use this as catharsis and avoid jailtime!My overall impression of this game? Great premise, iffy execution. There were a lot of awful choices you could make and often you had to choose between a really ridiculous awful choice and something phenomenally ridiculous and awful choice. You're often forced to commit crimes when you otherwise probably wouldn't which is annoying when you're trying to get the player character's life back together. I'm not sure if the creators did this to illustrate how awful life can get or if they just thought of the most ridiculous situations to put the player in. The things people do for love, amirite?Parts of the game were really frustrating. For example, having to pay $10 for one sandwich and needing to eat 10 to fill up your stamina bar and the frequency you need to do that. I ate 5 sandwiches in the afternoon and when I went to bed in the evening it said going to sleep would be risky since I was starving. I figured, ""Eh, people can live for several days without eating and I gorged myself like 3 hours ago, no big whoop."" I died. I DIED CUZ I HADN'T EATEN BEFORE BED AND I HAD EATEN 5 SANDWICHES NOT THAT LONG AGO WUT?! T_T Save early and save often all the time. If you play this game, save like you've never saved before.Another frustrating part was the repetition when attempting to earn money so buy bus tickets that rival airfare from North America to Europe and to buy the equivalent of Thanksgiving feasts for a midnight snack to prevent dying on someone's lousy couch. Getting shafted repeatedly by various characters in game and being blamed was also frustrating. For a vague example, Friend A makes bad choices because you didn't do something that wasn't really your responsibility but you get blamed for the tragic outcome even though it was really someone else's fault in the first place. Again, not sure if this is to illustrate life is really crappy or give you a headache. I think it accomplished both. Another annoying thing is boxing. Fisticuffs. Pugilism. Cuz some people just won't take money for auto parts and prefer punches to smackeroos? Alright, gonna do what I gotta do and hate it. I really got tired of playing about halfway through and just wanted to finish as fast as possible, survive all the BS, and after all that headache, win back the love of my life. It wasn't looking good for me and that made me mad.The dialog is at times really awful. I can't say I enjoyed having my character called a ""panty waste f*gg*t""or a ""♥♥♥♥♥♥quot; by an employer. I also didn't enjoy some turf warriors saying they needed to protect their turf from a ""pack of n*gg*rs"" despite one of said turf warriors having a dark complexion. Can't say I thought it was particularly necessary for some old guy telling the pawn broker he wouldn't let him ""jew him"". Seriously, you're not edgy or gritty. You're just awful at creating dialog. Yes, maybe they were trying to show how awful the world is again but I think the $10 sandwiches and having the metabolism of a hummingbird while being broker than broke and getting screwed by life repeatedly illustrated that just fine without the bigotted language for no actual story-defining purpose. Stop trying to be ""edgy"", edgelords.That said, there were some pros. You could choose your character model and name as well as that of your partner. You could have a same-sex partner if you wanted and other than being called names becuase of it, that's pretty progressive. I'm partially curious if you get called that crap as a straight character. I'm skeptical the dialog varies that greatly between chosen character models given the overall execution of the  game. The premise of the game is really appealing, win back the love of your life cuz your life is an epic soap opera of the absurd. I'm so into that. Ending up in some of the dumbest situations ever imagined? I'm not as into that as I used to be after playing this game. There's a pretty thick line between dumb luck and living the Jerry Springer dream. The game shuffles across that line into Jerry Springer territory pretty quick. But let's be real, crazy BS makes for an interesting story. Use it to your advantage.I'm really glad I got the ending I wanted and felt all the stupidity and random BS was at least mildly worth it. Closer to the end, I found a helpful community guide (https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=290538894) to make sure I didn't flip my desk over at the end of the game cuz that's how frustrated I was with how things were turning out. I probably would have gotten mad if I hadn't found it. Thanks, pal!Apparently, Vagabond Dog are creating a sequel to this game wherein you can import your save file for continuity. I really love that sorta thing and it looks like it may be a bit better by the preliminary info I could find. I'm still hesitant to buy the game outright. I think I'm going to let my feels on this game simmer before I seriously consider it. Maybe I'll buy it during onen of Steam's epic, mega sales for 80% of in like 3 years. We'll see.			"

												An RPG with Zero combat and **** ton of choices. Always sometimes monsters places you as a Straight/Gay/ lesbian guy/woman trying to win his love interest back and make it as an author. It rivals bioware in the amount of choices. There is a lot of great side content in its many areas that you might miss. Also there a references to various other games in its collectibles. This is probably the first RPG maker game i have played that supports WASD and has an autosave system10/10 would buy again			"

												While visually uninspiring, Always Sometimes Monsters addresses how the choices we as humans make not only have impact, but are almost always morally grey. However Always Sometimes Monsters rely's heavily on it's writing to keep the player engaged due to the lack of interesting gameplay, which consists of walking and occasionally pressing the space bar button.

												Once again it seems as though the indie genre picks up where triple A gaming fails. Always Sometimes Monsters is a compelling and enthralling game brought to us by the aptly named Vagabond Dog. To surmise Always Sometimes Monsters as eloquently (and with as little spoilers) as possible, it would begin with a small anecdote, much as life and this game does.Emotions are a fickle thing indeed. Our lives are so dictated by facts, set on rails since the time we begin to the time it ends, and that railcar called life never stops moving no matter how bad the road gets, picking up and losing speed wherever it feels it wants to. We can choose to leave that railcar and act as we see fit, essentially moving with our emotions, but we must keep in mind that we're shackled to it, and if we let it get too far ahead of us it will drag us into the ground. That doesn't mean that life hates us or has any preference, just that it always keeps moving and we neeed to keep that in mind. Always Sometimes Monsters is an amazing portrayal of such a concept.Storytelling as a medium is relatively new to anything outside of literature, especially in most western culture. Things are very action oriented, and it's easy to do so in a field such as video games, because all that is required is to present a moving story and hope your audience accepts it. It's when we are given control of situations that storytelling becomes complicated. You can say that you ultimately want to write a sad story or a happy story, but is it really simple to portray a story as just that? As something that has ups and downs depending on your own choices, forcing you to keep in mind that things move on and everything has its own time and pace? Always Sometimes Monsters would make it seem as simple as breathing.Throughout the course of this game I was given situations and choices that had me constantly reflecting on myself and my own life as much as my character's, and those choices did eventually catch up to me in some way or another. I felt happy, I felt sad, and by the end of it I felt empty. I stood at the edge of the game and could only look back, regretting what I had done and thinking that perhaps I could have done better.

Ultimately this game made me feel something that I had grown accustom to, but it instead let me see it from the outside looking in: depression and desperation. I didn't feel happy just because the story said I was happy, nor did I feel broken just because the story said it was so. I felt human living within the world presented to me, and that is a truly beautiful and complicated thing to be able to create.Vagabond Dog has successfully created what I would say is one of the most beautiful and realistic portrayal of a single fragment of life that I've ever seen, regardless of the medium used. I would recommend this game to anyone at all who has any interest in storytelling via the video game medium. This wonderful game stands as a reminder that video games can be so much more than just pointing and shooting, and I hope that Vagabond Dog continues making such wonderful games in the future.GO BUY THIS GAME NOW.

												A truly beautiful game, Always Sometimes Monsters demonstrates how a game with simple graphics and animations can still be utterly mind-blowing. The pixel art oddly supports the story well, providing a different view on a world that is oddly familiar. In fact, I found the whole world and story shockingly relatable, and the decisions I had to make throughout the game challenged my emotions and mentality. The story is one of the best I've come across. I was glued to this game for a solid week, and the many hours I have on record are due to me falling asleep playing the game...I couldn't stop! And the game has multiple story arcs, offering much replay value. I can't express enough how incredible this game's style and story are...honestly I would simply recommend buying the game and seeing for yourself. If you appreciate a story-rich, semi-open world game in which literally the entire story and the characters within alter based on your decisions, ten bucks is a small fee for such an experience. This game left some mental scars when I was done. Oh, and the music's awesome!			"

												Always Sometimes Monsters is an interesting game in the very least. The story is a typical love triangle, but the ""hero"" of the story does not exist unless you take the time to make yourself a hero. You're either the ""villain"" or you're just the average joe who is still in love with their ex. Being normal or bad is easy, but doing the right thing is hard and usually the best option which is a good thing to learn from this game. I recommend it if you want to see how exactly the game teaches this lesson; it's worth it.			"

												Would I recommend this game? Only if you enjoy emotional massochism and completely absurd awful life choices and consequences. More the consequences than the choicecs cuz even though you have choices, the consequences often are unprecidently awful. Or if you always wanted to commit crimes and simply needed a reason. Use this as catharsis and avoid jailtime!My overall impression of this game? Great premise, iffy execution. There were a lot of awful choices you could make and often you had to choose between a really ridiculous awful choice and something phenomenally ridiculous and awful choice. You're often forced to commit crimes when you otherwise probably wouldn't which is annoying when you're trying to get the player character's life back together. I'm not sure if the creators did this to illustrate how awful life can get or if they just thought of the most ridiculous situations to put the player in. The things people do for love, amirite?Parts of the game were really frustrating. For example, having to pay $10 for one sandwich and needing to eat 10 to fill up your stamina bar and the frequency you need to do that.

												This game is ridicluously pretentious at times, but then it becomes oddly positive and weirdly spiritual. The tone is all over the place, writing wise. It's an RPG maker game, so if you've played one you've played them all. There's some bits and pieces of good writing and enjoyable characters but the main storyline is so muddled with inconsistecies that it tarnishes the experience. For a game with such a hard on for moral ambiguity in the beginning, theres no real moral gray here. Instead of you making choices to affect the story, you make weird choices that fill the gaps into the story.  I didn't finish the game since it requires you to grind awful gambling/boxing minigames for thousands of dollars. It's a really hard wall to hit when you're almost completely done with the game, and nobody's buying a story based game to play a really mediocre blackjack simulator dozens of times over. If you're into this kinda stuff, you might find an experience. Otherwise I wouldn't waste your time.  "

												Always Sometimes Monsters: the game with a heart.Now, seeing the introspective person I am, playing this game really gave me an insight on how life plays out, depending on the actions you choose. Always Sometimes Monsters is a true choose your own adventure game; you're a character and you have a goal, and how you get to that is up to you. You could go round doing some odd jbos, you could make a quick buck off some poor sod or you could just wing it and go where the mood takes you. Either way, you'll end up with an ending somehow. Going through the game, it really gave me a sense of purpose in it, even though it didnt particularly feel like it when I was doing the tasks - sometimes I had to cut corners, and sometimes I had to do things the 'proper' way - that being said, the game makes it extremely clear to you that there isn't a 'right' choice to make. What you do is completely up to you but nevertheless you will get to your objective. It really did feel like a journey, and one that was worth writing about - I'm not going to spoil the premise, because that's kind of the whole schpiel, but the actions you take really do feel like you're working towards an ultimate objective. It's the kind of game where you can get so engrossed in the story, but you still have the freedom to choose what you'd do in the situations it gives you. The message is clear in the game - you're in control of your own fate, but you can't control everyone else's. It's really rewarding working around all the circumstances to get to the objective you set out for yourself, be it making money or getting someone's trust. That being said, you need to really look into yourself to be able to make moral decisions, for example do you sell a stray dog to a training facility, or do you try and find its owner? These kind of choices make up the fabric of the game. The art style and the music really gel in well with the atmosphere, with groovey tunes by Laser Destroyer Team setting in feels wherever you go, and the art style reminding me of old school indie pixel art games. You can really feel the indie game vibe going on in this game, and it's not suprising considering it was by Devolver Digital. Overall, this game left me feeling sad; not in a bad way, but the story actually made me feel sad. It made me reflect on life, our journeys, and the fact that you might not get what you want. But this is what this game excels at - it can teach you a lesson about the natural order, and it can provoke conflict within the mind. If you're a fan of exploring stories to their edges, then this game is for you.			"

""Can we be salvaged, or are we always sometimes monsters?"" 7/10  Always Sometimes Monsters is not for the faint of heart. Don't expect any remorse on the game's part: it has the potential to be far more bitter and unforgiving than it appears. In it, you play a struggling young author on a journey to pick yourself up from the gutter, but there's a catch: you only have 30 days to turn your life around. As I feel that the game is best enjoyed with little to no prior knowledge of its plot, I'll try to keep this review as nonspecific as possible. The concept is standard decision-based RPG fare: the choices you make will determine your future. I've always been a big fan of decision-based games, especially those that test your morals - and Monsters is brutal in this respect. A Paragon through-and-through, I'm always trying my hardest to take the moral high road in video games: tell the truth, abide by the law, and be the hero. Similarly to Lucas Pope's Papers Please, the decisions you make in Monsters are far too morally ambiguous for this to ever be an option. Due to the complex and difficult nature of these decisions, it's not so much a fun game as it is a captivating one - there's no good or evil, and you'll find yourself making a lot of difficult choices that reflect those we make in reality. In its complete rejection of black-and-white morality, events chain together and intersect in a myriad of different and surprising ways. You'll often have to choose between your own welfare and that of others: the game forces you, an individual struggling to stay alive, to choose between money and morals, but there's more often than not a third option that might help you unintentionally...or hinder you just the same.Ultimately, I found the events of the game to be dissatisfying and irritating - but that's not necessarily a bad thing, as these feelings were born more from a desire for in-universe justice than anything else (how dare they treat my Marcus like that)! I've got a lot of respect for any work that can evoke this sort of reaction. I was not angry with the game itself, rather, the cruel nature of the world within it, and the way it had treated me. As the player, you're forced to take what is handed to you, and often feel as if your hard work has no purpose. I felt myself constantly frustrated, unable to have my character's life turn out how I felt it should, regardless of the effort I put in. I was equally upset when characters berated me for choices I made that I had originally judged to be morally sound. You're always presented with easy ways to make cash or advance further in the game, but they're never without their lasting consequences. I found the range of emotions this game stirred up in me to be surprising, as they were very much unexpected during my first hour or so of playtime. I did, however, find the required menial tasks quite frustrating - whilst I understand this is likely the intention of the developers, much like the aforementioned Papers Please, this kind of gameplay was severely limited by the RPGMaker engine, whereas the former tackled it in a very unique way. Despite the serious themes the game explores, there's still a good helping of well-written humour. One thing I found particularly amusing was the fact that there are self-inserts of the developers in the game, and interacting with them produces a host of self-referential (and occasionally self-deprecating) jokes. I found this to be very clever, and it was a great way to break up the tension in the game, along with the occasional mini-game (Rasmus Man, though clearly a Vagabond Dog inside joke, was quite amusing).Unfortunately, the game lacks the defined visual style found in conceptually similar games such as Hotline Miami and Gods Will Be Watching. The character designs were not very memorable, although I did find the overworld sprites to be more aesthetically appealing than the character portraits (which, sadly, most characters only had one of, making intense scenes with smiling characters somewhat offputting, though I can understand this given the sheer number of designs). I honestly felt this to be to be my only major complaint with it, as the substandard quality of the artwork was made up for by an excellent plot and soundtrack. The music ranges from melancholy and atmospheric to gritty and unsettling, comprised of thumping 80's synths that wouldn't sound out of place on the Drive soundtrack. Sadly, however, I did find myself picking up a host of grammatical errors in the dialogue that could have been fixed very easily. Finally, I think it's important to note two things about this game, though I'll try to be as ambiguous as possible so as not to spoil anything: the all-important LGBTQ+ representation, racial diversity, and the replay value this ultimately results in. The character selection process can yield a huge range of different combinations for the player and their partner - much like life itself - and I'm yet to replay the game in order to explore the possible combinations of genders, races, and their influences on the game, let alone those of my choices. Characters will suffer racism, sexism, and/or homophobia, an unfortunate reflection of reality. I certainly recommend this game to anybody who's looking for something that deals with human nature at its very core. Though it does lack polish in some areas, it's an outstanding game, and it's definitely worth a play. If you're anything like me, just try to have tissues handy. And maybe a stress ball.			"

												Always Sometimes Monsters was a nice game about being homeless and scrounging up money to get to your ex's wedding, that I received as a gift.The game starts off at a party, you are Larry. You go around talking to your guests, which all offer a drink. Whoever you pick then becomes your character for the rest of the game as you decide their names by what you write on his birthday card.  It's a more interesting than the usual selection menu and while it may feel like a small detail, I really liked how this was handled.I very much enjoyed this game but I'm going to come across as negative review - the game is made on the RPG Maker engine, which I have used but don't particularly like. You press space-bar to progress dialogue but also choose your decision so if you're reading quickly you might occasionally select the wrong thing if you don't expect a dialogue box to show up or talk to a character again once they've finished speaking. They aren't bad but I'm not a particular fan of the engine's graphics either - individual environment sprites look very nice and the title screen is gorgeous but you can always tell that RPGMaker uses a square tile-based grid because grass instantly turns into a pavement with no overlays or curves. These are all personal grudges however and ones I'd apply to more games than just this one.The writing isn't perfect - None of the characters converse like real people, but this is a video game so I can forgive it and the overall plot was interesting enough that while I noticed it frequently, I wasn't particularly bothered by it. I actually felt kinda bad for my character, although some of the choices made would definitely make them unsympathetic. A lot of the decisions are fairly big and really interesting - there's one right at the end that I loved and seriously struggled with.Always Sometimes Monsters is set over a course of 30 in-game days, doing certain tasks will move time forward and at the end, you need to sleep. I enjoy games that use time as a mechanic and there was a genuine thought of ♥♥♥♥♥♥I need to get moving, I might actually miss this wedding' while playing, so I feel it's done well.  The idea is that each day brings different tasks, certain shops are only open at x times and it's appreciated, because it gives you a direction to go in. The initial task is to get money so you can pay your apartment rent and get the key back. When the game has things going for it, choices to make and new things occurring, it's a lot of fun to see you're taking the story and I seriously got into it. The game doesn't have enough plots/choices for all 30 days so sometimes, while it starts off very strongly, the flow can get broken and you'll wake up from your bed wondering if there's something I'm missing somewhere or if I should just spent the day making money.  For example, a certain character offered to give me a lift, which was great, they said they'd contact me in a few days which I then spent killing time because there didn't seem to be any objectives left. On a different engine with more experienced writers, this game has a potential to be a lot better, which isn't to say it's bad. I stuck with Always Sometimes Monsters to the end and I'm glad I did - the ending was good and the journey was worth sticking with. It deserves praise for trying new things and bringing fresh ideas, not all of which work, but it gets points for trying.			"

												While I enjoyed that this game gave the player a wide selection of choices (even when it came to their character and partner) I really have to say that the numerous errors in spelling, grammar, and the often times unclear goals/directions really ruined the immersion. Even from the start of the game it was not clear that you were to be selecting your avatar. It gives it replay value to see if you can do something more, something different, but I definitely wouldn't replay this game until fixes are made.			"

												Loving it at about 5 hours. I actually shed tears at one part. Aside from Walking Dead, probably the most emotional game I've played yet and it's working. I have hope for smaller studios and mid level games again. AAA will continue to try to gather the widest audience, but maybe we'll get a Speilberg of games one day that'll give us a AAA like this. I don't even necessarily think it'd have to be 3D, it could still be 2D, maybe even still pixel art, but it would at least have to support widescreen and proper scaling. Maybe UbiArt. Might end up being my game of the year and that's weird. Might be my game of the year if I played it last year. Yep, enjoying it more than Black Flag or any game I can remember from the previous year.			"

If you're a 20 something college graduate. play this game. if you're younger play this game. if you're older play this game.Like I said i am not done yet. i dont know how the story ends, but so far the ride has been great and well worth what i paid for this game.oh and the music is catchy and fitting. so much so that i went back and bought the soundtrack.bravo to the developers of this game.

												First of all, I want you to know: I do NOT think that this is a game for everybody. I myself am still a bit torn on what to think about it. I love the idea and the execution is...fine but not flawless in my opinion. I think it's best I list a view points that could be of interest to potential buyers (NO spoilers!):- my first playthrough took me about 9h30min- you can't create your own character by choosing what they look like but you have several different characters (and significant others) to choose from at the beginning of the game- the story and characters are what drives the game- you really should be someone who enjoys these ""choose your own adventure"" kind of games- you should also be someone who's into these kinds of stories (about ordinary people and their daily struggles mixed in with a sappy love story)- the gameplay itself gets rather repetitive after a while- besides some mini-games (which range from being kinda fun to annoying), you will spend a lot of time walking and talking- the game has a high replayability if you care enough about the characters and story to make you wanna see all the different outcomes and pathsAs there are so many different paths to play, you might want to consider checking out a playthrough on Youtube or so if you are still unsure on whether to buy the game or not. Might give you a good idea about the game's atmosphere which you really should get into if you hope to have a good time playing. So all in all, I decided to recommend this game as I love these types of story-driven, choice-making games in general and commend the developers for giving a game like this a chance. And once again: I think that if you can get into the story and characters enough, it'll make up for gameplay and you'll have a good time seeing how you're character's story unfolds.			"

												The game itself is good, very good, up until the marriage (that is basically the point of the game). I love this game personally even if i got the bad ending, being able to chose what you want is very nice and this game has a very realistic and false view of the world. It's not easy to explain. But ill try my best, so *spoilers* i went to the bachelor party and saved sam with money, went to the ceremony and spoke up, expecting of getting my loved one back, but instead i got called ""selfish"" even after i saved her ♥♥♥♥ing wife the day before, and this girl wanted to give away my journal that would have made me rich (and it did), so yeah, thats a kick in the nuts.The game handled itself pretty well up untill the end where it crumbled, still, this has to be one of my favourite games.Since i'm not ign ill give it a 8.9/10.I highly raccomend it.

												An incredible game. RPG Maker games tend to be misses rather than hits with me, being either too tedious or slow to fit in with my tastes. While Always Sometimes Monsters almost fits both bills perfectly, this game has a special spark that made it nearly impossible for me to stop playing. The story is deep, and so human. A player could play though multiple times and experience different stories, along with being able to play and romance as different characters!I couldn't recommend this game more.

												So after my first playthrough, I can only say that I want to play it all over again, at least one more time. There are, however, some things I did not quite like, but I overall really recommend this game.The gameplay mechanics aren't amazing (they could really use some tweaks!), but the story really gets to you. I think one of the greatest things the developers did was to include a lot of diversity. Sexuality, gender, race, morality, religion, etc are all integrated into the game in a way that each player can have an unique experience while playing the game,  and that's something I really appreciate. I was gladly surprised when the NPCs comment on some of these things, tailoring their answers depending on who you choose to be. Not all options matter in the end though, and sometimes the options you can take as the main character are limited. This may not be the same for everyone, but I found the game a bit depressing, but it could also be argued that it's just like life itself: There are choices to make, and you can't always please everybody. It takes about 8 hours to complete, but it is possible that at the end you'll also be wondering ""what would've happened if I hadn't done this and did that instead..."" so you may wish to play it again afterwards. (At least I do, specially since I kind of messed up and got one of the saddest endings!) Oh, and the music is awesome! I love the main theme!Someone should really fix the menu and the UI though. Why cannot we simply exit the mini games pressing ESC? How can we change the resolution? Why do I sometimes choose an answer I didn't want to say just because I pressed 'space' to get the full text? And maybe the mouse could also be integrated in some way, as for example, being able to move using the mouse or something.And also I wish you could at least change the clothes of your character. Yeah, it's kind of funny you always wear the same and it's kind of a nice joke, but who goes for a swim with clothes on? I got a damned scalp massage with my hoodie on! Erm... Just don't choose the guy with the hoodie at the start or you'll later on be infuriated you cannot ""unhood"" your guy even while assisting a wedding (yeah, not everyone can afford the 5000$ the suit costs.)And food and stamina plays no role in the game. You can basically starve your character to death with no consequences. Anyway! In short: + Tailored story.+ Lots of choices to make.+ Diversity. + Compelling story.+ Great music- Really bad UI.- Wish you could personalize the characters a bit. - Wish all choices mattered more in the end.- Food & stamina plays no role (that I know of)7/10			"

												Always Sometimes Monsters is a RPGmaker ""life sim"" where you play one character whose objective is to attend his/her ex-bf/gf wedding in a distant city.So as you may think, this game first lets you pick from a small range of characters (because they couldn't make hundreds of sprites) to get the protagonist and then you choose who will be your partner (and later, your ex). Both can be guys, girls or an heterosexual couple, the game let's you decide how you'll get more involved with the story there. For example my first gameplay I chose a lesbian couple.So the game centers around making you think about what path is best to accomplish your goal, and then make you reflect on your decisions. You need money in order to get to San Verdano (the city hosting the wedding), so you'll have to work, steal, lie... or not. The game leaves all that up to you. You can get the money by legal means, or walk over people to get what you want. You also need to eat and sleep, so you'll need money for that as well.The game involves drugs, sex, killing people, stealing and a bunch of references and jokes. So if you enjoy this kind of things you may like the game.But so far I've described to you the overall feel of the game. now I'm gonna get a little bit harsh on it, so I warn you:FROM HERE THE REVIEW HAS ""SPOILERISH"" OPINIONS, IF YOU PREFER TO GET INTO THE UNKNOWN, DONT READ THIS.Ok so the game has mainly three wrong things.- The first one is the poor writing of the story. At first the plot is real good until you get to a point where you ask ""why?"". And this repeats from then on. Poor character development if you ask me, and this will make you mad if you can't stand weak plots. Also, you ""decide"" why your character wants to go to the wedding, so you expect it not to be a ""romantic rescue"" if you don't want it that way. You just wait.- There is ""almost"" no consequences from acting douchy or well apart from the rewards. I've done a lot of♥♥♥♥♥♥ Help people who needed it, sell drugs, try to do an honest job... . And the only bad things that will happen to you if you go commiting crimes or just walking over people is... the moral remorse? Which may not matter to you at all because well, it's a ♥♥♥♥ing game.- At the end of the game you'll get a fusion of the last two points. The only way you'll face your ""mistakes"" is by talking with some character, and well, that's it. You'll have to defend yourself from accussations of doing bad things, if you did any. But you'll have an excuse for all of them so it doesn't matter at all. But the worst part is that, not only it actually turns out that you are ON A ROMANTIC RESCUE, but you figure it out too late. In a game where you can act maturely, you are expected to fight for your exs love (even if you chose your character to decide to forget her), other way you'll find yourself in one of, what I guess, many ♥♥♥♥♥♥ endings. Again, thanks for the poor writing.END OF ""SPOILERS"" HERESo this is a game that makes you decide in every minute, with poor writing but a fun story and minigames. Only one of the many endings this game has is ""good"", and if you play the same way I did, you'll find yourself in any of the bad ones. Also it fails to deliver the message in the game's title, as you build your character from zero and make all the decisions for him/her, so you won't feel bad about doing bad things if you just wanted to play that way.Anyway, buy it if it's cheap, but don't expect a great game. It's still fun and a nice experience, but I warn you, if you try to behave maturely and nice, you'll get butthurt as hell. 6/10 too much meh.			"

												I liked the sound of this game when I got it in a humble bundle, but honestly it's just really boring and tedious to play most of the time. It doesn't feel like any choice I'm making really matters, and in between the already boring story bits you have to do repetitive and simple mini-games to collect money. I don't see the fun in it, so it's just a bad game to me.			"

												I see what people are getting at in downvoting this game. The story can be overly dramatic at times, it is limited by its RPGMaker engine, and you don't ever have quite as much freedom as you'd live. It is a diamond in the rough. I think it is an ambitios attempt at a kind of RPG we haven't seen often before but is becoming more common in that it attempts to explore a modern day, realistic fiction setting. I believe Always Sometimes Monsters succeeds in its goal of causing the player to face themselves and the actions they're willing to take to win the game. There are no monsters to be slain, no magical items to retrieve, no experience to farm, only seemingly mundane choices that seem arbitrary at first, but can later (and often) have a profound effect on your world. Maybe not THE WORLD itself, but your world. You're not out to save the land from evil, you're on a journey of self-discovery. I found myself intrigued with the decisions I found myself facing, and at the end I was so disgusted with the ending I recieved, I loadrd a previous save to change my character's fate. I believe that reaction crosses Sometimes Always Monsters over from being merely a game to serve as a distraction and moves it towards an artistic piece worthy of discussion. Like a painting, you may love it or you may hate it, but the fact that it made you think and feel anything is an indication that the piece succeded in its goal.If you can get it for $10 or less or as part of a Humble Bundle, I highy suggest giving it a whirl. It does have a little replayability, as the selection of your character's race, gender, and sexual orientation do impact the game world and there are multiple branches you can take to complete the story. The endings can be lumped into 5 or 6 different branches, but Always Sometimes Monsters, like life, is about the journey and not the destination.			"

												Loving it at about 5 hours. I actually shed tears at one part. Aside from Walking Dead, probably the most emotional game I've played yet and it's working. I have hope for smaller studios and mid level games again. AAA will continue to try to gather the widest audience, but maybe we'll get a Speilberg of games one day that'll give us a AAA like this. I don't even necessarily think it'd have to be 3D, it could still be 2D, maybe even still pixel art, but it would at least have to support widescreen and proper scaling. Maybe UbiArt. Might end up being my game of the year and that's weird. Might be my game of the year if I played it last year. Yep, enjoying it more than Black Flag or any game I can remember from the previous year.			"

												Always Sometimes Monsters has provided a journey of despair, love, angst, humor, betrayal, and loyalty. This journey has guided me through the story near seamlessly (there were a few points of plot-advancement confusion, mainly in the first hour), and, although time was not taken to reflect during the actual sequence, the hours following the completion revolved around analyzing the decisions and paths taken to try and alleviate my guilt-ridden mind. It is to be believed that Always Sometimes Monsters is a roller-coaster of emotion, and it is one that I play on re-riding over and over again, if only to attempt achieving a perfect ending.Then again, what would a perfect ending consist of?

												I'm a sucker for character driven narratives, and this game is more of a story that you unfold. The choices you make impact the plot in such interesting ways. Perhaps your decisions don't make as much of an impact in this game as they might in another, more open-world franchise, but this game is good enough that I've purchased copies to hand out to a lot of my friends. It often goes on sale for pretty cheap, which means - to me, at least - that no one has an excuse not to try it out. If you like choice making games, story based games, tales about human error and relationships and hard times... Just pick this up already, would you?			"

												Always Sometimes Monsters is a hard game to review. The idea is great, presenting a gritty view of the ups and downs of life, but the lack of direction and attempts to read a deeper meaning into everything started to feel a bit long winded after a while. Every choice is yours, and you don't even need to make choices if you don't want to. You can just watch the timer tick down and stare at your character say they're hungry (but forgets about it after day 7).There are no real consquences to anything you do, bad choices are there just to make you feel bad, but you easily rationalize your choices to any NPC in the game, and they just sort of shrug it off. At times I felt completely alienated from my character, simply due to their dialogue. You moved 20 boxes, got $150 and feel like you're being punished? Just a little entitled and spoiled, my pixelated friend.That said, I liked it. It's too interesting not to like, but it felt like some aspects could have been polished off a little better, especially near the end where it feels rushed. If you want a reflective game, with a tongue in cheek look at reality, this is the game for you and it's a good buy for it's price.			"

												First of all, I want you to know: I do NOT think that this is a game for everybody. I myself am still a bit torn on what to think about it. I love the idea and the execution is...fine but not flawless in my opinion. I think it's best I list a view points that could be of interest to potential buyers (NO spoilers!):- my first playthrough took me about 9h30min- you can't create your own character by choosing what they look like but you have several different characters (and significant others) to choose from at the beginning of the game- the story and characters are what drives the game- you really should be someone who enjoys these ""choose your own adventure"" kind of games- you should also be someone who's into these kinds of stories (about ordinary people and their daily struggles mixed in with a sappy love story)- the gameplay itself gets rather repetitive after a while- besides some mini-games (which range from being kinda fun to annoying), you will spend a lot of time walking and talking- the game has a high replayability if you care enough about the characters and story to make you wanna see all the different outcomes and pathsAs there are so many different paths to play, you might want to consider checking out a playthrough on Youtube or so if you are still unsure on whether to buy the game or not. Might give you a good idea about the game's atmosphere which you really should get into if you hope to have a good time playing. So all in all, I decided to recommend this game as I love these types of story-driven, choice-making games in general and commend the developers for giving a game like this a chance. And once again: I think that if you can get into the story and characters enough, it'll make up for gameplay and you'll have a good time seeing how you're character's story unfolds.			"

Always Sometimes Monsters pretends to be a force to be reckoned with, but fails on it.Italian:Ci troviamo di fronte un gioco concettualmente interessante ma deludente nella realizzazione.

												The biggest accomplishment of this game is how it opens a window into the hell of struggling game design, self-aware in its obsession to deliver complex game structure and say something meaningful. The developers are present as background characters poking themselves for constantly failing at this, usually with a good dose of humour.Everything in this game is built around choice and consequences, and gosh dang can it bring you down. It's probably best not to go into the story if you're interested in playing at all--just surprise yourself and and look up no discussions...until maybe you hit the requisite twist ending unprepared.Most of the design faults pop up near the end. So many decisions and their impacts snowball together; it ends up falling apart fairly sadly, reminiscent of Mass Effect's closure(--in reasoning, not in disappointment). The structure also moves more and more away from being purely dedicated to itself, to petering out in game-y design with minigames or cartoon scenarios that don't fit the game's atmosphere, a side-effect of cramming in too much ambition.But maybe that design is the point, and is part of the story. The protagonist is writing it every night--or at least imagining it--after all. Maybe it's supposed to cross borders into blatant fiction by the desperate author(s).A unique recommendation goes out to fans of the original Deus Ex. This game shares a number of thematic and quest similarities, as well as taking clear inspiration in its color palette.			"

												Although it says I recommend it, I can't recommend it fullyAlways Sometimes Monsters is an interesting game. The story and concept are absolutely brilliant and are done very well. However, what little gameplay exists is mundane and boring. Think of the forklift sections of Shenmue and you'll know what I'm talking about.Also your choices don't really matter. There are no diverging paths as advertised on Devolver Digital's website and regardless of what you decide to do, pretty much same outcome will happen.If you've ever loved someone for a while and ended up losing them and as a result became extremely depressed and hopeless, then you'll probably enjoy this game as you can personally relate to it.If not, then I don't recommend it as the pacing is slow, the progress is tedious due to the amount of minigames you have to trudge through, and the endings don't leave you fully satisfied.The game is worth it for the story but even then, parts of it are sloppy and the endings are all letdowns.You can view my full detailed video review here:

												This is easily one of the trickiest reviews I've done, however, it was also a critical one that helped reinforce things I need to consider when doing my reviews. I had originally intended to give a ""no"" recommendation, changed my decision after considering many different things. Keep in mind, for an RPG Maker game, this one is extremely impressive. I craft badges based on games I really like, and I did so for this game to mainly represent the unique gameplay type (moreso than the gameplay itself) and the effort put into everything.If you like text-heavy, story/narrative driven games, decision trees - primarily focusing on your moral compass - and love stories, then you should enjoy this one.The aesthetics are good, the game has a good amount of detail for an RPG Maker game - the art used for the different characters is also well-done. The music is very good and fits appropriately with the gameplay. The story is decent, there is a lot of variability depending on what choices you make. In the beginning, you may select the character you wish to play as (as well as his/her love interest) - the game also allows same-sex partners.The controls are very simple (entirely keyboard-based), especially considering that this is more of a ""life simulator,"" than anything else. There is no option to change text-speed, however, and this can be annoying for people who read quickly - I would spam the ""next"" button (which also happens to be the interact button) and accidentally reactivate the conversation. I advise you to wait for the text to completely render because pressing ""next"" will also select the first dialogue option if there happens to be one at the end of the text; save often in case this happens to you a lot. The difficulty is minimal, the main thing you have to worry about is ensuring that you have enough money to afford food (when your energy is depleted you cannot sleep).The gameplay is decent - if you are an immersive gamer, you will really have your moral compass tested at particular points. Near end of the game, a scene is presented that really appealed to me (and redeemed my original impressions of the game). There are a multitude of things to do: play games at an arcade, invest in ""hotdog"" stocks, play scratch-and-wins, gamble, and eat at different places. You have an energy meter, and this can be refilled by eating or drinking food. To progress the clock (morning, afternoon, evening), you must either complete an event or go to sleep; however, you cannot sleep on an empty stomach. To pay for food, you must either work jobs to gain money, gamble/sell items (there are collectible action figures) at the pawn shop, or even forgo payment and just try dumpster diving for dirty mackarels. There is a time limit - you must get to x in x number of days (it is possible to fail), so you need to manage your time wisely. That being said, I was able to make it to my destination with ~14 days to spare. For money, I kept playing the stratch-and-wins - buying 10 at a time for $50 and profiting an average of $50. Near the end of the game, you have multiple gambling options, and I personally found blackjack to be the easiest (since you can just load your game if you lose).The replayability for the game is fairly high due to the amount of available choices, however, the game has not interested me enough to warrant a second playthrough.Understanding that this is an RPG Maker game helped remind me some important things - I was too used to being spoiled by AAA open-world games where you have to be aware of consequences. For example, when you are first introduced to the ""hotdog"" stocks, the pitch suggests that it is a safer way to store your money. Considering that you have to sleep in the streets most of the time, I would deposit my money to my bank account in case I got robbed - this never happened. I do not know if you can be mugged, but in ~8 hours of playtime the only way I ever lost money was if I chose to. The item system can also use a gigantic rework, as I sincerely believe that most of the items are purely cosmetic. This includes both buyable and findable items - about 90% of the items I have serve little to no use. Another example, I am trying to get into my apartment, but the locks have been changed. I have a crowbar in my inventory that I found, so I naturally try to use it (to no avail). I do not know if most of the items serve a larger purpose.Besides the abovementioned points, there is a lot of different things you can do in the game. There are even brief mini-games that give you a break from the normal gameplay, which I found to be very nice. If you like life simulators - that are limited (by the RPG Maker engine) - and narrative-focused games, try this one out. Be advised, the central theme revolves around moral compasses and love, so avoid this game if those do not interest you. I will suggest you to wait for the price to go down unless you are really interested in trying it out.Recommend.Cheers,DJSF @DJSF's Rogue Reviews "

												Spent 9 hours breaking my in-game back to get enough money to chase down the love of my life just to have my best friend become famous and for me to end up awaiting death in a dark alley. Best relationship sim on the market. But in all seriousness the game was a pretty good experience but it was very tedious at times due to the minigames such as putting boxes in a truck and constantly playing rock paper scissors for money. Besides that the game was an enjoyable experience. 8/10 would play again			"

												First part, when trying to pay the rent and getting involved in the matters about our friends was great, basically trying to survive in a modern world, and if that idea was continued instead of turning the game into a love story, this game could have been great but looking for the long gone love of the protagonist made me feel the rest of the game was simply out of place.Still, you should give it a try for the first part.

												The game itself is good, very good, up until the marriage (that is basically the point of the game). I love this game personally even if i got the bad ending, being able to chose what you want is very nice and this game has a very realistic and false view of the world. It's not easy to explain. But ill try my best, so *spoilers* i went to the bachelor party and saved sam with money, went to the ceremony and spoke up, expecting of getting my loved one back, but instead i got called ""selfish"" even after i saved her ♥♥♥♥ing wife the day before, and this girl wanted to give away my journal that would have made me rich (and it did), so yeah, thats a kick in the nuts.The game handled itself pretty well up untill the end where it crumbled, still, this has to be one of my favourite games.Since i'm not ign ill give it a 8.9/10.I highly raccomend it.

												An incredible game. RPG Maker games tend to be misses rather than hits with me, being either too tedious or slow to fit in with my tastes. While Always Sometimes Monsters almost fits both bills perfectly, this game has a special spark that made it nearly impossible for me to stop playing. The story is deep, and so human. A player could play though multiple times and experience different stories, along with being able to play and romance as different characters!I couldn't recommend this game more. Well worth the price. Well worth the time.			"

												Always Sometimes Monsters: the game with a heart.Now, seeing the introspective person I am, playing this game really gave me an insight on how life plays out, depending on the actions you choose. Always Sometimes Monsters is a true choose your own adventure game; you're a character and you have a goal, and how you get to that is up to you. You could go round doing some odd jbos, you could make a quick buck off some poor sod or you could just wing it and go where the mood takes you. Either way, you'll end up with an ending somehow. Going through the game, it really gave me a sense of purpose in it, even though it didnt particularly feel like it when I was doing the tasks - sometimes I had to cut corners, and sometimes I had to do things the 'proper' way - that being said, the game makes it extremely clear to you that there isn't a 'right' choice to make. What you do is completely up to you but nevertheless you will get to your objective. It really did feel like a journey, and one that was worth writing about - I'm not going to spoil the premise, because that's kind of the whole schpiel, but the actions you take really do feel like you're working towards an ultimate objective. It's the kind of game where you can get so engrossed in the story, but you still have the freedom to choose what you'd do in the situations it gives you. The message is clear in the game - you're in control of your own fate, but you can't control everyone else's. It's really rewarding working around all the circumstances to get to the objective you set out for yourself, be it making money or getting someone's trust. That being said, you need to really look into yourself to be able to make moral decisions, for example do you sell a stray dog to a training facility, or do you try and find its owner? These kind of choices make up the fabric of the game. The art style and the music really gel in well with the atmosphere, with groovey tunes by Laser Destroyer Team setting in feels wherever you go, and the art style reminding me of old school indie pixel art games. You can really feel the indie game vibe going on in this game, and it's not suprising considering it was by Devolver Digital. Overall, this game left me feeling sad; not in a bad way, but the story actually made me feel sad. It made me reflect on life, our journeys, and the fact that you might not get what you want. But this is what this game excels at - it can teach you a lesson about the natural order, and it can provoke conflict within the mind. If you're a fan of exploring stories to their edges, then this game is for you.			"

												This tells about a character that you choose and their journey from the other side of whateversville to a wedding for whatever reason.  The reason is up to you.The problem is that the ending has already begun and cannot be changed, no matter what.The story in this fashion is inspired in my opinion.  It is something in which you cannot change, no matter what actions you try to prevent it.  But you can at least shift how it ends.At times this game feels slow with the tedium this game provides.  It's not by how the character walks, it's how the interfaces for such things feel unpolished.Overall this is a fine game but in no means a great one.  But if you are looking for something to kill time with then this game may help on that.			"

												Life is not defined by home decoration, pets, cup cakes or other activities represented in ""The Sims”. That’s pure fantasy escapism. Real life is mundane, tedious and full of disappointment, and in the end nothing matters anyway. In that respect Always Sometimes Monsters is probably the best life simulator ever made. The 10+ hours you’ll have to invest tooling away to get enough money to buy food and stay out of the streets while chasing a doomed dream makes it a ”real life experience” not possible to replicate through other mediums.It should come recommended to anyone interested in the current development of experimental gaming.

It does have a lot of controversial themes and your ethics are constanly being tested. So if you're like me and you're curious about all the alternate endings, this game is really worth the price they ask! But if you only want to play a single run, I guess you should probably wait for a sale cause it might be a short game.			"

""Can we be salvaged, or are we always sometimes monsters?"" 7/10  Always Sometimes Monsters is not for the faint of heart. Don't expect any remorse on the game's part: it has the potential to be far more bitter and unforgiving than it appears. In it, you play a struggling young author on a journey to pick yourself up from the gutter, but there's a catch: you only have 30 days to turn your life around. As I feel that the game is best enjoyed with little to no prior knowledge of its plot, I'll try to keep this review as nonspecific as possible. The concept is standard decision-based RPG fare: the choices you make will determine your future. I've always been a big fan of decision-based games, especially those that test your morals - and Monsters is brutal in this respect. A Paragon through-and-through, I'm always trying my hardest to take the moral high road in video games: tell the truth, abide by the law, and be the hero. Similarly to Lucas Pope's Papers Please, the decisions you make in Monsters are far too morally ambiguous for this to ever be an option. Due to the complex and difficult nature of these decisions, it's not so much a fun game as it is a captivating one - there's no good or evil, and you'll find yourself making a lot of difficult choices that reflect those we make in reality. In its complete rejection of black-and-white morality, events chain together and intersect in a myriad of different and surprising ways. You'll often have to choose between your own welfare and that of others: the game forces you, an individual struggling to stay alive, to choose between money and morals, but there's more often than not a third option that might help you unintentionally...or hinder you just the same.Ultimately, I found the events of the game to be dissatisfying and irritating - but that's not necessarily a bad thing, as these feelings were born more from a desire for in-universe justice than anything else (how dare they treat my Marcus like that)! I've got a lot of respect for any work that can evoke this sort of reaction. I was not angry with the game itself, rather, the cruel nature of the world within it, and the way it had treated me. As the player, you're forced to take what is handed to you, and often feel as if your hard work has no purpose. I felt myself constantly frustrated, unable to have my character's life turn out how I felt it should, regardless of the effort I put in. I was equally upset when characters berated me for choices I made that I had originally judged to be morally sound. You're always presented with easy ways to make cash or advance further in the game, but they're never without their lasting consequences. I found the range of emotions this game stirred up in me to be surprising, as they were very much unexpected during my first hour or so of playtime. I did, however, find the required menial tasks quite frustrating - whilst I understand this is likely the intention of the developers, much like the aforementioned Papers Please, this kind of gameplay was severely limited by the RPGMaker engine, whereas the former tackled it in a very unique way. Despite the serious themes the game explores, there's still a good helping of well-written humour. One thing I found particularly amusing was the fact that there are self-inserts of the developers in the game, and interacting with them produces a host of self-referential (and occasionally self-deprecating) jokes. I found this to be very clever, and it was a great way to break up the tension in the game, along with the occasional mini-game (Rasmus Man, though clearly a Vagabond Dog inside joke, was quite amusing).Unfortunately, the game lacks the defined visual style found in conceptually similar games such as Hotline Miami and Gods Will Be Watching. The character designs were not very memorable, although I did find the overworld sprites to be more aesthetically appealing than the character portraits (which, sadly, most characters only had one of, making intense scenes with smiling characters somewhat offputting, though I can understand this given the sheer number of designs). I honestly felt this to be to be my only major complaint with it, as the substandard quality of the artwork was made up for by an excellent plot and soundtrack. The music ranges from melancholy and atmospheric to gritty and unsettling, comprised of thumping 80's synths that wouldn't sound out of place on the Drive soundtrack. Sadly, however, I did find myself picking up a host of grammatical errors in the dialogue that could have been fixed very easily. Finally, I think it's important to note two things about this game, though I'll try to be as ambiguous as possible so as not to spoil anything: the all-important LGBTQ+ representation, racial diversity, and the replay value this ultimately results in. The character selection process can yield a huge range of different combinations for the player and their partner - much like life itself - and I'm yet to replay the game in order to explore the possible combinations of genders, races, and their influences on the game, let alone those of my choices. Characters will suffer racism, sexism, and/or homophobia, an unfortunate reflection of reality. I certainly recommend this game to anybody who's looking for something that deals with human nature at its very core. Though it does lack polish in some areas, it's an outstanding game, and it's definitely worth a play. If you're anything like me, just try to have tissues handy. And maybe a stress ball.			"

												Always Sometimes Monsters was a nice game about being homeless and scrounging up money to get to your ex's wedding, that I received as a gift.The game starts off at a party, you are Larry. You go around talking to your guests, which all offer a drink. Whoever you pick then becomes your character for the rest of the game as you decide their names by what you write on his birthday card.  It's a more interesting than the usual selection menu and while it may feel like a small detail, I really liked how this was handled.I very much enjoyed this game but I'm going to come across as negative review - the game is made on the RPG Maker engine, which I have used but don't particularly like. You press space-bar to progress dialogue but also choose your decision so if you're reading quickly you might occasionally select the wrong thing if you don't expect a dialogue box to show up or talk to a character again once they've finished speaking. They aren't bad but I'm not a particular fan of the engine's graphics either - individual environment sprites look very nice and the title screen is gorgeous but you can always tell that RPGMaker uses a square tile-based grid because grass instantly turns into a pavement with no overlays or curves. These are all personal grudges however and ones I'd apply to more games than just this one.The writing isn't perfect - None of the characters converse like real people, but this is a video game so I can forgive it and the overall plot was interesting enough that while I noticed it frequently, I wasn't particularly bothered by it. I actually felt kinda bad for my character, although some of the choices made would definitely make them unsympathetic. A lot of the decisions are fairly big and really interesting - there's one right at the end that I loved and seriously struggled with.Always Sometimes Monsters is set over a course of 30 in-game days, doing certain tasks will move time forward and at the end, you need to sleep. I enjoy games that use time as a mechanic and there was a genuine thought of ♥♥♥♥♥♥I need to get moving, I might actually miss this wedding' while playing, so I feel it's done well.  The idea is that each day brings different tasks, certain shops are only open at x times and it's appreciated, because it gives you a direction to go in. The initial task is to get money so you can pay your apartment rent and get the key back. When the game has things going for it, choices to make and new things occurring, it's a lot of fun to see you're taking the story and I seriously got into it. The game doesn't have enough plots/choices for all 30 days so sometimes, while it starts off very strongly, the flow can get broken and you'll wake up from your bed wondering if there's something I'm missing somewhere or if I should just spent the day making money.  For example, a certain character offered to give me a lift, which was great, they said they'd contact me in a few days which I then spent killing time because there didn't seem to be any objectives left. On a different engine with more experienced writers, this game has a potential to be a lot better, which isn't to say it's bad. I stuck with Always Sometimes Monsters to the end and I'm glad I did - the ending was good and the journey was worth sticking with. It deserves praise for trying new things and bringing fresh ideas, not all of which work, but it gets points for trying.			"

TL;DR Version: Interesting idea for the casual gamer but lacks engaging gameplay mechanics for a traditional or hardcore gamer.  Always Sometimes Monsters has some great opening presentation, utilizes its art style well, and does much with very little in regards to graphics.  Having said that, the game isn’t particularly fun or enjoyable and suffers from some slow pacing.  You basically do a bunch of menial, boring minigames as part of a life simulator – set up a stage for a band, put and remove coats from racks, help an old lady clean her apartment.  Unfortunately all these minigames just involve moving your character from one place to another and picking a menu option.  The story may be the main impetus for you to continue playing but it just cannot overcome the lack of interesting gameplay.  Maybe 10 years ago this game could have survived in the gaming market but today a $10 game competes with some of the best games of all time, and Always Sometimes Monsters just doesn’t quite cut it.

												I respect this game for what it's trying to do: it's putting the player in a situation of desperation and asking ""How far are you willing to go to escape this?""And it does it very well. The game begins with you in the dumps, with nothing to your name and a practically unattainable goal - that is, if you were to stay on the straight and narrow. The question becomes, how flexible is your moral compass? What would you do to improve your situation? Would you lie? Steal? Kill?How much is your happiness worth, and how many people can you hurt before you no longer deserve it? At what point do you become a monster?The first act of the game is very strong, as is the ending. However, the two cities in the middle are significantly rougher - they seem emptier, with less to do, some noticeable bugs and insufficient testing. Interesting plots and elements will appear without being satisfyingly resolved. It feels like that part of the game was pushed out the door.Even with its shortcomings, Always Sometimes Monsters has a very engaging story to tell, and if you have the patience to slog through the middle of it, it does reward you for your time. I wish the devs had maintained a high standard throughout the whole thing, but they are also sometimes monsters.			"

The 10+ hours you’ll have to invest tooling away to get enough money to buy food and stay out of the streets while chasing a doomed dream makes it a ”real life experience” not possible to replicate through other mediums.It should come recommended to anyone interested in the current development of experimental gaming.

The main character just seems like a complete needy, lazy, loser who doesnt take care of his business like an adult should. The story progresses with him (or her) Deciding that they want their girlfriend (or boyfriend) back. I would have just said ""to hell with her"" and went to work. It was all too pathetic to me. You may think other wise because this is my opinion. I tried to get into it but I... just... couldn't... do it.			"

												Always Sometimes Monsters - The first time i heard that name i thought ""What the hell is that?"" A weird title that got my attention quite some time ago. A dude i know told me about it a couple of months ago. I checked it out but i wasn't ready to pay for it. Now it was part of the Humble Bundle so i grabbed it. And boy...i'm glad about that. I'd rate the game a 7/10The Pixelart workes great on that Game. It might turn some people down but not me. Like i said. it works great with that game. The Story is the core of this game. It makes you think about stuff. Thats something i like about games like these. They are not only there to empty your pockets and make you feel like a badass hero. 'Always Sometimes Monsters', tries to make you think about something. It has a goal. An that goal is not for you to reach the end of the story as fast as you can. the goal is to give you something to think about when you're done with it. It will stick in your head. I can't say too much without spoiling anything lets say...love is a big part of it. Gameplaywise you won't find anything special here. there is nothing that will blow your mind. The game has a story and a goal. And thats what it focuses on. And it does a good job. Give it a try if you like good storys with twists and WTF moments. It will be worth your time.			"

												This game is deep. There is no other word for it. I'll agree that if you're the type of gamer that likes action, suspense, or instant gratification, then it probably isn't for you. If you like a game with a great story, and a lot of choices, then this may be a game for you. It takes a very particular type of gamer to enjoy this kind of game. This game is about life, the pursuit of lost love. It places you in a very real role, and makes you choose your path. How much are you willing to sacrifice, how low will you sink to chase love? It's all up to you. Who your character is changes how people react to you, so it's fun to play a character that isn't like you. Try being straight, gay, white, black, asian, whatever, and you get a different perspective. You may just learn something. The soundtrack is also amazing, there wasn't a single moment in this game that I didn't enjoy listening to.			"

												I first played this game when the developers showed it at Pax East. From what I saw, the story line was very interesting and choice driven. I was compelled to play it when it came out and had a chance to speak with some of the developers to tell them that I enjoyed the demo. What I didn't realize is how much story content this game has and I was always on the edge of my seat  to find out what happens next after I make a decision. I'm not going to spoil anything, but I highly recommend this game since it reflects on the choices that you make and the paths that are interwoven together by those choices. Another note to add, the soundtrack is amazing!			"

												If this had been an adventure game it would have been a lot better. As it is, the JRPG format makes the game quite tedious. The biggest problems are the mini-games and the lack of quest markers. The mini games just break the pacing of the story line. One example is a storyline where you have to hack the electoral system to rig an election. To me, the important thing is whether you decide to rig the election, and which candidate to favour; rather than interrupting it with Frogger-TRON. The lack of clear quest markers is a problem because this is a top-down RPG. Think of an old style adventure game where you would scan the screen with your mouse cursor to find the interactive elements. Here, you have to walk your character around the area and try interacting with all the surfaces to find the one that triggers the next phase of the ""quest"". One example is when you're told to start boxing. You would think you'd go to the boxing ring, nope. How about those two guys training with the hook and jab pads, nope. The guy training at the punch bag, nope. Turns out you have to go to the guy lifting weights in the corner to start boxing. I'm not asking to be led by the nose to the next quest trigger, but some of the trigger points are counter-intuitive and/or downright obtuse. The game is about making decisions, and this element of find-the-thing/trigger just breaks the pacing of the story. I didn't finish the game, I found the problems I've noted outweighed my curiosity at how the story would play out. The story is good, and in most places quite mature. I would like to see more from these developers, but not in the JRPG format. "

												This ia a beautiful game. As of writing this now, I've only clocked in about 5 or 6 hours. I lost track lol. It's a wonderful game with a captivating story. Unlike other games, Always Sometimes Monsters makes the player actually feel like they are in the game. You're constantly brought up with the theme of choice.  Every little thing is a choice. You're not forced to do whatever it is that you're doing.  If you don't want to let the man in the first minute speak, you can kill him and be done. If you are interested in his story, you can let him speak.   No matter what you do, it's all about choice, and that's what I enjoy about this game. Let's not forget about the music and art style. Even though the game is comprised of sprites, it's still great. The music is just amazing. It fits the story perfectly. It's like a typhoon of beauty.  For anyone who is looking for a game with an amazing story, something to open your mind, or just to feel true freedom in how you play something, this is a game to look for.  This is a must play for everyone.			"

												I honestly hated the game at the beginning but it started to grow on me. For a game built in RPGMaker it has an ambitious scope and a lot of choices that can affect the story in unexpected ways.This isn't meant to be a fun game. Far from it. It deals with a lot of dark subject matter and doesn't shy away from approaching subjects that might make some players feel uncomfortable. Unfortunately, story segments are separated by gameplay segments that I suspect have been intentionally been designed to be boring. Which isn't unusual in video games. The ""work"" mini-games in Shun Mue come to mind.The story starts with a tragic beginning as the protagonist's life is a mess and the game makes it clear that its their fault. In fact, the game makes a point of this by having NPCs remind you of your past mistakes through out the game several times. This troubles me because it feels like the player is meant to clean up the protagonist's mess with no reason to feel sympathetic to them aside from them being the underdog. In a game about choices, you start halfway in a person's life story where a lot of bad choices have been made on your behalf and you are meant to cope with the consequences.Ultimately, I wouldn't recommend the game because I can't accept the character's motivation as something a normal and healthy person would do. I won't reveal what the motivation is but it gave me the impression that the protagonist is creepy and possessive.			"

												(Note: I have not completed this game. I do not plan on coming back to it.)Despite its desperate pleas to be the Indie Game of the Now, Always Sometimes Monsters is a pretentious, sloppily-written slog of a game that deserves neither your time nor your money. Its two developers are far too comfortable hiding behind its laughable mission statement to bother crafting a believable world for its cast of shriveled archetypes to inhabit, and this oversight stops any momentum that its mildly interesting premise may have afforded. If video games are going to be taken seriously as a narrative form, at some point we're going to have to admit that merely donning the airs and vestments of intellectualism without actually saying anything of importance isn't enough to warrant critical attention. The only themes I got out of three hours of Always Sometimes Monsters were ""choice matters,"" ""laziness is bad,"" and ""you're responsible for your actions.""  If this truly deserves the bevy of positive ""thinking man's"" reviews that this title has received, maybe I'm in the wrong line of work. 4/10			"

												Always Sometimes Monsters is a creative RPG that was created by Vagabond Dog and published by Devolver Digital. It is available on Steam for the low price of $10. In Always Sometimes Monsters, you have just lost the love of your life and you have not payed the rent of the month to the landlord. The landlord takes your keys, leaving you homeless when you receieve an invitation that the love of your life is marrying another man. You decide to go and interfere, causing a series of events to occur as you try to get to the wedding by the end of the month.Story - For the ten minutes I was very confused. Then, the story began to unfold letting me know I had to get to this girl in x amount of days or else it's all over. I have actually never seen this type of story in a game, so I definitely found it quite interesting to go through. There were surprises at every turn that allowed the game to go into more depth and the story is definitely worth an honorable mention.Graphics  - As mentioned above, this is an RPG game, a 2D one at that. This game was created on the RPG Maker, but it excels in what the engine gives it with some very smooth looking character models and creative art for the buildings. Saying that, the graphical art is definitely not spectacular, but it definitely fits with the RPG style of the whole game, which is more than many developers can say.Controls - The controls do take some getting used to, but they are definitely not ""clunky"". The controls definitely could have been better, but they work and they work with little to no response time.Fun Factor - I was very eager to play on the game, actually staying up later in the night than any other game that has released this year, which definitely means something. The replayablity of this game is very high as you can pick different decisions and some have a big difference in the game, which is one of the things I enjoy the most about this game.Recap Negatives - The controls could have been better, but were overall good. The graphics are nothing special, yet it is an RPG, so take that into consideration.Final Score:  9/10			"

												It seems really great in the beginning but ends up disappointing in the end.The further you get into the game, the more depressing things you witness and are forced to do along with heavy repetition on your chosen jobs which are just boring repetitive tasks.Its pretty fun that you get to choose the main character and then your love interest but then the fun ends and you are warped into a game about making you feel like junk. Every moment you play its just about you either being a horrible person or others around you being scum of the earth. They throw you with all these political kinda views and horrors of society but not in a fun kinda way. More like a rapid slap to the face with no alternative solutions. You either take path A or path B....and both make you kinda feel guilty in the end.I managed to get through the whole thing to the end and....I can't really say the ending was a payoff at all.SPOILERS:Your choice is to let your romance be with their new lover and you end up on the streets as a failure....but if you take your romance back, their lover will end up on the streets as a failure. None of these options are enjoyable at all. Sure the first is the proper happy ending, but how can that be when your best friend has ended up on the streets as a vagabond to be gunned down.Everyone is bitter. Everyone is whiny. And everyone is a backstabber in this game. Heck, you are even forced to be one yourself. By the end of it, I felt kinda crummy.In all, I think its more of an ARTSY kinda game so people who like that kinda stuff will probably get a kick outta it. For me? It really has no re-play value and I didn't care for it.			"

												I honestly would not recommend this game. Also note that I was actually excited for this game before it was released. I'm going to do my best to avoid all spoilers.I love indie games, I'm a fan of retro graphics. I'm a huge fan of storytelling type games even if it has minimal gameplay. But this game has a very weak narrative that just doesn't make sense if you try to analyze any of it past the base level. All the 'twists' don't make sense. It feels forced and contrived at points. Also the moral choices feel about as subtle as a bat to the face over and over again. Most of the choices were extremely obvious, back away from this situation or somebody dies.  But the 'moral choice' was always much longer in terms of gameplay time which meant more boring 'minigames' and by the time I was halfway through I just wanted the game to end to see how the story finished. Also quite a few of the moral choices weren't obvious in terms of the game forcing you into the situation first and then asking you to reconsider. I'm already there man, and there was no dialogue to just say no from the start so might as well see how this plays out. I got pretty tired of half the music looping after about 15-30 seconds. It felt like any message they were trying to deliver was basically drowned out by all the archetypical stereotypical characters they presented in the game. Yes, they weren't trying to say 'all drugs are bad mmkay' but it felt that way. Yes, they weren't trying to say 'religion will set you free!' but it felt that way. The writing didn't express the author's intent as much as it did the characters moral values which were always extremely black and white. The authors definitely wanted a grey moral area but I felt it lacked the execution to do so. Ah well, I feel like the dev could make a promising sequel/game from what they've learned after making this game.			"

												Pros:  Didn't play long enough to find out.Cons:  Very strong language.Full disclosure:  I got this game in a bundle and literally played it for just a few minutes.  The strong language (several f-bombs within that short amount of time) turned me off real quick.  It's a shame, because the concept and story intrigued me; I wanted to try something new.  The dialogue was trying way to hard to sound ""edgy"" though.  If language bothers you, you'll want to skip this one.			"

												Приключенческая нарративная игра, сделанная на RPG Maker. Было много хайпа вокруг нее, и я повелся. Плюс название интересное, привлекательное.В итоге - ходишь по городу и ищешь, где продвинуть историю вперед. Постоянно находишься в состоянии ""Непонятно, что дальше делать"". Плюс, пытаешься выжить, зарабатывая деньги, выполняя нудную, неинтересную работу (играя в медлительные скучнейшие долгие мини-игры, это реально ад).В плане нарратива - мило. Но игровой процесс не доставляет удовольствия для таких, как я - у которых не так много времени на игры. Больше времени тратишь на то, чтобы разобраться в том, что делать, куда идти и т.д.			"

												Now if you're looking for an action shooter game or any of that stuff don't look here. This game has none of that but it doesnt mean its a bad game. This game is about the story and the decisions you make along it. It teaches you that you cant always be right but you can somehow always make the wrong decision. During the story you will meet many charactersthat you will learn about and interact with, all while conduct tasks for people trying to get to your loves wedding across the country.I have to admit I feel in love with this game, so my opinion may be biased. THis game is great because it shows you the highs and lows of life, p[ossibly to an extreme. Some apparent issues I found in the game is that at one point if you fail you have to spend days of repetive tasks. Also to you mlg players this game isnt hard, again its about story and such. This game has some replay valve because you can do different things for at least 4 playthroughs. Overall I love the game, I hate sappy love stories (im a guy btw) but this game is great and it really teaches you conquences without instantly telling you. Its all about the journey, not the destination. "

												So, right out of the gate -- no doubt, this game is sort of a hot mess.  There's typographical errors. (Of course, like the game points out, there's got to be at least a million words in this thing, so, the fact that less than a dozen got spelled wrong is not damnable.)Upsetting, plot-damaging bugs abound.  Nothing game breaking, but some sources of confusion and dismay.  (A testimony, perhaps, to the power of the game, which drives one to complete tasks, to witness the consequences of one's actions and really experience the result of their action.)As some have noted, the tone of the writing (dialogue, in particular) is occasionally sophomoric.  A fine description of it likened it to Kevin Smith - to which I would only add that while it bears a resemblance to Smith's fascination with blending the scatological and the emotional, the humane and the profane -- it also has a feel distinctly like Richard Linklater's existential slacker philosopher-poets.And yes, it offers a staggering array of choice in everything other than the main plot, which occasionally railroads you sharply and channels you in one, inexorable direction.  (One might note that the game never claimed to be a sandbox, and offers rather more narrative selection than any other RPG I'm aware of.)All that said, fresh from my second playthrough -- hot damn, if you can get past that, you're in for a real treat.  This is a complicated little machine, and the charm of it isn't in the polish, but in the fact that it is something new and fresh and original and kind of brilliant.  It is some supercharged mutant unleashed on the indie gaming public, and for people who can pick up it's wavelength, it's possibly going to spoil mainstream twitch-reflex gaming for you forever.There are some real feels that can be had playing through this thing if you give in to the immersion -- heightened, rather than than in spite of, the occasionally cumbersome interface.  Some of the mini-games had me holding my breath, or tense, concerned about the consequences.  Some of the more emotional moments evoked a powerful, visceral reaction.  One noteable moment of horrific violence involving a poorly secured satellite dish made me laugh out loud, torn between horror at what I had so casually done, delight at the response from the NPCs, and shock at this unexpected shift in tone and action.  And while the dialogue is occasionally a little clunky, the underlying narrative structure and overall outlook of the game was done by someone with a fine capacity for empathy and a more than uncommon understanding of the human condition.If anyone out there still has doubts about a videogame's capacity to be a storytelling medium or a work of art, point them at Always Sometimes Monsters, which in uniqueness and singularity of vision is surpassed, possibly, only by - maybe - a work of artisinal obsession like Dwarf Fortress.For you fans of post-modernism -- you are in for a treat and then some.Even if this game, in play, was a disaster, I would have given it a postive review for it's ambition and it's outlook.  A relief, then, to be able to endorse it even more full throttle than that -- this game is really playable, and despite a little bit of 'ugh, I have to play THIS level again?' lends itself well to more than one replay.  I'll probably let it cool down for a week or three, but I can see myself returning to it soon. I simply can't say enough good things about this game.  Thanks, Vagabond Dog, for an awesome experience.			"

												Coming from a background of someone that loves sim games, I honestly didn't know what to expect with Always Sometimes Monsters. In the beginning of the game, it felt really weird and I felt as though the game didn't know which genre it wanted to be. After getting past the introduction; however, that is where the real drama happens and I was pleasantly surprised by how great the quality of the narrative is.Basically, you are trying to get to the wedding of your ex in the next 30 days, but you are broke and have no family or any other means to help you get to where you need to go. Fufilling jobs, getting favors, and doing side missions, all the while keeping your stamina needs up are key to winning the game. There's also a choice system as well, and depending on your actions, you can change the ending of the game. Honestly, Always Sometimes Monsters felt as though I was binging a Netflix series. The game is just beautiful in terms of how immersive the storyline can be. I made myself the main character and my partner as the ex and things got real pretty quickly! Also, I have to give the creators a round of applause for allowing not only interracial relationships but also same sex relationships as well. Pros:+Excellent narrative with real customization options to make the story your own.+Game play that really keeps you on edge, clock ticking anxiety makes it exhilarating. +Mini-games are really fun and quite symbolic to life as well.+The soundtrack is really good! Very memorable soundtrack.Cons:- The choice sections come up really fast. I wish there was a delay or something before the choices come up, because there has been numerous occasions where I would hit the space bar to progress dialogue and accidentally make a choice that I didn't want to make!!! Please somehow fix that!Overall, I would most definitely reccomend Always Sometimes Monsters. I just finished the game and I'm still emotional at the ending I got. Definitely worth the time and money. It's like reading an interactive book. Highly, highly recommended! "

												Pretty good game, but with some hiccups along the way. The game does a great job of telling and interesting story. It is also great how it tackles multiple subjects and can skirt the line of right/wrong with a bunch of decisions. There are multiple paths to take and multiple different things to do to reach your goal. You really get invested in your character and feel like the decisions he makes are what you chose. With all that said there are some problems. Sometimes the game only gives you cut and dry decisions, even though there should be more. Some of the things don't make sense. Like how in one part you have to have the money in a casino to pay a debt beforehand, even though it is reasonable to be able to ask for some time to go get the money or win it. Also, how a casino owner can murder someone in their casino and that is normal. Both of those are both illogical and not possible, only done to force certain things the developers wanted. Also in regards to good or bad endings, I hate how games do this. In order to get a ""good"" ending, you have to do this long list of irrelevant things that don't actually have an effect on the choice. How would an ex suddenly decide she doesn't like you because you stole money at a part 3 towns ago that she has no idea about. There should be multiple different ways to get a certain conclusion, not one specific set of prechosen things that you didn't know you had to do early on that seemingly didn't matter in the slightest. So i think they dropped the ball bigtime there.Then there is dealing with money. For some reason you never make money, and it only seems like the game decided to do this to make life more unfair than it actually is. Rigging an election and you get a ""city funded credit card"" but it only has 200 dollars.....a mayor would pay you 2k or more for that. Also, selling a high level rock star electric guitar and only getting 200 dollars, once again doesn't make sense. Then the idea you need to eat every night and tons, it seems a little much. And suddenly out of the blue you need 5k to attend a wedding and 10k for a debt, when you literally get no money all game. Poor decision making by the game. It is dumb how there are basically 2 endings though, as the game could be much more ambiguous and allow for a multitude of changes. Also could have been more realistic as I said before. P.S. the boxing was terribly done and could have been reworked to make it actually work and make sense and be strategic. It is annoying how most of the game is literally just walking around and talking to people, more variation would have been nice. It also was unrealistic how you cannot eat from the fridge of someone's house who you are staying at when they tell you you can. Big mistake. The dialogue and choices were also a misstep in how they are utilized. You can press a button to make the dialogue move faster, but most of the time a choice suddnely pops up unwarranted and if you are on a conversation and you double hit skip, it will make a choice for you already on the dialogue box that is about to pop up. Since you never know when this is going to happen and the game does an absolutely terrible job of letting you know, or giving a break before a choice, you will commonly choose something already, and you can't undo it. This was the biggest flaw of the game and worst annoyance. All in all the game did captivate my attention and I enjoyed some of it, but they should have ultimately had more realistic ending that you could actually influence in many different ways. 6.5/10.

												After some 10 hours I beat Always sometimes monsters. It was definitely one of the more interesting games I've played but, ultimately, I felt its own gaminess was its downfall. The story pushes you thru a number of challenges, like getting evicted or needing to get to another city. I tried to play it realistically, putting myself in the shoes of the characters, but the suspension of disbelief was quickly broken by ridiculous video game quest trope. Cue having to win 4 boxing matches to get new tires for a car or casually hacking into a government computer to rig elections. The occasional horrible minigames are more of an annoying hindrance than a fitting part of the story. For a game that focuses on choice, it gives you none as far as the main goal goes. You spend 30 days trying to get to a wedding of an ex-girlfriend because... plot? It's never really explained until the end and the few flashbacks don't do much to make you want to win your old love back. It's even more awkward when several times the NPCs ask you why you are going through all this trouble to get there. Frankly... I had no idea. Because that's what the game tells me to do?I was also a bit disappointed with how the game evaluates all your choices. Towards the end, a character calls you out on all your ""evil deeds"" which kinda made me scratch my head. So I am a horrible person because I didnt smash a doctor's car to help a junkie ""friend"" I only met through a few skimpy lines of dialogue? Really? And the very final flash-forward scene literally depicted me as homeless and asking to be killed because I've become a monster... wtf? I've never harmed anyone, never stole, even helped a few people along the way. I can see this ending working for some choices, but it clearly backfired with my playthrough.Would i recommend it? If you are into these kind of narrative games, it is an interesting experience and good food for design thought. If not, well, you probably shouldn't be looking in this genre in the first place.			"

												A great story driven RPG game. However due to the limitation of RPG maker engine,the graphic and control is too simple. Moverover, the condition to get a happy ending for first time player is harsh, which makes the choice the player made in game oversimplified, insignificant and frustrated.			"

												I had a feeling that I would enjoy this game and was really excited when I started following it through its development.I was not disappointed in the least. Despite the fact that there was zero combat, it still kept me quite engaged - mainly because I was invested in the narrative.There were small things I could nitpick about it, like the mini-games you use the gain money are quite mind-numbing. However, that's pretty much all meaning jobs. So I understood what they were trying to capture there, but it was a tad too on the nose.At the end of the game, your choices are reflected very well in my opinion. There were some complaints about you, as the player, making the choice of others, but I was a little more forgiving of that. Needless to say, my ending was rather dark. It made me very sad because I've had to make those choices in my personal life and could relate to how brutal that can be.If you are interested in games with a decent narrative and don't mind the mini-games, I would highly suggest giving it a shot. It's not often a game makes you sit down and reflect on your own choices. A game that has the ability to do that has my recommendation.			"

												I recommend this game.  It's ... an 'experience'.  I can't say it falls into any ""usual"" categories.  It's definitely about choices and consequences.  Stellar story, whichever way you lead it.  Has a philosophical punch to it.  Good doses of humour.  Lots of 'Easter Eggs'.  Some humourous references that only Canadians will get :DYou can really do anything in this game.  You'll work at some very different jobs.  You'll pawn stuff.  You'll invest.  You'll steal and blackmail.  You'll fish.  You'll race cars.  You'll play casino games.  You'll masturbate in the shower....  that was a nice touch actually  :DThe best I can really say is it's an experience.  It's an experience whatever price they are asking... I don't think it's that much.  Get it.  Play it.  Smile and search your soul.			"

												Ehh, I kind of like this game, and at the same time I kind of don't. About halfway through I stopped really caring because of a few reasons.1. The game sets you up as a character who is perceived as hated by most everyone, yet is still wildly important (even outside of the scope of their own narrative) for some reason.2. You don't have to play to this character at all but the game will always act like you do.3. The plot's predictable, I knew about an hour in who the guy in the alley was going to turn out to be (though apparently it can turn out to be someone else in the good ending? Whatever.)Eventually I was just ""okay whatever I just want to get to the end"" and went all sociopath on a lot of things. Whoops, me rushing got some scumbag killed. How terrible. Oh no, I lost a blackjack. Time to save and reload, because you can do that in real life. It's just not believeable. I know the intention of the game isn't to be ""fun"" and I was fine with the tedious parts. I had more issue with trying to figure out how to progress the game at certain points, though. And the game seems way too eager to criticize you for choices when it doesn't give you all the options available. I like the overall concept of this game and it's certainly not bad but it mostly left me frustrated by the end of it.Though honestly I'm not sure how to even review this properly. It'll probably get a second playthrough at some point, since I think it merits it (a lot of stuff I didn't do from the sound of things...)			"

												This game broke my heart into tiny pieces and im feeling kinda depressed right know. In fact it is a painful game that gives you ultimate life lesson. A piece of work!﻿ I recommend it for everyone who wants a  a deep emotional and dark story where you have many different choices and endings. Do you want to be a good or a bad person? A good or a bad friend? Do you want to save a life of a person or let him die? For some of these i literally had to stop for a bit of time  to think about it and these decisions are really hard to make, like life is generally. And of course the game is also full of humour: Want to sell drugs or work in a weed farm? Want to meet the developers in this game ( meta duuuuuddeeee)? Or do you want to invest in sandwich shares? You can also put hundreds of packages into a van until you realise at the end that all this time was lost for nothing (srsly dont, just dont do it, i raged so hard). And if this didnt convince you, you can also masturbate under the shower and poop in the toilet :D Nahhhh but seriously this game is awesome, you need to buy it to understand what im talking about. Choice is an evaluation of cost and benefit. Circumstance dictates the evaluation. The choice to buy this was the right one to make.			"

Some people say it is an RPG, and I would agree, but it is also a very good Life Simulator. The way this game works is very good. It is all based off your choices, so it may cause you to rethink your own life choices. It hasen't yet with me because I make all the good choices in it, but I was tempted sometimes to not do that... ^_^ I haven't finished the game yet, but it is VERY good. Beautiful. Just beautiful. Buy this game if it goes on sale. It is worth it.			"

												I think for the first time in my life I've found a game in which I am surprised to find myself needing to forget that I am playing a game, and think like I am playing life.  I would find myself facing situations with this ""how can I get the most out of this?  What do I have to say to get the 'best' outcome?"" way of approaching it, and when I realised that I'd been playing shallow games for too long that it was holding me back from appreciating this game, I started doing just that. I remember having to work at a food processing plant several days in a row, non-stop,  in an effort to accrue enough money to do what I needed to do.  If I was the kind of person that the puddle-deep games that most kids play these days create, then I would have found it to be utterly boring.  Waking up, going to work, leaving work with a♥♥♥♥♥♥paycheck, going to sleep and repeating it all the next day and the next.  Boring, right?  Yes.. kind of, and that was such an okay thing to me when you realise what this game's all about. You could half♥♥♥♥♥it at work to get home sooner or sleep through half the day to 'skip' all the boring business, and you would indeed pay dearly for that in more ways than one.  But not payed dearly.			"

												Some games really work a good story line in it. This game was not one of them. The sheer amount of text early game just makes you lose any interest in the game. I just couldn't sit through any more of it which is funny considering I write a lot myself.Sorry, this game may be fairly fun but it really falls under the catagory 'you want it.' If you come in to this game for a quick bit of retro fun, you will be disappointed, you are in for a read and it isn't the most interesting stuff you have ever seen.It might be good, as you can see I just couldn't get in to it and got really bored really fast with no direction, just a wall of text and gave up pretty early. I wouldn't recommend it but maybe if you have more patience than me and want to give it a go however I would recommend youdo your research about it, both story line and videos before trying to give it a shot.

												Haven't finished this game, but i would say this game is somehow great.In short, it's great life-simulator with lots of drama and you're the one who make the story.But, with slow pacing, boring soundtrack and sometimes annoying gameplay (i think it just bad) are the bad points.Not bad game, but not reccomended for modern player or those who don't like indie games in general.

												You can be a girl named ""Blonde Lady"" and be married to a girl named ""Glasses Lady"" become succesfull...then become a homeless person that has to fight hobos for a mattress to sleep on next to a dumpster.You can also sell other peoples action figures for a hamburger to feed to a homeless dog and work at a night club where you can do a sh** job and they will be happy and pay you,..and if you wanted to they will let you into the bathroom when the guy is taking a dump.Not convinced why you should get the game yet? Well how about stealing baseball cards from an old lady's dead husband,peeping through the hole in someones door to see them get laid, and most importantly..pawn off all of your posessions to buy bacon so you can bribe your landlord to give the keys to your apartment back.Can be homeless lesbian hooker with no life other than poking pigeons at the local park.I rate the game 11 moldy hamburgers out of 10 hookers.

												I just finished my first playthrough finally, and I must admit there's a lot I want to say about this game, but I'm at a loss of what words would put this piece of art to justice. This is one of the best games I've played for a while, and I've played a lot recently. First of, you're not just a guy named Fred looking for his wife, Lisa and then the story goes on. You're not only creating the story; you also create the characters. Sure ""Peter Pimp"" and ""Cumdumpster"" were the first thing in my head at the moment, but nevertheless I chose them and their names so I did get a sentimental attachment to my two pixelated and homemade basturds. I played as Peter, trying to get my beloved Cumdumpster back after our messy break-up, and boy did I go through a lot of shet to go to her stupid wedding with my best friend from college in High School.It's easy to get lost in all the different choices, I usually always go for the doochebaq-choices because that's just how I play, but this game did the sneaky thing and added the grey-zone in which you had to ask yourself ""Is this actually the right choice? would I do this?"". There's a few parts of the game system that was flawed, like in the old Pokémon games for the GameBoy that most oldie's probably know about, it's easy to make up a save game right before you start betting all your money on the slotmachines, or in this 'ere case - the rock-paper-scissor people... Oh and also slu.. I mean slot-machines, if you're into that. Then just hit up the save right before you lost all your money and try again. I even felt it necessary at one point, up to the wedding.Some people would probably find core parts of the game tedious (to earn money you have to go through a lot of repetitive work) but I honestly found them to be an enjoyable part of the experience, because you connect to how your character feels bored or tired as he does this, and you follow how he/she is anxious when big events happens in his life. If you do not enjoy movies like The Butterfly Effect, you probably wouldn't like this game one bit. The graphics aren't a masterpiece in itself, and I suspect it's made with a not too complex engine like RPGMaker but the execution and time put into this is fairly visible. The story is breathtaking. 10/10 would play again at some point.			"

If I had my way, we'd round up all the homeless and drop them off on some far away island. They could build houses out of their own dung and forage for change down by the shore. They could even set up little shops where they exchange pickles and dirty moonshine for spare change. In time, they'd have their own thriving economy. Their sons and daughters would be brought up int he same way, they would evolve genes to become expert change hunters, sending people to the mainlands to collect change and malt liqour, fetching a high price at home in place of their dirty moonshine full of♥♥♥♥♥♥ Humanity could thrive if this all were to happen.

												    I am absolutley in love with this game, this is truly a game of moral choice and all the grey areas in between. You often finding yourself weighing whats right versus what will make you happy, and even then theres no promises it'll work out.      The game is surprisingly fun and addicting considering most of the game has you collecting money to pay your rent or buy a bus ticket, and watching the little numbers tick up and seeing my charecter do well felt really rewarding (104 boxes red! ONE-OH-FOUR!) Theres also a fair bit of replay value as the choices you make can completely alter your story, you'll definatly get your moneys worth if you like this sort of thing.     I really recommend this game to anyone who loves a good story thats not only funny, but hits you right in the feels with every choice you make.			"

												When someone says ""This game has tons of choices"" I usually scoff it off, as I've seen games with seemingly tons of choices, but lead absolutely nowhere. Mass Effect, Fallout 3, and others like it are all victim to having choice systems with no consequences. Always Sometimes Monsters nails the choice thing in spades.It's set up like an old-skool rpg, with a top down view. No need for a mouse on this game, so if you're a laptop gamer with no mouse, check this out. I don't want to spoil anything, but you play as a person (you choose the gender, in a rather unorthodox, but pretty cool way) attempting to stop their true love from marrying the wrong person. This game is amazing, but the only flaw is in the temp. agency jobs. You can work at a temp agency to make money, but it gets tedious FAST. It's a small part of the game, but it does make me get bored easily, however, the inventive story and thoughtful storytelling pretty much makes up for that small flaw.In short: choice is weighted, buy this game if you're a fan of old-skool RPG-style games with tons of meta-humour and pop-culture gags.

												Before I get into the review, I will try to spoil as little as poosible about the story. There will some MINOR SPOILERS, but I will mostly refer to the begining of the game, but ever so vague. Well, let us begin :)Story: You are a character that has his/her life is in shambles and loses his/her boyfriend/girlfriend after the prologue of the game. Soon enough, you recieve an invitation to your ex's wedding ceremony that will occur in 30 days. It is your job to go get your ex back. Or is it? Graphics: It's pixel art so what do you expect? Kidding aside, it suits the game quite nicely in my opinion. Music: I love the music so much. Many songs will repeat, but you will never get tired of it, at least I didn't.Gameplay: I did not say this before, but this game will not appeal to everyone because all you practically do is read. I see this game more as a Visual Novel rather than a game to be honest, but it is a really good one at that. There is a lot of text in the game, but with good reason. This game is all about choice. A lot of games that are out now have ""choices"" in them, but this has to be the best game to deliver choice thus far in my opinion (Yes I have played Mass Effect 1-3 and Witcher 1-2 and I love them both if that means anything). Every choice you make, whether it being in dialogue or in action, it carries weight. What I love even more are that these choices are very subtle. There is no moral meter, light/dark, or red/blue. All of the choices are grey and does not have a big sign showing ""Make big decision here!!"" There are also various minigames to play to break the reading which are actually quite fun. Pros:+Story+Music+Gameplay +CHOICESCons:-Gameplay (I put it here twice because there is a lot of reading, but it didn't bother me)In all, I had a great time playing the game. I believe that it was worth the $10 (got it for $9 though). The story is very engrossing and can sometimes give you the feels. In the end, we are Always Sometimes Monsters.If you read this far, thank you because this was my first review and I carried 100 boxes Vagabond!!!!			"

												I've been up all night playing this game! A lot of effort has been put into making the world immersive and interactive, with plenty of laughs throughout. I love the constant choices you  have to make, with the suspense of making a decision you might regret and the pride of fixing what you thought was a fiasco of choices.			"

												I have never written a game review before, but this game deserves one, so here we are. If you're put off buying this game because of its low price and the fact that it's the studio's first release - don't be. This game is absolutely fantastic in every single way. You end up becoming attached to your characters, and depending on the characters you choose the whole game just feels so much more emotional and intimate. Amazing story line, amazing soundtrack, amazing gameplay, amazing characters. Game of the year 2014.			"

												Always Sometimes Monsters Review: 


YouTube™ Video: Always Sometimes Monsters Review 

			Views: 3,858		

			Cosmic reviews indie RPG Always Sometimes Monsters developed by Vagabond Dog. Apologies for the quality, had issues with recording.		

Always sometimes monsters is an indie RPG designed around choice and consequence. It's designed so that players can take a great number of diverging paths through the story and choices will have lasting effects on the story.Though it is an RPG in some form, always sometimes monsters is not about galiantly slaying dragons to save a princess in a mystical land. It is in fact set in modern day life and has no combat. Yep thats right no combat, the game is about living through the eyes of your chosen character, living in his or her set of circumstances. Essenatially is a game about the modern human experience and all the trails that it entails.When the game starts, you are at a party for Larry who appear to work at a book publisher. You first take control of larry and can talk to the people in his apartment, depending on who you toast with, this will become your main character. Once selected you take control of the main character and head out onto the patio where depending on who you talk to will determine your other half and ultimately your sexuality. After this point the characters all toast with larry after he offers to sign you up to publish your book that is a work in progress.The game then skips to one year later and you find yourself in your run down apartment, broke, single and owing your landlord $500 rent which you must somehow find by the end of the day or risk eviction. Its clear early on that everything has gone horribly wrong for you so your first task is too not get evicted and so you head out to find some work. As the story progresses, you find out the reasons why your in the position your in now, why the love of your life left and some important meaningful twists along the way.The gameplay is limited in the game you have the ability to move and interact with objects thats it. There are various mini-games in the game that range from playing video games in the arcade to the processes involved in the various jobs you may encounter. Each day includes a morning, afternoon and night cycle. You will have limited time during the day to accomplish tasks, usually the time will progress after you have done a certain task for example should you go to a job in the morning, once you finish it will be afternoon. The day night cycle is also important for certain events, an example of this is if someone is meeting you at night, should you miss this appointment you won't get a second opportunity. The last major gameplay element is stamina, your character has a stamina bar that can be refilled with food and drink, it's important to keep your stamina up especially if you end up sleeping rough in the streets or you may not survive the night.The game can be very tedious at times, it can be frustrating and annoying. The limited gameplay and controls can take it's tolls, as can real life. While it is frustrating and tedious at times once your involved with the characters and story it becomes irrelevant. There's so much to experience in the game that the lack of gameplay and ultimately variety doesn't matter.The games content deals with multiple social, domestic and financial issues. Even right at the beginning of the game your tasting desperation. Love issues,  money issues, unemployment and more are right at the beginning of the game. The experience of the situations you come across in the game will resonate with you personally. Many people including myself have encountered many forms of desperation in life. Depending on your choice of character, race and sexuality in the game will also change things too. You will encounter racism, prejudice and more.			"

												When someone says ""This game has tons of choices"" I usually scoff it off, as I've seen games with seemingly tons of choices, but lead absolutely nowhere. Mass Effect, Fallout 3, and others like it are all victim to having choice systems with no consequences. Always Sometimes Monsters nails the choice thing in spades.It's set up like an old-skool rpg, with a top down view. No need for a mouse on this game, so if you're a laptop gamer with no mouse, check this out. I don't want to spoil anything, but you play as a person (you choose the gender, in a rather unorthodox, but pretty cool way) attempting to stop their true love from marrying the wrong person. This game is amazing, but the only flaw is in the temp. agency jobs. You can work at a temp agency to make money, but it gets tedious FAST. It's a small part of the game, but it does make me get bored easily, however, the inventive story and thoughtful storytelling pretty much makes up for that small flaw.In short: choice is weighted, buy this game if you're a fan of old-skool RPG-style games with tons of meta-humour and pop-culture gags.

												This game is amazing. After 90 mins of gameplay, this game asked me such a moral question that literally made me stop playing, exclaim ""wow"", and then spend the next 30 mins thinking about which of the two choices to pick as my answer. Not only that, but it sparked up a conversation between a few friends as to how to answer such a question.There's no right or wrong answer, but wow did it make me stop and think.12/10 stars. This game is brilliant.			"

A very strange, different type of RPG game.You're given a ton of different choices/outcomes in the game depending on how you respond and what you decide to do in a short time limit.The story begins by choosing who the main character (Hero) shall be and their love partner.One year later, your partner leaves you on your own to deal with paying bills and dept that you cannot afford, causing you to live randomly on the streets, scavange anything you can and do any job possible for little money.There's more walking around and dialogue than there is action and anything worth making the game playable.Think of Pokémon, with more vulgar language, little confrontations, and no battles (or Pokémon for that matter) whatsoever.The only positive thing about this game is the very neat soundtrack which you can purchase as DLC.Not my type of game, very interesting though.I gave it my best and but wasn't drawn in.3/10 "

												I'm not going to use fallacious arguments to discredit the game, or terms like ""pretentious"", ""trite"", ""preachy"" etc., which are only used by people who fail to get their point across, because they lack any real criticism.So, about the game...Haven't you always just wanted to go around telling people to go ♥♥♥♥ themselves to express your hatred against humanity, and see the consequences, but never had the balls to do it? Then this game is for you.On a more serious note, the only people who do not like this game are most likely creatonist, tea-sipping mental mongoloids who were offended by the profanity.It's a really enjoyable game, especially if you are a socially handicapped penguin who likes to distant themselves from reality and tends to avoid human contact.

												This game at first was a little slow, but as I kept playing and was forced to make decisions that effected my charactters I begun to question who I was as a person.  This game has a astrong enough story and effect to make me doubt my own beliefs and morality.  I had trouble justifying actions I had made in real life after this, if I got in to a college would I be knocking someone else out who needs it more?  It sounds cheesy to say this game changed me as a person, but if people can say a book did I have no problem saying this masterpiece of this game changed the way I think. After bawling for hours in both saddness and happiness I am proud to say this is easily the best game I have ever played.			"

												Always Sometimes Monsters is a fantastic, narritive-driven game where it feels like your decisions actually impact the story.  However, this feels like more of an adventure game than an RPG being that there is no actual character advancement.  The mini-games are subpar (but they are only mini-games, after all) - but they are, unfortunately, occasionally required.  In fact, a particular mini-game can bog down progression temporarily until you master it (or guess your way through it).  However, the actual story narritive is great, and you'll want to talk to every person you come across to uncover both humor and drama that are thickly spackled around the story of the actual protagonist - your protagonist.So many decisions littered so liberally throughout the game and several ways the game can end lend to a good amount of replayability - in fact, you'll probably find yourself playing the game repeatedly just to see what might happen if you choose to behave a different way, or assist different people.

												So this is a game that will take you on a fun adventure then make you quetion your own personal moral and ethical judgement on life lol. It is pretty deep and  very addicting, you very much begin to have an attachment to the character you choose and the people they connect with. If I would give it a comparison it is kinda like if the game Lisa and Earthbound had a child. Like Lisa there is a griddy dark kind of reality and resolute yet like Earthbound, it tries not to take it's self TOO seriously with some very witty and quirky writing, mini adventures with a rated M contemporary enviroment. This is one of those unique type fo games I think you will only see come around once in a blue moon so don't look this over.			"

												Never have I had a game that hit so many emotions. You cant help but fall in love with this simple game. Always Sometimes Monsters drives home the nature of being human. Falling in love, losing that love and making the ultimate sacrifice for the one you love. With a memorable supporting cast and many differant paths to travel, it will leave wanting more, or at the least look for a happoer solution. But, this game is far from a happy solution. Just like in life, your decisions will hurt someone. Even if you don't know who they hurt.			"

												So I just bough this game the other day. And I must admit it is very interesting. This game is heavily focused on story. I have seen so far one choice which can change the outcome of the story I could have either  Talked a character called Jack out of commiting suiced or talk to him and not be able to stop him from doing it. If he doesnt commit suicide you get a free bus ride :D  Overall this game is very good but there are some things that kinda I wish were implemented.In this game I found myslef lost at some points. Not knowing where to go what to do. Eventually something happend but it took a while to figure out what to do. Also there is no mute button for the music/soundfx's which I would like alot as I would like to have something of my playing in the background or no in game music so I can skype with friends.Overal this is a good game but feels empty at times. It would be better if there was a mute button though and the little box for a screen feels kinda odd to me.I would give this game 9.5/10 I really think a mute button should be a feature.This game is worth a buy.

												This game is a piece of art. Ever wonder how it feels like to be a woman? Give this game a go. Usually character choices in RPG's affect aesthetics, specifications and statistics, but not how game world and it's inhabitants treats you. This game puts ""RP"" back into the ""RPG"" genre, because your choices have the chance of ending the game prematurely. It's been awhile since I have played a game which felt alive, as opposed to making you feel like you are a gun-turret on rails or a mathematical certainty based on loot chance.   Further more, you never feel rushed in the game. It's one of those games that respects your time and is there to be experienced, not over-achieved, because life is a process, not a goal.			"

												****THIS REVIEW WILL HAVE MINOR SPOILERS*****TL;DR. Buy it, its good.Always Sometimes Monsters is all about choice. Will you be a nice guy/gal to everyone you meet, or will you steal  and cheat your way through? A basic plot synopsis would be you are a struggling writer who is kicked out of your apartment the day before you get a wedding invitation from your ex girl/boyfriend. You make it your mission to get to the wedding and jumpstart your career, but what you do along the way, and what happens when you get there, is up to you.It has a really cool intro in picking your character. You will talk to a bunch of people at a party, and whoever you choose to take a drink with is your character. The same idea goes for your love interest. It has a very Pokemon-esque or RPG Maker like art style, one that I quite enjoy. But it also has some very annoying mechanics. There is no mouse based support, all actions must be done through the keyboard. There is gamepad support, but I don't have one and therefore cannot comment on it. But to me a PC game where I can't use my mouse is really frustrating. Scaling the screen is also bugged right now. I could scale my screen down to a small resolution, but if I wanted it to go back, no amount of F6 would make it so unless I restarted. There are also typos and accidents galore in the text. For example, one time it called the same person a man and a woman, in the same line of dialogue.But this game has plenty of positives. The choices you make in this game are everywhere. You never know how important a choice is, but it is amazing how much choice you really have. It mostly does boil down to a simple Fate system similar to a Fable-like morality, but quite enjoyable none-the-less. This bonanza of choice also means a replay is almost necessary. I loved seeing the different results my second time through. On my first blind playthrough it took about 10 hours, and I have played through it twice so far, and have no plans to stop now, despite the problems. Music and the soundtrack were nothing to write home about, and there is only around 6-7 songs, little to no sound effects, and no voice acting at all.PROS AND CONS+ Choice. It is what this game is all about, and they did a great job with it. There is at least three endings, and almost assuredly more.+ Characters. While what you and your love interest look like is up to you, what you decide changes how people react to you. I was a lesbian couple in the first play and lots of people were uncomfortable with it in the game. Just a nice touch.- Mechanics. As already described, this game could absolutely use some more time in the oven and smoothing of some edges. Lots of typos, and annoying systems.OVERALL: 8/10. For only 9 or 10 dollars, this is a great pickup. But just be aware that at least as I am writing this, there are some problems that I hope get fixed. "

												Finished my first playthrough, and I have to say, I'm sad. This game made me hurt. Now that that's out of the way, on to the actual review.The game is split into several different towns that you move through on the way to win back your love. There is no tutorial, the game drops you into the world and immediately starts throwing punches, left and right. You get kicked out of your apartment and learn that your love is marrying someone else at the end of the month. The atmosphere of desperation is palpable as you struggle to rustle up enough cash for a bus ticket, though that's not the only way to get to San Verdano...In terms of actual gameplay, Always Sometimes Monsters doesn't really offer much. The job missions tend to be repetitive and tedious - whether or not this was an intentional choice I'm unsure, but it certainly reflects the boredom such tasks would inflict in real life! The side missions that actually provide a modicum of entertainment value cost money and generally provide no reward for their completion. These, however, pale in comparison to the most glaring flaw in the entire design: the boxing minigame. In order to take a high road, you must complete this four-part debacle - it took me five days. There is no way to definitely win any given boxing match, as it is essentially a six-piece rock-paper-sickle game and you have to guess what sort of punch or dodge your opponent is going to use. Foes have tendencies, but don't always stick to them, so you can still be KOed due to a random anomaly.These things aside, I was wrapped up in my journey across the country. The story pulled me in and made me feel for my character, tugging me further down the road - and here is where I found a flaw in the diamond, as it were: The journey felt so urgent and important that I hardly felt able to stop and look left or right. I often found myself with downtime between main quest missions, but side activities that didn't feel tedious and trite were difficult to find. The few times side missions were hinted, such as running into a frustrated woman at city hall and then again at the drug store, I couldn't figure out how to progess any further. The rest of the game felt bare-bones, without much content beyond the main quest.Despite how negative this review looks, I would recommend this game - for the price and the experience, this is a worthwhile investment. The ending offers the opportunity for flawless victory and crushing defeat, and sadly, for me, mine was crushing defeat. To play this game, I think you need to not view it as a game, and instead try to step into the shoes of your character. Emphasis on the RP in RPG.			"

												So this is a game that will take you on a fun adventure then make you quetion your own personal moral and ethical judgement on life lol. It is pretty deep and  very addicting, you very much begin to have an attachment to the character you choose and the people they connect with. If I would give it a comparison it is kinda like if the game Lisa and Earthbound had a child. Like Lisa there is a griddy dark kind of reality and resolute yet like Earthbound, it tries not to take it's self TOO seriously with some very witty and quirky writing, mini adventures with a rated M contemporary enviroment. This is one of those unique type fo games I think you will only see come around once in a blue moon so don't look this over.			"

												I love this game with all of my heart! It managed to make me attatched to the main trio that are thrown into the game (You, your lover, and your best friend aka Sam.) and even some side characters! It felt somewhat slow at times but at others I was often torn between choices. I warn you now if you play thins game and often make wrong choices this game WILL make you feel like crap. It really brings out the underbelly of reality, and how life is often unfair. Also how♥♥♥♥♥♥can hit the fan REALLY fast. Its such an open system that you can play this several times and stll get several endings (at least I pray there is, I've already started replaying). Its soooo good! I know for me personaly I felt like I was going through a life time of choices and my idea of right was slowly morphed over the course of the game. Its so quirky and cute yet at the same time a horrible horrible catch 22 so if your in for an intresting story and a good laugh (and possibly crying) buy this game for sure!			"

												If you like games where the main character isn't some happy go lucky guy or super soldier from the future then this game is for you. You are in control of a main character who isn't clear cut good or bad and the choices you make aren't always so simple to make. Do you ruin another person's life to save another person life? Do you object taking a reward or do you take more than what someone says you can take? Do you stab someone in the back to get ahead or let your own life crumble to make someone else happy? The game often asks those kind of questions and expects you to answer. If you can accept that not every story has a happy ending then you probably can embrace this game cause chances are you probably won't get the ""Good Ending"" on the first try but if you keep trying you should be able to. The story and the journey to find out how the end plays out are part of what makes this a good game and a different experience from other games out there.I like how the game allows you to choose the main character and love interest in a way that isn't as simple as click this box for male or this box for female. Also this game does allow you to have same sex couples too for those that don't want to play as the straight couple. I wish there was a way to customize your character but there are a few varieties to choose from. For some of the major characters you can see their motivations and see the reasoning behind some of the things they do for better or worse as the game goes.  Some of the games drawbacks are that there doesn't seem to be a run button(You will wish that you can run sometimes), the choices while sometimes in the grey area of right and wrong they don't always have positive or negative impacts on the world after the fact and don't make you like it mattered. Some of the choices do affect game though and in the end you have to answer for your choices and actions(Think last chapter of the Walking Dead videogame season 1) Some of the mini-games are fun and are nods to classic games(Like Frogger and Pac-Man)  however most of the jobs that you have do to earn cash are boring and repetive (I guess just like real life).For this price I feel the game is worth while and you will be playing this game for several hours to try get the good ending for you and your love. Just be prepared to know that people are always sometimes monsters.			"

												This, my friends, is an absolutely fantastic game. It's hard to talk about it without spoilering, I need to admit that, so I intend to keep it spoilerfree yet tell you ""enough"" about it. What do I pay for?What you get is a game made with the famous RPG-Maker - in whatever version. For those who don't know: That means the graphics are not highest standard. Though I have to say that this game has an amazing menu structure compared to what most RPG-Maker games have. It's not standard and you can see that the developers of the game put much, very much effort into it. They really tried to provide us, the players, with all necessary information and give us tough choices to make.It's the little thingsTalking to people. Usually if you speak with an NPC they have one line and repeat themselves constantly if you try talking to them again. Here they have a couple of lines they say - which is very refreshing! There's sidequests, LOADS of minigames - some of which I don't get but that's just me. Additionally to that, the characters have personality. They have a background. And most of the characters - mostly those for that you can do something - have an avatar. Now if you know RPG-Maker games, that usually means it's a little square with a face, right? Not here. Nope. They let artists help them and they did a splendid job! The characters have not the usual totally exaggerated facial expressions, they have a body. You usually get to see people from head to mid-thighs. That adds to the atmosphere of the game, absolutely.Oh. Right. And you can choose what gender you want to play and what gender your partner shall have. You can choose from about - what - ten people? Let's say ten for your main character and another ten for your partner!The main story It is a lovestory, yes. But the game doesn't define itself by the lovestory. It's all the choices that come across your way, all the possible ways to solve your problems and piling up more problems as you go. It's watching a character who grows close to you with which you identify over time getting past obstacles to find his/her way. I played the main story mostly and I've been very well entertained through it. I can't say there would've been a moment in which I felt bored in that game and that - for me - is something special.Something about the romance - don't read if you don't want to get spoilered at least a LITTLE: The romance felt a bit flat. The characters fell in love too quickly and the ending was pretty aprupt, I got to admit that. But it's not bad, because if you want to play a game where you go on dates and feed each other chocolate, play a dating simulator.Bottom lineLong story short? Buy the game. It's amazing, it's fun and I felt like I finally paid for a game again in a suitable amount for what I get from it. And I might add: I don't like to buy games at high prices (high beginning at >25€). You get minigames, you get a lovestory, you get choices to make, you get to think about consequences more - it's fun. Do it.			"

And you can choose what gender you want to play and what gender your partner shall have. You can choose from about - what - ten people? Let's say ten for your main character and another ten for your partner!The main story It is a lovestory, yes. But the game doesn't define itself by the lovestory. It's all the choices that come across your way, all the possible ways to solve your problems and piling up more problems as you go. It's watching a character who grows close to you with which you identify over time getting past obstacles to find his/her way. I played the main story mostly and I've been very well entertained through it. I can't say there would've been a moment in which I felt bored in that game and that - for me - is something special.Something about the romance - don't read if you don't want to get spoilered at least a LITTLE: The romance felt a bit flat. The characters fell in love too quickly and the ending was pretty aprupt, I got to admit that. But it's not bad, because if you want to play a game where you go on dates and feed each other chocolate, play a dating simulator.Bottom lineLong story short? Buy the game. It's amazing, it's fun and I felt like I finally paid for a game again in a suitable amount for what I get from it. And I might add: I don't like to buy games at high prices (high beginning at >25€). You get minigames, you get a lovestory, you get choices to make, you get to think about consequences more - it's fun. Do it.			"

												I'm a few hours into this game, and I haven't completed it yet. Just a little disclaimer about the review. [THIS REVIEW MIGHT CONTAIN SPOILERS]Basically, Always Sometimes Monsters puts you in the shoes of someone who is basically struggling to live above the poverty line after losing everything that made them truly happy - best friend, lover, job, all of it. Your job is to guide them through life and make choices for them that effect not only the life of your character, but the lives of those that surround your character as well. Because the game tries to reflect life itself, parts of it get tedious and boring. That said, this game is very ambitious, and it has a few little meta jokes, which I liked. Always Sometimes Monsters has no right or wrong choices - this is not a game about the black and white parts of life, but the grey. You make a choice believing it's the ""right"" one, but the next thing you know because you didn't make a different choice, the♥♥♥♥♥♥s hitting the fan. This is the kind of depressing existentialism you will find in this game - definitely NOT for everyone, but interesting and ambitious for a game nonetheless. The game's concept is great, the ability to choose not only your gender but also your race and sexuality is an ambitious feature rarely seen elsewhere, and it adds an element of circumstance creating situations where even if you make all the ""right"" choices (or what you believe to be the right choices), someone will still have something to say, and your avatar's path will still change. The game is able to evoke an emotion, which is a bonus. If a game can make me actually FEEL something, that's when I know it's really a great game. Just as with life, Always Sometimes Monsters has it's ups and downs. But nonetheless, it's a great game, and worth a shot, especially considering the price (10 dollars usually, but right now it's on sale for 7.50) You will get bored. You might get sad. You might want to give up entirely. But the game is clever, thought-provoking, and ambitious, and that might just make it worth it. If you think this is your kind of game, it probably is.			"

												I've heard, over the years, lots of complaints about choices in games. This game gives choices but never really makes them feel like they've really had an impact. This time, in this game, ""Always Sometimes Monsters"" Delivers tat impact. This will be the 2nd game I've 100% and still want to go back and see more. With many different ways to play the game, with even more choices. With the ability to follow the story or even forgo it this game is a marvel.When seeing the breaking of the fourth wall I instantly fell in love. This is a game that, at first, I figured wouldn't work. I mean a game where the main gameplay mechanic is choices and dialogue trees . . . but it works. It's a wondeful achievement and I cannot wait to see what these guys do next. One major issue I hadd with this game is f12, mostly used for screenshots in steam, is the game reset button. . . I really think, for a game made for steam, was a really foolish move. The other thing is in the endgame there is a no-clip bug. . . but those are my only two issues.			"

There are side quests, free roam, and of course, the power of choice.I have started a play through of this game if anybody wants to get a general look into it -

												A dude got killed because of swag and I avenged him.That aside, this is a really nice game and I recommend it. I really liked the mechanics--the hustling. I see the game as a moral playground: you're free to apply whatever morality and ethics you want in the safe environment of a fictional world, and see how that turns out. Of course the game gives you a goal, and there is where it gets itchy. The game assumes you care about the goal. I didn't, despite the various flashbacks. Nevertheless, I got the message clear.			"

												Only played a few hours so far, but damn. This. Is. Good.There's honestly little to say aside from that. ASM is an extremely well written and harrowing journey, filled with an immense number of choices and an engrossing storyline (even if a little cliche, its pulled off so far that it does not matter). The choices sometime leave you stuck between ""but I *need* the money so badly"" and ""but..... I can't do that"" and I think it shows the quality of this game so well that those choices can be presented, and be hard to make.I can see myself playing and replaying this for some time yet. Well worth the £7 price tag. And please, Vagabond dog, keep makeing games like this.			"

												I've certainly gotten my $9 worth from this game.  I've spent two days playing it and several hours thinking about it.  Much better value than the $13.50 I paid to see Godzilla.  Exploring is fun, all the choices are interesting, (I only wish there were more) and the subject matter gives your decisions a lot of weight.  I agonized over some of the things I had my character do in the game.  I'm already thinking about the choices I will make in my next playthrough.  There are frustrating moments, but they usually serve to advance the story.  Overall, if you want an RPG you can fall into for a few days and that will stay with you for awhile, Sometimes Always Monsters fits the bill.			"

												You're a lesbian writer living in an East L.A. city who gets kicked out of her apartment by Mr. Rodgers and you’re trying to stop the wedding of your ex so you end up selling dogs to a dogfighting ring and giving handjobs in the back of pet stores to afford an $800 bus ticket. You then play as a black man who looks like a young Forest Whitaker who doesn’t really do anything other than walk around and talk to rich people. Always Sometimes Monsters is a great example of the overbearing upper class fighting the liberal youth of the underprivileged children of the urban cities and if you are looking for a deep, complex social analysis of modern racial struggles I would recommend this game.

												I cannot recommend this game due to a bug that stops the game from launching. There are threads in disussion about how to fix this but it was more complicated in my case. I did finally get this running, but not due to any help from the devs. In addition this has been a known problem for over 2 years. The executable is triggering DEP, which is used by Windows to detect malicious code. In other words the coding is so poor that Windows is flagging the executable as unsafe and shutting it down. This is an RPG maker app, and I've played RPG Maker games that don't have this problem. It doesn't make sense that this has not been fixed and users are forced to resort to a lengthy workaround just to play the game.I'm leaving this review up regardless of my feelings of the actual game to try to encourage the devs to fix this. I can't get a refund through Steam (nor can I get that 1 hour of my life debugging back) so I feel like this is the only way I can pressure the devs into fixing this bug. Please, please fix this.

			LMG bringing you a review/gameplay from our first day in the game of Always Sometimes Monsters Story. Decided to start a let's play of this game because it is that awesome.		

This game so far has exceeded every expectation I had coming in. From the retro feel, to the moral choices, to you sitting there debating to yourself afraid of the consquences of your own actions. You'll never know what life is going to throw at you next. Finally a game that really does make choices matter in even your little, minor decisions. I think this little sleeper indie hit will win many awards for sure. Would highly encourage to get it while it's on sale.  "

												I love love LOVED this game. I honestly did feel like all the choices I made had some effect on the way it all played out and how characters viewed me. I would love to replay it and choose differently and try to get a better ending. But I think this games goes beyond that and truly makes you look at yourself and who you are and why you choose to live your life the way you do. And makes you ask yourself are we always sometimes monsters? Do we justify doing bad things cause they were for the right reason?Anyone who likes a good thought provoking story GET IT NOW!			"

												This game is quite interesting and definately made me laugh quite a few times! People may look at it in a negative sense. But it depends how you look at the game. What makes a game good? I think it's the fact that this game has so many options to choose from which gives it a lot of replay ability. This game made me do some pretty funny things. I gave a hobo a sandwhich. I recommend it, if you're the type of person into visual novels or like games with multiple choices and different endings. Overall in my book it's very fulfilling, so i'd say 10/10.			"

All the same, it's easy to tell, there's something special in this game, as the devs have put a lot of love into building a believable world filled with characters who say and do things that wouldn't be expected of sprites like these.It's a good game to snag, if you're looking for a story driven experience that provides surprises and lots of ""wtf?"" moments.Recommended.

												ASM is a great game fillede with a ridiculas amount of choice like who you choose to play as their sexual prefrence and their name all in a non tutorial way. This game will no spoon feed you and what you do can change what happens and the puzzles are not common but not easy to figure out. This game can make you do bad things and it will make you feel bad about them if you do. highly reccomended looking forward to everything this company makes in the future and if somehow the devs are reading this 101 boxes 101 god damn boxes.SPOILERS BELOW*spoilers* an example of a great series of choices is a man will invite you to his place which will lead to several choices which can save or kill a person which can get you out of the city but only if you handle a doctor in a certain way which will stop access to a vechle.

												This game caught my eye when I was searching for games similar to Life Is Strange.  It was only $3 or so, because there was a special for it.  I purchased that and the soundtrack together, thinking that it would be something decent.  I regret this purchase COMPLETELY.  This is one of the worst games I have played in my lifetime.  It was a huge waste of time.  Things were predictable, other stuff was blown out of proportion, and in reality you didn't get to make many choices/changes regarding your future.  The ending was horrible, and this game in general is horrible.  I would not suggest this to any of my friends or fellow gamers.			"

Revolves heavily around alcohol, promiscuous sex, drug use, murder and interracial relationships. Game has sex scenes of an old woman getting done from behind.  Terrible music.

												The whole concept of the game is very different so the main crowd of gamers today might not like this game its very niche. The reason I love it is because it is different. In a way if you play the game seriously and try to make choices based on what you would do in the situation it kinda analyzes you. Always Sometimes Monsters also adds in a lot of replayability because it is very open to how you shape the story. So people who are into more action and fast paced gameplay with defined enemies may not want to purchase this game because you will find none of that. In this game you are the enemy if you choose to be and so is life itself. For those who like that kind of stuff I highly suggest this game because it really is a breath of fresh air in this stale marketplace that is video games.			"

												Unlike most RPG's ASM takes place in the real world, dealing with more 'mundane' real world issues in more conventional ways. Instead of a story interspersed with combat sequences your main concern is simply gaining enough money to progress the storyline, paying off rent, getting money for a bus ticket, and things like that. Naturally the way to gain money is through work, and completing odd jobs throughout the game becomes its homologue to combat sequences and grinding found in other RPG's. Unfortunately the job aspect of this game is extremely tedious, although it doesn't take up a huge amount of the game seeing as it's the primary way to earn money I would've liked this process to be a bit more enjoyable. Luckily the work minigames are the only real portion of the game that disappoints. The story is refreshingly original, and tackles a lot of real world issues that were competently handled with a surprising amount of choice and consequence found in the games decisions, which can lead to several different endings. Morality is great here as well, with most of your choices leaning on the gray side of the morality scale.  The characters were well done but sadly the game is short,  so you don't get enough time to really care for the characters except for perhaps the protagonist.  I also enjoyed the soundtrack, which was better than what I expected for an RPG Maker game. The same can't be said for the graphics though, it IS an RPG Maker game after all, and it shows. Overall I'd definitely recommend this game for any RPG fan looking for an unconventional take on the genre, it's not perfect, and it leans on the short side (although it does boast a fair amount of replay value). What it does provide however is an interesting story that tackles tough real world issues with equally tough choices that actually matter, and that's a formula that inevitable leads to a great RPG.

												Always Sometimes Monsters is interesting. The choices you make have weight, and things can get out of control quickly if you make bad ones. The story is compelling, if not somewhat predictable in the path it takes, and the characters are interesting and make you care. The game has flaws though, several things that annoyed me throughout the game was the very small soundtrack, by the end you'll have heard every song in its entirety about 50 times. I would recommend playing on mute to be honest. Apart from that, and the slightly dodgey controls, it's pretty good.			"

												Always Sometimes Monsters...If there's one constant in life: There's always sometimes monsters. It's engraved into our beings and soaked deeply into our souls; our primalistic desire to fight for love, and do anything to get it. ASM portrays this beautifully, and in many lights.Down on your luck (and your money), you receive your final eviction notice. You're a broke author who never made it. How come? Early on your hustle for money, you receive a wedding invitation...from your ex. What? But you haven't heard from them in a year, and now this?So what do you do? You still love them, right? Of course! So now it's come down to this - 30 days to pick up the pieces of your life and get your♥♥♥♥♥back to them! But will you make it? Will you burn out on the way there? Will you die, lonely and destitute, as your life has become? Or will you make it, win your love back and maybe become the monster on the way? What will you do for the chance at their heart again?ASM is about forging your path back to the love of your life and more importantly, what you DID to get there. There are choices GALORE and many paths to follow. There's the distinct light / dark and all the in-betweens. Neat little minigames and collectibles and tons of engrossing dialogue. The music is also spot ON (big props to Laser Destroyer Team!) and definitely sets the mood for the scene at hand. I count it as one of my absolute favorite games I've ever played, and not just because it was a great game, but because of the impact it made on me. It left me with chills and in tears and... complete fulfillment. Hell, even I as I type this, I'm shedding a few tears...I simply can't recommend this game enough.			"

												If this game was solid through its entirety than I would recommend this purchase. Sadly, this game starts out strong only to leave you lacking and frustrated near the end. With how compelling the first two thirds of this game were, I didn't think I'd find myself so annoyed and eager to finish and get this game out of the way. ASM already gives you tedious mini-games and tasks, but that's all the end game ended up being. I don't even need to explain the boxing minigame to those who have already played. All in all this game had the potential to be something great, but for whatever reason took a sudden turn for the worse near the most climatic part of the game.			"

												I LOVE this game! I believe it is the perfect combination of mindless gaming and a deep story. I believe anyone is capable of loving this game and making it their own. If you like reality type games that allow you to choose your fate, you will simply adore this game and all of its possible endings! I got really into this one really fast.			"

												This game is fantastic. Customization is exactly as you would think it'd be (enter a name for an already made character) and the story is phenomenal. Every playthrough done is never the same as there are choices along the way that can affect the outcome of your game. This game has a way to make you feel bad about your decisions, even if you had the best intentions. I highly recommend for the story.			"

												This game is one of the most engaging and addicting I've played in a long time. The sense of choice and consequence, of defining who you are in the game world, of the unexpeccted chaos of life are all done exceedingly well up to par if not supperior to full counsel release rpgs. I'm 6 hours in and probably only half way but I'm still considering decisions made in the first hour. What storylines could have arisen from a different series of choices? Who could I have evolved into as a character would I be a better or worst person than I'm playing as now? If you love games with a slow paced but immersive story, roleplaying, and some heavy philisophical questions of how far you would go for love than this is a great game for you. Simple graphics and gamplay but as engaging as any mass effect or walking dead if you can really invest in the roleplay potential.			"

												Always Sometimes Monsters strived to provide an experience where the player was in control of their own destiny but unfortunately delivered an experience that fell short of its ambition. I wanted to like it, I really did, as those moments where the story shone through were truly great but they were so few and far between that the larger flaws of the gameplay and storyline are what leave a lasting impression. Your mileage may vary however, as many fellow reviewers have noted, but unfortunately for this writer Always Sometimes Monsters isn’t a game I can recommend.Read my full review here: http://www.therefinedgeek.com.au/index.php/2014/06/27/always-sometimes-monsters-lifes-a-♥♥♥♥♥/ "

												Looking back at the history of videogames I could risk to say that we have two fundamentally different types of game. These games can cover a variety of styles, but in essence they, on one side of the spectrum, ask from the player to take an active role, mechanically speaking, and on the other side of the spectrum, we have those that demand the user to be more emotionally involved being little demanding on aspects like hand/eye coordination. Of course the majority of videogames lie somewhere in-between these two extremes, but Always Sometimes Monsters (ASM) rests on the latter side, firmly.ASM is just a simple RPG. You won't have deep character customization or a complex combat system. In fact there's no character customization, and combat, apart from a point where you might have to do some boxing, is non existent.The game basically asks of you to eat and to get money for transport, just so that you can get to the end of your journey. But don'l let yourself be fouled, just like in our lives, what takes for a person to get such ""simple"" tasks done can be a source of infinite complexity. Especially if you'r trying to do this balancing on the line of poverty and, definitely, if you'r on a deadline for what can heal your broken heart and solve your financial problems.So, after one of the best designed character selection modes I've seen on any game, and after a clever introduction to your character(s), you are set in a reality where you are a failed writer, broke - close to eviction -, and with a broken heart. You now have 30 days to get to your ex-lover's wedding, to maybe get her/him back and, maybe, get your book deal going again.On your journey you'll have plenty of moral choices to make, how this choices impact on your game is hidden under an obscure Fate attribute (that you can only see at the save/load screen) that in fact seems to have very little impact on the story it self.So, what's really the point of basing a game on choice, if that choice has so little impact on the game outcome? Well, this will vary from person to person. Honestly, it can either brake the game for you or it can make the game. To me it worked absolutely brilliantly. Your path is a (meta)game that happens not just on the CPU, it happens inside you also. So although ""choice"" has no definite in-game impact, because you let that someone die, or blackmailed that other person, or whatever other silly or serious things marked your path, when you finally are confronted with what you wrote on your notes, you are led to get emotionally involved to your story. And from there, what follows managed to overflow from this basic RPG and connect me on a level where few games succeed. Still, an analogy can be made with the 1st season of the Walking Dead game. It really didn't mattered that all your choices had no definite impact on those tragic final moments, all that choices were there to place that meta-game aspect in you.On the technical side the game suffers from its use of the RPG Maker engine, be it graphically be it on the crippled mechanics. But can't say either that it looks awful. It has a classic, and intemporal, JRPG look. The character illustration actually pretty good.Must also give a special note to the sound-track. Not the best thing ever done, but really liked it. You can check it here. http://laserdestroyerteam.bandcamp.com/album/always-sometimes-monsters-lpAll in all, ASM is one of those games that gives you back what you put into it. If you'r lucky you can actually find here one of the good surprises of 2014.			"

												Review excerpted from http://www.gamesxtreme.com/article/4118/always-sometimes-monsters-review/ and used with permission. Please note full review contains spoilers.The thing about games with stories is that no matter how your play affects them, someone had to write every bit of it. The choices a game offers-- and their consequences-- say as much about it as the actual gameplay. However, using gameplay to present that story, to create atmosphere, and to immerse you in the scenario is critical to gaming as a narrative medium. Good writing can compensate for lackluster mechanics, while good gameplay can smooth over poor or nonsensical plotlines.For example, Spec Ops: The Line's mediocre gameplay helped lower the player's guard, lulling them into going with the flow during the early stages of the plot. Better mechanics would have made a better game, certainly; but its creators used what they had to enhance the story's power. Another is Papers, Please-- a monotony simulator. It's the most immersive game I've ever played. It pulls you into a rhythm, and the story, told in short, sharp shocks, is punctuation that draws you deeper. Whenever I play the game, my internal monologue is in a strange Boris Badenov accent for days after. Always Sometimes Monsters fails on virtually every level it attempts to engage on.It is made in the wrong engineHonestly, I don't have a problem with RPGMaker being used for commercial products in principle. But it's a hobbyist engine, and Vagabond Dog makes no interesting use of it. The times when it is used (such as for the abortive hunger system, or poorly-constructed minigames), it's bland enough to not even be worth comment. The style of story could have been better served by something like Ren'py, if they'd been willing to go full visual novel for this; after all, they have a few drawn scenes that are reasonably attractive. Twine would probably have been the ideal medium, however, as Vagabond Dog fancies itself as having a strong writing staff (spoilers: they don't), and the story could have been more effective in text alone.The visuals are bad. So, so badThe tile graphics are bland and amateurish, offering essentially no atmosphere (with the notable exception of a single room). It's strange, because at times there is visible effort-- for example, one late-game location is supposed to evoke a dying roadside town, but the repetitive tiles and lack of interesting set pieces make it more forgettable than it should be.The spritework is downright abysmal. As a general rule, they do not emote; with some isolated exceptions, it's possible to play the entire game and see only a gratuitous aiming-a-gun motion. Instead, when the script calls for a visual reaction, tiny emote bubbles pop up over characters' heads-- like a heart, or a music note, or anime-style sweat drops and vein-pops. This, frankly, has never looked good, and it's never wise to evoke visual stylings that were implemented as a cost-cutting measure in low-budget cartoons.One would expect, given the above, that character portraits used for dialogue would do some of the heavy visual lifting-- many story-driven games use them to great effect. These don't. While not aesthetically offensive, they're entirely static. When even the most emotional exchanges are done with the same unchanging monotony as ordering a burger at McDonald's, it's hard to take the whole thing seriously.Apparently there are six credited artists. Six.The sound design is not goodThe music doesn't help the mood. In a vacuum it might be pleasant enough to listen to, but the emotionless (if upbeat) background synth offers nothing to a scene. It also doesn't always loop properly, at times inserting a long, noticeable silence before restarting. Neither does Vagabond Dog seem to know what a music cue is; you'll never hear it used to enhance an emotional scene.Even the tiniest of sound effects would have been a huge improvement. As it is, their inclusion is exceedingly, ridiculously rare. The intrusive emote bubbles, for example, could have seemed a little less disconnected if they had them. Instead, the times that sound effects are used, they're for things like playing fart noises when you interact with a toilet.Male or female, straight or gay, black or white?Vagabond Dog really wants us to be talking about this, so let's. I really believe that if you can't do something right, you shouldn't do it at all. Always Sometimes Monsters does it wrong in ways I never imagined they would. But I'm getting ahead of myself; let's start with the good they've done. The game does capably display, at times, just how people will react differently-- consciously or no-- to, say, a person of colour, or a woman, rather than to the by-default straight white man. The first character I selected was a straight (ASM gives no attention to bisexual people) white woman, and in short order, a male character was making blatant passes at me that I'm sure another male wouldn't have gotten. While the scene swiftly lost any pretense of subtlety, it still wasn't that bad.Unfortunately, the longer the game drags on, the less likely it is that your starting choice matters. When it does matter, it's mostly just for the sorts of insults other characters direct at you. Ultimately, no matter what identity you selected, you are always the same character in the story. Your dialogue is the same, and the plot is the same. Your black trans lesbian has lived the same life, and reacts to plot events in the exact same way, as your cis white heterosexual man. This is madness.			"

												I tend to avoid games made in RPG Maker engine, mostly because of the annoying turn-based combat getting in the way of the actual story. I honestly do not care if the character had to kill all the chickens on the way to get to the end, especially since I had to waste so much time in random encounters with angry squirrels on the way.Always Sometimes Monsters thankfully doesn't have any of that nonsense, which means that the developers had more time to focus on the actual story. There are few minigames here and there, but those are pretty much optional maybe except for one that player will have to go through if they chose to do the things the hard (also more honest) way. Provided they will get to that point though. But more about that later.GameplayAs I mentioned earlier, the game was apparently made in an RPG Maker engine, I think it was RPG Maker VX Ace to be precise but apart from short mention on the forums, I didn't really do too much investigation about that. What I do know though is that the control scheme is your everyday RPG Maker-ish one. You move the character with cursor keys, you take actions and pass the dialogue with space or Enter (by the way you can't skip through the dialogue) keys you can speed up your walking with left shift key, and go to the menu with ESC key. There is no options menu so you can't rebind the keys to something ""more comfortable"" such as standard WASD scheme I would use since it'd allow me to play the game with one hand. But then again you don't really need mouse so having that hand on the cursor keys shouldn't be a problem. It's matter of personal preference more than anything else. The graphics is your everyday RPG Maker chibi style pixel-art kind of style, whole thing runs in a window which you can't resize, although you can turn it into fullscreen with a key if you want. Again it's up to personal preference. On top of roaming around talking with random people, you can also play some minigames that have similar control scheme. There is a time limit tied to the story which I feel is kinda standard to games like that. That brings me toStoryThis is where this game's main strength is coming from. Without spoiling too much it's about human relationships and choices one has to make on daily basis. At the beginning you get to chose your protagonist and their partner, all is good and well, everybody's happy and looking forward for what future brings. Then about a year later things got a bit bumpy - Your didn't get a dream job, you broke up with your partner, landlord is getting mad at you because you forgot to pay rent, and on top of that you get an invitation to from your ex who is getting married at the end of the month. From this point you take a long journey and it's up to you what steps you take and what choices you make along the way. Not every choice is easy to make and you'll often end up deciding between what is ""moral"" or what is ""lesser evil"" or flat out ""♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ move"". No matter what you choose, there will always be a consequence. Kind of a ""choose your own adventure"" kind of story which gives the game good replay value. You have 30 in-game days to get from where you are to the place where wedding should take place, and it's a long journey. Each day is split into three parts (Morning, Afternoon, Night) and it goes on as you complete each task such as having a conversation with key character, or taking a nap etc. On top of that you need to keep your character fed, because sleeping with empty stomach isn't very good idea needless to say that food costs money and you don't really have too much to spare which adds to kind of a desperate atmosphere.ConclusionSince this game is so heavily focused on the story and since it's made in RPG Maker, there'll be a lot of text for you to read. A looot of reading soIf you are expecting more action-focused adventure, get bored with long dialogues which you can't skip through, or don't like reading at all, well you might want to give this one a pass.If you're looking for a game where story actually matters to you at all, You might want to give Always Sometimes Monsters a shot.

A series of hard choices (some, perhaps a little contrived) showing a quite startling reflection of yourself and how your choices affect others - refreshing in today's world of good vs evil game choice.

I feel like this is the point of this game though. You travel through an average persons life on an unique and inspiring journey. There are slow points, and there are high points. There are happpy points and sad points. so is the journey of life, and so is this masterpiece of a game.

												Always Sometimes Monsters is a little game about choice.At nearly every turn the player is put in a situation in which they must make a decision, and live with the consequences. Though the game wil always guide you through the key points, how and why you get there vary with each playthrough.The game also likes to test your morality. There are many situations in which you must decide who to screw over, or whether you're going to play dirty.The game is fairly short, taking only a few hours to get through, but considering the sheer number of choices (and multiple endings) it has extreme replayability. The game also has a rather unique way to pick ones charcter, and allows for you to play either sex and orientation.While having only presently played through twice, I look forward to trying to hunt down all the hidden details and possible outcomes in hopes of getting that Happy Ending.If I had to give a rating, 'twould be 4.5/5.

												This game is almost a simulater of life from changes to Life and to Death and things you don't expect may happenand things you might wan't to cause don't happen. It's a game of a dice rolling with diferent outcomes coming to your computer. Even people my age ( Im 12 yes don't insult me) can get into this game without even trying to. And even if you don't like it buy it for friend buy it for someone who does care that isn't losing there minds in generic FPS games just trust me someone will appriecate this game that you know it's like listing to the chillest song ever with that chorus blasting out in the middle than catching you by the feet after a massive and somehow in depth rollercoaster ride of an unprepetual limbo that will still get you stuck in situation you won't know how to handle because you've never been in that situation itself.

												I usually do not write reviews but this is an exception. This game is really rich in its meaning to life. I would tell you some of my own philosophies of life but that would spoil the meaning of the game. Yes, sometimes choices are so hard to make but when you think you did the right thing, others walk away, heartless, and you suffer the consequence. Sometimes you would feel selfish but the world is a kill or be killed/eat or be eaten world. This game give you a taste of life and what it is to be human. Tbh I love the plot and you can expect everything to be an aspect of the human flaw. Though there were some surprising outcomes. This game has opened my mind about new philosophies. Spectacular game and plot! I love how the creator of this game decided to add life decisions and philosophies into this game! The creator did it well so that there isn't anything cheesy and predictable. Even though this game isn't a masterpiece in art, it is in story and in meaning and I agree with most of the philosophies in this game. It is true that people may be always sometimes monsters. We just hope we won't be a victim.I wish there was a sandbox mode. Sometimes I would get confused of where to go since every place is so big. But I like the place big. I give it 9.5/10			"

You wont play the same game twice which is fantastic in terms of replayability. Its also very immersive despite its humble graphics. a word of advice, name the character after yourself and the love interest of your love interest. it really gives you a different drive then if you were to name them something spontaneous. Hopefully youll learn alot about yourself and how far you would go to be with the person you love. Try this game and be open to it, thats what will give you the best experience.			"

												Surprisingly well written, I found the first three quarters of the game very enjoyable. The story offers you many different opportunities to shape the outcome of the story which is refreshingly deep for an indie game. You feel the pressure of your character's struggle throughout the story and every decision has a lasting effect which forces you to think of the consequences of your actions.Unfortunately the final quarter of the game seems to completely throw away the decisions made as every ending is extremely similar. Great journey, very disappointing finale.			"

												If this game was solid through its entirety than I would recommend this purchase. Sadly, this game starts out strong only to leave you lacking and frustrated near the end. With how compelling the first two thirds of this game were, I didn't think I'd find myself so annoyed and eager to finish and get this game out of the way. ASM already gives you tedious mini-games and tasks, but that's all the end game ended up being. I don't even need to explain the boxing minigame to those who have already played. All in all this game had the potential to be something great, but for whatever reason took a sudden turn for the worse near the most climatic part of the game.			"

												This game is fantastic. Customization is exactly as you would think it'd be (enter a name for an already made character) and the story is phenomenal. Every playthrough done is never the same as there are choices along the way that can affect the outcome of your game. This game has a way to make you feel bad about your decisions, even if you had the best intentions. I highly recommend for the story.			"

												This game has an idealistic storyline with events that make you have to question your morals, carefully balance out the pros and the cons, and in the end, you might not get your happy ending.But the ride is amazing, you'll feel yourself pulled into your charcter's storyline, you'll feel their heartbreaks and joys.Definitely worth buying and playing through at least once, twice if you realizie, like me, one choice could've meant the difference to getting the love of your life back, or winding up living under a bridge after giving away your last chance to save someone else's hide.

Centred around your journey across country, the people you meet and the things you decide to do. full of choices that have no right or wrong  answer. even though there was no right or wrong, i felt the weight of guilt more heavily when i dicked sombody over in this game than others.well worth the price, its an enjoyable and fun game.

												Always Sometimes Monsters strived to provide an experience where the player was in control of their own destiny but unfortunately delivered an experience that fell short of its ambition. I wanted to like it, I really did, as those moments where the story shone through were truly great but they were so few and far between that the larger flaws of the gameplay and storyline are what leave a lasting impression. Your mileage may vary however, as many fellow reviewers have noted, but unfortunately for this writer Always Sometimes Monsters isn’t a game I can recommend.Read my full review here: http://www.therefinedgeek.com.au/index.php/2014/06/27/always-sometimes-monsters-lifes-a-♥♥♥♥♥/ "

												Love this game! This game is so much fun =). The game is not perfect but it is still a super fun game. First of all I love the choice system. It feels like most choices effect what upcoming choices in the game. Some choices also change how the city quest will work completely. I love the music, though sometimes a little repetative if played right you will not have to live with the same song for long. Money in the game is hard too come by that I think is normal =P. Some people might find it cheating but I was able to keep around $200, with any extra in my bank. I would save then buy 40Scratch Cards. After Scratching them I would turn in all the winniers and if I was over $200 I would put the extra in my bank, save again and start over, If not over 200 I would just reset. I only found I needed too do this in the second town where I was a couple hundred short for the bus pass. Also I would take your time to get to where you need to go in the game. I didn't realize durning my first playthrough that my extra days left meant nothing and it just skipped too the last day =P. Had I known this I would have explored and spent more time in each town. Overall I love this game, It was a whole lot of fun, my first playthrough took roughly 10Hours. I don't know if I got a good ending or bad but I know I wish I had ended it differently. So Onto my second playthrough!			"

												It was an OKAY game. It just never felt like it lived up to it's promises of this big decision making RPG. You basically get to travel to 5 towns and make decisions in 4-8 different events that are all vaguely related.Events never felt like they hinged on your every decision. Even major decisions never felt like you accomplished much; at one point you are tasked with rigging an election (out of ♥♥♥♥ing nowhere, I know) where the outcome is essentially based off of a small series of ♥♥♥♥♥♥ mini-games that slow you down and a final press Red button for outcome/candidate A or Blue button for outcome/candidate B"". You never really give a♥♥♥♥♥♥about the town, you just follow the flow of the game and do as it says. You arrive in a town and rig an election in as little as 3 days and leave.Overall. you just never grow attached to things, you just make decisions like a casual observer that has no real investment in the characters. All your decisions are just means to the end and the feel hollow.			"

												Review excerpted from http://www.gamesxtreme.com/article/4118/always-sometimes-monsters-review/ and used with permission. Please note full review contains spoilers.The thing about games with stories is that no matter how your play affects them, someone had to write every bit of it. The choices a game offers-- and their consequences-- say as much about it as the actual gameplay. However, using gameplay to present that story, to create atmosphere, and to immerse you in the scenario is critical to gaming as a narrative medium. Good writing can compensate for lackluster mechanics, while good gameplay can smooth over poor or nonsensical plotlines.For example, Spec Ops: The Line's mediocre gameplay helped lower the player's guard, lulling them into going with the flow during the early stages of the plot. Better mechanics would have made a better game, certainly; but its creators used what they had to enhance the story's power. Another is Papers, Please-- a monotony simulator. It's the most immersive game I've ever played. It pulls you into a rhythm, and the story, told in short, sharp shocks, is punctuation that draws you deeper. Whenever I play the game, my internal monologue is in a strange Boris Badenov accent for days after. Always Sometimes Monsters fails on virtually every level it attempts to engage on.It is made in the wrong engineHonestly, I don't have a problem with RPGMaker being used for commercial products in principle. But it's a hobbyist engine, and Vagabond Dog makes no interesting use of it. The times when it is used (such as for the abortive hunger system, or poorly-constructed minigames), it's bland enough to not even be worth comment. The style of story could have been better served by something like Ren'py, if they'd been willing to go full visual novel for this; after all, they have a few drawn scenes that are reasonably attractive. Twine would probably have been the ideal medium, however, as Vagabond Dog fancies itself as having a strong writing staff (spoilers: they don't), and the story could have been more effective in text alone.The visuals are bad. So, so badThe tile graphics are bland and amateurish, offering essentially no atmosphere (with the notable exception of a single room). It's strange, because at times there is visible effort-- for example, one late-game location is supposed to evoke a dying roadside town, but the repetitive tiles and lack of interesting set pieces make it more forgettable than it should be.The spritework is downright abysmal. As a general rule, they do not emote; with some isolated exceptions, it's possible to play the entire game and see only a gratuitous aiming-a-gun motion. Instead, when the script calls for a visual reaction, tiny emote bubbles pop up over characters' heads-- like a heart, or a music note, or anime-style sweat drops and vein-pops. This, frankly, has never looked good, and it's never wise to evoke visual stylings that were implemented as a cost-cutting measure in low-budget cartoons.One would expect, given the above, that character portraits used for dialogue would do some of the heavy visual lifting-- many story-driven games use them to great effect. These don't. While not aesthetically offensive, they're entirely static. When even the most emotional exchanges are done with the same unchanging monotony as ordering a burger at McDonald's, it's hard to take the whole thing seriously.Apparently there are six credited artists. Six.The sound design is not goodThe music doesn't help the mood. In a vacuum it might be pleasant enough to listen to, but the emotionless (if upbeat) background synth offers nothing to a scene. It also doesn't always loop properly, at times inserting a long, noticeable silence before restarting. Neither does Vagabond Dog seem to know what a music cue is; you'll never hear it used to enhance an emotional scene.Even the tiniest of sound effects would have been a huge improvement. As it is, their inclusion is exceedingly, ridiculously rare. The intrusive emote bubbles, for example, could have seemed a little less disconnected if they had them. Instead, the times that sound effects are used, they're for things like playing fart noises when you interact with a toilet.Male or female, straight or gay, black or white?Vagabond Dog really wants us to be talking about this, so let's. I really believe that if you can't do something right, you shouldn't do it at all. Always Sometimes Monsters does it wrong in ways I never imagined they would. But I'm getting ahead of myself; let's start with the good they've done. The game does capably display, at times, just how people will react differently-- consciously or no-- to, say, a person of colour, or a woman, rather than to the by-default straight white man. The first character I selected was a straight (ASM gives no attention to bisexual people) white woman, and in short order, a male character was making blatant passes at me that I'm sure another male wouldn't have gotten. While the scene swiftly lost any pretense of subtlety, it still wasn't that bad.Unfortunately, the longer the game drags on, the less likely it is that your starting choice matters. When it does matter, it's mostly just for the sorts of insults other characters direct at you. Ultimately, no matter what identity you selected, you are always the same character in the story. Your dialogue is the same, and the plot is the same. Your black trans lesbian has lived the same life, and reacts to plot events in the exact same way, as your cis white heterosexual man. This is madness.			"

												FUN! Definitely reccomend for the 50% sale price!! Great choices that really do matter and put you in the quite the dilemma, but all the while without moral judgement. Great to see a game where your choices actually really matter (I'm still looking at you ME3!). My only major detraction is that it is probably better to save multiple times near the end in order to see all endings from one save file, as I'm not sure the endings alone warrant a replay. However the story itself will be very different - so if you can stomach it youll get at least 2 plays out of it.			"

												I like RPGs, and I find that the closer to real life it is --no magic, supernatural ghosties or demons or 'anime logic' plaguing it-- the more invested I am in it.Yadda yadda yadda, it was a fun game. You have no tutorial from the very start. If you've played a game of this type before, you can *assume* (and be correct) in that you move with arrow keys/WASD and confirm/prompt with Space/Enter, mouse not required. That's good!What I found confusing was the very first scene, which was essentially your sprite lobby in the form of a party. You choose which person to take a swig of alcohol with (being the unofficial straight edge person that I am it didn't feel right, but whatever, I'm still a child in an adult woman's body so I should suck it up to keep the game moving xP), and then choosing among the throng on the patio who your ""lover"" is. I didn't know this was how my avatar was chosen so I picked a cute-looking guy in a brown hoodie and once I realized I was picking my partner's avatar I just walked up to a nice intellectual with a blue sweater. Together, we were ALEX and MISCHA. And our love, for the long game time it was--and the fairly brief real time minutes it was--was beautiful. But I had to go and ♥♥♥♥ it up and now I'm pining for my babe as a deadbeat writer in a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ apartment.And that's where I start! In a rundown, bum-filled city with a day to procure $500 to pay rent because apparently I'm that irresponsible and that's only the first 10 minutes of the game! Freaking Adventure Quest up in this ♥♥♥♥♥!The little observations my character makes are a mixture of deadpan snark and actual emotion. When you pick a choice between being a complete ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ or actual decent human being or at times neutral, the dialogue corresponds with it. I find that in some RPGs your character is secretly aligned with a temperament already and if your choices go against that temperament that you have built up or is already in place, your choice is played out halfheartedly, which is lame. So what if I want to change my character's outlook half way through?! The puppy needs a home! I don't care if I robbed that game's safe of their start-up money two minutes prior, I'm a changed man/lady/sprite-thing!This game is a slice of life, find-your-own-way, make-ends-meet, there-are-quite-a-few-ways-you-can-go-about-this, but-don't-♥♥♥♥-it-up-too-hard-ya? RPG that I settled into almost immediately. The problem with ME, not the game, is that I'm so indecisive. I'm that person who has at least three fingers on different pages when reading Choose Your Own Adventure books (one joke from Family Guy comes to mind ""AAah! a dragon! Lois my finger was on the page! Do you see it Lois?! Do you see!"") so making big 'this or that' decisions in this game was nail-biting and I glanced at one of Steam's ""Perfect Ending"" guides just to see if I was heading in a relatively good direction on my own (I was, hurray for me!).I don't know about you, but games like these...I play as if this were real life because as delayed as I am in understanding social skills, I still recognize and understand that there is right and wrong to be followed. I played my character as close to my own personal tenants as possible and reeled in urges to steal as much as possible (I just love snapping up free things. It's a curse and a blessing) but I think what makes this game worthwhile is realizing that my decisions are--morally at least--the right ones and I'm a bit proud of myself for guiding my imaginary self through this gray concrete jungle to something hopefully better, filled with understanding, connections with old faces and new ones, and trying to set things right.And I recommend this game if you want to feel like I do. Realistic situations (at least from my limited perspective, ha), engaging characters that you actually care to read what they say (not entirely memorable, but I recall who they are when I see them appear time and again on my journey to that big sunset stretching across the highway or whatever I'm aiming for), and a little leeway for you to do a bit of what you want on the side while still keeping in mind that you're on a schedule as soon as you sign yourself up for some commitments and odd jobs. It really is like real life. Sort of. A fraction of real life.Oh, quick critique!I found that I was pressing the equivalent of the fast-forward button for text because I hate waiting for it to be spelled out and instead like it to be just all there for me to read at once and then continue; when I did I often pressed a choice that I didn't know was going to appear and made a few mistakes. Quite frustrating because I'm used to fast-forwarding, then after pressing ""continue"" the prompt comes up then. Just now I told a guy to ♥♥♥♥ himself. Why must the rudest choices be highlighted first!? Grrrr			"

												I love this game because of its cute graphics, flexible timeline type style and the fact that your never, for the most part, lost. Unless, you know, you don't read anything people tell you in there. I am someone who buys games I know that look good, graphics wise and I like based on watching people on Youtube play them as well as the flexibility in time line. so if I know any people like me who have similar tastes, I definitely recommend this to you. Even though your technically given only 30 in-game days to get through the whole game, there's no rush. There's no actual ""clock"" ticking down. It starts with morning, after your character wakes up, do something, then its afternoon. Do something. Then its night and you can't do much except sleep. So no rush is what I like.			"

The plot I feel resonates best with most 20+ year olds who have been broke / heartbroken at some point and provided a good escape for me.  I enjoyed all the meta and adult humor in it but I didn't like that the main character's life revolved around getting the main love interest back.  It would've been nice to have an ending where the main character realizes they are fine on their own or finds love along the way with someone else.			"

												This game is easily one of the best games I've ever played. It shot right into my top ten after my second playthrough. Dead serious.This game is just brilliant. The dialog is beautiful and grounded, and the situations you find yourself in are both harsh and powerful. A few minor bits, like being bribed during a journalism job, don't match up, but how you handle those situations can still bring completely unexpected outcomes.But the real brilliant thing here is how choice is handled. This isn't like a visual novel; there's one set path the game has, and two endings that can result. However, everything else depends on what you do, and there is an incredible amount of weight to each choice you make. I don't mean your own monotary gain; that can be a factor, but not the main factor. The real factor is if you can live with yourself after what you do; do you take the harder route and try to do the right thing, or do you take a shortcut or endulge in something? Will that affect a character you've grown attached to? How will selfish or selfless actions affect others? Does the ""right"" choice always have the positive outcome?This is a game where choices can be minor and insignifficant, like many in real life, or life changing for either you or the person lucky or unlucky enough to come across you. My first playthrough as as the nicest guy imaginable, and it lead me to doing something surprisingly despicable. However, as I played as a harsher character, situations I handled with peaceful outcomes before suddenly turned in a way I never expected and left a clump in my throat.The line between good and evil is paper thin, and this game brilliantly gets that, all while showing beauty and complexity in nearly every character. This game really deserves two playthroughs so you can see sides to characters you never saw before. The writing is amazing, the characters are all memorable, even the most minor, and the limited mechanics and graphics can all be forgiven by just how much is gotten right here.Only complaint; Memes and references seep in at a few points. They don't ruin the game, but it dates it a tad. Other than that, play this game.			"

												If given four words to describe the contents of Always Sometimes Monsters, they would all happen to begin with the letter 'C':  Coincidence, circumstance, choice, and consequence.  Unfortunately, if I were to give a letter grade to the overall game and my experience, I would have to be quite forgiving to remain using the letter 'C'.A ""life simulator"" if you will, this is a game that plants you into a world where your hopes and dreams haven't proceeded as planned.  In a time where it has become a struggle to earn enough money to pay for food or keep a roof over your head, you find yourself invited to a wedding in a distant city.  You are tasked to find your way there within a month's time, and along the road many scenarios and options are presented to tailor your experience in exactly how you will (or will not) achieve your goal.The freedom of choice is apparent upon starting the game and persists throughout to an extent.  Sacrifice to help a friend or be selfish?  Take sides with party X or organization Y?  Take the high road or the low?  Many situations might give you pause to stop and consider your choices before committing.  Do you want to retain moral character or will the means justify the ends?  All of it is left to you as the player and will ultimately decide your fate.In the end, however, I was left rather unsatistfied with the game as a whole.  I felt as though my personal choices led to the same general path I might have ended up at had I gone the opposite direction.  Sure, one or two characters would have had different opinions of who I was in the end, maybe they'd be there in the final scene or maybe not.  But what impact did I have on the world?  ...Very little, it seems.  I chose to go with more of an upstanding citizen and aide (though not in EVERY scenario, hence the appropriate title), and as a result the choices seemed rote.  As a game that asks you to make difficult decisions, there was never a moment where I felt like I NEEDED to break out of the role I had chosen.  It felt no different to a Mass Effect game: if you play a paragon character, you make paragon choices in just about every situation.  Therefore, for a game all about choices and consequences, Always Sometimes Monsters rarely presented anything that felt meaningful.  As for the ""game"" part of the game, it's pretty messy and rarely flows well.  Conversations are held up and constantly prolonged with bubbles floating above characters' heads displaying elipses or hearts or exclamation points, none of which can be hurried with button presses or disabled in the options.  Just as disrupting is a big clock that pops up and remains on screen for at least a full five seconds whenever each ""stage"" of the day transitions from one to the next.And the mini-games.  OH, the mini-games.  Some exist to reward you in the form of money or key items.  Some are there just to spice up the world and give you something else to do off the beaten path.  However, ALL of them are rather monotonous, if not downright frustrating from time to time.  Need to puzzle out a mini-game over five or ten minutes for some cash once, that's okay.  Need to repeat that same puzzle a dozen times with hardly any variables changing, each lasting the same five to ten minutes?  It's boring and tedious.  I spent twelve hours in the game, and I would have been much more satisfied with the experience if it were cut in half.  ...At a bare minimum.  And when a mini-game causes you to savescum a few dozen times, there's something wrong.  This is a piece of work that asks you to consider your choices and their consequences, so its aim has gone awry when you're in a postion where you find yourself quitting and reloading to go back to previous saves.Due to the nature of how this game plays with its choices, I know that I missed a lot of content by making the decisions I did.  There's a lot left to see and experience.  Normally I'd be gung ho to get right back into it to see everything I could.  ...But not with Always Sometimes Monsters.  I didn't finish it excitedly to see what ending might unfold; I finished it over a few play sessions, each start more and more begrudgingly, only to get it done and out of the way.  I was not invested in my character or the world or the emotions it tried (and failed) to stir within me.  I was only pushing buttons to see what the game had to offer, and in the end I wasn't all that interested, surprised, or all that enthralled.  For a ""cerebral"" game that wanted me to think or care, it failed with me.   It doesn't stand up to similar ""head space"" games.  Gone Home made me curious and sympathetic.  To The Moon gave me wonder, tugged at my heart, and literally brought me to tears of joy and sadness simultaneously.  ...Always Sometimes Monsters far too often made me slump in my chair, toss back my head and roll my eyes, and caused me to breathe out grunts of annoyance and exasperation. Thus, I can't recommend it.  Sorry, Vagabond Dogs.  I wanted to like it.  It just didn't do it for me.			"

												Amazing game!It's a very dramatic and emotional kind of game. The money I spent on getting this game was worth every dollar.Almost Sometimes Monsters revolves around  you , or your character. You are faced with many choices that are obvious and hidden. The game touched some very sensitive issues which is really unique and sometimes confronting.Almost Sometimes Monsters focus on the bad side, the flaws of the world, so don't expect the typical happily ever after or kiss in the sunset. When I played the game, I knew there were some really disturbing scenes, but I didn't think that it would make me really uncomfortable, whilst playing the game I felt that I grew closer to the characters, the situations, the consequences.My favourite part of the game is not the tragedy, but the freedom and the many paths you could take. It's like playing a game made by Telltale Games mixed with Rockstar games. I played this game without getting any NPCs killed...I think...Actually there's this one jerk who really ticked me off, but I regretted it afterwards.If you like RPGs, drama, violence, and tragedy then this is the game for you! I can't wait for a new game (hopefully not disappointing) from you Vagabond Dogs! ♥  "

												I'm not sure how to really start reviewing this game...It's riddled with mini-games, some better than others (I really hated the boxing, I'll just say that) but overall, this is not what this game is about.Always Sometimes Monsters is a decision-simulator; you screwed up your life, your ex invites you to his/her wedding, and you try and get there.You make decisions. Some good, some bad. You never know. Not until your first playthrough.Because this is a game that requires multiple playthroughs to really ""grasp"" it, and see all of its endings.But I guess that's kind of the point. You can play as a character with which you recognize yourself, that you can play as yourself really. It's part relationship simulator, so you can have straight/gay relationships no problem, part eNovel.And the game can be emotionally hard. Myself, I took a decision at the end which resonated with my own personal history and decisions in the past. And I did have a tightening of my heart. Because I recalled that moment and it made me actually tear up a bit.But then, the elation that comes with knowing that, right now, I'm good.The more I think about it, the more I feel it's an introspection simulator. You get from the game what you put into it. You can be good or you can be bad. The choice is definitely yours. Just like in real life.And as you play, especially on the first playthrough, you'll take decisions... which later on, you might regret taking. Or you may not, especially if you want to know what happens in the storyline if you take a decision instead of another.Bottom line is, I am not sure how to review this game.I can definitely recomment this game, that's a given.But I'm not sure how to describe it or how to review it.Other than ""it's worth the money"", I don't know what else to say...

												One word. Choice. This game is all about choice. Although it would be pretty difficult to explain the whole game to you, I do reccomend this wonderful game. Whether you return a lost dog to its owner or sell it at a dog fighting arena is one of the many examples I could give you. Although I love this game and think all of you should get it, the choice is yours to make whether you like it or not. Thank you for reading this review.			"

												The story was actually quite interesting about your journey on trying to get the love of your life back but then towards the ending it was alright. I guess it's cause the ending was a ""forever on-going ending"" where you're just stuck in the house.There were so many different choices you can make to lead you onto the next city and I'd say those were the best parts since I've stolen so many things from little kids to old people and then I even killed some.

												Don't buy it.Just like all other story games I've ever played, the choices you carefully/purpously make to define who you want your character to be mean absolutly nothing in the main ending story sequence. Some choises you don't really get to make, or only get back out of latter, after the inital decision was made for you. The only good ending is the one you can get about 1 min into the game. It is the most belivable and sound decision you can possibly make in the game. There is no gameplay, and 1 main mechanic that is absolutly pointless eccept to make you wast your money, and no I'm not refurning to gambling.It could have been good if your character choices mattered, but they don't.

												Cash farming chores and uninteresting stor and dialogs  wraped up in pseudo ""moral dilemma, psychological adventure"" advertising. If You see indie game with no pressure on graphics and fireworks You would expect something extra in terms of gameplay or story or any kind of interesting experience - not in this case.Let me point it out why:gameplay - non-existent, unless You consider embarrasing pointless mini-games and tedious cash farming which is necessary for game progress a gameplay (then here you go there's plenty)story - maybe would be bearable with decent story-telling but here You have tons of uninspired dialogs which You will probably start click away at some point just to move on. What's imprtant You don't have real impact on what's going on You can only select which cash farming BS section You want to takewhole game concept - It supposed to be (as I understand) about non-hero who struggles to recover his life. Choosing in the process if there are some borders he won't cross to achieve that. Problem is You can't do any meaningful decisions and crucial characters are so unintersting that You don't really care what happens to them through the whole game.You want moral dilemmas and story impact - play the Witcher - at least You get fun gameplay and good graphics with it.

												My overall opinion: A pretty good game, it won't be liked by some people but I gotta say the story and the choices you make/say really did feel like a real choice and the ending wasn't set in stone and there are quite a few ways your journey may end earlier or differently(WARNING! THERE ARE SOME HINTED SPOILERS!)(This Is Just My Own Personal Opinion And How I Felt The Game Was To Me And You Might Feel Different To My Point Of View So Please Be Nice Kay? =)It wasn't a game where you can just get the best ending by just rushing to the end and picking the right dialog, it was focused on choices and life decisions that can cause your own story to end suddenly by taking the wrong turn in life. There are some flaws that I felt made the game feel annoying at some points like the boxing minigame or earning enough income in a short time open up another dialog option later in the story but without knowing all this beforehand you'll be left with just one thing, your own personal choice. (and this is without being a cheat and reading a how-to guide!)The epilogue felt open ended and you cannot revisit the previous town/cities to check up on how they are all doing and your main love interest (if you choose to persue it) simply locks him/herself in a room and you end up having a limit set of options you could do.I truely wished there was abit more to the story in the epilogue, I kinda felt cheated after going through everything just to have my main love interest lock him/herself in so I cannot see or talk to him/her and having it end just like that because I felt there could be abit more story between the main character and the love interest rather than relying mostly on flashback/dreams and maybe having them go together to revisit the town/cities the main character have gone to and see where it goes from there.Heres hoping for dlc or a sequel! but I doubt they'd do that, happens too often~ =P Anyways, this is a good game in which I will play again to see what else it has to offer and the main theme of the game is probably the choice in life and maybe something else =P , I hope you enjoy it if you do buy the game, its total recommended game to get!

												Always Sometimes Monsters is a great little game about the choices you have to make and owning up to your mistakes. There are a few typos and lazily programmed bits and bobs in later areas of the game, so hopefully the two creators practise what they preach and patch it at some point. Other than that, it's very funny, pokes fun at itself, knows what it is, and has great replayability.			"

												Probably one of the best games I've ever played. I enjoyed every bit of the game, truly, but here are the key parts.The first thing that I instantly noticed was how well the introduction was created. The first scene was a little bit bewildering and confusing since I had no idea what was happening. The first scene took only like three minutes, and that's when the magic began. The way the character and the lover were chosen and introduced was clever. Whereas most games have the character creation not really tied to the story or it's just there at the beginning related to nothing *looks at the Elder Scrolls IV* the character creation really made you feel like a part of the story right off the bat. One of my favourite bits was that you can choose anyone to be your character and you can choose anyone to be the significant others, and whom you choose doesn't have a whole bunch of effects. Sure, there might be a few gay innuendos from the friendly neighbour or some racist butt faces being racist against you and your *black friend (his boss)*, but there isn't anyone saying it's wrong.Because that's not what this game is about.As the developers have stated, the game doesn't care. It doesn't care if you decide to sell the dog to be a police dog, a fight pit dog, or return it back to the owner. The charm about this game is that it's not up to the game to make you content with what you do. There isn't anybody patting you on the back for doing the right thing (something that doesn't exist in this game, as you'll see) or someone telling you that you're a screw up if you do the evil thing (also doesn't really exist), it's practically only you who will be the judge of you. If you feel like you did the wrong thing, then you did the wrong thing. The game doesn't care, and it most likely won't impact you. If you feel like you did the right thing, then you did the right thing. Again, the game doesn't care.What really makes this game great is what I said before: it's special to you because you make it special. It's just you doing the things in the game, with very little forced upon you. You can take that screwdriver and pawn it off simply because you're short on cash. Whoever owned the screwdriver might be mad, but you don't see it, it doesn't effect you negatively. You benefit, he loses. Or you might decide to not accept the bribe. You lose some, others gain some. It's take or pull, but it's what you make of it. Have fun.			"

												This game is okay. Right now, it's on sale, which is when I decided to pick it up. Paying $10 for an RPG maker game with no replay value seems very silly, so I got it for $5 instead. It's a fun game, however your game is going to spent with tedious mini games, trying to earn as much  money as you can just for a good ending. I had no idea, so I'm stuck gambling. I recommend using more than one save file. I dislike the autosave feature. I also dislike that there's no option to turn off music (I looked, or maybe I just missed it.) So be prepared to have your own back ground soundtrack ready because the music is loud and obnoxious when you'd rather have something soothing or quiet. Not much changes depending on your gender or sexual orientation, though I like that you at least have the option to be a man or woman and gay or straight. That's cool with me! I think it's a good game to play once, but like I said before-- it has no replay value. I wouldn't recommend paying full price for it.			"

												No, I did not click ""Not Recommended"" because it's an RPG Maker game. There's a few good ones if you look around, and Always Sometimes Monsters might be one of those. Unfortunately, the game is incredibly boring. Sure, it's got depth and it might tell an interesting story, but I could not get hooked. I was loathing going any further because the dialogue was so drawn out and it felt like it was going to take forever to get anywhere. Nothing was memorable; the art wasn't, the music wasn't, the characters weren't, the story wasn't, and the self-jokes from the developers certainly weren't.

												I really loved this game, though the possible endings were kind of disappointing. It was mostly a game about the journey, though.I especially loved the subtle way it dealt with issues like sexism, racism, homophobia, etc. through dialogue that was intentionally inserted to make you cringe. It was also very diverse in terms of who you wanted your player character to be and who you wanted them to date. You can play a straight character or a gay/lesbian one, and get into a bisexual threesome with a couple if you want to.And I've never felt so guilty as when I took the job slaughtering pigs. The way the poor little pixellated piggies look directly at you right before they're killed - so sad! :( I stuck to tofu after that, even though it wasn't as profitable. And did anyone else see the sly Monsanto reference in the seed-planting job?Oh, and the soundtrack was AWESOME. <3I'll definitely be replaying this.			"

												Always Sometimes Monsters is an intriguing game where your decisions impact the narrative. While not an entirely new concept, this game manages to keep things interesting most of the time. Gameplay The gameplay in Always Sometimes Monsters is primarily about making choices. In the beginning of the game, you choose your character by deciding who to toast with at a party, and then choose your love interest by going to the balcony and talking with one of the many characters. It makes character selection more interesting than just picking from a menu. Also, you are able to choose from a diverse group of male/female characters and can choose to be either heterosexual or homosexual.There is an in-game clock of sorts that breaks the day up into 3 parts - morning, afternoon, and night. You can do one job/event per time of day, and some tasks require a certain time of day. After completing the task, that part of the day is automatically over. This is where making choices comes into play. You have to decide what you are going to do for each segment of the day, and the choices you make during those jobs and events affect the way the story unfolds. You have 30 in-game days to reach a particular destination (I won't spoil what that is, since it is a major part of the story).There are some mini-games as well, but to be honest, they were not too interesting to me. I tried each one once or twice, but I did not have the desire to revisit them. Lastly, there are optional figures to collect that feature characters from various indie games, though I'm not sure if they serve a purpose other than to be collected for fun (they can be sold to the pawn shop for a little extra money, but I preferred to keep them in my collection). Story I won't spoil anything, but the actual game starts one year after the party I mentioned previously where you select your character. You are basically trying to get your life back on track. There are several main areas in the game, and each has its own story and set of quests you will need to do in order to make it to the next area. This is unfortunately where the game is hit-or-miss, since it is a story-driven game. Some characters and events are intriguing, while others just simply are not (at least in my opinion). However, keep in mind that I only played through the game once, so my choices may not have led to all of the most interesting events.Dialogue is good about 70% of the time, but the rest of it is not quite at the same level of quality. It feels like certain parts are trying to be very mature, but they don't always quite hit the mark. It's not terrible by any means, but just something I wanted to point out. There are also some spelling and grammar mistakes that I encountered on more than a few occasions. It's not a deal-breaker, but those kinds of mistakes sometimes took me out of the moment. I understand that this is an indie game and it's not easy to find every little mistake during the development process, though. Sound The songs are pretty cool for the most part - simple yet catchy electronic music. Be aware that there are some songs that got annoying after a while, but only if I was in a particular area for an extended period of time. If you really love that type of music, you may not find it to be too annoying. I just felt like there was a lack of variety. The sound effects were fine and I have no complaints about them. Conclusion Despite its flaws, I do recommend this game. It was made using RPG Maker, and as someone who has used those tools before, I must say that it is impressive what these developers were able to do with it. If you enjoy story-driven games where your choices matter, then Always Sometimes Monsters is worth your time.			"

												Always Sometimes Monsters provides a very realistic and rivetting story in which the player is forced to make difficult descisions based on their own morality. As I played through I found myself making choices that I personally believed to be less than admirable, but when faced with awful alternatives it seems as if there is no right or wrong choice. Always Sometimes Monsters does not necessarily set out to make a statement, but under the gritty reality that you are faced to face in this game there are definitely lessons to be learned.			"

You can tell a lot of love has gone into this game's creation, as the art, writing and game world itself feel finely crafted - despite a few spelling and continuity errors here and there.All in all, if you're looking for a time-killer and like a good story, give this one a try.

												I am absolutely in love with the idea that there are consequences with every choice you make in life. This game takes me back to a lot of situations that I wish I would have changed. Best recommended if you want your box of feels punched with a tree.			"

												I want to give this a thumbs down because of how much of an emotional wreck I am right now, but I don't really want to not recommend a game just because of the negative emotion it gave me. For those who have finished this game would understand me, that is, if everything ended sucky for them as well.**MIGHT spoil the game, but I am trying to avoid any spoilers**This game was pretty great, I'm just quite an emotional person and feels always get to me right away. I mean, this game makes me think, we don't easily forget the people that make life worth living, do we?I mean, my character in this game has done so much and in the end, he just gets thrown around like an animal and gets his heart completely crushed. Too much effort, just for that to happen... Does a legacy of effort mean anything in this world anymore?If I had a happy ending, that would be Sam standing there and I would be the cause of HIS/HER unhappy ending. Maybe Sam's been as miserable as me. Maybe he/she doesn't deserve an unhappy ending...but it's either me or the other person who gets that happiness; there always has to be one person who has to be the miserable one. Should I accept my fate and stay silent?No matter what choice we make in this world...there are always sometimes monsters.__Okay, so enough of that crap. There were some things in this game that I could definitely see me doing / see happen to me in the future so I got really into it. I thought this game was totally worth it ESPECIALLY if it's on sale. There's romance, a lot of comedy, oh, and a hecka lot of quotes I wish I wrote down (I may or may not have used some above). I'd definitely recommend this to people who like romance and comedy - and people who like feels.I would write a PROS list, but my opinion about what I like doesn't really matter. Different people like different things. BUT I am going to write a CON list because sometimes we gotta look at the bad before caring too much about the good.Cons:-Sometimes the objectives in this game isn't as specific as the others (might get lost/confused about what you're supposed to do next) but you'll get back in track after a few minutes of wandering.-There were times where this game was boring *cough* Tofu job *cough* but it added to the steadiness of the game (rather than having too much stuff like maybe uh uhm yeah the ending bye)-Choices that leave you thinking after a while-If you're SUPER emotional and a sissy like me, you'd be feeling uncomfortable and broken-CHARACTERS THAT MAKE YOU WANT TO BREAK THINGS-Sam -why does the kid only want to fish for crabs?? are people going to notice the floating corpse?? and HOW ABOUT THAT SMASHED WINDOW?!-i need money and food-some of the music made my eyes twitch (sorry)-Most of the guys did not look attractive. Only the females looked nice (most of the time)Pros:(I said I wouldn't, but I want to write just a FEW things)-The game is steady, not too much going on.-Dream scenes - oh my god I love it when games have these-The game lasted longer than I thought it would (I would always be anxious to play but I was too scared to finish it)[there are a lot more probs, I am just too upset to focus on the good things right now]__Well, I hope you guys enjoy this game, if you do buy it. Maybe gift your friend the game as well and then compare choices. And I hope someone would list all the quotes in this game and put them on wiki/imdb or some website or something. All the quotes in this game are magnificent. The deep quotes always get to me oh my god. Anyways, enjoyt the game. And thanks to the people who read through all my nonsense.			"

												Was recommended by a friend, enjoyed the game. Didn't cry like the friend did but I've got that title of heartless or something. Anyway, good game. Not as much customization in the characters but you can be gay if you want and names are chosen by you so do what you will cuz a Pirate is Free, you are a pirate. Long game if you're not willing to really put your energy into it. To get all achievements, play through to the end past credits. Top tip right there. If you get emotionally invested and forget real life you probs might start sobbing due to all of the dramatic choices. It's supposed to show the duality of choice in life etc and how there's consequence and we're human and whatnot. Good game overall. Not the most entertaining for me but I would recommend it if you're into this kind of thing. Something Markiplier would play on his channel probably. Like To the Moon or something.			"

												Do you enjoy the soul crushing monotony of working dead end jobs to make just enough money to survive? Then I can recommend Always Sometimes Monsters Otherwise, unless you're going for the novelty of what this game offers give this a pass. The story is frustratingly angsty and uninteresting as well as having you perform conveyor belt ""mini games"" to make enough money to afford food and a bus ticket which is $8,000 for some reason. You can skip this money grinding by keeping a certain character alive; except this character has no sure way of being saved. It's random so either you get lucky, you save scum, or you spend a very, very long time grinding money to progress the story. It's just plain not fun.  "

												THIS GAME IS AWESOME!!!!!! When I first bought this game, I thought I wasnt going to like it. I am usually not interested in 8-bit indie games like this (my sin is Third Person Shooters) and out of a whim I just put it in my cart and said ♥♥♥♥ it. 10/10 would do it again. This game is whatever you like it to be. The laughs are genuine and the choices you make are regretful! Just like life! My Cons:-Viper-My luck is horrible-Boxes-Enter button makes decisions for me :'(My Pros:-Fighting for love is exhausting -Bacon Burgers every night and staying in shape-Really nice friends -Overall Criminal Activity I would recommend to anyone who will listen. This game is a must play.9/10And now to patiently wait for Sometimes Always Monsters :'(			"

Always Sometimes not even worth it on sale.The good: Inovative use of RPGMaker Freedom to choose main character/love interest. ... That's about itThe Bad: The Choices are by in large illusory - they have little impact in the actual story The Dialog seems to have been written by a depressed Nihilist Parts of the game are exceedingly juvenile. Oh, and it's an RPG Maker game, which really is sin enough on it's own; Slow menus, Screen has to go to black to remove NPC sprites, and all the other cosmetic issues inherent with RPG Maker Games.The game just doesn't live up to it's hype.

												I'm currently burning through my Steam library playing the games I've never installed. So this review will be pretty brief and based on the hour and a half I've played.I think I got this game in a bundle at some point. I installed it today not knowing what to expect since I hadn't yet looked into what this game was past the name. What i got was what I can only describe as a Super NES melodrama. Not that its a bad thing, mind you. Sometimes always monsters is very unique. Without going into spoilers, this plays like an old adventure game. You'll walk around talking to people and interacting with the environment. The graphic style looks like something from the 16 bit era. The music is pretty cool too. This is mostly a semi interactive visual novel, though. I don't believe the branching paths branch all that far in that from what I've played so far, It seems that the main character is locked into either doing certain things or losing the game altogether. Maybe I'm wrong. All in all though, Always Sometimes Monsters is pretty good and worth checking out. The 10 dollar price tag does seem a wee bit high so grab it on sale if you can.  "

												Its So Edgy I cut Myself(Apparently people are content with drugs, murder and prostitution just to get to some wedding)The game is also quite monotonous, alot of what you are doing feels mundane and not very riveting, your character burns through food like Homer Simpson After A Diet (How does 3 Bagels somehow only give me back half my hunger meter) It also sacrifices fun for story, which may be ok for some, but it felt really tedious, especially since the story has odd ideas of character and the propotrion to which a characters motive might fuel his actions.Pick up if on sale for dirt cheap, because its an experiment to say the least, but otherwise just give it a pass :P			"

												Spoilers Included:Majors in a story-telling aspect with allusion to some of your choices actually mattering with some interesting social commentary. Loses it’s steam due to tedious repetitive segments complete with poor pacing, obvious plot twists, and revolving around mostly nothing but your grinding/luck with money.What’s interesting is it actually gives away it’s concept pretty early while talking to the meta in-game developers as “Would you be interested in playing a game where you’re not the hero” and the game tries to accomplish just that. You stem into this journey in attempt to see your partner betrothed at someone else’s hand and the cost of doing such may cost you your own morality and people will question that as time passes but in the end it just comes to this giant “meh” of a selective ending unless you really want♥♥♥♥♥♥to warp into the soap opera zone.The characters 8/10 of the times are cynical ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s, their attempt to get you connected to your partner completely revolves around these short flashbacks you get every maybe 30% of game completion with very little substance whatsoever and devalues the plot by about 50%, it’s an attempt to give you a visual novel experience by Devolver Digital standards (surprise, surprise) and just barely manages to withhold it’s own without coming off as pointless.

												Surprisingly, I've learned a lot about myself from this charming 8-bit game. This game gives you many, many choices that often change the outcome of a situation, chapter, or even the entire game. Some are black and white moral choices, others are very gray. What would you do for love? What would you do for your friend? What would you do for a paycheck? What would you do for...bacon?!Things That Happened In Game:*Victim of racism in first ten minutes of gameplay. *Homeless.*Starved to death, start over, sustain self on bacon.*Stole a man's job, then saved him from killing himself.*Worked temp job making soy burgers for hippies, enjoyed more than real life job.*Experienced sexism as I was hit on by jerk foreman. Put up with it for a paycheck.*Died in my sleep, start over, remember to eat before bed! *Chose to make tofu over killing piglets, even though it paid less. Ironically, I sustain myself on bacon. *Broke into mansion, hacked computer, stole sex scandal pics, blackmailed surgeon to save best friend's girlfriend.*Scalp Massage. Oh, yeah. *Tricked drug addict into losing money which I then pocket.*Got top score in a video game.*Stole the start up money for this game while in game and broke the fourth wall, sending me back in time, making me a Time Lord. Start over. Eat more bacon.*Rigged an election. Oh, don't look at me like that. They were both bad choices, anyway.  "

												This game is unbelievably good.  Forget the graphics, it is a game only in the loosest sense of the word - instead it is a journey down an incredibly hard set of circumstances and YOU are the one who decides whether it is worth it or not.  Will you complete your quest or will you abandon it?  Will you achieve your quest by the straight and narrow or will you take shortcuts?  What are you willing to sacrifice?  Who are you willing to step on?  I binge played this game straight thru and cried at the end.  Whether you experience a ""happy"" or ""sad"" ending is partly up to the choices you make and partly up to fate.... just as in this crazy would we live.  An amazing experience!			"

												I'm a detail lover, I think that details are a really important thing, but in this game I didn't had to pay attention to the details to find rough edges because this game bugs easily, has a lot of louse ends in the story, a hunger system written by a very fat guy where you can't even pass the night if you eat 6 ♥♥♥♥ing sandwiches (Really, a normal person has enough with 3 sandwiches for a night) and a really rushed end that makes you think that the devs were tired of developing this game after the second town and ended up with making you loose around 15 days without any reason or story behind.Not only that but it's a cheesy games that makes predictable moves to try to make you feel depressed or something deep but ends up being boring as heaven.If you're a hipster you'll love it, if not, stay away from this game since it's the overshoot attempt of some american content white devs to show you how hard and edgy life is or some sort of cheap doomsday philosophy.I hate to hate on an indie game but they wanted to keep it real in his game, so I'm doing the same in my review.

												5/10.This is a heavily story-focused game.  No combat...which is okay!You follow a selected protagonist through a series of difficult life choices.  The way Vagabond Dog wrote the story, you really feel invested in the characters and the choices you're making.  That's definitely a positive.  However, as far as the main story goes, I feel that many of your choices don't have too much of an efffect, and sometimes I felt too railroaded.  I don't intend to spoil any story-points, but I felt a little cheated by the ending.Beyond choice-making, the game has a few minigames to play in order to earn cash.  99 percent of them felt like grinding in an old RPG without any of the fun of a battle system.  As I stated before, no battle system is okay.  However, I would expect the minigames to be somewhat entertaining if they're going to be replacing it completely.Overall, this game is worth checking out if you enjoy throw-back pixel-graphic games and an interesting story that makes you think.  This game definitely is a standout for being different and interesting.  The entertainment quality simply suffered in a few places.			"

												I've had this game recommended to me for months now, and I finally got gifted a copy. Boy, am I glad it was a gift, i would have been♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off otherwise.As much as I've been told the story and choices/morals in this game are so good, I find it to be pretty damn bad.The characters for starters are so unlikable it's almost criminal. The player character is such a total ♥♥♥♥-up (even when you are trying your best to be a good person with your choices) that he/she is totally unlikable.There is a difference between making a character likeable and charismatic AND also flawed. That is good writing and necessary. It also gives you room for a good character arc and growth. But when your main character is instead a flat stereotype of a total screw-up and you are given no incentives to like them, it's impossible to get into the the story or care about them.The rythm of the game-plot is also slow as molasses and that is also a BAD writing thing. Difference between a slow-paced beginning and a boring one, folks. DOn't make me wade through hours of♥♥♥♥♥♥to get to the good stuff. A story can have a slow start and still grip you, it HAS to. A movie/show/game should get your attention right away (and I'm gonna give you a clear example of a game that gets your total attention in the first 20 seconds: GHOST TRICK).I also immediately felt like the choices I was making were meaningless and just chores to give me the false illusion of autonomy, thus ruining the immersion further; and the daily tasks/quests are not fun at all.The music gave me a headache after less than 90 minutes of playing.In short, if you want a gripping, well-written game with a real moral system and an enjoyable experience, this one is not up to the task.

												Did I enjoy it: YesIs it a good game: Debateable, but I'm going to say yesCons can basically all be pointed back to the choice of RPG Maker as the engine. However, if you can look past that you'll find a game that tackles some interesting topics in a novel way.How many games allow you the opportuntiy to be homeless and unemployed? Or face discrimination based on your race, sex or sexuality? Even the minigames in which you make money are an exercise in dealing with boredom - probably an artistic choice on the designer's part, but not a smart mvoe when making a game.All in all, I found it engrossing. It's basically a road-trip movie that takes itself seriously, and wants to explroe the darker side of the modern world. Dialogue can get incredibly preachy and go on too long about simple philosophical concepts, and some people feel they were rail-roaded too much in the latetr part of the game after the initial 'open world' experience of the first act, but these are minor niggles. The fact that most NPCs treat you differently based on race, sex and age are all commendable, showing that these choices matter.Always Sometimes Monsters delivers a good story, has some solid points to make and dares to do something different.

												I really loved this game, though the possible endings were kind of disappointing. It was mostly a game about the journey, though.I especially loved the subtle way it dealt with issues like sexism, racism, homophobia, etc. through dialogue that was intentionally inserted to make you cringe. It was also very diverse in terms of who you wanted your player character to be and who you wanted them to date. You can play a straight character or a gay/lesbian one, and get into a bisexual threesome with a couple if you want to.And I've never felt so guilty as when I took the job slaughtering pigs. The way the poor little pixellated piggies look directly at you right before they're killed - so sad! :( I stuck to tofu after that, even though it wasn't as profitable. And did anyone else see the sly Monsanto reference in the seed-planting job?Oh, and the soundtrack was AWESOME. <3I'll definitely be replaying this.			"

												No, I did not click ""Not Recommended"" because it's an RPG Maker game. There's a few good ones if you look around, and Always Sometimes Monsters might be one of those. Unfortunately, the game is incredibly boring. Sure, it's got depth and it might tell an interesting story, but I could not get hooked. I was loathing going any further because the dialogue was so drawn out and it felt like it was going to take forever to get anywhere. Nothing was memorable; the art wasn't, the music wasn't, the characters weren't, the story wasn't, and the self-jokes from the developers certainly weren't. An unfortunate circumstance, since I loved the demo a lot.			"

												Always Sometimes Monsters is an intriguing game where your decisions impact the narrative. While not an entirely new concept, this game manages to keep things interesting most of the time. Gameplay The gameplay in Always Sometimes Monsters is primarily about making choices. In the beginning of the game, you choose your character by deciding who to toast with at a party, and then choose your love interest by going to the balcony and talking with one of the many characters. It makes character selection more interesting than just picking from a menu. Also, you are able to choose from a diverse group of male/female characters and can choose to be either heterosexual or homosexual.There is an in-game clock of sorts that breaks the day up into 3 parts - morning, afternoon, and night. You can do one job/event per time of day, and some tasks require a certain time of day. After completing the task, that part of the day is automatically over. This is where making choices comes into play. You have to decide what you are going to do for each segment of the day, and the choices you make during those jobs and events affect the way the story unfolds. You have 30 in-game days to reach a particular destination (I won't spoil what that is, since it is a major part of the story).There are some mini-games as well, but to be honest, they were not too interesting to me. I tried each one once or twice, but I did not have the desire to revisit them. Lastly, there are optional figures to collect that feature characters from various indie games, though I'm not sure if they serve a purpose other than to be collected for fun (they can be sold to the pawn shop for a little extra money, but I preferred to keep them in my collection). Story I won't spoil anything, but the actual game starts one year after the party I mentioned previously where you select your character. You are basically trying to get your life back on track. There are several main areas in the game, and each has its own story and set of quests you will need to do in order to make it to the next area. This is unfortunately where the game is hit-or-miss, since it is a story-driven game. Some characters and events are intriguing, while others just simply are not (at least in my opinion). However, keep in mind that I only played through the game once, so my choices may not have led to all of the most interesting events.Dialogue is good about 70% of the time, but the rest of it is not quite at the same level of quality. It feels like certain parts are trying to be very mature, but they don't always quite hit the mark. It's not terrible by any means, but just something I wanted to point out. There are also some spelling and grammar mistakes that I encountered on more than a few occasions. It's not a deal-breaker, but those kinds of mistakes sometimes took me out of the moment. I understand that this is an indie game and it's not easy to find every little mistake during the development process, though. Sound The songs are pretty cool for the most part - simple yet catchy electronic music. Be aware that there are some songs that got annoying after a while, but only if I was in a particular area for an extended period of time. If you really love that type of music, you may not find it to be too annoying. I just felt like there was a lack of variety. The sound effects were fine and I have no complaints about them. Conclusion Despite its flaws, I do recommend this game. It was made using RPG Maker, and as someone who has used those tools before, I must say that it is impressive what these developers were able to do with it. If you enjoy story-driven games where your choices matter, then Always Sometimes Monsters is worth your time.			"

												Always Sometimes Monsters provides a very realistic and rivetting story in which the player is forced to make difficult descisions based on their own morality. As I played through I found myself making choices that I personally believed to be less than admirable, but when faced with awful alternatives it seems as if there is no right or wrong choice. Always Sometimes Monsters does not necessarily set out to make a statement, but under the gritty reality that you are faced to face in this game there are definitely lessons to be learned.			"

												Always Sometimes Monsters sounded like a wonderful idea for a game. But the gameplay and story feel very boring and dry. I tried playing up to 2 hours to try and convince myself that it would get better before I decided to refund, but the quality remained the same. This game failed to hook me quite right and lost me. It also isn't clear on which direction one can go with their choices and where to go and what there is to do. I am a person that loves story driven games, however this story didn't catch on with me.			"

												There is a difference between a sad story and a depressing story.After a sad story we feel catharsis. We feel like we've explored an idea, like we've walked in another person's shoes. Sure, the story didn't turn out well, but not everything in life does. We can learn from it. Sad stories serve a purpose.A depressing story, on the other hand, tells us nothing we don't already know. Life sucks. Work is boring and unfulfilling. Society is cruel and unfair. Damn near nobody cares about us; they're all out to get their own. Connections we make in our lives are all the more precious for being freaking rare, and we have to treasure the few good things we have for the limited time we still have them. We know all that.After experiencing a sad story, you feel cleansed. After experiencing a depressing story, you want 1.4 hours of your life back.Judging by my rating, in which category do you think I place this ridiculous runaround of a game?I guess someone who's had a much easier life than mine might find a game like this eye-opening. Honestly, though, it's so far removed from reality anyway that it can't even be instructive.			"

												This game is basically a non-combat interactive story where you can make a lot of choices that will have consequences, so on the game has multiple endings. I really like those type of games and I think it's pretty well done in this one. The game can be pretty dark, but that's one of the reasons as to why I like it even more. It really shows that life isn't all roses and it does bring across several messages. Even though those things are not always perceived the same way by people, nor can I agree with all of them. But that's an entirely different matter. The story was interesting enough to keep me wanting to play and near the end of the game I'd actually gotten attached to my character, which is always a good sign. The game comes with many mini-games for jobs and also in the shape of arcade video games your character can play which I thought was a nice touch and I enjoyed them, although I've seen people say they found the jobs tedious to do. Regardless from that possibly being the case for people, I still think it's not something that would stand in the way of enjoying this game for all it's other aspects. Overall this is a pretty brilliantly composed game, especially considering it was made in RPG-maker by a small studio of indie-developers.			"

												""Humble thyself or ye shall be humbled."" ""There is none good, no, not one."" During my ten hour playthrough I constantly thought of these Biblical teachings so that I would make the best possible ""morally right"" choices through the game. Then again, morals are only based on popular opinion, and this game really digs deep into our morals. No matter the conclusion, be it a sad, a good, or a controversial ending, the outcomes really weighed upon me, which goes to show that a game doesn't need great graphics to tell a good story. That is what I believe the developers at Vagabond Dog were trying to do: make a story to be remembered for years to come, be it sad, good, or controversial. For ten dollars, Always Sometimes Monsters will take you on a journey of love, sacrifice, hate, and greed. This game invites you to think about your own morals.			"

												I have nothing nice to say, but I have put near 8 hours into the game and spent money on it, so I am going to vent a little. Always Sometimes Monsters isn't just a let down on my expectations, it's a let down of a game. It fails at the one thing a game should always prioritize on being: Fun. It fails as being fun. It fails at telling an immersive story. It fails at pacing. It fails from a control standpoint. However it doesn't fail on one aspect. It doesn't fail at being a chore. It's so anti-game that it hurts me. I hate being overy critical, but when I invest the time and the climax is a massive disappointment, I can't help but be this way.Is it the fault of the developer? In my opinion, I don't always believe so. Sure, it's easy to blame them cause I mean they did create the game after all, but it was their vision at the end of the day, and they weren't wrong for producing it. However, it is their fault for having a premise, and making it a long grind of futility and boredom. It's so damn boring. I can go into more details in a future edit if people REALLY want me to but every other review has done a good job of dealing with the details. I just wanted to vent over how disappointed I was.  "

												The one thing this game has going for it is that you can tell it was a labor of love.  It feels very personal, as if the developers created it without the intention of showing it to anyone else, and there's something charming about that.Unfortunately, the awkward writing, the nonsensical plot, and especially the really tedious gameplay (culminating in having to gamble up to a ridiculous amount of money to get the best ending) are too much.  There were several pretty annoying glitches, one where events weren't triggered at the right time and resulted in seeing the same dialogue more than once, and one where a minigame was just completely broken.  I also found it way too easy to accidentally select dialogue choices when hitting the button to advance through the text.But as I said, there's something kind of charming about it.  So I played through almost all of the game until I reached the part I described in the spoiler, and then I just decided it wasn't worth the time and looked up the endings.  I can't say I didn't enjoy it, there were moments where the writing was actually great, but I can't really recommend buying it.  Perhaps watch a playthrough on Youtube so you can skip the tedious parts.			"

The plot I feel resonates best with most 20+ year olds who have been broke / heartbroken at some point and provided a good escape for me.  I enjoyed all the meta and adult humor in it but I didn't like that the main character's life revolved around getting the main love interest back.  It would've been nice to have an ending where the main character realizes they are fine on their own or finds love along the way with someone else.			"

												I felt sort of speechless on writing a review about this, because this game is surely not for everyone as it might cause one to be either bored or emotional (who might just have broke up in a relationship as it surely does give the ""hope"" for the people who still couldn't step forward yet in life, unfortunately life doesn't work that way). Well, nevermind forget about it. :/My positive point of view:- This game actually did a really great job on delivering the messages and it shows us what kind of the world we live in.- The gameplay was good, I was confused for the first hour, but then I gotten more curious on what kind of outcome it's going to be.- The soundtrack, not bad.- The story, is really good. It's all based on your decisions made, some choices given were pretty tough for me to pick though. Honestly I couldn't even decide which is good or bad ending, as it was all like, exchanging misery with one and another just for own happiness or for other's. Sad reality, eh? At least to me, yes.I highly recommend this game for people who are more into experiencing and stories in games.			"

												Overall I enjoyed this game. The story gave a lot of choice and presented some interesting dilemmas, although some parts did tend to drag on a little bit. I enjoyed the ending, and while I would be a little interested to see how the story can play out with different choices, the game doesn't have a lot of replay value.Not much to say about the graphics - the screenshots basically tell you all you need to know. The art is not amazing, but decent. The music on the other hand was generally great, although some tracks were a bit irritating. The developers crammed in a bunch of references to other indie titles with collectable items, and references game that try to remind you repeatedly that you're playing an indie game right now and I found it a little annoying. There's a fair number of mini games scattered throughout the game as well, though most of them are mediocre, if not downright terrible. Thankfully, the bad ones are completely optional. The core of the game is in the narritive and managing your money. My only complaint there would be that the whole stamina system is not well explained, I was never sure what the consequences of not eating would be and was never told. Overall, Always Sometimes Monsters is a decent game, though there are better games out there. The fact that there is so much choice tends to mean that a lot of the dialogue feels very generic and weakens the narritive. Even still, the price is right, and if you have the time to play it I'd reccomend picking it up. There are certainly better stories out there, but seeing how your version of this one plays out is worth the time.			"

												I don't usually write reviews, but after finishing this game I felt like I had to.I've played a lot of games with morality systems and choices. While some have done a better job of making me feel the consequences of my actions, most are hit and miss. Always Sometimes Monsters manages to make every choice I make feel like I've made a real decision. And they all have consequences that I did not even think about before while I made them. From who I help to who I don't help, every thing I've done came back to haunt me, for better or for worse. Always sometimes monsters is one of those rare games that lives up to it's claims.I want to write this review without spoilers, which puts me in a bind for discussing the story. Egoraptor did a video once, where he emphasized the difference between telling a player about your game, and showing them how the game works through the actual gameplay. Through your journey, you don't have to be told how hard your character has it. You feel every inch that they struggle. You feel every bit of boredom, tedium and eventually the fear. You become invested in what you're doing and the game very rarely engineers a situation to make you feel bad. Every tragedy, every guilty pang is your fault and the game makes no attempt to pretend that it's not due to your actions. But the same goes for every triumph. Every success, every small victory is all because of you and what you have decided to do. It is the biggest guilt trip, but you honestly feel that warm fuzzy feeling when you do something honestly good.I heard the game described at one point as ""To the Moon mixed with Cart Life"". Those of you who've played both, as I have, can attest to this fact. It's an emotional rollercoaster full of hard choices and honestly, with no guarantee of success. I suppose this game is somewhat like life, which is the best thing I can think about this game. It's only 9 dollars at release, 10 dollars normally. If you have the money, then give this game a try. Or don't. After all, the choice is always yorus to make.			"

												Have you ever promised something to someone and didn't follow thru?Did you ever miss out on a concert to spend time with your boyfriend/girlfriend/wife/husband?What were the consequences of your choices? That is what this game is trying to explain that we live far more complex lives than we think and it is changing the way we look at the medium of video games.  Its not about acheviments, high scores or saving the world.  This games makes the player realize that the choices we make have an impact on the people and world around us.  While its not a traditional game it is an experament that video games can be art and delve into the human condition.  If you are going into this game with doubts I'd say play it and it may or may not be for you but for me it made me realize that we can have major impacts on lives by making trivial decsions.

												Always Sometimes Monsters might not be the best RPG-Maker game I've ever played, but it's certainly one of the most unique, as it puts a huge emphasis on choices. That begins with the intro (that seems disonnected to the rest for a long time) where you can decide to listen to the person telling the story or simply shoot him and end it before it gets going.And after that you land at a party that is actually a character selection in disguise. Choose your main character and then the person you will be chasing after for the remainder of the game, which might take 7+ hours, depending on how much you do. I certainly could have done more, since I had about 10 days to spare from the 30 day countdown.With only one playthrough I cannot say how much of the choices are real and how much illusions, but you can certainly get some people killed or simply decide if you want to be a nice person or a real ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s who would even rob indie developers of the little money they have.Therefore I can only recommend it. One of the few commercial rpg-maker games that is worth every cent. It might be a little rough around the edges, but it's nothing that couldn't be fixed with a few updates.			"

												Always Sometimes Monsters is a little game about choice.At nearly every turn the player is put in a situation in which they must make a decision, and live with the consequences. Though the game wil always guide you through the key points, how and why you get there vary with each playthrough.The game also likes to test your morality. There are many situations in which you must decide who to screw over, or whether you're going to play dirty.The game is fairly short, taking only a few hours to get through, but considering the sheer number of choices (and multiple endings) it has extreme replayability. The game also has a rather unique way to pick ones charcter, and allows for you to play either sex and orientation.While having only presently played through twice, I look forward to trying to hunt down all the hidden details and possible outcomes in hopes of getting that Happy Ending.If I had to give a rating, 'twould be 4.5/5.

												DO NOT GET THIS GAME. This game is unsatisfying and unrealistic. At first, the game may seem like it will be a difficult experience trying to win your love back, but it's EASY. It makes me even wonder why they put certain things in, like needing to either pay a ridiculous amount of money or suck a dude off to sleep in an alley when you can just sleep in your friend's house. And the choice is completely taken from you if you want to win your love back. You would have a better time writing your own story. Maybe buy this game when it gets a 99% off discount. Otherwise, AVOID.			"

												Playing this game, I sometimes felt trapped reading endless reels of babble.  The story takes way too long to unravel.  Other than that, the game is fun and has some interesting points.  The graphics and character abilities are extremely limited, but that is not the selling point of this game.  It seems the author/game creators wanted to make an interactive romance novel.			"

												It's an RPG Maker game so you already know it offers the most basic of gameplay in an .exe that hopefully works without having to change some properties. Can't say anything new about that or recommend it to people who are tired with those types of Verge RPG programs from way back. The main draw for this one is its choose-your-own-adventure story system. Unfortunately, that means it had better be written well to be worth $10. Same goes for the $5 soundtrack, which is also too boring and uninspiring to be worth it.Gamers have a very low bar for what’s considered good writing, it seems. No achievement for shooting that first long-winded bum who kept prattling on about choice? C’mon, we were supposed to not hate that dialogue? The biggest problem with moral dilemma stories written by gamers is that it’s so obvious what the intended choice is. They all think the same. Besides, when you have the choice between “Well, I guess you’re right if you really think about it” and “Get the ♥♥♥♥ out of here, I’m not an awful person ugh,” it’s not hard to figure out which path the writer’s hoping you choose, especially since there’s always a trigger involved. Sex? Kinda sketchy. Drugs? Tools of the devil. Old people? Gotta respect ‘em. Do I steal the game dev’s money or do I leave it alone? I wonder which one results in the Game Over.“It’s supposed to make you mad/sad so you could think about the other choices you could’ve made/consequences of your actions! That’s what we set out to do. We’re artists.” Ok.I’m happy to see modern-day RPG Maker stuff, I really am, and I’m impressed that the team was able to make money off of it but they might wanna grab someone from the NaNoWriMo forums who’s desperate to get their grand works out there next time. Who knows, the gimmick might work. “Budding novelist hopeful teams up with indie vidya designer for passion project. Adam Sessler rises from the grave to promote it until it’s written about in Time Magazine. The medium is finally transcending!” It’s not like anyone’s expecting Walden Simulator or A Sport and a Pastime: The Game.Or, you know, you can just ramble about fate or cry about your ex-girlfriend some more.12/10 would whine about binary moral decisions again.

												Well that was a great game, let me tell you. That's what I call ""story rich"". Okay, not all the choices in the game have real influence on the ending (which would be perfect), and there's a tricky way to get good ending (no one wants to end up as a hobo, I suppose?), which forces you to play not as if it was you, but just pursuing your goal - and that kills a bit of fun. But still this game is great - the journey to get your love back throws you in different situations, where the choice is yours - act like a jerk to get money (rob an old granny, butcher some pigs, etc.) or be kind and receive moderate payment for your help. So go on and try - will you be able to get the love of your life back, making the right decisions and getting to the wedding in time. 8/10			"

												I heard some great things about the writing, the storyline and how  you choices and actions would affect things.  After four hours, I feel like that time was wasted.  There is a lot of money grinding and action grinding to push the stages along, and the caricatures disguised as people have become insufferable.  Nothing really felt like it was having any effect on the overall story, and realizing that the main plot of this game is really to profess the fact I can't get over my ex after a year and do it them on their wedding day is a trope and a somewhat pathetic story when used in B-List Rom-Com movies.I really wanted more, and after only reading the reviews at this point, it doesn't sound like I will get anything more out of it.  I finish this glad this was within a HumbleBundle, so I do not feel as though any money was spent on this.			"

												I really wanted to like this game; I forced myself to play for almost 15 hours of it and just can’t bring myself into playing anymore. For a story driven game it has shockingly bad writing. The game is about the struggles we face in everyday life, yet the story was completely detached from reality. I mean, there are actions can potently lead to the deaths of multiple people without any repercussions, even though you *spoiler alert* wrote it into a journal which you published into a book!And you know the scene in the dark alley at the start? That’s what got me to keep playing because I wanted to see how the rest of the game tied in to it. Guess what? It doesn’t. Those characters showed up at the very end, and are completely shoed in to justify the first scene.The writing is also extremely pretentious. It spends too much time talking about philosophy of right and wrong, rather than showing through their action of its character. Which is a wasted opportunity, as many characters has potential for development (like Mark). The saying “show, don’t tell” really applies here.The gameplay is pretty much non- existence. Which is fine in “To the Moon” (another story-driven rpg-maker game), because it’s short and to the point. While in this game, I spend 15 hours in this game and still haven’t finished it (I watched a let’s play if you are wondering how I know the ending). It is drawn out and tedious, which would have been okay if the story was good, but it wasn’t.All this would have been forgivable if the developers weren’t so ♥♥♥♥ing pleased with themselves. It’s okay to be proud of your work; it’s also okay put yourself in the game as a character.  What isn’t okay is *spoiler alert* to have a book in the game called “Always Sometimes Monsters” and calling it a masterpiece, and saying that “nothing captures the human spirit quite so well” which it clearly doesn’t, and of yourself show up to offer the author  1 million dollars to turn it into a game.With all that said I hope they learn their lesson and make a better game next time, games like this are few and far between.

												My overall opinion: A pretty good game, it won't be liked by some people but I gotta say the story and the choices you make/say really did feel like a real choice and the ending wasn't set in stone and there are quite a few ways your journey may end earlier or differently(WARNING! THERE ARE SOME HINTED SPOILERS!)(This Is Just My Own Personal Opinion And How I Felt The Game Was To Me And You Might Feel Different To My Point Of View So Please Be Nice Kay? =)It wasn't a game where you can just get the best ending by just rushing to the end and picking the right dialog, it was focused on choices and life decisions that can cause your own story to end suddenly by taking the wrong turn in life. There are some flaws that I felt made the game feel annoying at some points like the boxing minigame or earning enough income in a short time open up another dialog option later in the story but without knowing all this beforehand you'll be left with just one thing, your own personal choice. (and this is without being a cheat and reading a how-to guide!)The epilogue felt open ended and you cannot revisit the previous town/cities to check up on how they are all doing and your main love interest (if you choose to persue it) simply locks him/herself in a room and you end up having a limit set of options you could do.I truely wished there was abit more to the story in the epilogue, I kinda felt cheated after going through everything just to have my main love interest lock him/herself in so I cannot see or talk to him/her and having it end just like that because I felt there could be abit more story between the main character and the love interest rather than relying mostly on flashback/dreams and maybe having them go together to revisit the town/cities the main character have gone to and see where it goes from there.Heres hoping for dlc or a sequel! but I doubt they'd do that, happens too often~ =P Anyways, this is a good game in which I will play again to see what else it has to offer and the main theme of the game is probably the choice in life and maybe something else =P , I hope you enjoy it if you do buy the game, its total recommended game to get!

												A nice story that will last you a few hours, with some nice jokes and some very well done story telling. The game tells you that your choices and the way you act will impact the game, and to some degrees it does, but (without using any spoilers), the ending will pretty much be the same. It also feels like while the developers put a lot of effort into the first half of the game, the second half feels much less fleshed out and much more rushed. Less choices, quicker dialogue etc. However, overall, it's a nice game and I don't regret playing it at all. I highly recommend it to anybody that loves story rich games, just don't expect much gameplay. It's a walk and talk game. Some people like them, some people don't, but I have no qualms recommending this game.			"

												Its a choose your own adventure game threaded  together using ALOT of boring minigames. being able to choose how you want to deal with situations presented in the game is the best part, but sometimes I saw my choices didn't save (ie. Someone died, they're alive later). The story was an interesting idea, most of the conversations with characters were pretty great and well written, however some conversations and story points made me go wtf, didn't make sense, or was just badly thought out and written. I like the changing settings and how there were at least 3 full towns to explore, however lacking towards the end in SV. Now as a choose your adventure/choice game I would recommend it hesitantly.BUT absolute worst thing this game does is create a very long amount of trash filler minigames to tie the story together.From my playthrough I played 3 arcade minigames (one pacman ripoff), 2 job minigames (Tofu/Weed jobs), coat check minigame, box minigame, hacking minigame (frogger ripoff), vent maze, deliver drugs minigame, boxing minigame, 4 casino minigames. I hated them. Almost all the minigames I listed are required for progress or jobs done to progress the day. By the end of the game, I've had enough and didn't even play any of the casino minigames cause that's a stupid idea. I hated those boring minigame segments that are half the game.Also, the developer cameo was great at first in the coffee shop, but wtf was with the two of them, and that ending at the book store was so stupidly bad I laughed.Do not recommend.

												It's not that easy to judge this game... It was fun... SOMETIME. It was boring... SOMETIME. It has unxpressed potential and there are a couple ""flaws"" that I didn't like that much. It's intentionally repetitive and ""not epic""... the main charachter is a really mediocre person, not even a antihero. It was hard to sympathize with her SOMETIME. I liked the experience, overall, but SOMETIME I was thinking it was too long. Dialogues are usually good, SOMETIME great, SOMETIME annoying or boring. Even the story, that is the main part of the game, because the gameplay it's definately not so great, is not so interesting.So... It's hard to judge the game. I think it's... AVERAGE. :) Some people will like it a lot, some people will hate it. I say average ;)+ Music+ Many possible endings+ Some interesting choices+ Some dialogues+ Some humor and some adult theme (racism, violence, sex, freedom, death...)+ Mostly realistic (maybe too much)+ Choices usually matters- Some dialogues- Sound effects- Repetitive tasks - Main character - Felf too long- The main story afterall - Retro graphic not cool6/10			"

												This game is like no game I have ever dream to play. It's like a life simulator. It has a dark-ish general story and all, like most games, but you get to decide how to get there. I know, I know. You heard that before, right? Well I will honestly say that this game actually achieves that idea in a way where it makes you think about your life and how you want to live it. I dream to make games like this. It takes you on a journey you (Hopefully) won't forget. You get to pick your main character and his/her love interests (which is a great design and makes you connect to your character more). If you like story driven games, this is for you and I suggest giving it a playthrough (If not more, because trust me, you will want to play it again to see if you can get a different ending or maybe make a better choice then you did before). This game will start with a confusing beginning but it'll all make sense at the end. Now this game does have a couple of cons that I have to state at least. This game is heavily driven on text. If you're not a big fan of reading, you might want to stray away from this game. You will not appreciate it all if you can't appreciate the text. Now that being said, I did spot a FEW mistakes in the spelling and some mishaps on pronouns. For the grammar nazis out there, I just laying that out there. But for a game that probably has over 5000 words in it, 1 or 2 mistakes is just being human, or just being sometimes monsters... SORRY! Had to throw that somewhere in there!To shorten this up though, I'll just make a pros and cons list:Pros:+A great story that leaves you thinking about your life+Choices that make an impact on you+Humorous at times+Well designed (for a RPG Maker game)+Great CharactersCons:-Few Spelling/Grammar errors-My ending made me feel the feels! ♥♥♥♥ you for your feels!Rating:8\10			"

												SPOILER ALERTI don't recommend this game because it doesn't suit me to be an sjw.I understand that it's not ye olde action game or rpg and all that but it isn't fun either. It's cliché, it's like someone grabbed a story from fan fiction and ported it into an rpg full of stereotype characters, stupid as hell karma consequences that are either black or white and neither necessarilly right or wrong, that try and fail miserably when trying to make you feel guilty for them.As for story and characters, they are bland, trivial. The whole point of the story is to drag yourself into an empty envelope - your avatar - and let yourself get dragged into the most crazy and unrealistic made up cliché scenario - to get back to your lovelly ex wife that dumped your♥♥♥♥♥because your stupid essay or whatever was taking a toll on your romantic relationship. If this wasn't what all single neckbeards dream about. (being engaged in the pursue of their waifu) then I don't know what it is. Hence such a high rating for this video-game soap opera.Since there is no surprise here, the whole point of the game is to get back to your dearest ♥♥♥♥♥ ex girlfriend to whom you were engaged with. You meet her when your lame♥♥♥♥♥room mate that starts stalking the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of her asks you to go talk to her. Then you ""steal"" her from him aftert she clearly tells you she's annoyed by that ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ that seems not to do anything productive ever but for some reason gets extremelly attached to you and insists on making you feel guilty for the success you take of your own hard work.Well later on you find yourself moneyless and you have to make money to travel from town to town in order to get to her. I liked that. What I did hate was that I was expecting to meet interesting characters but instead I only get dragged into the most babbysitting and stupid situations by spoiled little ♥♥♥♥♥ that can't keep their♥♥♥♥♥♥together. And if I don't help the miserable♥♥♥♥♥♥♥it's like the game implies I'm a terrible person and I get guilt tripped into helping these idiots and losing precious money on them that I could be using for my own ordeal.Well later you find out that apparently your ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ex tries is getting married because his fiance invites you to the marriage. Once you get there you find out she's getting married with your lame♥♥♥♥♥roomate from college that spent his days jerking off while you did all the work. See? soap opera.Instead of moving on with lilfe, I don't know, get a job in another place, move on, you still insist on dragging yourself to the guy's bachelour party where other crazy stuff happens and you have to give out all your work because your idiot ""friend"" blasted his money in the casino and people are threatening to kill him. So the whole ""lesson"" I took from this game is. If you have an ex and she dumped you for a mentally challenged individual, don't be spending months of hard work so you can go see her wedding. Move on, get a life. There are other women and employers out there.  "

												Finished this a while back and found it to be very enjoyable. The themes represented in the story and characters is very thought out and poiniant. If you like games that have you thinking about the decisions you've made and eager to see what happens next then I can't recommend this enough.			"

												If you have a low attention span, and cannot enjoy a game without somethng blowing up. This game is not for you.If, however, you can immerse yourself COMPLETELY into the roll of the character that you assume, and live their life, you will enjoy it. The main story is engrossing enough, but HOW you carry out and achieve your end goal (is your end goal what you think it is?), is where the real beauty lies.I spent the last 4 and a half hours contemplating every move, and decision. No matter how hard you try, no real answer is right... or wrong. It's definately adult themed, and younger gamers probably will not appreciate this game. You will have to been through, some, ehem, real life♥♥♥♥♥♥ and seen real life♥♥♥♥♥♥ to understand some of the depth of this game. Personally, this game is one of my all time favorites.			"

												I don't usually consider RPG maker games worth spending actual money on, but this game is a glorious exception. I found the characters and the story are both engaging and surprising easy to become invested in. All the different choices give the game excellent replay value, as well as constantly provoking thought on a multitude of ethical issues. The game isn't wihtout fault, random one time mini games can be a rather jarring change of tone, and particularly frustrating when you fail and don't get a chance to redo them. Plus the pace drops significantly when quests run dry in a town and you're left scraping up money for transport to the next town, which can be rather tedious and ends up kicking your immersion right in the balls.Even with those minor issues I still think this is an amazing game and highly recomend plaing it to anyone who has yet to do so.

												Beautiful, well-crafted storytelling: at least for the first two thirds of the game. Worth playing in a single marathon-style sitting for the immersion. Depending on your choices, you may be left re-evaluating your life afterwards, as ASM does not pull its punches.Disappointed with some of the late-game scenes, particularly the flashback to the big break-up. The entire game had been foreshadowing some big way in which my character ♥♥♥♥ed up which made his lover leave, but the actual break-up was very melodramatic and heavy-handed. Also, the inclusion of the developers themselves as minor characters was a nice Easter egg throughout the game, but their post-game scene took the joke too far, spoiling the intensity of the final sequence with a self-indulgent and amateurish cameo. In spite of this, the narrative was overall very solid and complex, and it was easy to immerse myself in my main character.More games like this please.			"

												Not a bad game overall. The evolving plot refreshingly different, although maybe not as mind-blowing as it tries to be. The characters and dialogue are above par. The game has a viceral feel to it, I actually cared about the situations and consequences of my avatar's actions.The HUGE downside to this game is that so much of it feels like a real chore; like going on a lame vacation so you can feel better about your normal life at the end. You spend a good amount of time doing monotonous things, which are not fun in any way/shape/form. You also get to spend tons of time just figuring out how to advance the game clock, because events happen in a very scheduled way. A very tedious way to structure puzzles.So it gets a love/hate recommendation from me. This will satisfy a craving for a ""think outside of the box"" game, just might not feel worth the full price.

												Very interesting game. Good for people who enjoy simple 'create your own story' type games that aren't focused on the graphics. Took around 15+ hours to complete, worth the cash. Fun experience. The beginning is the best part, as the game progresses it turns away from the fun type of atmosphere it starts with. The atmoshperic change is mainly cause by the storyline gettng progressivly darker and predictable in order to match the very begining sequence. In my own opinion, Markansas is the glue that keeps the beginning atmosphere going to the end. Either way, I recommened it. Tons of funny innuendo too, Sofa King Fast, Master Baiter's, ect...			"

												Interesting premise and I loved the first couple hours of the game. However I cannot recommend the game as it gets unsatisfying and tiresome once you're used to the concept and past the first couple hours. +Refreshing premise +Funny dialogue at times -The jobs are tedious and repetitive-The story is great at first but begins to come off a little pretentious as the game really likes to hammer in discussions about love and fate and yadayada-Many of the features in the game feel unfinished. For example there are tons of items/buildings that don't have any impact or use on the game despite them seeming like they would (I'm looking at you, Union Clubhouse). This wouldn't matter so much if it was an open world game with lots to explore, but this isn't. Stamina matters very very little. The collectible indie figures in the game have no impact/achievement/worth. Also theres still an annoying but harmless bug near the end I won't list (spoilers) -Minor complaint, but the UI is a little clumsy. And the controls aren't listed in the game for some reason (esc is the back button)-Underwhelming endings or endings that don't really make sense.-Despite multiple endings, little replayability since most of the game will be the same despite your choicesIt's worth trying out if you got it off the humble bundle or on a great sale, but otherwise I'd skip it			"

												This game have an interesting prologue. You lost your love, your job, and even your home at the beginning of the game, and you will have to do whatever you can to get them back. This game is all about choice and consequence. How far would you go to get the life you want?There're lots to do in game. Trying to figure out how to maxmize profit can be interesting. Although there will be times when you have to do lots of saving and loading in order to get everything right (especially near end game). Trying to make different choices and see how things turn out differently is also what make this kind of games interesting too.Although I think the game is fun as a whole, I feel that the character development is weak. Sure they are all interesting, but they are not convincing. To a certain degree, I don't see how the 'past story' can explain or to support the development of the later story. I'm confused and question the actions/reactions of the main characters later in the game. There are so many gaps you have to fill in yourself. The story feels a bit rush and tries to push things forward during the second half of the game. It is a pretty major weakness considering this is a highly story driven game.Other than that, this game still gave me a good experience.			"

There are so many minor actions that affect how the story goes and changes. You  are able to choose between a same sex couple or not as well and the fact that they chose to do that is great. The music track is nostalic and the graphics are great. The storyline is awesome and this game really makes you ponder on your decisions. I really have come to like this game and would reccomend. Should play through it a couple times to see how much changes. No matter the choice you make, you will find out that we are Always Sometimes Monsters.			"

												It's an RPG Maker game so you already know it offers the most basic of gameplay in an .exe that hopefully works without having to change some properties. Can't say anything new about that or recommend it to people who are tired with those types of Verge RPG programs from way back. The main draw for this one is its choose-your-own-adventure story system. Unfortunately, that means it had better be written well to be worth $10. Same goes for the $5 soundtrack, which is also too boring and uninspiring to be worth it.Gamers have a very low bar for what’s considered good writing, it seems. No achievement for shooting that first long-winded bum who kept prattling on about choice? C’mon, we were supposed to not hate that dialogue? The biggest problem with moral dilemma stories written by gamers is that it’s so obvious what the intended choice is. They all think the same. Besides, when you have the choice between “Well, I guess you’re right if you really think about it” and “Get the ♥♥♥♥ out of here, I’m not an awful person ugh,” it’s not hard to figure out which path the writer’s hoping you choose, especially since there’s always a trigger involved. Sex? Kinda sketchy. Drugs? Tools of the devil. Old people? Gotta respect ‘em. Do I steal the game dev’s money or do I leave it alone? I wonder which one results in the Game Over.“It’s supposed to make you mad/sad so you could think about the other choices you could’ve made/consequences of your actions! That’s what we set out to do. We’re artists.” Ok.I’m happy to see modern-day RPG Maker stuff, I really am, and I’m impressed that the team was able to make money off of it but they might wanna grab someone from the NaNoWriMo forums who’s desperate to get their grand works out there next time. Who knows, the gimmick might work. “Budding novelist hopeful teams up with indie vidya designer for passion project. Adam Sessler rises from the grave to promote it until it’s written about in Time Magazine. The medium is finally transcending!” It’s not like anyone’s expecting Walden Simulator or A Sport and a Pastime: The Game.Or, you know, you can just ramble about fate or cry about your ex-girlfriend some more.12/10 would whine about binary moral decisions again.

Music and sound are good, dialogue tends to be pretty decent, and the storyline is almost believable - again, something reasonably rare for a game.Only real fault I can find is that it may take a few hours of gameplay to pull you in, but I'd say it's worth it for the finished product. 7/10 for sure			"

What really matter is content and Always Sometimes Monsters doesn't fail in that matter. What is this game about? In short: it's about player, which means you. Every choice brings consequences. How the story will go and how will it end - it depend only on you and what you would do in some situations. It's not some kind of epic story, it's not also some masterpiece that will leave you speechless while playing or ending it - it's just a nice game full of things that might give you some thoughts, or not, and you will think it's trying to be something more than it is. There is a demo version of game, so give it a try and decide for yourself if you want to continue this story or not. I don't regret time spending playing Always Sometimes Monsters. In fact, I would gladly play more story-driven games.			"

												I have nothing nice to say, but I have put near 8 hours into the game and spent money on it, so I am going to vent a little. Always Sometimes Monsters isn't just a let down on my expectations, it's a let down of a game. It fails at the one thing a game should always prioritize on being: Fun. It fails as being fun. It fails at telling an immersive story. It fails at pacing. It fails from a control standpoint. However it doesn't fail on one aspect. It doesn't fail at being a chore. It's so anti-game that it hurts me. I hate being overy critical, but when I invest the time and the climax is a massive disappointment, I can't help but be this way.Is it the fault of the developer? In my opinion, I don't always believe so. Sure, it's easy to blame them cause I mean they did create the game after all, but it was their vision at the end of the day, and they weren't wrong for producing it. However, it is their fault for having a premise, and making it a long grind of futility and boredom. It's so damn boring. I can go into more details in a future edit if people REALLY want me to but every other review has done a good job of dealing with the details. I just wanted to vent over how disappointed I was.  "

It is by no means a perfect or flawless game and at times I did feel a bit frustrated, especially when I was trying to gather money just to keep my Stamina up, but I felt that the story was intriguing enough to keep me pulled in.At first, some of the missions and things you do seem pointless or unrewarding but they ARE worthwhile. Another big thing is that I found it extremely helpful to have multiple save files. The biggest thing to remember is that there are many different paths you can walk in this game than the one that is directly presented in front of you.			"

												If given four words to describe the contents of Always Sometimes Monsters, they would all happen to begin with the letter 'C':  Coincidence, circumstance, choice, and consequence.  Unfortunately, if I were to give a letter grade to the overall game and my experience, I would have to be quite forgiving to remain using the letter 'C'.A ""life simulator"" if you will, this is a game that plants you into a world where your hopes and dreams haven't proceeded as planned.  In a time where it has become a struggle to earn enough money to pay for food or keep a roof over your head, you find yourself invited to a wedding in a distant city.  You are tasked to find your way there within a month's time, and along the road many scenarios and options are presented to tailor your experience in exactly how you will (or will not) achieve your goal.The freedom of choice is apparent upon starting the game and persists throughout to an extent.  Sacrifice to help a friend or be selfish?  Take sides with party X or organization Y?  Take the high road or the low?  Many situations might give you pause to stop and consider your choices before committing.  Do you want to retain moral character or will the means justify the ends?  All of it is left to you as the player and will ultimately decide your fate.In the end, however, I was left rather unsatistfied with the game as a whole.  I felt as though my personal choices led to the same general path I might have ended up at had I gone the opposite direction.  Sure, one or two characters would have had different opinions of who I was in the end, maybe they'd be there in the final scene or maybe not.  But what impact did I have on the world?  ...Very little, it seems.  I chose to go with more of an upstanding citizen and aide (though not in EVERY scenario, hence the appropriate title), and as a result the choices seemed rote.  As a game that asks you to make difficult decisions, there was never a moment where I felt like I NEEDED to break out of the role I had chosen.  It felt no different to a Mass Effect game: if you play a paragon character, you make paragon choices in just about every situation.  Therefore, for a game all about choices and consequences, Always Sometimes Monsters rarely presented anything that felt meaningful.  As for the ""game"" part of the game, it's pretty messy and rarely flows well.  Conversations are held up and constantly prolonged with bubbles floating above characters' heads displaying elipses or hearts or exclamation points, none of which can be hurried with button presses or disabled in the options.  Just as disrupting is a big clock that pops up and remains on screen for at least a full five seconds whenever each ""stage"" of the day transitions from one to the next.And the mini-games.  OH, the mini-games.  Some exist to reward you in the form of money or key items.  Some are there just to spice up the world and give you something else to do off the beaten path.  However, ALL of them are rather monotonous, if not downright frustrating from time to time.  Need to puzzle out a mini-game over five or ten minutes for some cash once, that's okay.  Need to repeat that same puzzle a dozen times with hardly any variables changing, each lasting the same five to ten minutes?  It's boring and tedious.  I spent twelve hours in the game, and I would have been much more satisfied with the experience if it were cut in half.  ...At a bare minimum.  And when a mini-game causes you to savescum a few dozen times, there's something wrong.  This is a piece of work that asks you to consider your choices and their consequences, so its aim has gone awry when you're in a postion where you find yourself quitting and reloading to go back to previous saves.Due to the nature of how this game plays with its choices, I know that I missed a lot of content by making the decisions I did.  There's a lot left to see and experience.  Normally I'd be gung ho to get right back into it to see everything I could.  ...But not with Always Sometimes Monsters.  I didn't finish it excitedly to see what ending might unfold; I finished it over a few play sessions, each start more and more begrudgingly, only to get it done and out of the way.  I was not invested in my character or the world or the emotions it tried (and failed) to stir within me.  I was only pushing buttons to see what the game had to offer, and in the end I wasn't all that interested, surprised, or all that enthralled.  For a ""cerebral"" game that wanted me to think or care, it failed with me.   It doesn't stand up to similar ""head space"" games.  Gone Home made me curious and sympathetic.  To The Moon gave me wonder, tugged at my heart, and literally brought me to tears of joy and sadness simultaneously.  ...Always Sometimes Monsters far too often made me slump in my chair, toss back my head and roll my eyes, and caused me to breathe out grunts of annoyance and exasperation. Thus, I can't recommend it.  Sorry, Vagabond Dogs.  I wanted to like it.  It just didn't do it for me.			"

												I lit a camp fire for some old coot, it gave me the option to walk on it and I died horribly - 10/10In all seriousness though I would give it closer to a 6/10, with only a soft-recommend due to some game design choices.It's a hard game to point out my exact reason for the just slightly above average score without getting into spoilers. The story is really the reason to play this and how choice in it was handled at certain points (in terms of game design) are why I had to take points away.Suffice it to say it was a geniunely interesting journey, that is designed in such a way to turn the decisions you made throughout the game into a meaningless illusion, all the while it sold itself on the idea that it was doing the opposite.Anything that truly determines the final outcome happens within the last few moments and you're given full control in choosing them right then and there regardless of past actions.That is a pretty major flaw for this sort of game in my opinion. It makes everything else you had given serious thought and consideration into choosing pretty much pointless.You could theoretically experience all endings on a single playthrough if you save before these final choice moments, then reloading and playing the last 10-20min~ while choosing different combinations of options ""A or B"" instead.That's really not what the game makes itself out to be while you're going through it all, and all things considered I found that fairly disapointing to discover.Bottom line is; It creates the illusion of your choices throughout the entire game mattering and being the cause of your end result. However that is just not how it plays out or how it was designed to work, which is unfortunate since it would otherwise be the thought provoking work of art many people claim it to be.			"

												Amazing game!It's a very dramatic and emotional kind of game. The money I spent on getting this game was worth every dollar.Almost Sometimes Monsters revolves around  you , or your character. You are faced with many choices that are obvious and hidden. The game touched some very sensitive issues which is really unique and sometimes confronting.Almost Sometimes Monsters focus on the bad side, the flaws of the world, so don't expect the typical happily ever after or kiss in the sunset. When I played the game, I knew there were some really disturbing scenes, but I didn't think that it would make me really uncomfortable, whilst playing the game I felt that I grew closer to the characters, the situations, the consequences.My favourite part of the game is not the tragedy, but the freedom and the many paths you could take. It's like playing a game made by Telltale Games mixed with Rockstar games. I played this game without getting any NPCs killed...I think...Actually there's this one jerk who really ticked me off, but I regretted it afterwards.If you like RPGs, drama, violence, and tragedy then this is the game for you! I can't wait for a new game (hopefully not disappointing) from you Vagabond Dogs! ♥  "

												This isn't like some triple A. You don't make choices buy clicking a button. You don't make choices by choosing from two. You make choices with your money and your time, similar to Papers Please.This is a phenomanal game in which you, having been kicked out your apartment with little money to your name, must journey across the country to attend the wedding of your ex and win them back. I haven't beaten this game yet, but I'm a chunk of the way through. I think I've pretty much won. I guarantee you I haven't.The choices you make define who you are. I killed a woman, or put her life in serious risk, for $30 towards my salvation. I fell on and killed a man attempting to destroy a city, all for money I never got. I made children watch their father die for a car. I made some horrible choices. Consequnce is real in this game. The choices I made I never believed would result in death. People are dead because I need to go across the country. When you are desperate, every choice you make seems to harm those around you.Always Sometimse Monsters is scary. It's not a horror game, but its scary because it explorers the consequnces of our actions. My character may starve because I payed my rent, for an apartment I never even needed. I just felt it was the right choice.The choices we make define who we are. In Always Sometimes Monsters, it's a journey of self discovery.			"

												This game is very interesting, I thought it was post-apacolyptic at first due to the title lol, anyways after I played it for a good amount of time I stopped because I wanted to explore other games. Giving credit to this 8-bit story it is excellent, it kept me playing it for days until I had to play others, I loved it and it kept me interested along with very desired to play more. It is a game where you have to choose between one thing and another and your actions affect your choices and it will reflect upon that throughout the game. I realy recommend this for the great price of a good time :)Things that stood outStory: hands up 10/10 I loved it!Level design: 8/10 (very cool but I got lost and couldnt find my way arround until I looked everywhere)Lasting Appeal: 8/10 kept me very interested in the storyOVERALL 8.75/10			"

												Cemented  in the struggles of everyday life, Always Sometimes Monsters focuses heavily on the morality, ethics and distance we are willing to travel for our desires. Although it suffers a little from linearity (choices against this essentially end with 'you did this, game ends here then'), there are many different paths and decisions you can choose to follow, and for that I highly recommend it.P.S. you'll regret selling ladybird :(			"

And what would you do to get it back?Would you raise hell, saying the end justifies the means?Would you cherish, but forget? The end is over. Move on?What if then I told you this object, this person, was substance?This substance is something every person - alone, single, and in a relationship wants.It has many names, it has many faces. It is generally called 'love'There are many roads that intertwine, section off, and go their own way. Yours, and Mine.But all roads start from a Source.10/10.			"

												Love this game! This game is so much fun =). The game is not perfect but it is still a super fun game. First of all I love the choice system. It feels like most choices effect what upcoming choices in the game. Some choices also change how the city quest will work completely. I love the music, though sometimes a little repetative if played right you will not have to live with the same song for long. Money in the game is hard too come by that I think is normal =P. Some people might find it cheating but I was able to keep around $200, with any extra in my bank. I would save then buy 40Scratch Cards. After Scratching them I would turn in all the winniers and if I was over $200 I would put the extra in my bank, save again and start over, If not over 200 I would just reset. I only found I needed too do this in the second town where I was a couple hundred short for the bus pass. Also I would take your time to get to where you need to go in the game. I didn't realize durning my first playthrough that my extra days left meant nothing and it just skipped too the last day =P. Had I known this I would have explored and spent more time in each town. Overall I love this game, It was a whole lot of fun, my first playthrough took roughly 10Hours. I don't know if I got a good ending or bad but I know I wish I had ended it differently. So Onto my second playthrough!			"

It has a story with ton of choices for you to craft your characters the ways you like but IMO, it's outcome is limited which is a little disappointed. To add to that, the epilouge is like ""hoho, do have anything to do?"" and BAM!, hints that you should play again. I don't like this at all.But the fun is what you do, right? I do what I want, get what I want the first time playing. Good music to sooth the mood, met tons of brilliant characters, and take what you have done.

												Very interesting game. Good for people who enjoy simple 'create your own story' type games that aren't focused on the graphics. Took around 15+ hours to complete, worth the cash. Fun experience. The beginning is the best part, as the game progresses it turns away from the fun type of atmosphere it starts with. The atmoshperic change is mainly cause by the storyline gettng progressivly darker and predictable in order to match the very begining sequence. In my own opinion, Markansas is the glue that keeps the beginning atmosphere going to the end. Either way, I recommened it. Tons of funny innuendo too, Sofa King Fast, Master Baiter's, ect...			"

												I was extremely intrigued by the premise of this game - all the social commentary and whatnot.  However it was not well executed.  What I spent most of my time doing while playing was walking around the city looking for which building I was supposed to go into to trigger the next story event, and playing an excruciating mini-game that seemed to be intended to show how boring working an assembly line is - if that game concept isn't fundamentally flawed, I don't know what is.  The art is pretty mediocre, the music is unpleasant, and the menu system is awkward.  I tried to feel for my character - that's obviously what the game is about - but at the end of the day, I just didn't feel for him enough to endure the rest of the game.  I played the game for about 4 hours before giving up.			"

												This title first and foremeost had a very solid style of delivery and it's soundtrack was really nice. On the onset of the game you have the choice of selecting your own main protaganist and their significant other before the game launches you into its main story. Filled with countless moral decisions that render a few different endings. It's story is pretty good with a lot of random sidequests/minigames that help propel itself forward. Overall, it was a pretty interesting style of delivery and character development. Only thing that sort of fell through was the ending. It just felt as if it had a really fun buildup (9  hours of it) only to deliver a really short and swift ending. In the end the final decisions help you decide what your sense of a 'monster' is. But seeing how exactly you or the other characters impact eachother is kinda of shortsighted. Still a fine title 6.5/10			"

												I really wanted to like this game; I forced myself to play for almost 15 hours of it and just can’t bring myself into playing anymore. For a story driven game it has shockingly bad writing. The game is about the struggles we face in everyday life, yet the story was completely detached from reality. I mean, there are actions can potently lead to the deaths of multiple people without any repercussions, even though you *spoiler alert* wrote it into a journal which you published into a book!And you know the scene in the dark alley at the start? That’s what got me to keep playing because I wanted to see how the rest of the game tied in to it. Guess what? It doesn’t. Those characters showed up at the very end, and are completely shoed in to justify the first scene.The writing is also extremely pretentious. It spends too much time talking about philosophy of right and wrong, rather than showing through their action of its character. Which is a wasted opportunity, as many characters has potential for development (like Mark). The saying “show, don’t tell” really applies here.The gameplay is pretty much non- existence. Which is fine in “To the Moon” (another story-driven rpg-maker game), because it’s short and to the point. While in this game, I spend 15 hours in this game and still haven’t finished it (I watched a let’s play if you are wondering how I know the ending). It is drawn out and tedious, which would have been okay if the story was good, but it wasn’t.All this would have been forgivable if the developers weren’t so ♥♥♥♥ing pleased with themselves. It’s okay to be proud of your work; it’s also okay put yourself in the game as a character.  What isn’t okay is *spoiler alert* to have a book in the game called “Always Sometimes Monsters” and calling it a masterpiece, and saying that “nothing captures the human spirit quite so well” which it clearly doesn’t, and of yourself show up to offer the author  1 million dollars to turn it into a game.With all that said I hope they learn their lesson and make a better game next time, games like this are few and far between.

												Don't get me wrong, this game has it's moments and is worth $5, but I'm just here to warn you that this is not a choose your own adventure, this game gives you the illusion of choice for everything, but those choises do NOT matter.  There are almost never consiquences in this game for making a moraly bad decision (like killing someone or stealing their life savings).  This game also gives you the illusion of being a long game by having many moments of walking back and forth LITERALY FOR HOURS.  There are points that in order to finish I had to spend 2 and a half hours walking back and forth pressing space-bar so the game would continue.  This is less of a game of making decisions and more of a 'playable' movie, only you aren't playing the movie, but a completly seperate game. meow.

												I have nothing nice to say, but I have put near 8 hours into the game and spent money on it, so I am going to vent a little. Always Sometimes Monsters isn't just a let down on my expectations, it's a let down of a game. It fails at the one thing a game should always prioritize on being: Fun. It fails as being fun. It fails at telling an immersive story. It fails at pacing. It fails from a control standpoint. However it doesn't fail on one aspect. It doesn't fail at being a chore. It's so anti-game that it hurts me. I hate being overy critical, but when I invest the time and the climax is a massive disappointment, I can't help but be this way.Is it the fault of the developer? In my opinion, I don't always believe so. Sure, it's easy to blame them cause I mean they did create the game after all, but it was their vision at the end of the day, and they weren't wrong for producing it. However, it is their fault for having a premise, and making it a long grind of futility and boredom. It's so damn boring. I can go into more details in a future edit if people REALLY want me to but every other review has done a good job of dealing with the details. I just wanted to vent over how disappointed I was.  "

												Personally I don't like the game but I know why a lot of people could like it. The game is great if you like to choose your own destiny and not kill zombies or throw poop at monsters. I like games that you can choose your own destiny but ASM is to slow for me and the controls ain't the most fluid (that doesn't matter that much). ASM has a lot of gametime because there is a lot of different stories and characters. I really did try to like it but I just don't find it that fun.  So to conclude this review I wouldn't recommend ASM because it's too slow and nothing really impressed me but if you really want to try it out wait till it's on sale.			"

												Reading the synopsis for Always Sometimes Monsters I thought it was the coolest thing, since I'm a huge fan of simulation and create your own destiny games. Started out pretty good, and went downhill after about 2 hours.It just didn't deliver as much as I thought it would. It was tedious, unbelievable, and unsatisfying .Let's start off with ""tedious"". To make money, there are various jobs in the game. Jobs like packing meat or tofu into boxes, or sorting weed or other plants into baggies. And let me tell you, they are no fun. Most people know of the infamous packing boxes into a truck scene. You could literally spend about 25 minutes going back and forth putting these boxes into the truck, and if you think ""Let's see what happens when I get to 100!"" you will be very disappointed, my friend.For the ""unbelievable"" part, I just mean that some positions you're put in don't make sense. Really. This game tries to be dramatic and put you in ""hazardous"" situations, but it just comes off like it's trying too hard. Like it really wants to make your character's life miserable. And you know how this game is basically about you trying to get to your ex's wedding? There's a plot twist (a pretty obvious one) that is totally unbelievable, as in, unrealistic. If you really look at the characters' backgrounds, it doesn't make sense. Seems like it's just there for the sake of having a plot twist.Now for the unsatisfying ending, no spoilers. Like I said, I love games where the decisions you make affect the story, but in the end, no matter what you do you'll get the bad ending (and that's not a spoiler. You actually start off at the end of the game). I played several times to see all possible different endings, and even when I did everything to get myself the best possible ending, I still ended up homeless. I just don't understand.Don't get me wrong, I don't regret buying this game. I still play it every now and then. It's got it's perks as a game with a lot of stuff to do and decision to make. I'm just adding some criticism since all the other comments here seem to be pretty positive.Just saying, expect to get frustrated and question a lot of things.			"

												Always Sometimes Monsters is an RPG developed by Vagabond Dog to simulate survival in modern society whilst driving forward a constant storyline revolving around your chosen character and partner that you choose at the beginning of the game. The responsibility of choosing your own way in life and making important decisions really grabbed my attention when playing through this. It is not your average RPG in which you play a linear story making choices that don't necessarily affect the state of the world and the relationships you have with the people in it, Infact, the choices you make will definately affect the world around you and the way that you are treated by other characters definately towards the end of the game.The visuals are pretty standard for an RPG of this type, but the attention to detail is definately worth a mention, If you want an interesting visual experience and a great story, this game can definately provide you with both. There are a few graphical problems, particularly with the Hospital Lobby area, the food plates seem to be hovering in mid air and are being eaten by people standing at the ends of the table instead of being sat at it, I don't know if this is a known problem, or if vagabond intend to deal with it, but it isn't an experience ruiner for sure, so don't let it affect your opinion too badly.The music in this game is incredibly atmospheric, and provides a lot of mood setting for the particular towns and areas. The Laser Destroyer Team did a great job on it and they should be proud of the masterpieces that they produced. One of my favourite tracks is 'Hit the Town', and I suggest you give those a listen if you're into 8-bit themes.TOTALS:Graphics: 6/10Sound: 9/10Story: 9.5/10 (Absolutely insanely good, but not perfect in every way)Polised? --Couple of minor scratches 8/1032.5/40Overall experience rating: Garunteed memorable game!""RPG lovers will love such a personal and exciting experience ;3"" - Bunnieth "

												It's not that easy to judge this game... It was fun... SOMETIME. It was boring... SOMETIME. It has unxpressed potential and there are a couple ""flaws"" that I didn't like that much. It's intentionally repetitive and ""not epic""... the main charachter is a really mediocre person, not even a antihero. It was hard to sympathize with her SOMETIME. I liked the experience, overall, but SOMETIME I was thinking it was too long. Dialogues are usually good, SOMETIME great, SOMETIME annoying or boring. Even the story, that is the main part of the game, because the gameplay it's definately not so great, is not so interesting.So... It's hard to judge the game. I think it's... AVERAGE. :) Some people will like it a lot, some people will hate it. I say average ;)+ Music+ Many possible endings+ Some interesting choices+ Some dialogues+ Some humor and some adult theme (racism, violence, sex, freedom, death...)+ Mostly realistic (maybe too much)+ Choices usually matters- Some dialogues- Sound effects- Repetitive tasks - Main character - Felf too long- The main story afterall - Retro graphic not cool6/10			"

												If you have a low attention span, and cannot enjoy a game without somethng blowing up. This game is not for you.If, however, you can immerse yourself COMPLETELY into the roll of the character that you assume, and live their life, you will enjoy it. The main story is engrossing enough, but HOW you carry out and achieve your end goal (is your end goal what you think it is?), is where the real beauty lies.I spent the last 4 and a half hours contemplating every move, and decision. No matter how hard you try, no real answer is right... or wrong. It's definately adult themed, and younger gamers probably will not appreciate this game. You will have to been through, some, ehem, real life♥♥♥♥♥♥ and seen real life♥♥♥♥♥♥ to understand some of the depth of this game. Personally, this game is one of my all time favorites.			"

												Fantastically put tofether game. This is really a roller coaster ride all the way through, there's so many things that happen and so many different ways to play it. You can go from playing it like a game and playing it like real life and you'll see different outcomes. Although there's not tons of different endings, from what I see from other talking there are still some subtle differences throughout that add up to a completely different experience depending on how you decide to play.All in all this is a very replayable game, a very touching game, and one I would definitely recommend everyone who likes touching, emotional pieces of any kind. 10/10			"

												SPOILER ALERTI don't recommend this game because it doesn't suit me to be an sjw.I understand that it's not ye olde action game or rpg and all that but it isn't fun either. It's cliché, it's like someone grabbed a story from fan fiction and ported it into an rpg full of stereotype characters, stupid as hell karma consequences that are either black or white and neither necessarilly right or wrong, that try and fail miserably when trying to make you feel guilty for them.As for story and characters, they are bland, trivial. The whole point of the story is to drag yourself into an empty envelope - your avatar - and let yourself get dragged into the most crazy and unrealistic made up cliché scenario - to get back to your lovelly ex wife that dumped your♥♥♥♥♥because your stupid essay or whatever was taking a toll on your romantic relationship. If this wasn't what all single neckbeards dream about. (being engaged in the pursue of their waifu) then I don't know what it is. Hence such a high rating for this video-game soap opera.Since there is no surprise here, the whole point of the game is to get back to your dearest ♥♥♥♥♥ ex girlfriend to whom you were engaged with. You meet her when your lame♥♥♥♥♥room mate that starts stalking the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of her asks you to go talk to her. Then you ""steal"" her from him aftert she clearly tells you she's annoyed by that ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ that seems not to do anything productive ever but for some reason gets extremelly attached to you and insists on making you feel guilty for the success you take of your own hard work.Well later on you find yourself moneyless and you have to make money to travel from town to town in order to get to her. I liked that. What I did hate was that I was expecting to meet interesting characters but instead I only get dragged into the most babbysitting and stupid situations by spoiled little ♥♥♥♥♥ that can't keep their♥♥♥♥♥♥together. And if I don't help the miserable♥♥♥♥♥♥♥it's like the game implies I'm a terrible person and I get guilt tripped into helping these idiots and losing precious money on them that I could be using for my own ordeal.Well later you find out that apparently your ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ex tries is getting married because his fiance invites you to the marriage. Once you get there you find out she's getting married with your lame♥♥♥♥♥roomate from college that spent his days jerking off while you did all the work. See? soap opera.Instead of moving on with lilfe, I don't know, get a job in another place, move on, you still insist on dragging yourself to the guy's bachelour party where other crazy stuff happens and you have to give out all your work because your idiot ""friend"" blasted his money in the casino and people are threatening to kill him. So the whole ""lesson"" I took from this game is. If you have an ex and she dumped you for a mentally challenged individual, don't be spending months of hard work so you can go see her wedding. Move on, get a life. There are other women and employers out there.  "

												This game is like no game I have ever dream to play. It's like a life simulator. It has a dark-ish general story and all, like most games, but you get to decide how to get there. I know, I know. You heard that before, right? Well I will honestly say that this game actually achieves that idea in a way where it makes you think about your life and how you want to live it. I dream to make games like this. It takes you on a journey you (Hopefully) won't forget. You get to pick your main character and his/her love interests (which is a great design and makes you connect to your character more). If you like story driven games, this is for you and I suggest giving it a playthrough (If not more, because trust me, you will want to play it again to see if you can get a different ending or maybe make a better choice then you did before). This game will start with a confusing beginning but it'll all make sense at the end. Now this game does have a couple of cons that I have to state at least. This game is heavily driven on text. If you're not a big fan of reading, you might want to stray away from this game. You will not appreciate it all if you can't appreciate the text. Now that being said, I did spot a FEW mistakes in the spelling and some mishaps on pronouns. For the grammar nazis out there, I just laying that out there. But for a game that probably has over 5000 words in it, 1 or 2 mistakes is just being human, or just being sometimes monsters... SORRY! Had to throw that somewhere in there!To shorten this up though, I'll just make a pros and cons list:Pros:+A great story that leaves you thinking about your life+Choices that make an impact on you+Humorous at times+Well designed (for a RPG Maker game)+Great CharactersCons:-Few Spelling/Grammar errors-My ending made me feel the feels! ♥♥♥♥ you for your feels!Rating:8\10			"

												This was a game that, after seeing many reviews and recommendations from friends and family, I finally purchased and played through myself. I am not disappointed in that purchase. It is by no means a perfect or flawless game and at times I did feel a bit frustrated, especially when I was trying to gather money just to keep my Stamina up, but I felt that the story was intriguing enough to keep me pulled in.At first, some of the missions and things you do seem pointless or unrewarding but they ARE worthwhile. Another big thing is that I found it extremely helpful to have multiple save files. The biggest thing to remember is that there are many different paths you can walk in this game than the one that is directly presented in front of you.			"

												This game. My god, this game.I admit. I cheated many times using the save & load method during the gameplay to get money (especially at the casino part, I even managed to hit a big one). But apart from cash grinding (I mean seriously - I spend like a in-game week at the second city to afford a bus to Salt City) this game kicks you in the spleen every time you make even theoretically void decisions. Even leaving a bag of heroin on the ground will have fatal consquences.This game asks you a question - what are you capable of to reach your loved one? Will you feed your inner monster or strain from immoral choices?I don't recommend it to those with faint mind - most likely after finishing this, it will leave you depressed for a couple of days.And I let my loved one choose Sam.

												This is my first review and I give this game a 9/10 for being so great.I literally played this game from the start until the end without any toilet break well cause the game is that good. I actually was emotinonally and physically drained ( well cause I did played this game a few hours straight into the night) by the end of the whole game. I actually felt connected to my character and the choices I made in the game depicted the kind of person I am. It sends you on an epic journey of life and choices which represents the person playing. Honestly, I teared and had trouble sleeping after the game because I DID SO MANY BAD THINGS and I regret alot of them. This game really gets you thinking about life and things bigger than us. It has one of the best story plots despite being a little cliche about things. But this game is totally worth you money if you are looking for a nice entertainment and evalutaion of who you are as a person.AWESOME GAME!			"

												This game has an amazing charisma inherent in its lively attitude in contrast with fairly horrible events, and although gameplay is a bit repetitive, this makes it all the more rewarding when you progress. In spite of this, the game doesn't feel fully fleshed out, as it has areas where complex situations keep me interested, while other areas had me considerably bored.Overall, I wouldn't call it an amazing game, but it presents enough of interest that I would recommend it to anyone who hasn't had their morals questioned lately.

												A great branching adventure game where your choices really impact the way to game plays out, both leading up to the ending and the ending itself. It can be serious and grim at times but it also has a good sense of humour at the right times. General gameplay reminds me of Shenmue, walking around and talking to people, performing jobs and (optionally) collecting figurines but the story and themes are more mature. If you like adventure games and story driven games where your choices impact what happens, this game is definitely worth playing.			"

												I'm not one for these types of games, but this one was well worth the price. I also don't write reviews, but this was well deserving of one. In the game you are not someone that needs to save the world or a group of people, your a normal person living an everyday life with everyday challenges. I loved how every choice you made would determine the outcome of events. I replayed the game over and over again to get every possible outcome of the events and every possible outcome of the main story event. I know that this is just a game, but this one was very moving and really touched me on the inside. It was a very well thought out game and well written. This may sound childish, but I cried a little at some parts, laughed at others, and cried a little more when I finshed the game. It's confirmed there will be a sequal, so excited for that.

												Interesting premise and I loved the first couple hours of the game. However I cannot recommend the game as it gets unsatisfying and tiresome once you're used to the concept and past the first couple hours. +Refreshing premise +Funny dialogue at times -The jobs are tedious and repetitive-The story is great at first but begins to come off a little pretentious as the game really likes to hammer in discussions about love and fate and yadayada-Many of the features in the game feel unfinished. For example there are tons of items/buildings that don't have any impact or use on the game despite them seeming like they would (I'm looking at you, Union Clubhouse). This wouldn't matter so much if it was an open world game with lots to explore, but this isn't. Stamina matters very very little. The collectible indie figures in the game have no impact/achievement/worth. Also theres still an annoying but harmless bug near the end I won't list (spoilers) -Minor complaint, but the UI is a little clumsy. And the controls aren't listed in the game for some reason (esc is the back button)-Underwhelming endings or endings that don't really make sense.-Despite multiple endings, little replayability since most of the game will be the same despite your choicesIt's worth trying out if you got it off the humble bundle or on a great sale, but otherwise I'd skip it			"

												Just now found out about stuff after the credits. So everything below this was before that. Sorry for the rush, I couldn't help it. Okay so the stuff after the credits is just minigames. Absolutely love it. I got this a while back, but never played it. I ended up deleting it from my computer until I saw someone play the beginning and decided to reinstall and play it. I'm glad I did. I don't remember exactly when, but I think I started around 5pm and played until about 11am, near the end of the game. I just now finished it, and I'm going to be replaying it from the start soon, after I see how the ending is affected by a certain choice at the end... As for an actual ""review,"" here we go:Always Sometimes Monsters isn't like whatever you're thinking it is. The game opens on a scene where you meet someone in a dark alley as you're attempting to quit your job as a contract killer. If you choose to listen, then you're told a brilliant story of the concept of choice, and an interesting tale of what it means to love someone. You'll be spending a lot of time doing odd jobs and making choices. In fact, those are the two main things in the game. There are some minigames, but they're all very easy and simple. Which is good, it keeps your focus on the story. The themes and choices in the game can range from incredibly dark to light hearted, though much of that is determined by you. I can't give this game a high enough recommendation. If nothing else, the humor and view points presented in the game make it worth playing through the end. My only complaint is that the in-story twist and the out of story twist are both too obvious, but that never really takes away from the experience. Though it does make me want to go back to that one choice and see what happens. The inclusion of the developers is a great touch, especially the Dubstown building. Again, I can't recommend this game enough. I absolutely love it and I feel like anyone who plays it will come away with something, even if they don't like Always Sometimes Monsters. Lastly, as just a note about something, at the very end of the story, ""his"" was said in reference to Sam, even though she was female at the time.			"

												I recommend this game with reservations.Always Sometimes Monsters is a tricky game that is not easy to get into. Without flawless execution, you can end up with a very bad ending, and since you are most certainly playing for the narrative and not the gameplay, that can be quite disappointing. Beginning the game, its pretty easy to feel disconnected. Generic lines in the beginning with a not-so-edgy start. Personally, I have never been a fan of RPGMaker, so if you are like me, this could drag you out of the experience. Lots of mini-games which can add up to the game itself feeling like it is very lacking. While I do recommend this, I recommend it only to people who are willing to lose gameplay for more story. 6.5/10			"

												I applaud this game for letting you not only choose your avatar, but also your love interest, only to have the latter taken from you, with the game being about trying to get them back. The writing is fine; it felt more... honest than usual, I guess. My main issue is that it SEEMS like there are things to do besides the main quest, but really those just end up as distractions, and you're better off doing what you need to do to finish the main quest. Including save scumming at a casino. Would like to see what the group behind this could do with a big budget.			"

												If given four words to describe the contents of Always Sometimes Monsters, they would all happen to begin with the letter 'C':  Coincidence, circumstance, choice, and consequence.  Unfortunately, if I were to give a letter grade to the overall game and my experience, I would have to be quite forgiving to remain using the letter 'C'.A ""life simulator"" if you will, this is a game that plants you into a world where your hopes and dreams haven't proceeded as planned.  In a time where it has become a struggle to earn enough money to pay for food or keep a roof over your head, you find yourself invited to a wedding in a distant city.  You are tasked to find your way there within a month's time, and along the road many scenarios and options are presented to tailor your experience in exactly how you will (or will not) achieve your goal.The freedom of choice is apparent upon starting the game and persists throughout to an extent.  Sacrifice to help a friend or be selfish?  Take sides with party X or organization Y?  Take the high road or the low?  Many situations might give you pause to stop and consider your choices before committing.  Do you want to retain moral character or will the means justify the ends?  All of it is left to you as the player and will ultimately decide your fate.In the end, however, I was left rather unsatistfied with the game as a whole.  I felt as though my personal choices led to the same general path I might have ended up at had I gone the opposite direction.  Sure, one or two characters would have had different opinions of who I was in the end, maybe they'd be there in the final scene or maybe not.  But what impact did I have on the world?  ...Very little, it seems.  I chose to go with more of an upstanding citizen and aide (though not in EVERY scenario, hence the appropriate title), and as a result the choices seemed rote.  As a game that asks you to make difficult decisions, there was never a moment where I felt like I NEEDED to break out of the role I had chosen.  It felt no different to a Mass Effect game: if you play a paragon character, you make paragon choices in just about every situation.  Therefore, for a game all about choices and consequences, Always Sometimes Monsters rarely presented anything that felt meaningful.  As for the ""game"" part of the game, it's pretty messy and rarely flows well.  Conversations are held up and constantly prolonged with bubbles floating above characters' heads displaying elipses or hearts or exclamation points, none of which can be hurried with button presses or disabled in the options.  Just as disrupting is a big clock that pops up and remains on screen for at least a full five seconds whenever each ""stage"" of the day transitions from one to the next.And the mini-games.  OH, the mini-games.  Some exist to reward you in the form of money or key items.  Some are there just to spice up the world and give you something else to do off the beaten path.  However, ALL of them are rather monotonous, if not downright frustrating from time to time.  Need to puzzle out a mini-game over five or ten minutes for some cash once, that's okay.  Need to repeat that same puzzle a dozen times with hardly any variables changing, each lasting the same five to ten minutes?  It's boring and tedious.  I spent twelve hours in the game, and I would have been much more satisfied with the experience if it were cut in half.  ...At a bare minimum.  And when a mini-game causes you to savescum a few dozen times, there's something wrong.  This is a piece of work that asks you to consider your choices and their consequences, so its aim has gone awry when you're in a postion where you find yourself quitting and reloading to go back to previous saves.Due to the nature of how this game plays with its choices, I know that I missed a lot of content by making the decisions I did.  There's a lot left to see and experience.  Normally I'd be gung ho to get right back into it to see everything I could.  ...But not with Always Sometimes Monsters.  I didn't finish it excitedly to see what ending might unfold; I finished it over a few play sessions, each start more and more begrudgingly, only to get it done and out of the way.  I was not invested in my character or the world or the emotions it tried (and failed) to stir within me.  I was only pushing buttons to see what the game had to offer, and in the end I wasn't all that interested, surprised, or all that enthralled.  For a ""cerebral"" game that wanted me to think or care, it failed with me.   It doesn't stand up to similar ""head space"" games.  Gone Home made me curious and sympathetic.  To The Moon gave me wonder, tugged at my heart, and literally brought me to tears of joy and sadness simultaneously.  ...Always Sometimes Monsters far too often made me slump in my chair, toss back my head and roll my eyes, and caused me to breathe out grunts of annoyance and exasperation. Thus, I can't recommend it.  Sorry, Vagabond Dogs.  I wanted to like it.  It just didn't do it for me.			"

												Amazing game!It's a very dramatic and emotional kind of game. The money I spent on getting this game was worth every dollar.Almost Sometimes Monsters revolves around  you , or your character. You are faced with many choices that are obvious and hidden. The game touched some very sensitive issues which is really unique and sometimes confronting.Almost Sometimes Monsters focus on the bad side, the flaws of the world, so don't expect the typical happily ever after or kiss in the sunset. When I played the game, I knew there were some really disturbing scenes, but I didn't think that it would make me really uncomfortable, whilst playing the game I felt that I grew closer to the characters, the situations, the consequences.My favourite part of the game is not the tragedy, but the freedom and the many paths you could take. It's like playing a game made by Telltale Games mixed with Rockstar games. I played this game without getting any NPCs killed...I think...Actually there's this one jerk who really ticked me off, but I regretted it afterwards.If you like RPGs, drama, violence, and tragedy then this is the game for you! I can't wait for a new game (hopefully not disappointing) from you Vagabond Dogs! ♥  "

												Going into this game i was on the fence it had a lot of bad reviews and negative comments. I waiting till it was on sale and picked it up for 5$. What i got was a good suprise. IT took me roughly about 10 hrs to finish my frist playthrough and i will probably go for  another playthrough in the near future. I dont review games often but since all of the negativity this game is getting i thought i would put my opinion out there. I liked it alot and whish there was more like it out there. The decisions you make in this game are important and a lot of the time you will be stuck between a rock and a hard place and will have to make immoral decisions to make sure that you achive your goal, getting to San Verdano. This is a indie game and the writing is very witty and humourous at times but falls flat at others there are also a few typos here and there. This is a game about life and it may be a bit grindy at times but isnt normal life a grind going to a job from 9-5 on weekdays justo earn a living. This game is trying to simulate the same thing. To get to where you want you need to work hard while that nmay get boring in this game it is worth it to advance and go on your journey. There are multiple ending with the game but i was pretty happy with mine :) enjoy people this is a very underated gem.			"

												Always Sometimes Monsters is a game i would recomend. With witty dialouge, questions that define you morales, and all those dark points in the game. Well writen, it provides quite the experiance. However, my problem with the game isn't a sucky ending, or a simple point of insult, much rather my proble lies in the game itself... literaly.There I am, about to make an important choise, or just walking down the hallway, or just transitioning from place to place, then all of a sudden my screen goes black. The audio is still running! I can still access the windows screen! Nothing is frozen except for the game. Even worse, I have to start all over again! You see, it effected all my saves, and packing boxes over and over again is not fun. I tried to uninstall it then reinstall, didn't work. I went through the games files and it didn't work. Until this bug is fixed, I'm afraid it puts a handicap on the amount of enjoyment you can have. I still recommend it though, and I realise that not everyone will have this bug, but i hope that such a bug is fixed soon.			"

The choices throughout the game were intriguing but I didnt feel attached to the characters in a way that made the consequences meaningful.If you really want to get invested and FEEL something play ""To the Moon"".

												Ok so you want wondering if you should buy this game and you are looking in the steam user reviews and you happend to see my review and you see what i have to say. well what I have to say is this. This game is a great game for people who like a thick plot and choices that can change everything you know that is near and dear to your heart. if you don't...then just don't get this game. here are the pros to the game. The graphics are phenomenal the player and npc sprites are nice. the world is good and the top down perspective just makes it all work really well together. The dialog is really nice it makes you feel as if you are the character and you are talking to the npc. Now the game play is pretty good. it plays like the over world in the old pokemon gameboy games were the character is in a overworld and he can go into biulding and interact witht he nc int he towns, or in this case a city. Now come the cons. when you start the game it doesn't really tell you when you are selecting your character it just puts you in a room and you have to figure out what you have to do. for some people they will get this rigth away and have no problems, but for other they might be wondering what is going on. this is only minor thow because it will let you change your character if you are unplease by who you selected. Sometime the game will delete you saved data and you will have to either start from a auto save or start from scratch. I only see this as a minor problem and will really only affect you if you are far in the game or just don't like doing thing more than once.overall this is a good game and I would recommend this game to anyone who likes game where you are the one who is making the big decisions and doesn't mide reading for about five minutes. (that the longes I have read for one dialog)			"

												This was a delight to play. It has an old school feel to it. I would have liked to see the game a little longer and see some of the events and characters play out a little longer. I have always liked realism in games and it has it in spades. Dark, real, gritty. I also love how redemption is a possibility for the main character. This game does have choices though and they matter. I played through trying to get the girl in the end. It plays through in about 10 hours and that is if you try to do everything. The music is incredible and had me humming the different songs for days after playing. 8/10			"

While I can absolutely see the philosophical value to it, but the game is paced like molasses and did not give me an opportunity to care about the characters.Can't recommend unless this unless you are the type of person who can sacrifice gameplay for something a bit more cerebral.

												Alright, I think it's been enough time since I've played this game to give an accurate review of it. To preface this, I went in with high expectations due to watching Jesse Cox play this game on Youtube, expectations that were MET in the BEGINNING of the game anyway. The game looks good, the writing is solid, and the minigames to get money are fun.... BUUUUT the entire game is hamstrung by a time-constraint that you need to be at your Ex's wedding by a certain time, on top of which the 'variety' of choices you have really boils down to two equally unappealing prospects, which you pick the one which sounds the best. To make matters a bit worse, there aren't even many apparent consequences OF your actions beyond what you can imagine.  That normally wouldn't be a deal-breaker, but then, due to my neurotic nature, I looked up how to best play the game and what I needed to do, willingly spoiling the ending for myself and.... Seriously? The entire point of this game is to go through trials and tribulations so that you might be able to achieve SOMETHING right? But no, spoiler alert: No matter what you do, the ending will suck. That is a deal-breaker for me, when you build up a game that is actually REALLY good starting off, but then you decide to give a bad ending no matter what? That's just... Terrible writing on the dev's part. The game has its moments, and if you're in it for the mini-games, or some of the decisions, then good, but if you are wanting a good ending as a sort of payoff for putting in hard work and becoming attatched to your character, then you'll be in for a big disappointment. Hopefully some people liked this game, and it's a good try for the devs, if they do make any more games, hopefully they'll think ahead and see that setting up every ending as a kick in the groin ISN'T a way to please fans.

												You start off on the bottom.Rock bottom.Your life is in pieces and you set out to put it all back together.And from there, the adventure is up to you.With the theme of desperation always lingering, will you resort to doing immoral things to add some bills to what little money you have?Will you invest some of your precious time into making friends, or would you rather be a lone wolf in the world?How far will you go to win back the love of your life and have a complete restart in your life?There are some choices in this game which I find to be irrelevant, and some mechanics I found to be useless But if we go storywise, I'd consider this as somewhat of a masterpieceIt's not the first of it's kind to have dark themesIt's definitely not clear of useless parts in it's storyBut it opens your eyes a bitIn the numerous towns and cities you go to in your journey, you will see many disturbing things that are actually things that happen in real life There are some characters that you might grow to hate, their sharp tongued, selfish and hypocriticalThey're humanIf theres any word that can summarize my whole take on the plot, it's humanWhether you like it or not you will definitely make choices in this game that would give you second thoughtsAnother thing I'd like to add is how realistic the ending isEven if you try and think you made all the right choices, you're probably going to get the bad endingYou have to work really hard to get a ""Good"" ending, or at least where your character is happyIt's human in that the end will always leave someone on top and someone rock bottomIt's a human world, and humans are Always Sometimes Monsters			"

												This is the best of its category I've played on steam. I didn't think I'd like it and then I just didn't stop playing it all day. I finally put it down and haven't picked it up again. It is an RPG about reclaiming lost love. Don't expect battles of any kind other than an economic battle. You have to wander through the streets homeless until you make it, and life and your own goals will keep dragging you down. Despite that description it's not at all depressing.

												I spent about two hours on this game, and it basically is a mid-20s simulator. Sure, you can do stuff like work at a tofu factory, and it's plenty ironic, but... why? Why bother?It's basically a jrpg without any fantastical elements. While this could easily have stood up on its own with a strong story it feels like simply a bunch of random sidequests strung together in Portland with the numbers filed off.

												****SPOILER WARNING****For lack of better words, I went in on this game. For the most part, I agree with a lot of the negative and Petrel opinions of the game and I don't bring up the well-mentioned issues they bring up. I just add things that annoyed me.****SPOILER WARNING****From the beginning of the game with the hitman and the casino owner/gangster wannabe to the politican election in Beaton to somehow inheriting Mark's car trouble in more then one way and lastly the threating to kill or killing of Sam for a debt she made less than 24 hours ago... all of these issues raise nothing but questions about the story or is just straight up illogical.Why are the hitman and casino wannabe important to the story... why is the opening scene important at all? None of it is need for the dark descent someone has to take at the end and nothing comes of the hitman sudden desire to not be a murderer. If you shoot, the game automatically ends, so what's the point of them and the scene?Why is it necessary for me to get involved with the election in Beaton? I get that doing so speeds up the game, but the fact that a random, powerless, struggling writer from another town comes out of no where and ends up the sole desider of an election. Even if you choose to not go through with it, your still deciding the outcome. That's just ridiculous. Could have used this time to flesh out Larry and his wife, which is far more interesting and it would be more believable for your character to solve that issue as well. ( the vent thing is just wrong as wel).Why do you inherit Mark's car problem? Why would he volunteer to help when he didn't have the means to help?... Why does this section of the game exist when you could GO WITH LARRY, who's knows your going to the wedding, and is going himself? nuff said.Why does the Sam debt dilemma exist? She just got the debt. I get that it's to start drama, but if you wanted to start drama, make Sam a cheater that gets caught or make his/her try to steal the journal for just his/her own selfish gain or to ruin you out of spite for dating the ex they liked in the first place. Hell it can stay the way it is. Just make a scene where he/she has to tell the ex about it and the gamer could either be the bigger person and help smooth things over or use the opportunity to raise hell or something.All in all, the game is ok despite these and many other immersion breaking things going on. I recommend it for it's general concept is refreshing, but you might want to turn your brain off to fully enjoy.P.S. Dev cameos are fun, but it's a bit over done in this game. "

												This game was like playing a visual novel disguised as an RPG, which wasn't a bad thing at all. A couple parts feel a little farm-y, like the boxing and casino minigames towards the end, but overall was very enjoyable on my first playthrough.By the time you finish the game, at least the first time, odds are you've been able to guess the ending, but that doesn't make the choices feel any less impactful. In fact, for me, it directly influenced my endgame choices.I definitely enjoyed playing it through, and even though I know how it goes, I'll be going for another few playthroughs just to see how my decisions change the gameplay and ending.Overall, this game is probably good for at most 4 or 5 playthroughs if you're just looking to see the endings, but there are so many little subtle things that you can experience that don't directly impact gameplay... they're more of little side-events that you get to see, so there's definitely still room to enjoy the game beyond ""I've seen all the endings"" and I'll probably play a few more times through, just to explore... then I'll put the game away for a while until it feels fresh again, which I think it will. That's part of the beauty I see in this game: almost anyone will be able to relate at least somehow to the events that play out.It's a shining testament to what people can create with the RPG Maker tool with a bit of creativity and a unique approach to game design.

												If you're into a long beautiful story, full of downfalls and choices, this game is definately for you.From choosing you character, to the people you choose to side with, all of these will greatly affect the game in general. Be black and get racially picked on, or a hot burnette and get the world to show you love and help, the choice is yours. The game surprisingly mirrors real life very well. Poverty, corruption, sex, all in it. But then again, its your choice if you wanted any of this to happen. I finished the game with a fantastic ending, will you?After all... aren't we Always Sometimes Monsters?(huehuehuehuehue)10/10, wouldn't mind a continuation, or at least a DLC to feature a different story or something.

												This is just awesome. One of the best videogames, storywise especially, i ever played. The fact, that you're roleplaying yourself and are able to weave you're own life (and SO) into this, makes it so relatable. But moreover, the dialogues and characters, the relationships and up's and down's of everyone seem so authentic and just realistic. Of course, there are some ""deus ex machina""-like nudges for the sake of being a videogame. But this doesn't hurt. In fact, this game perfectly captures the balance between story, openness while still being a game at heart. The artstyle is a bit grim but mostly simple, yet realistic and authentic. Music is very nice and fits the themes of the cities.Gonna make more playthroughs, there were just so many interesting decisions and choices. All in all this might be the most realistic or authentic videogame i've ever played.Many props to the creators, and thank you sooo much for not only giving the players same-sex options but also for avoiding stereotypes and making a gay relationship natural while playing the game. I really found many relations to my own relationship. Exceptionally well executed.			"

I'm honestly not sure how much I'd recommend this game; it's ok, but not the best for me. But I guess, it /is/ a bit replayable, especially if you've taken a pretty big break between each time.			"

												I wrote an amazingly long review that glitched out and didn't post, so I'll keep it brief.DISCLAIMER: I played the game with a friend the whole way through, and we were goofing off from the very beginning.  That might color my views a little bit.This game was responsible for both my best experience in gaming, and the hardest I had ever laughed at anything.This game is not a good story-driven game.  The choices you would expect to matter don't, and the choices you would expect not to matter do.  For example, you can steal from a rich old woman who trusted you or literally murder a man in broad daylight with no consequences, but selling a dog results in it being trained as a boxing animal that you have to fight later on, which makes things much, much harder.The game doesn't give you enough time with it's characters to really feel bad for them.  This makes sense given the setting of the game, but it's still a point against.  You need to develop a character if you want people to appreciate it when they get broken down.  You can't just introduce characters and then instantly have them kill themselves or get shot and expect me to feel sorry.  If I felt sorry for those sorts, then I would also feel sorry for every random enemy I shot in an FPS.It never made me feel sadness or remorse even though it constantly tried.  In fact, it was how hard it tried that made me laugh most of the time.  Some parts are obviously intentionally funny, and are funny due to being outright ridiculous, but most of the games humor came from it trying way too hard to be tragic in a way that made me feel like I was laughing with the game, not at it.  It is hard to explain.There's no way to describe all the times the game made me laugh without spoiling it, and even then, it needs context for you to really understand.If the developers were trying to make an amazing comedy, they succeeded and are absolutely brilliant.  Humor comes from the unexpected, and this game is paced and marketed perfectly for that.  If you think about the hardest you have ever laughed, chances are you aren't thinking of a joke a comedian told.  You expect comedians to be funny, and you expect funny games to be funny.  You expect sitcoms to be funny.  That expectation lowers the potential.  It can make you laugh, but not quite as much as things that aren't supposed to be funny.If this game was developed to be funny, it is the greatest work of comedy ever devised.It has just the right amount of soul-crushing, boring gameplay where nothing interesting really happens.  The majority of the game is walking through towns and talking to characters you will never see again, about things that don't really matter.  It's that drought of fun that makes the bright spots all the better.I can't even tell if it was developed to be funny or to be an interesting story.  The perfection of the pacing leads me to believe its supposed to be funny, but the marketing, and the amount of people who apparently didn't think of it as a hilarious experience make me think that maybe it wasn't supposed to be that way.  Maybe I only think of it that way because I played it with a friend the whole way through and got it for free off of a humble bundle without really knowing what it was or what it was supposed to be.In short:  Play it with a friend and expect nothing.  Forget you ever read this.  You can use skype screen share while the game is in windowed mode to play it with a friend and talk at the same time, that's what we did.  (sorry steam but your steaming service is bad at the time of this review)If you do that, you might just have as much fun as I did, which will make it well worth two feet of subway sandwiches.			"

												After the 2 hours I played, I think I have a pretty good feel for what the game is going for. I can't connect with my character very well, maybe because the only thing I can relate to is having lost someone I love, but I'm not looking for jobs/places to sleep all the time. That aside, even though I can't feel emotional attachments to my character, I am so interested in this game! I can not wait to see the wedding or see what happens when my character finds ""Forehead"" (the name of the girl cause it's so ♥♥♥♥ing huge.) This game has a great music theme to it, goes well with the graphics, and though the gameplay is mostly just doing jobs/daily activities, there's more to it than just that. It may sound like a boring survival game because you do need to buy food to survive, find places to sleep and earn money, but it puts you in a different concept. The applications in this game aren't something most people see everyday, which is why I think more people should play this. It has a great change of perspective on the economy and people.			"

												Always Sometimes Monsters sounded like a wonderful idea for a game. But the gameplay and story feel very boring and dry. I tried playing up to 2 hours to try and convince myself that it would get better before I decided to refund, but the quality remained the same. This game failed to hook me quite right and lost me. It also isn't clear on which direction one can go with their choices and where to go and what there is to do. I am a person that loves story driven games, however this story didn't catch on with me.			"

												Always Sometimes Monsters is an intriguing game where your decisions impact the narrative. While not an entirely new concept, this game manages to keep things interesting most of the time. Gameplay The gameplay in Always Sometimes Monsters is primarily about making choices. In the beginning of the game, you choose your character by deciding who to toast with at a party, and then choose your love interest by going to the balcony and talking with one of the many characters. It makes character selection more interesting than just picking from a menu. Also, you are able to choose from a diverse group of male/female characters and can choose to be either heterosexual or homosexual.There is an in-game clock of sorts that breaks the day up into 3 parts - morning, afternoon, and night. You can do one job/event per time of day, and some tasks require a certain time of day. After completing the task, that part of the day is automatically over. This is where making choices comes into play. You have to decide what you are going to do for each segment of the day, and the choices you make during those jobs and events affect the way the story unfolds. You have 30 in-game days to reach a particular destination (I won't spoil what that is, since it is a major part of the story).There are some mini-games as well, but to be honest, they were not too interesting to me. I tried each one once or twice, but I did not have the desire to revisit them. Lastly, there are optional figures to collect that feature characters from various indie games, though I'm not sure if they serve a purpose other than to be collected for fun (they can be sold to the pawn shop for a little extra money, but I preferred to keep them in my collection). Story I won't spoil anything, but the actual game starts one year after the party I mentioned previously where you select your character. You are basically trying to get your life back on track. There are several main areas in the game, and each has its own story and set of quests you will need to do in order to make it to the next area. This is unfortunately where the game is hit-or-miss, since it is a story-driven game. Some characters and events are intriguing, while others just simply are not (at least in my opinion). However, keep in mind that I only played through the game once, so my choices may not have led to all of the most interesting events.Dialogue is good about 70% of the time, but the rest of it is not quite at the same level of quality. It feels like certain parts are trying to be very mature, but they don't always quite hit the mark. It's not terrible by any means, but just something I wanted to point out. There are also some spelling and grammar mistakes that I encountered on more than a few occasions. It's not a deal-breaker, but those kinds of mistakes sometimes took me out of the moment. I understand that this is an indie game and it's not easy to find every little mistake during the development process, though. Sound The songs are pretty cool for the most part - simple yet catchy electronic music. Be aware that there are some songs that got annoying after a while, but only if I was in a particular area for an extended period of time. If you really love that type of music, you may not find it to be too annoying. I just felt like there was a lack of variety. The sound effects were fine and I have no complaints about them. Conclusion Despite its flaws, I do recommend this game. It was made using RPG Maker, and as someone who has used those tools before, I must say that it is impressive what these developers were able to do with it. If you enjoy story-driven games where your choices matter, then Always Sometimes Monsters is worth your time.			"

												Always Sometimes Monsters provides a very realistic and rivetting story in which the player is forced to make difficult descisions based on their own morality. As I played through I found myself making choices that I personally believed to be less than admirable, but when faced with awful alternatives it seems as if there is no right or wrong choice. Always Sometimes Monsters does not necessarily set out to make a statement, but under the gritty reality that you are faced to face in this game there are definitely lessons to be learned.			"

												I heard some great things about the writing, the storyline and how  you choices and actions would affect things.  After four hours, I feel like that time was wasted.  There is a lot of money grinding and action grinding to push the stages along, and the caricatures disguised as people have become insufferable.  Nothing really felt like it was having any effect on the overall story, and realizing that the main plot of this game is really to profess the fact I can't get over my ex after a year and do it them on their wedding day is a trope and a somewhat pathetic story when used in B-List Rom-Com movies.I really wanted more, and after only reading the reviews at this point, it doesn't sound like I will get anything more out of it.

												I don't know to say for who ever is reading this.[SPOILERS KINDA]Frist off, I feel like this game is either overwhelmingly positive or overwhelmingly sad depending on your decisions. I really wasn't expecting my character to get really depressed and go insane because he lost his girlfriend. I thought i heard him say during the game that it would be worse if he stayed home and didn't do anything. I was expecting if I did get rejected that my character might live an ok life without the girl. Not going insane and becoming homeless all over again.Secondly, I really didn't enjoy myself 75% of the gameI feel like if there is some part where you are supposed to enjoy it, it is at the end if you get the good ending. From some of the other ""your descions will impact what happens in the game"" type games that I have watched and played, I've enjoyed myself more. The main parts of those games are enjoyable and captivating. The only enthralling part in this game was the things in Salt City you had to do. Besides that Dubstown and Beaton weren't my peice of cake. However I do understand that Dubstown had to miserable because you had to start from the bottom to get to the top.At the end, I think what i want is a neutral ending. Something where i'm fine not getting the girl. Basically do away with the whole gun holdup seen at the beggining and end of the game. BUTTTTTT, All in all this is a pretty great game. Great soundtrack. The deign great most of the time(some characters are drawn worse than others). Deep characters. Great plot. 8/10			"

												Reading the synopsis for Always Sometimes Monsters I thought it was the coolest thing, since I'm a huge fan of simulation and create your own destiny games. Started out pretty good, and went downhill after about 2 hours.It just didn't deliver as much as I thought it would. It was tedious, unbelievable, and unsatisfying .Let's start off with ""tedious"". To make money, there are various jobs in the game. Jobs like packing meat or tofu into boxes, or sorting weed or other plants into baggies. And let me tell you, they are no fun. Most people know of the infamous packing boxes into a truck scene. You could literally spend about 25 minutes going back and forth putting these boxes into the truck, and if you think ""Let's see what happens when I get to 100!"" you will be very disappointed, my friend.For the ""unbelievable"" part, I just mean that some positions you're put in don't make sense. Really. This game tries to be dramatic and put you in ""hazardous"" situations, but it just comes off like it's trying too hard. Like it really wants to make your character's life miserable. And you know how this game is basically about you trying to get to your ex's wedding? There's a plot twist (a pretty obvious one) that is totally unbelievable, as in, unrealistic. If you really look at the characters' backgrounds, it doesn't make sense. Seems like it's just there for the sake of having a plot twist.Now for the unsatisfying ending, no spoilers. Like I said, I love games where the decisions you make affect the story, but in the end, no matter what you do you'll get the bad ending (and that's not a spoiler. You actually start off at the end of the game). I played several times to see all possible different endings, and even when I did everything to get myself the best possible ending, I still ended up homeless. I just don't understand.Don't get me wrong, I don't regret buying this game. I still play it every now and then. It's got it's perks as a game with a lot of stuff to do and decision to make. I'm just adding some criticism since all the other comments here seem to be pretty positive.Just saying, expect to get frustrated and question a lot of things.			"

												Personally I don't like the game but I know why a lot of people could like it. The game is great if you like to choose your own destiny and not kill zombies or throw poop at monsters. I like games that you can choose your own destiny but ASM is to slow for me and the controls ain't the most fluid (that doesn't matter that much). ASM has a lot of gametime because there is a lot of different stories and characters. I really did try to like it but I just don't find it that fun.  So to conclude this review I wouldn't recommend ASM because it's too slow and nothing really impressed me but if you really want to try it out wait till it's on sale.			"

												I've really tried to enjoy this game, specially after reading so many positive reviews about it. I enjoy story based games, and the premise sounded promising enough to catch my attention. But I can't do it, I can't keep going on.I'll start by saying that I don't mind the graphics, or the RPG-Maker, or the really crappy sound effects. And if I have to point out something positive, I'll say that the music is pretty decent. But the story... It tries to hook you up in a plot of moral dilemmas and hard choices, about a young person out of luck, alone in the cold, uncaring world. But every time the game was about to catch me in it, a blatant change of tone, terrible inconsistencies would break any immersion I was having. The game tries to be dramatic and emotional, but any kind of tension is completely diluted by continuous 4th wall breakings, silly jokes and unnecessary collectables.It also tries to sell you that your decisions matter, but they hardly do. For example, at one point, you might not have enough money to pay for a room, and find yourself sleeping in the streets. Which at first I thought it'd be terrible and a real handicap while trying to find a job and get back on my feet, turned to have absolutely no consequences.  You'd think that sleeping under the stars, among the hobos, not being able to take showers or change your clothes would have any negative effects in your health or social status, but no. You search for food in a trash can, heat it up in a burning barrel and sleep on a dirty mattress in a creepy alley, and then go to work as a top notch reporter in the local newspaper, then go dance at the expensive club at night. Just before you go back to sleep to your hobo alley. By the time I had enough money to rent a room, I didn't even consider doing it, because there was no point in doing so, at least, that I could see!And on top of that, to get money, you have to do little mini games that are absolutely tedious. And I've played Papers, Please, and Cart Life, games that played on routine and struggling with your life every day, and enjoyed it. I couldn't keep playing Always Sometimes Monsters.			"

												A story heavy, RPGmaker game with decent dialogue. I stopped playing around Day 6. It's not engaging enough for me as I would like to feel investments in my character making an impact. There's too little direction for my taste as well especially considering it's not exactly open world. There's a story here and I'm sure it's pretty good, but the gameplay is not engaging and not to my tastes. May come back and complete at some other time.			"

												This game is basically a non-combat interactive story where you can make a lot of choices that will have consequences, so on the game has multiple endings. I really like those type of games and I think it's pretty well done in this one. The game can be pretty dark, but that's one of the reasons as to why I like it even more. It really shows that life isn't all roses and it does bring across several messages. Even though those things are not always perceived the same way by people, nor can I agree with all of them. But that's an entirely different matter. The story was interesting enough to keep me wanting to play and near the end of the game I'd actually gotten attached to my character, which is always a good sign. The game comes with many mini-games for jobs and also in the shape of arcade video games your character can play which I thought was a nice touch and I enjoyed them, although I've seen people say they found the jobs tedious to do. Regardless from that possibly being the case for people, I still think it's not something that would stand in the way of enjoying this game for all it's other aspects. Overall this is a pretty brilliantly composed game, especially considering it was made in RPG-maker by a small studio of indie-developers.			"

												Fantastic game that I've played many times over. You feel real attachment to not only your own character and the ♥♥♥♥ they have to go through, but quite inexplicably, you find yourself yearning to be reunited with your character's ex, which I found surprising considering how little is revealed about them until later in the story. You just know from the moment you start a new game that the person you choose to play and their other half (also chosen by you) are meant to be together and that's it. Perhaps that's what it is to be human...but then humans (like the title of the game suggests) are always sometimes monsters. Sometimes you might find yourself doing bad things, for yourself, to try and achieve a greater good that you are aiming for. This game lets you explore that concept and it is utterly captivating. I hope Vagabond Dog do more games like this, because it will be an instant buy from me.			"

												OK this game is good. Its real good. However I understand that its not for everybody. First when it says it's story driving, it ain't kidding. The only form of gameplay in this game is just talking to people, walking around, and answering prompts. However, it doesn't lessen from the story at all. In fact, it actually adds to it. Without the need to focus on combat mechanics and such, the writing takes the centerstage and it deserves it. The story starts out with you trying to get your lover back. In a month. Before they get married. Its got heartwarming moments and characters and some pretty funny dialouge. Its choices are pretty heavy too. Some may seem unfair and sometimes the outcomes can seem a bit extreame but the story does a great job by making you feel like you have all the control for most of the game. My only problem with the game is that for you to get the good ending you basically have to look it up. There is a requirment you must reach before you go to the end zone and no one tells you about it at all and there is no way to actually know about it (as far as i am concerned). I suggest that if you do want to get the good ending you are going to have to look only that part up. The rest is up to you. I enjoyed it a lot and I look forward to vagabond dog's future games. I hope they have some soon.			"

												I bought this game after I read the summary because it sounded interesting. I played it for almost a whole day until I got stuck at the boxing part. I really think the boxing part of the game is not fair. It doesn't seem to fit the gameplay and it feels out of place. It's so much more difficult than the rest of the game and it is so challenging and random. I really like the game, but I feel like because of the boxing I will ever be able to get to the ending of the game. I think it should have been created a bit easier. Also, I think jobs should give more money. It's very repetitive and could get boring after a while. Without these things I feel like I would have gotten a lot more enjoyment while playing Always Sometimes Monsters.			"

												This is one of those that I wish Steam allowed for more than a rigid ""yes or no"" for reviews. I, personally, have problems liking this game and getting immersed enough with the story and mechanics (which actually at some points seemed off putting and monotonous) Of course it's hard not to give the game props for its visuals, though as stunning as some of them are there are still a few small errors where one resource doesn't quite look like it matches with the rest of the objects of the map (unfortunately a few of the tiles they used from the Futuristic tile pack looked like this for me, but I'm not sure if it's because I know those tiles or because they actually do have a completely different look from the drawn looking resources made for this game)There are other reviews that summarize the story so I'm not going to get too into deconstructing that, but I do have quite a few issues with how things are setup and certain writing through out. Many of the characters (including sadly enough some major characters) come off as very flat in the writing. I also noticed a few minor grammar errors (unfortunately I forgot to note them down since I usually play games through Stream to unwind) but it wasn't anything that really detracted from the intended meaning and took maybe a second longer to process. I do typically like stories and games that try to look or deconstruct moralistic views, but this many times felt a bit like some kind of agenda was being pushed and instead of feeling (as a player) free to pick whatever path I wanted; it seems very clear a lot of times that there's still a very right or wrong option.  Because of this, I don't quite feel like it achieves precisely the level of control over ethics and consequence that the game devs pitched (or maybe I'm just looking at it wrong)Really, one of my major issues and a problem with the game that I don't like at all is it suffers from making a lot of maps just way to big, or at least it feels that way due to not being able to run on some of them (heck, even on the outdoor maps where you are able to run they just feel way to big sometimes; especially since most of the time to get the story you'll probably only go into about half of the buildings available making the rest just extremely large pieces that take up space)Actually, overall it suffers from the wrong kind of padding; as mentioned before the maps are a bit too big occasionally meaning you'll be walking over them many times and many of the actual gameplay elements are either RNG to the point of being annoying or just monotonous actions and possibly prompts. Removing or changing these to a more understandable setup for to the player might have been better, except the game wouldn't have been near as long (I'm up to about 5 hours [that's the total on the save file] right now; that's just for one play through and I haven't even actually reached the ending yet) or probably have as much gameplay.   Also, as nice as it is that the game has its own music, the tracks all get rather annoying pretty quickly; it's pretty unfortunate that there's no way to just turn off the music after awhile.None of this is to turn others off from playing, though; clearly even though it does have these problems there are still quite a number of people who absolutely enjoy what the game devs managed to create with this game and it's still quite possible that you could, too. It just happened to not be a game I enjoyed and that's perfectly okay.			"

												This is one of the few games that I've played that actually feels like an authentic experience. Always Sometimes Monsters offers decisions that actually affect story and plot progression, which makes allows you to experience the game in your own shoes. Overall, its a good story and interesting experience. I will say that the moments where you had to grind to move on were a bit tedious. However, I do think it adds to the overall tone of the game, and am glad that the developers decided to add that in.			"

												A well crafted and enjoyable RPG, Always Sometimes Monsters is a nice getaway from what many might conceive to be a bland market. It has quirks and charms that you don't find in many games, and the gameplay is well paced and not overwhelmingly long, leaving the player content at the end. Music and sound are good, dialogue tends to be pretty decent, and the storyline is almost believable - again, something reasonably rare for a game.Only real fault I can find is that it may take a few hours of gameplay to pull you in, but I'd say it's worth it for the finished product. 7/10 for sure			"

The plot I feel resonates best with most 20+ year olds who have been broke / heartbroken at some point and provided a good escape for me.  I enjoyed all the meta and adult humor in it but I didn't like that the main character's life revolved around getting the main love interest back.  It would've been nice to have an ending where the main character realizes they are fine on their own or finds love along the way with someone else.			"

												Always Sometimes Monsters definitely the best Newgrounds-esque game I've played (insofar as it is RPG Maker, but with more effort than most games of that type).  And it's precisely the type of game that makes me wish there were more options than a thumbs up or thumbs down.  The game isn't bad.  Like I said, for the tech level the devs were working with, I'm actually very impressed.  But the dialogue and the writing is so damned pretentious and unrealistic that I found myself rolling my eyes at every second sentence.  It honestly felt like reading something a 16 year old would write after taking his first course in philosophy.  And for a game that puts so much on its story, that's bad.  It's really bad.As for the game itself, why would I want to play a story where the character has a less interesting life than I do?  As soon as I found myself homeless and working odd jobs for money, I needed the story to keep me in the game.  And as I mentioned, the story is too full of itself to carry the experience for me.  I'm a fan of indie games, and I really wanted to like this one, but I couldn't bring myself to give it a really fair chance.I can't recommend the game, but if it's the type of story you're into, and you can stomach the writing, there's something there.

												Here is a good system to determine if you should get this game:1. Have you played To the Moon? If yes, go to 3. If no, go to 2,2. Play To the Moon, go to 33. Did you like To the Moon? If yes, go to 4. If no, go to 6.4. Are you a masochist who would genuinely enjoy a depressing and hopeless story that makes you feel lower than the dirt in the gutter that you step over on your way to work every day? If yes, go to 5. If no, go to 6.5. Play this game...and enjoy being miserable.6. Liberate tuteme ex inferis. (Save yourself from hell)Imagine, if you will, if To the Moon and Tell Tale's the Walking Dead had a baby...and then both parents immediately died after the birth to leave the child in the care of Spec Ops: The Line. That child would grow up to become Always Sometimes Monster.tl;dr - the above is all you need as far as a recommendation is concernedIm seriously on the fence about whether to truly recommend this game. On one hand, it is well written and has a genuinely engaging story. On the other, it makes me want to shove glass under my fingernails as penance for ruining everybody's lives.Youll notice I mentioned To the Moon a lot and for good reason: this game feels like it came from the same developer. Its an 8-bit retro game thats pretty much a serving plate for a really good story (To the Moon was infinitely better, though). You dont sit down to enjoy the plate; the plate is just the method of delivering the food (aka the story). And boy does this food taste like depressing sadness cooked in a fine horrible-people wine...*spoilers* *spoilers* *spoilers* *spoilers* ...and rants belowDont say I didnt warn you. 2 final thoughts/rants (on the story):This game presents itself as a decision based game...its a dirty liar. All of the story elements happen irrespective to your decisions, and in more than one situation I actually had my decisions hyped up as being super important and then the game pretended like the decision never happened. One particular moment stands out:Youre offered to either spend 3 days hunting down 3 car parts through tedious side-quests to fix up a car and win a race...or spend one afternoon to cut the opponent dude's brake line and have him burst into flames literally right in front of his 4 little children (I was in a hurry, dont judge me...though it was hilarious after the fact). The next day, the guy who put you in the situation in the first place, set up the race, a true blue Christian from head to toe, is a pastor at the church, and LITERALLY just presided over the dead dude's funeral with his little children crying ""DADDY NOOO"" goes up to you and acts like nothing happened and is like ""Hey! Ready for that car trip Whatsyourface?"" in the most cheery way possible. The decision is only mentioned once more in one of the game's many random pointless questionnaires that means absolutely nothing about whether you regret your decision. Consequences? In a game based entirely around consequences?! Pfft, pass...Lastly, the ending was a huge ****slap. Basically, there is no happy ending; dont even try, youll just screw things up even more. There is literally nothing you can do to get back together with your love interest. Dont believe me? Do some Googlefu and you will.Since Steam forces you to give a yes/no recommendation, I chose my opinion because I am a little happy I played this. Beware, though...this game is definitely not for everyone.			"

And the choice is completely taken from you if you want to win your love back. You would have a better time writing your own story. Maybe buy this game when it gets a 99% off discount.

												This title first and foremeost had a very solid style of delivery and it's soundtrack was really nice. On the onset of the game you have the choice of selecting your own main protaganist and their significant other before the game launches you into its main story. Filled with countless moral decisions that render a few different endings. It's story is pretty good with a lot of random sidequests/minigames that help propel itself forward. Overall, it was a pretty interesting style of delivery and character development. Only thing that sort of fell through was the ending. It just felt as if it had a really fun buildup (9  hours of it) only to deliver a really short and swift ending. In the end the final decisions help you decide what your sense of a 'monster' is. But seeing how exactly you or the other characters impact eachother is kinda of shortsighted. Still a fine title 6.5/10			"

												The one thing this game has going for it is that you can tell it was a labor of love.  It feels very personal, as if the developers created it without the intention of showing it to anyone else, and there's something charming about that.Unfortunately, the awkward writing, the nonsensical plot, and especially the really tedious gameplay (culminating in having to gamble up to a ridiculous amount of money to get the best ending) are too much.  There were several pretty annoying glitches, one where events weren't triggered at the right time and resulted in seeing the same dialogue more than once, and one where a minigame was just completely broken.  I also found it way too easy to accidentally select dialogue choices when hitting the button to advance through the text.But as I said, there's something kind of charming about it.  So I played through almost all of the game until I reached the part I described in the spoiler, and then I just decided it wasn't worth the time and looked up the endings.  I can't say I didn't enjoy it, there were moments where the writing was actually great, but I can't really recommend buying it.  Perhaps watch a playthrough on Youtube so you can skip the tedious parts.			"

												Fantastically put tofether game. This is really a roller coaster ride all the way through, there's so many things that happen and so many different ways to play it. You can go from playing it like a game and playing it like real life and you'll see different outcomes. Although there's not tons of different endings, from what I see from other talking there are still some subtle differences throughout that add up to a completely different experience depending on how you decide to play.All in all this is a very replayable game, a very touching game, and one I would definitely recommend everyone who likes touching, emotional pieces of any kind. 10/10			"

												FUN! Definitely reccomend for the 50% sale price!! Great choices that really do matter and put you in the quite the dilemma, but all the while without moral judgement. Great to see a game where your choices actually really matter (I'm still looking at you ME3!). My only major detraction is that it is probably better to save multiple times near the end in order to see all endings from one save file, as I'm not sure the endings alone warrant a replay. However the story itself will be very different - so if you can stomach it youll get at least 2 plays out of it.			"

												I like that it's a much more personal and character-driven RPG. No saving the world to be done here, it's just you trying to deal with the consequences of your failures. The moral choices aren't terribly complex, but they do a good job of exploring the game's central theme: Is it possible to be a truly good person, or as the title suggests, are we always sometimes monsters?

												Surprisingly catchy!I got this game out of a humble bundle, and I started playing it without ever looking at the store page. It is very confusing, because it is unlike most of the other games you can find on the market.This is a game about life. Somewhat like The Sims, but this isn't about building a stable life, but rather about surviving a difficult life for a month, and try to get back the love of your life. Also much darker than the sims.At first it will be boring and annoying, just like life. You need money to live, you need to work to get money, and nobody likes to work. But in the middle of these boring, work-filled days, you will be faced with several defining choices... And the next thing you know, you finished the game, and you feel like you just finished watching a really good movie or reading a really good book. And even though it is only a bunch of pixels, and not even particularly realistic, you will feel guilty for behaving like a real monster.			"

												Cash farming chores and uninteresting stor and dialogs  wraped up in pseudo ""moral dilemma, psychological adventure"" advertising. If You see indie game with no pressure on graphics and fireworks You would expect something extra in terms of gameplay or story or any kind of interesting experience - not in this case.Let me point it out why:gameplay - non-existent, unless You consider embarrasing pointless mini-games and tedious cash farming which is necessary for game progress a gameplay (then here you go there's plenty)story - maybe would be bearable with decent story-telling but here You have tons of uninspired dialogs which You will probably start click away at some point just to move on. What's imprtant You don't have real impact on what's going on You can only select which cash farming BS section You want to takewhole game concept - It supposed to be (as I understand) about non-hero who struggles to recover his life. Choosing in the process if there are some borders he won't cross to achieve that. Problem is You can't do any meaningful decisions and crucial characters are so unintersting that You don't really care what happens to them through the whole game.You want moral dilemmas and story impact - play the Witcher - at least You get fun gameplay and good graphics with it.

												This game is okay. Right now, it's on sale, which is when I decided to pick it up. Paying $10 for an RPG maker game with no replay value seems very silly, so I got it for $5 instead. It's a fun game, however your game is going to spent with tedious mini games, trying to earn as much  money as you can just for a good ending. I had no idea, so I'm stuck gambling. I recommend using more than one save file. I dislike the autosave feature. I also dislike that there's no option to turn off music (I looked, or maybe I just missed it.) So be prepared to have your own back ground soundtrack ready because the music is loud and obnoxious when you'd rather have something soothing or quiet. Not much changes depending on your gender or sexual orientation, though I like that you at least have the option to be a man or woman and gay or straight. That's cool with me! I think it's a good game to play once, but like I said before-- it has no replay value. I wouldn't recommend paying full price for it.			"

												My overall opinion: A pretty good game, it won't be liked by some people but I gotta say the story and the choices you make/say really did feel like a real choice and the ending wasn't set in stone and there are quite a few ways your journey may end earlier or differently(WARNING! THERE ARE SOME HINTED SPOILERS!)(This Is Just My Own Personal Opinion And How I Felt The Game Was To Me And You Might Feel Different To My Point Of View So Please Be Nice Kay? =)It wasn't a game where you can just get the best ending by just rushing to the end and picking the right dialog, it was focused on choices and life decisions that can cause your own story to end suddenly by taking the wrong turn in life. There are some flaws that I felt made the game feel annoying at some points like the boxing minigame or earning enough income in a short time open up another dialog option later in the story but without knowing all this beforehand you'll be left with just one thing, your own personal choice. (and this is without being a cheat and reading a how-to guide!)The epilogue felt open ended and you cannot revisit the previous town/cities to check up on how they are all doing and your main love interest (if you choose to persue it) simply locks him/herself in a room and you end up having a limit set of options you could do.I truely wished there was abit more to the story in the epilogue, I kinda felt cheated after going through everything just to have my main love interest lock him/herself in so I cannot see or talk to him/her and having it end just like that because I felt there could be abit more story between the main character and the love interest rather than relying mostly on flashback/dreams and maybe having them go together to revisit the town/cities the main character have gone to and see where it goes from there.Heres hoping for dlc or a sequel! but I doubt they'd do that, happens too often~ =P Anyways, this is a good game in which I will play again to see what else it has to offer and the main theme of the game is probably the choice in life and maybe something else =P , I hope you enjoy it if you do buy the game, its total recommended game to get!

												Probably one of the best games I've ever played. I enjoyed every bit of the game, truly, but here are the key parts.The first thing that I instantly noticed was how well the introduction was created. The first scene was a little bit bewildering and confusing since I had no idea what was happening. The first scene took only like three minutes, and that's when the magic began. The way the character and the lover were chosen and introduced was clever. Whereas most games have the character creation not really tied to the story or it's just there at the beginning related to nothing *looks at the Elder Scrolls IV* the character creation really made you feel like a part of the story right off the bat. One of my favourite bits was that you can choose anyone to be your character and you can choose anyone to be the significant others, and whom you choose doesn't have a whole bunch of effects. Sure, there might be a few gay innuendos from the friendly neighbour or some racist butt faces being racist against you and your *black friend (his boss)*, but there isn't anyone saying it's wrong.Because that's not what this game is about.As the developers have stated, the game doesn't care. It doesn't care if you decide to sell the dog to be a police dog, a fight pit dog, or return it back to the owner. The charm about this game is that it's not up to the game to make you content with what you do. There isn't anybody patting you on the back for doing the right thing (something that doesn't exist in this game, as you'll see) or someone telling you that you're a screw up if you do the evil thing (also doesn't really exist), it's practically only you who will be the judge of you. If you feel like you did the wrong thing, then you did the wrong thing. The game doesn't care, and it most likely won't impact you. If you feel like you did the right thing, then you did the right thing. Again, the game doesn't care.What really makes this game great is what I said before: it's special to you because you make it special. It's just you doing the things in the game, with very little forced upon you. You can take that screwdriver and pawn it off simply because you're short on cash. Whoever owned the screwdriver might be mad, but you don't see it, it doesn't effect you negatively. You benefit, he loses. Or you might decide to not accept the bribe. You lose some, others gain some. It's take or pull, but it's what you make of it. Have fun.			"

												Always Sometimes Monsters is a great little game about the choices you have to make and owning up to your mistakes. There are a few typos and lazily programmed bits and bobs in later areas of the game, so hopefully the two creators practise what they preach and patch it at some point. Other than that, it's very funny, pokes fun at itself, knows what it is, and has great replayability.			"

												Well that was a great game, let me tell you. That's what I call ""story rich"". Okay, not all the choices in the game have real influence on the ending (which would be perfect), and there's a tricky way to get good ending (no one wants to end up as a hobo, I suppose?), which forces you to play not as if it was you, but just pursuing your goal - and that kills a bit of fun. But still this game is great - the journey to get your love back throws you in different situations, where the choice is yours - act like a jerk to get money (rob an old granny, butcher some pigs, etc.) or be kind and receive moderate payment for your help. So go on and try - will you be able to get the love of your life back, making the right decisions and getting to the wedding in time. 8/10			"

												I'm a detail lover, I think that details are a really important thing, but in this game I didn't had to pay attention to the details to find rough edges because this game bugs easily, has a lot of louse ends in the story, a hunger system written by a very fat guy where you can't even pass the night if you eat 6 ♥♥♥♥ing sandwiches (Really, a normal person has enough with 3 sandwiches for a night) and a really rushed end that makes you think that the devs were tired of developing this game after the second town and ended up with making you loose around 15 days without any reason or story behind.Not only that but it's a cheesy games that makes predictable moves to try to make you feel depressed or something deep but ends up being boring as heaven.If you're a hipster you'll love it, if not, stay away from this game since it's the overshoot attempt of some american content white devs to show you how hard and edgy life is or some sort of cheap doomsday philosophy.I hate to hate on an indie game but they wanted to keep it real in his game, so I'm doing the same in my review.

( i don't know yet. maybe i didn't find more )- well.IT'S AN RPG MAKER KINDA GAME. it will be better if it was like 3rd person and hd thing,but it's allright.- SOME OPTIONS IS KINDA MISS. like when i choose ""not really"" option.it goes to ""no"",i believe i will be like "" whatever"" kinda thing. but again. a minor negative.either way. i recommend you to play it.if you like some visual novel.it just .THIS IS ABOUT YOU.( not really,but kinda a lot ) 8.9/10 bananas			"

												Pretty much a choose-your-own adventure game except with an incredibly vast number of decisions you can make. The biggest problem, though, is that there is no actual adventure. The first 20 minutes were just mundane, random minutiae. Nothing happened. Also, the dialogue is poorly written, the art is ugly, the engine is painfully bad, and the music is boring and repetitive. I could a very certain type of person who would like this game- someone who spends a lot of time roleplaying on Gaia Online and writes lots of Harry Potter fanfic. That someone is not me.			"

												This game has an amazing charisma inherent in its lively attitude in contrast with fairly horrible events, and although gameplay is a bit repetitive, this makes it all the more rewarding when you progress. In spite of this, the game doesn't feel fully fleshed out, as it has areas where complex situations keep me interested, while other areas had me considerably bored.Overall, I wouldn't call it an amazing game, but it presents enough of interest that I would recommend it to anyone who hasn't had their morals questioned lately.

												This game. My god, this game.I admit. I cheated many times using the save & load method during the gameplay to get money (especially at the casino part, I even managed to hit a big one). But apart from cash grinding (I mean seriously - I spend like a in-game week at the second city to afford a bus to Salt City) this game kicks you in the spleen every time you make even theoretically void decisions. Even leaving a bag of heroin on the ground will have fatal consquences.This game asks you a question - what are you capable of to reach your loved one? Will you feed your inner monster or strain from immoral choices?I don't recommend it to those with faint mind - most likely after finishing this, it will leave you depressed for a couple of days.And I let my loved one choose Sam.

												A great branching adventure game where your choices really impact the way to game plays out, both leading up to the ending and the ending itself. It can be serious and grim at times but it also has a good sense of humour at the right times. General gameplay reminds me of Shenmue, walking around and talking to people, performing jobs and (optionally) collecting figurines but the story and themes are more mature. If you like adventure games and story driven games where your choices impact what happens, this game is definitely worth playing.			"

												Always Sometimes Monsters is a game where you live the life of a broken adult, trying to reclaim their life but face many decisions that a normal human being would most likely never face. This is the story of your character, whom ever it may be, facing many everyday problems, from money to love. It is an amazing game that always managed to throw my emotions around and made me feel for the character. The one thing I would complain about this game is how the game handles money. Every ""main quest"" has some cash output for you to progress, but these ""main quests"" do not give enough money. After you are done with these ""main quests"", you are stuck to do an odd job at a employment agency to get the remaining cash to progress and these jobs are very tedious and boring, unlike the rest of the game. I would recommend this game to anyone willing to dish out 10 dollars and ~7-8 of their life for an amazing story and never ending music that WILL get stuck in your head.			"

												My girl left me, my publisher fired me, I'm broke, AND THE PROM IS TOMORROW!On a more serious note, this is a great game that got me geniunely involved with the characters. Most games make you abundently clear that the characters are just that- characters. But in Always Sometimes monsters, I really felt like they were real people, with real consequences for my actions. This isn't a game for everyone, but for someone who likes adventures, a smidge of romance, and grey-and-grey moral choices that could end in disaster or in triumph, this is a shining example of what an RPG should look like. My only qualm was that it wasn't long enough.			"

												Always Sometimes Monsters is an interesting look into a deadbeat writers life, as he tries to make it to his friends wedding. The story is interesting, the moral choices could have been better, and the game itself was kind of tedious. When you go into this story you REALLY go in, by working two repeating jobs at a temp agency, over, and over again. There is just a little too much dialogue, so it's easy to accidently skip through an important piece of the story. But overall it's an ok game, interesting visuals, pretty good story. 7/10			"

												I'm not one for these types of games, but this one was well worth the price. I also don't write reviews, but this was well deserving of one. In the game you are not someone that needs to save the world or a group of people, your a normal person living an everyday life with everyday challenges. I loved how every choice you made would determine the outcome of events. I replayed the game over and over again to get every possible outcome of the events and every possible outcome of the main story event. I know that this is just a game, but this one was very moving and really touched me on the inside. It was a very well thought out game and well written. This may sound childish, but I cried a little at some parts, laughed at others, and cried a little more when I finshed the game. It's confirmed there will be a sequal, so excited for that. Can'y wait early 2017 woooo.P.S. The music was phenomenal			"

That's about itThe Bad: The Choices are by in large illusory - they have little impact in the actual story The Dialog seems to have been written by a depressed Nihilist Parts of the game are exceedingly juvenile. Oh, and it's an RPG Maker game, which really is sin enough on it's own; Slow menus, Screen has to go to black to remove NPC sprites, and all the other cosmetic issues inherent with RPG Maker Games.The game just doesn't live up to it's hype.

												The game started off with a promising premise, but bad writing ultimately destroyed the game. The characters are very unlovable, there aren't enough development that makes you root for any of them; most of the lines they deliver are either cringingly corny or so hammy that makes you roll your eyes. The game throws so many errands at the player; it makes the gameplay very tiring. By the end of it, I just want the game to be over as I couldn't bring myself to care about it anymore.Lastly, for the love of all is good, GIVE THE OPTION MUTE THE REPETITIVE MUSIC.			"

On top of that I found the input/interface to be frustrating and would have preferred if the option menu had a delay behind the chat in terms of input, I missed so many options because I was trying to scroll through text. The idea was very interesting however and I think with some minor modifications it could be an amazing game.  I am not unhappy I played it, just finishing the game left me feeling incomplete in a way that I'm not satisfied being.			"

												Unlike most RPG's ASM takes place in the real world, dealing with more 'mundane' real world issues in more conventional ways. Instead of a story interspersed with combat sequences your main concern is simply gaining enough money to progress the storyline, paying off rent, getting money for a bus ticket, and things like that. Naturally the way to gain money is through work, and completing odd jobs throughout the game becomes its homologue to combat sequences and grinding found in other RPG's. Unfortunately the job aspect of this game is extremely tedious, although it doesn't take up a huge amount of the game seeing as it's the primary way to earn money I would've liked this process to be a bit more enjoyable. Luckily the work minigames are the only real portion of the game that disappoints. The story is refreshingly original, and tackles a lot of real world issues that were competently handled with a surprising amount of choice and consequence found in the games decisions, which can lead to several different endings. Morality is great here as well, with most of your choices leaning on the gray side of the morality scale.  The characters were well done but sadly the game is short,  so you don't get enough time to really care for the characters except for perhaps the protagonist.  I also enjoyed the soundtrack, which was better than what I expected for an RPG Maker game. The same can't be said for the graphics though, it IS an RPG Maker game after all, and it shows. Overall I'd definitely recommend this game for any RPG fan looking for an unconventional take on the genre, it's not perfect, and it leans on the short side (although it does boast a fair amount of replay value). What it does provide however is an interesting story that tackles tough real world issues with equally tough choices that actually matter, and that's a formula that inevitable leads to a great RPG.

Probably cause of the name and I had put off playing it for a long time after I bought it.Now that I've finished it though, I can say this much; this is so better than I expected it to be, I mean I was hoping it would be good and it took a long time or at least it felt long cause it's slow and I couldn't play for hours and hours. But this game is oddly realistic yet ridiculous. I mean; to give you an idea of what's in store, let's just list some of the♥♥♥♥♥♥I did in this:Bought drugs for a complete strangerSlept on the streets repeatedlyAlmost hacked votes to elect someoneWorked as a Prize Fighter for nearly a week, beating the absolute♥♥♥♥♥♥out of peopleTalked someone out of a possible suicide attemptBought more than 100 sandwiches, possibly 200Raced a dude to get a car back for a PastorAlmost did Crystal meth so I could get some cleaning supplies from a drug dealerGot invited to a threesome early on and ended up staying in the couple's apartment for like a week, no threesome thoBribed a doctor to fix a friend up by threatening to post pictures of him being dommed by a (android? hopefully?) teddy-bearWatched as my temporary boss' car got♥♥♥♥♥♥onBriefly worked with some dude who sold legal weed, who was probably one of the nicest bosses to be honest.Nearly got shot a few times?But all talk of the bizarre♥♥♥♥♥♥aside; this game was really enjoyable, surprisingly nuanced and I genuinely liked the characters. It took awhile and when I couldn't figure out what I was supposed to do next then it got frustrating. But overall I really loved it.Especially since I didn't need to actually get back together with my ex to earn all of the achievements; I didn't really want to by the end but not because I didn't like them, no I liked the characters but I felt their time together was over and they should go on with their lives.

The story, although the choices dont each branch out into a seperate variation of an ending,  (A little unrealistic to expect that, imo) is quite deep and the choices are nice and varied.This game will resonate with me as one of the best I've played this year. Reccomended to any fan of choice-based games (telltale for example), Indie games in generic sense, dating sims(It kind of plays like one),  and anybody who appreciates a decent story.			"

I mean, this game makes me think, we don't easily forget the people that make life worth living, do we?I mean, my character in this game has done so much and in the end, he just gets thrown around like an animal and gets his heart completely crushed. Too much effort, just for that to happen... Does a legacy of effort mean anything in this world anymore?If I had a happy ending, that would be Sam standing there and I would be the cause of HIS/HER unhappy ending. Maybe Sam's been as miserable as me. Maybe he/she doesn't deserve an unhappy ending...but it's either me or the other person who gets that happiness; there always has to be one person who has to be the miserable one. Should I accept my fate and stay silent?No matter what choice we make in this world...there are always sometimes monsters.__Okay, so enough of that crap. There were some things in this game that I could definitely see me doing / see happen to me in the future so I got really into it. I thought this game was totally worth it ESPECIALLY if it's on sale. There's romance, a lot of comedy, oh, and a hecka lot of quotes I wish I wrote down (I may or may not have used some above). I'd definitely recommend this to people who like romance and comedy - and people who like feels.I would write a PROS list, but my opinion about what I like doesn't really matter. Different people like different things. BUT I am going to write a CON list because sometimes we gotta look at the bad before caring too much about the good.Cons:-Sometimes the objectives in this game isn't as specific as the others (might get lost/confused about what you're supposed to do next) but you'll get back in track after a few minutes of wandering.-There were times where this game was boring *cough* Tofu job *cough* but it added to the steadiness of the game (rather than having too much stuff like maybe uh uhm yeah the ending bye)-Choices that leave you thinking after a while-If you're SUPER emotional and a sissy like me, you'd be feeling uncomfortable and broken-CHARACTERS THAT MAKE YOU WANT TO BREAK THINGS-Sam -why does the kid only want to fish for crabs?? are people going to notice the floating corpse?? and HOW ABOUT THAT SMASHED WINDOW?!-i need money and food-some of the music made my eyes twitch (sorry)-Most of the guys did not look attractive. Only the females looked nice (most of the time)Pros:(I said I wouldn't, but I want to write just a FEW things)-The game is steady, not too much going on.-Dream scenes - oh my god I love it when games have these-The game lasted longer than I thought it would (I would always be anxious to play but I was too scared to finish it)[there are a lot more probs, I am just too upset to focus on the good things right now]__Well, I hope you guys enjoy this game, if you do buy it. Maybe gift your friend the game as well and then compare choices. And I hope someone would list all the quotes in this game and put them on wiki/imdb or some website or something. All the quotes in this game are magnificent. The deep quotes always get to me oh my god. Anyways, enjoyt the game. And thanks to the people who read through all my nonsense.			"

												I was not always happy with the decisions i could choose from. Especially torwards the end the story was rushed, felt like the writer wanted to get over with it already. Or maybe he has a weird view of things not sure. But up to that point it kept me awake dring the rl night. I still give it a yes because someone might think different. Also it's well made and has a high replay value after some time has passed.And yes, we are all always sometimes Monsters ...sadly.			"

												It was a good story. I was expecting something like the ending from the beginning; however, its the journey that matters and not the end result. There was a bit of tedius walking back and fourth which may account for more than a sixth of my playtime. The controls were relatively simple and the storyline was easy to follow along even with all the side stories and stuff to do along the way.I wasn't too thrilled for the timeshift before the final moments of the game. It was a little dissapointing to see my frugality with time was for naught and I could have totally blown a couple of days to pay that rent in the start of the game.The fact that every decision matterd towards the final outcome was what sold it for me and is why I would reccomend playing this game if you've got some time too kill between books or games.tl;dr Buy it on a good sale, kill half a day like reading a decent book. Decent.			"

The entire game a chore making you play broken minigames and grinding for money just to progress through the game. The game is sloopy and badly put together and if you think you might get a reward for at  least finishing the game they cop out with a shity ""it was all a dream type scenerio""1/10 not worth your time buy something more fulfilling.

												This is the first ever RPGMaker game that I have played through to completion.The game hooked me with the initial setup. I'm a sucker for any plot that starts out with a mysterious masked gunman, and a standoff situation that makes you want to know what the ♥♥♥♥ is going on.That is something that, IMHO, this game did well.There is not much in the way of gameplay challenge here, though you can get a game over by making certain choices.As an adventure game, there is not much that will leave you scratching your head - it's pretty easy to wander around and find something to move the plot along. Though there are however a few little secrets to find.The biggest strength of this game is its story, a somewhat mundane story about lost love, redemption, self-improvement and such. I found it good enough to keep me playing.The second selling point is the morality choices, which in general play out and have consequences that make you feel like you actually made a choice, and weren't just railroaded.So I would recommend this game if you don't mind pixel graphics, you're interested in a mellower plot than most games provide, and you are looking for some 'choice porn' to tide you over in between the next big open-world-action-rpg outing.Also, you get to work in a meat packing plant at one point, and there is a 'press enter to masturbate' scene, so there's that too.

												Summary: ""Always Sometimes Monsters"" is a story-only RPG. There's no combat, no skill systems, no hidden item search, and the puzzles are for the most part optional. The story is about a young, penniless writer. It begins with the main character being evicted from their apartment, and on the same day receiving a wedding invitation to their ex-boy/girlfriend's wedding in one month's time. They set out to bus and hitchhike across the country to the wedding within 30 days.For me it was kind of a mixed bag. I tentatively recommend it, mainly because I just love this genre of game. Most of the gameplay consists of exploring the three towns the main character visits, getting involved in characters and conflicts, and making choices to help or hurt them. The game contains a pretty large set of things to discover and choices to make, and I loved that.Also, you can choose your avatar and their boy/girlfriend from a range of men and women of different races. You can play as a man or a woman, gay or straight. That didn't matter much to me, but I'm sure it's a selling point for some folks out there.The main downside to this mixed bag, is that the game drags. You move at a walking pace around the map, with no option to run (none that I found anyway). You can't skip cutscenes, only individual lines of dialog. And you pretty much have to spend a decent amount of time on boring temp jobs to earn the bus money needed to get to the end of the game. This wouldn't be a huge problem if you were set on treating this like real life and just playing through it one time, accepting the unforeseen outcome of every choice and mistake. But with so many choices and mutually exclusive paths through the game, it implicitly invites you to play it again to see what would have happened if you'd chosen differently, or even just to back up to a save point if it turns out that a line of dialogue you picked means something different than you thought it did.Even before I got into the game proper, I had to rewind through two excruciatingly slow scenes. The game is told as a flashback, so it opens with a scene from the frame story, and partway through that you have the choice to make the POV character shoot the character who's going to have the flashback. If you choose that (and of course I did to see what would happen), you get an early ""Game Over"" and have to restart from the beginning of this non-skippable cut scene. This is immediately followed by a scene at a party where the POV character chooses who to have a drink with, which turns out to be how you pick your avatar. If you don't realize this before you make the choice (as I didn't) you later get a chance to return to the start of the scene, which I did, forcing me through another annoying repetition.Another minor annoyance is the game's level of preachiness. It's like one of those moralistic anime series where the main characters are warm-hearted and human but most people in society are completely depraved selfish monsters. This wasn't a deal-breaker for me; I just kind of took it with a grain of salt, as part of the fictional world the game is set in. But it would have been nice if some of the moral choices you were making were more two-sided, instead of clearly always having a ""good"" side and a ""bad"" side. Indeed, to get the happiest ending at the end of the game you have to, at one point, say that you are unqualifiedly sorry for every single thing you did that transgressed the normal rules of society, even if you were doing it to save someone's life. It's like Kant's categorical imperative up in here.And then there's that ungrammatical title. I guess it's supposed to mean ""All people can sometimes be monstrous"". But the awkward self-contradiction of ""Always Sometimes"" just irks me a little every time I see it. At least the game itself pokes some fun at this, with a character in-game seeing it as the title of a book and puzzling over what the heck it means.Lol, so now I've written a lot of details about what was bad about the game, but I'm still going to recommend it. If you like RPGs based on exploration and character interaction rather than combat, you'll probably enjoy this game. At least, the first time through. If you're patient.			"

												I love this game, the story it tells is very gritty and harsh but very immersive and rich. The characters are relatable and have very well developed arcs, it becomes hard to tell who is good and who is bad (thus always sometimes monsters). The player will be made to do unpleasent things in order to survive and to see their lost love one last time.			"

												Solid enough narrative story with choices and consequences.  The only problem is the macguffin wedding subplot is a bit weak.  To me the motivations behind the ex and the wedding could be better executed, which would take altering the backstory a bit.  There are some good moments in the backstory, but I don't feel it does a very good job to set up the wedding as is.  Another problem is that depending on on you want to play the protagonist, you can be a bit railroaded by the ending.However I do find the beginning and ending interesting and how it weaves into the actual meat of the story.  The narrative also plays really well on how life can go to total garbage and showcases the journey upwards and the morality that is involved in how to do so.The music is also fantastic.			"

												I don't like ragging on games too much, but I believe this is an extremely poor game. It's way too late to write a review to warn people against buying it, but I can at least make the case for those who will look at it in the future. The gameplay is bad, because of a number of design choices:The use of large areas that inflate the game time by forcing you to walk back and forth through them, that become increasingly empty and devioid of meaningful interactions the further you go into the game (said large areas are also often bland and anonymous, the art isn't much better than what you could expect from the standard RPGMaker tilesets, althogh the palette fits the mood and the urban environment are reasonably portrayed);Game mechanics that are more suited for point and click adventures. perhaps visual novels or time-management games, that weren't correctly translated into a game using the RPG Maker engine. Often, you waste insane amounts of time conferming your actions/choices over and over again, the dialogue that is the meat of this game is served in minimal tidbits, the choices suffer similar restrictions, the ""fatigue"" mechanic is poorly implemented, since you just need to have some of it right before you go to bed, opening it to being exploited, the money-making is easily exploitable too, especially if one wants to save-scum (there really isn't a need for it, for the most part, although you might be screwed if you go to a new area without some starting money or at least food and you don't want to exploit the game);A huge amount of choices you make seem to matter very little, you briefly encounter people and then you don't interact with them ever again, or just get a few lines near the ending. Considering most of the gameplay is bad mini-games, poor resource management mechanics AND choices, you'd expect at least this one to be explored in-depth, but you'd be wrong.The writing is also bad, which is particularly jarring in such a narrative-focused game. The plot is set on having you go at your ex's wedding at all costs (that's the entire push behind the entire plot, that sees you struggle with your financial situation to try and get together enough money to get there and survive), but at the same time the story lets you re-affirm everytime that you are over him/her. The ending you get if you are consistent with this behavior makes no sense, though, as you are seemingly destroyed by the fact that things go just as planned.The ending is the least of the game's problems, though, and in fact it at least embraces the theme that permeates the game about circumstances dictating a lot of what our choices actually are, the problem is that the writing is bad through the entire experience, and the ending couldn't possibly escape from that. The plot is a string of contrivances usually solved by deus-ex-machina or similar, obvious narrative devices. For a game that goes for a serious approach, and could be classified as a drama, having such unbeliavable/stupid plot points severely undermines the struggles of the protagonist, making the whole even less believable. I found the comedy in the game to be frankly terrible, but I am going to concede this might be subjective, I do think that regardless of that, it further clashes with the themes, taking the believability of the drama further down, as it pops-up whenever it damn well pleases it. The presence of the game's authors in the game itself is just icing on the cake, beating you over the head with commentary on the themes in the story (which you could argue are flatly stated early on anyway). I can say, without kidding, that I have played porn games made in RPGMaker and similar engines, that have more nuanced and interesting writing than this. I believe you need incredibly low standards to be okay with it, especially since you can't rely on the gameplay to entertain you.The music didn't have particularly catchy or emotional tunes, I don't think it's terrible, but it's extremely forgettable.I will conclude by saying that I can only assume this game wasn't created to tell a story that also had a message, but instead it was written because they wanted to express a message, and reverse-engineered a story to suit said message. The characters are there to serve one function and little else, and I honestly regret spending my life playing this game. I checked 3-4 endings, although there might be slight variations to each and even some I didn't see, but the staggering amount of repeated dialogues even in these put me off from trying another playthrough, so after seeing the ones I could easily get by reloading a previous save file, I am more than done with this.

It kept me hooked with a neat storyline and decision-making process. I even though I thought my actions wouldn't really change the ending, but oh boy was I wrong. The plot twists are amazing, and the almost-breaking of the fourth wall is precious.I got this game on sale, but even if it's not, it's worth every coin. Buy it, play it, laugh and cry.

												The game is story-driven and you have to ignore the fact that RPG Maker is not the best engine, I got it. But I couldn't enjoy the story and the characters whatsoever (just the old lady, the old lady is adorable). The characters are very poorly written. There's a lady who had a problem with drugs and she's supposed to be your friend. But why? I don't know! And you have to make a decision to save her. But I had no sympathy for her at all! And that's how I saw all the characters in this game: all of them are very shallow (including the protagonist). With no sympathy for the main characters, what's left? A monotonous game, full of tedious and repetitive jobs. The soundtrack is also very repetitive. I just don't recommend it.			"

												Always Sometimes Monsters is a unique game that I quite enjoyed. There were a few things that could have been improved, but overall, I liked it. I will try my best to describe my experience that will hopefully influence your decision to buy or not.When I first launched the game, I was intrigued by the graphic style. Please note that the graphics were one of the reasons why I purchased the game since they reminded me a bit of MySim games. I had a lot of trouble initally with the controls. Nowhere in the main menu did they give you instructions of how to control the game. I could have looked it up on the Internet (which I did after ten minutes), but my first reaction was to randomly click around on my keyboard until I figured out everything I could do. But unfortually, I hit F12, which reset my game and I had to redo the first ten minutes I played over. At least I wasn't hours into it. After I realized I could plug my Xbox remote into my PC and use the controller to play, I have used that instead of the keyboard since.The game became addicting. I played hours on end, but tried to cut my time short of only playing 2-3 hours a day. Again, there was something that I had trouble with, and I had to do a little searching online. As the days progressed in-game, I wasn't sure what to do. I think that the developers could have put in a mechinism where, if the player is stuck, we could go to a spot in a menu to find a goal or something to figure out what to do. You'll notice (if you play) that there are times where you need to waste time in the day without a set goal in mind. That's where things get repeatative.As your chosen character, you want to get to San Vernadino (I might've spelt it wrong, sorry), but if you made mistakes along the way (again, you'll know what I mean if you play), you'll need to make money to buy bus tickets to get there. Luckily, in almost every town, there is a building where you go to find a job to work for the morning, afternoon, or evening. To get the certain amount needed, this process is repeated over and over again, and becomes tiresome. I can understand why some players quit at that point, but I say try not to. It feels quite rewarding when you finally have enough money to get to the next town.I've found that certain mini-games within the game are difficult. When you go to Salt City, you have to play a boxing mini-game if you don't want to go through with an alternative method. It was very difficult because I spent over an hour just on this because the mechanics were hard to figure out. When you reach this part, I'd suggest searching in the Always Sometimes Monsters discussions on Steam. Just search ""boxing game"", and there should be a post that will give you descriptive advice on how to beat it.Lastly, I want to talk about the ending. It left me kind of missing something. I don't know what other choices I could have made in the past that would have improved it, but I worried that choosing certain things in the last few minutes wouldn't have made a difference. I don't know for sure if this game has ""replay value"" or not because of the mini-games, but I'll find out. I definitely want to see if any other choices will change if I replay the game.So far, I have enjoyed this game a lot. Like I said, it reminds me of MySims, so it's kind of nostalgic since I played that game as a kid. This is the grown up version of MySims. It's addicting, enjoyable, and rewarding. Oh, and a quick tip for those of you who will decide to play: Save your game often. Don't save it on the ""auto"" save file, but on one of the other ones. That way, you can reload if you think you messed up. If you aren't sure of when to save, just save your game if you think something big will happen, or before you enter a building you were told to enter.7.5/10.			"

												Even if it's flawed, Always Sometimes Monsters managed to interest me for the whole playthrough and I happily recommend it to anybody who likes adventures with an emphasis on character development and non-linear storylines. The most relevant comparison which comes to mind is with To The Moon: if you liked it, you will probably at least appreciate what ASM has to offer. With respect to To The Moon, this one is in a sense a more ambitious game: it deals with (not always perfectly) many mature themes (it actually goes where few games dare to), but it also presents you with a much more complex storyline and a basic free-roaming structure with lots of options and different outcomes.This non-linear nature really shines not only during the very first moments, when you are given a lot of freedom in choosing your character, but also when you feel that the game actually responds to your choices. I went for a female protagonist and I could really identify myself with her pursuit of success, freedom and, most of all, lost love.Many different outcomes are possible, but I have to say that the one I got didn't entirely do justice to my personal path, as I probably expected something more connected to my choices during the game and to the character I created inside my head. This is of course a problem for any game which presents such a non-linear and relatively complex structure; moreover I grew fond of my character and her personal growth, so probably my expectations were pretty difficult to be met.So, even if it sometimes falls short of its premise, Always Sometimes Monsters is an original and occasionally touching experience, with a very nice and recognizable soundtrack and lots of references and easter eggs.7.5/10			"

												There is a difference between a sad story and a depressing story.After a sad story we feel catharsis. We feel like we've explored an idea, like we've walked in another person's shoes. Sure, the story didn't turn out well, but not everything in life does. We can learn from it. Sad stories serve a purpose.A depressing story, on the other hand, tells us nothing we don't already know. Life sucks. Work is boring and unfulfilling. Society is cruel and unfair. Damn near nobody cares about us; they're all out to get their own. Connections we make in our lives are all the more precious for being freaking rare, and we have to treasure the few good things we have for the limited time we still have them. We know all that.After experiencing a sad story, you feel cleansed. After experiencing a depressing story, you want 1.4 hours of your life back.Judging by my rating, in which category do you think I place this ridiculous runaround of a game?I guess someone who's had a much easier life than mine might find a game like this eye-opening.

												Spoilers Included:Majors in a story-telling aspect with allusion to some of your choices actually mattering with some interesting social commentary. Loses it’s steam due to tedious repetitive segments complete with poor pacing, obvious plot twists, and revolving around mostly nothing but your grinding/luck with money.What’s interesting is it actually gives away it’s concept pretty early while talking to the meta in-game developers as “Would you be interested in playing a game where you’re not the hero” and the game tries to accomplish just that. You stem into this journey in attempt to see your partner betrothed at someone else’s hand and the cost of doing such may cost you your own morality and people will question that as time passes but in the end it just comes to this giant “meh” of a selective ending unless you really want♥♥♥♥♥♥to warp into the soap opera zone.The characters 8/10 of the times are cynical ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s, their attempt to get you connected to your partner completely revolves around these short flashbacks you get every maybe 30% of game completion with very little substance whatsoever and devalues the plot by about 50%, it’s an attempt to give you a visual novel experience by Devolver Digital standards (surprise, surprise) and just barely manages to withhold it’s own without coming off as pointless.

												Playing this game, I sometimes felt trapped reading endless reels of babble.  The story takes way too long to unravel.  Other than that, the game is fun and has some interesting points.  The graphics and character abilities are extremely limited, but that is not the selling point of this game.  It seems the author/game creators wanted to make an interactive romance novel.			"

												It's an RPG Maker game so you already know it offers the most basic of gameplay in an .exe that hopefully works without having to change some properties. Can't say anything new about that or recommend it to people who are tired with those types of Verge RPG programs from way back. The main draw for this one is its choose-your-own-adventure story system. Unfortunately, that means it had better be written well to be worth $10. Same goes for the $5 soundtrack, which is also too boring and uninspiring to be worth it.Gamers have a very low bar for what’s considered good writing, it seems. No achievement for shooting that first long-winded bum who kept prattling on about choice? C’mon, we were supposed to not hate that dialogue? The biggest problem with moral dilemma stories written by gamers is that it’s so obvious what the intended choice is. They all think the same. Besides, when you have the choice between “Well, I guess you’re right if you really think about it” and “Get the ♥♥♥♥ out of here, I’m not an awful person ugh,” it’s not hard to figure out which path the writer’s hoping you choose, especially since there’s always a trigger involved. Sex? Kinda sketchy. Drugs? Tools of the devil. Old people? Gotta respect ‘em. Do I steal the game dev’s money or do I leave it alone? I wonder which one results in the Game Over.“It’s supposed to make you mad/sad so you could think about the other choices you could’ve made/consequences of your actions! That’s what we set out to do. We’re artists.” Ok.I’m happy to see modern-day RPG Maker stuff, I really am, and I’m impressed that the team was able to make money off of it but they might wanna grab someone from the NaNoWriMo forums who’s desperate to get their grand works out there next time. Who knows, the gimmick might work. “Budding novelist hopeful teams up with indie vidya designer for passion project. Adam Sessler rises from the grave to promote it until it’s written about in Time Magazine. The medium is finally transcending!” It’s not like anyone’s expecting Walden Simulator or A Sport and a Pastime: The Game.Or, you know, you can just ramble about fate or cry about your ex-girlfriend some more.12/10 would whine about binary moral decisions again.

I am usually not interested in 8-bit indie games like this (my sin is Third Person Shooters) and out of a whim I just put it in my cart and said ♥♥♥♥ it. 10/10 would do it again. This game is whatever you like it to be. The laughs are genuine and the choices you make are regretful! Just like life! My Cons:-Viper-My luck is horrible-Boxes-Enter button makes decisions for me :'(My Pros:-Fighting for love is exhausting -Bacon Burgers every night and staying in shape-Really nice friends -Overall Criminal Activity I would recommend to anyone who will listen. This game is a must play.9/10And now to patiently wait for Sometimes Always Monsters :'(			"

												Do you enjoy the soul crushing monotony of working dead end jobs to make just enough money to survive? Then I can recommend Always Sometimes Monsters Otherwise, unless you're going for the novelty of what this game offers give this a pass. The story is frustratingly angsty and uninteresting as well as having you perform conveyor belt ""mini games"" to make enough money to afford food and a bus ticket which is $8,000 for some reason. You can skip this money grinding by keeping a certain character alive; except this character has no sure way of being saved. It's random so either you get lucky, you save scum, or you spend a very, very long time grinding money to progress the story. It's just plain not fun.  "

												I really wanted to like this game; I forced myself to play for almost 15 hours of it and just can’t bring myself into playing anymore. For a story driven game it has shockingly bad writing. The game is about the struggles we face in everyday life, yet the story was completely detached from reality. I mean, there are actions can potently lead to the deaths of multiple people without any repercussions, even though you *spoiler alert* wrote it into a journal which you published into a book!And you know the scene in the dark alley at the start? That’s what got me to keep playing because I wanted to see how the rest of the game tied in to it. Guess what? It doesn’t. Those characters showed up at the very end, and are completely shoed in to justify the first scene.The writing is also extremely pretentious. It spends too much time talking about philosophy of right and wrong, rather than showing through their action of its character. Which is a wasted opportunity, as many characters has potential for development (like Mark). The saying “show, don’t tell” really applies here.The gameplay is pretty much non- existence. Which is fine in “To the Moon” (another story-driven rpg-maker game), because it’s short and to the point. While in this game, I spend 15 hours in this game and still haven’t finished it (I watched a let’s play if you are wondering how I know the ending). It is drawn out and tedious, which would have been okay if the story was good, but it wasn’t.All this would have been forgivable if the developers weren’t so ♥♥♥♥ing pleased with themselves. It’s okay to be proud of your work; it’s also okay put yourself in the game as a character.  What isn’t okay is *spoiler alert* to have a book in the game called “Always Sometimes Monsters” and calling it a masterpiece, and saying that “nothing captures the human spirit quite so well” which it clearly doesn’t, and of yourself show up to offer the author  1 million dollars to turn it into a game.With all that said I hope they learn their lesson and make a better game next time, games like this are few and far between.

												Its a choose your own adventure game threaded  together using ALOT of boring minigames. being able to choose how you want to deal with situations presented in the game is the best part, but sometimes I saw my choices didn't save (ie. Someone died, they're alive later). The story was an interesting idea, most of the conversations with characters were pretty great and well written, however some conversations and story points made me go wtf, didn't make sense, or was just badly thought out and written. I like the changing settings and how there were at least 3 full towns to explore, however lacking towards the end in SV. Now as a choose your adventure/choice game I would recommend it hesitantly.BUT absolute worst thing this game does is create a very long amount of trash filler minigames to tie the story together.From my playthrough I played 3 arcade minigames (one pacman ripoff), 2 job minigames (Tofu/Weed jobs), coat check minigame, box minigame, hacking minigame (frogger ripoff), vent maze, deliver drugs minigame, boxing minigame, 4 casino minigames. I hated them. Almost all the minigames I listed are required for progress or jobs done to progress the day. By the end of the game, I've had enough and didn't even play any of the casino minigames cause that's a stupid idea. I hated those boring minigame segments that are half the game.Also, the developer cameo was great at first in the coffee shop, but wtf was with the two of them, and that ending at the book store was so stupidly bad I laughed.Do not recommend.

												If you're into a long beautiful story, full of downfalls and choices, this game is definately for you.From choosing you character, to the people you choose to side with, all of these will greatly affect the game in general. Be black and get racially picked on, or a hot burnette and get the world to show you love and help, the choice is yours. The game surprisingly mirrors real life very well. Poverty, corruption, sex, all in it. But then again, its your choice if you wanted any of this to happen.

												This is just awesome. One of the best videogames, storywise especially, i ever played. The fact, that you're roleplaying yourself and are able to weave you're own life (and SO) into this, makes it so relatable. But moreover, the dialogues and characters, the relationships and up's and down's of everyone seem so authentic and just realistic. Of course, there are some ""deus ex machina""-like nudges for the sake of being a videogame. But this doesn't hurt. In fact, this game perfectly captures the balance between story, openness while still being a game at heart. The artstyle is a bit grim but mostly simple, yet realistic and authentic. Music is very nice and fits the themes of the cities.Gonna make more playthroughs, there were just so many interesting decisions and choices. All in all this might be the most realistic or authentic videogame i've ever played.Many props to the creators, and thank you sooo much for not only giving the players same-sex options but also for avoiding stereotypes and making a gay relationship natural while playing the game. I really found many relations to my own relationship. Exceptionally well executed.			"

												Even if it's flawed, Always Sometimes Monsters managed to interest me for the whole playthrough and I happily recommend it to anybody who likes adventures with an emphasis on character development and non-linear storylines. The most relevant comparison which comes to mind is with To The Moon: if you liked it, you will probably at least appreciate what ASM has to offer. With respect to To The Moon, this one is in a sense a more ambitious game: it deals with (not always perfectly) many mature themes (it actually goes where few games dare to), but it also presents you with a much more complex storyline and a basic free-roaming structure with lots of options and different outcomes.This non-linear nature really shines not only during the very first moments, when you are given a lot of freedom in choosing your character, but also when you feel that the game actually responds to your choices. I went for a female protagonist and I could really identify myself with her pursuit of success, freedom and, most of all, lost love.Many different outcomes are possible, but I have to say that the one I got didn't entirely do justice to my personal path, as I probably expected something more connected to my choices during the game and to the character I created inside my head. This is of course a problem for any game which presents such a non-linear and relatively complex structure; moreover I grew fond of my character and her personal growth, so probably my expectations were pretty difficult to be met.So, even if it sometimes falls short of its premise, Always Sometimes Monsters is an original and occasionally touching experience, with a very nice and recognizable soundtrack and lots of references and easter eggs.7.5/10			"

												Sophmoric writing and lazy coding. Everybody is a one dimensional character only a sociopathic child could create and understand, and set in a land of abstract morals, it is played off as an objective world where free will is a reality, yet certainly isn't when it comes down to the coding. According to the coding, there are basically no choices, and due to abstract reasoning people react in ways they should not, as if they are not characters. I am not sure if that is intentional, but it certainly does not seem to be. It is just a railroad through a silly story where there is only one truth, regardless of the presentation of choices. Good idea. Bad game.			"

												Always Sometimes Monsters is a unique game that I quite enjoyed. There were a few things that could have been improved, but overall, I liked it. I will try my best to describe my experience that will hopefully influence your decision to buy or not.When I first launched the game, I was intrigued by the graphic style. Please note that the graphics were one of the reasons why I purchased the game since they reminded me a bit of MySim games. I had a lot of trouble initally with the controls. Nowhere in the main menu did they give you instructions of how to control the game. I could have looked it up on the Internet (which I did after ten minutes), but my first reaction was to randomly click around on my keyboard until I figured out everything I could do. But unfortually, I hit F12, which reset my game and I had to redo the first ten minutes I played over. At least I wasn't hours into it. After I realized I could plug my Xbox remote into my PC and use the controller to play, I have used that instead of the keyboard since.The game became addicting. I played hours on end, but tried to cut my time short of only playing 2-3 hours a day. Again, there was something that I had trouble with, and I had to do a little searching online. As the days progressed in-game, I wasn't sure what to do. I think that the developers could have put in a mechinism where, if the player is stuck, we could go to a spot in a menu to find a goal or something to figure out what to do. You'll notice (if you play) that there are times where you need to waste time in the day without a set goal in mind. That's where things get repeatative.As your chosen character, you want to get to San Vernadino (I might've spelt it wrong, sorry), but if you made mistakes along the way (again, you'll know what I mean if you play), you'll need to make money to buy bus tickets to get there. Luckily, in almost every town, there is a building where you go to find a job to work for the morning, afternoon, or evening. To get the certain amount needed, this process is repeated over and over again, and becomes tiresome. I can understand why some players quit at that point, but I say try not to. It feels quite rewarding when you finally have enough money to get to the next town.I've found that certain mini-games within the game are difficult. When you go to Salt City, you have to play a boxing mini-game if you don't want to go through with an alternative method. It was very difficult because I spent over an hour just on this because the mechanics were hard to figure out. When you reach this part, I'd suggest searching in the Always Sometimes Monsters discussions on Steam. Just search ""boxing game"", and there should be a post that will give you descriptive advice on how to beat it.Lastly, I want to talk about the ending. It left me kind of missing something. I don't know what other choices I could have made in the past that would have improved it, but I worried that choosing certain things in the last few minutes wouldn't have made a difference. I don't know for sure if this game has ""replay value"" or not because of the mini-games, but I'll find out. I definitely want to see if any other choices will change if I replay the game.So far, I have enjoyed this game a lot. Like I said, it reminds me of MySims, so it's kind of nostalgic since I played that game as a kid. This is the grown up version of MySims. It's addicting, enjoyable, and rewarding. Oh, and a quick tip for those of you who will decide to play: Save your game often. Don't save it on the ""auto"" save file, but on one of the other ones. That way, you can reload if you think you messed up. If you aren't sure of when to save, just save your game if you think something big will happen, or before you enter a building you were told to enter.7.5/10.			"

												I want to like this game. A RPG in a contemporary setting, that doesn't involve saving the kingdom or mechs (as cool as those are). A RPG that examines the modern condition, its ups and downs, and the choices people always sometimes have to make. In some parts, it can be illuminating and daresay enlightening. The music is unique, each city and town has a subtle feel. The artwork, though not masterclass, is quite good. I almost, almost mind you, forget that I'm playing a game made in RPGMaker. I played it all the way to the end. I got every achievement (though they are checkpoint achievements, so not the greatest accolade). So, I want to like this game, but I don't. I find it interesting, promising, and quite unique. Indeed, this Toronto-born award-laden project makes me proud to be a Canadian gamer.  But at the end of 10+ hours, I am unwilling to recommend this game.For about 50% of the journey, there are interesting twists and turns. Interesting characters, insights, and questions raised. Your choices are, if not at least an illusion, actual choices. Then it comes off the rails in the final chapters. For all the choices made, the detail in people and places, the mood and atmosphere: the story begins to make less and less sense. Given certain paths in the story you choose: the ending can make a lot of sense or no sense. The storyteller's conceit from the top of the game can be brilliant or just downright bizarre. For all the great beginnings, the meat of the story before it: the ending is just a miss. This is not a gamer lamenting a bad ending that he didn't manage to avoid. Even on the ""good"" ending (or one of them, depending on your point of view), I was just confused. This is a game with a message, trying to tell us something we don't often hear. It is a game trying to do something that isn't a nostalgia trip to bygone JRPGs of yesteryear. Yet, it all falls apart.So, do I recommend this game? No, not to everyone.Do I hate this game? No, I am disappointed.Should they have not made it? Better to fail ambitiously than to succeed in mediocrity.I cannot recommend this game because, I feel, that it missed the execution of the ending. A story with a poorly handled ending is just the death of story-driven tales like ASM. Yet, I cannot bring myself to hate this game. For all the ending had failed; the promise of a great modern-day RPG that stands apart from all rivals: that is well worth trying. I would rather the boys and gals at Vagabond make the attempt and miss; than for no one to ever try. I cannot condemn this game as something that should never have been.  There is too much promise and hope in such a title. Even if you don't get the happiest ending possible (if one could call it that.)This is an interesting game that I hope Vagabond makes a similar attempt at. This is a game that other developers should strive to perfect. This is the sort of game that modern gaming we see more of and not less. So if you want to have a little inspiration, a little glimmer of what a unique game could be like, then buy this;  play it; and make it better. Indeed, keep an eye out for future games by this studio: they have a masterpiece in them: they just have to make it.~~~~~~~This is a Review Based from First Complete Playthrough. I intend to play it again as differently as I can manage to see if there is something hidden; something more that I missed the first time through. I sincerely doubt it; but upon second completion: I will add more here.			"

												My hour count is high because I left the game running (whoops). For the record, I finished it once, and it didn't take me that long.The whole point of this game is to get back with your ex. Problem is, he's getting married. Winning requires you to tear apart a pretty happy existing relationship. It's a fun game through the middle if you're not expecting it to be too serious. But the main arc of the story and some of the people who are supposed to be main characters are so ridiculously juvenile, it's not even funny. And the ending turns out awful for someone no matter what. I don't mind games with no ""happily ever after""--but there should be an option where a core character doesn't end up wishing they were dead.Trigger warnings for suicide-, drug-, and death-related stuff. Crops up a couple times, and although it was kind of hackneyed, it's worth mentioning that if that stuff pushes bad buttons for you, this game isn't worth it. Ending aside, there's this one pretty early on: One minor-ish character commits suicide if you don't pick the right choices when you talk to him. He calls you up, thanks you for your advice, and then shoots himself while on the line with you. He's not the most believable character, but still, if you happen to be playing at night, in a dark room, while sleep-deprived, it's pretty jarring. (I was.)If you're still interested in playing, there's a really good step-by-step guide here that tells you what to do to get the 'good ending' (scare quotes) or in case you get stuck. It doesn't spoil the actual plot just by reading the guide.


Step-By-Step Good Ending Guide 
A Guide for Always Sometimes Monsters
By: Ceaseless Duality

			It's a step-by-step walkthrough to get the player through the game, while also achieving the good ending.		


I used it loosely as I played, so I did get the 'good ending', but had I made my own choices, that wouldn't have happened. By the end I was pretty disgusted with the three main characters--they're all kind of jerks. MC does some questionable stuff over the course of her (or his, it was her for me) adventure, and then chooses to stop a wedding during the ceremony when she could have literally spoken up days before it happened and saved a lot of expense, drama, and effort. Aaaaaarrrgghh. Your ex strings Sam along to the point of almost marrying her when he actually wants you, and then ditches her when you show up and just say that you wuv him and he should stop before he makes a Big Mistake because you two are ~soulmates~. And then Sam--oh, Sam.She invited you to her wedding just to shove it in your face that she was marrying your old flame, and brag about her huge book deal. Either that, or she's an idiot. There's no indication that the main character and Sam kept in touch or were still friends in any way. MC did kind of ""steal"" her crush (he chose MC over her, if you call that stealing), and MC got a book deal that was supposed to be for both her and Sam but cut Sam out of the deal, and ended up taking it anyway (it was a sticking point).I got really annoyed when Sam got held at gunpoint over her gambling debts and wanted your manuscript so she could cash in on her book deal and pay off her debts--and I mean annoyed at both characters. I was really irritated with Sam, of course, but I was also irritated because where were her friends when she got carted off to play high-stakes cards? Sam has a reputation for getting drunk at parties and wandering off to get into trouble, so why weren't they watching her a little better? Can't someone around here act like a responsible adult? (Preferably Sam, but that was never going to happen.) And then Sam's life is in danger and MC gripes about what giving her the manuscript will do to MC's career. This is the same MC who blackmailed a doctor because ""a life is a life""--remember? Anyway, you can pay it off without giving up the book, but it requires major minigame work or gambling or one of a couple other options that are pretty boring.So, either you take your book/crush and become happy and successful and Sam ends up in the gutter, or vice versa, because apparently nothing is more important than Marrying Your Soulmate, and success is a zero-sum game. (eyeroll) What happened to Sam's giant book deal, anyway? How... never mind, I'm going to stop trying to make sense of this.There were parts that were fun, though.In the second town, I ditched both the union job and the protesters and joined the detective instead. He was obviously a Superman reference on legs, really boring, but he didn't stick around long. I got a kick out of the computer scenes. Snork. In case any of you are designing games--they'll tell you in Networking 1 that anyone can get into just about any network machine if they've got physical access to it. There's no need for them to move floppy disks around little fire sprites in a minigame.I really liked Markansas. He was a believable character that you could totally empathize with, and he was a decent guy who just genuinely wanted to help the MC. I appreciated the inclusion of a Christian character not portrayed as a jerk, even if it wasn't 100% accurate and the related writing (his sermon in particular) was really stilted, but they still looked up a real Bible verse relevant to what he was saying. (I should hope that a church service involves more than one verse though. Especially one lasting like four hours or whatever that was.)Also, racial diversity. That was pretty cool--I've only played as the Japanese (?) girl and got a few comments based on my race, but I wonder if people are more distrustful of you if you're a black guy or something? Speaking of which... I, uh, think my character put on blackface to disguise herself while she raided the doctor's mansion for teddy bear bondage porn to use as blackmail material, and I don't know how to feel about that.That may be the weirdest single sentence I've ever written in a game review, so I'm going to leave it there.

												THE SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS LISTED FOR PLAYING THIS GAME ON A MAC ARE NO LONGER ACCURATE. IT REQUIRES 10.9 NOW. WOULDN'T YOU LIKE TO KNOW HOW I FOUND OUT?!?I played this game for nearly 5 hours in total. I want to guess I was halfway through it. (I just got to the trailer park, for those of you that know what that means.) I let my games update automatically and it's never given me trouble before. This game updates, and suddenly, I can no longer play it unless I update my IOS system. Maybe I'd update it, but I literally just updated my IOS system a month ago, and it was such a  pain in the♥♥♥♥♥that doing it again now would feel pretty ludicrous.  Not to mention, if I do end up updating my IOS system and decide to play this, I have to start the game all over again. While this game was interesting in concept, replaying the past 4.8 hours of menial work to buy bus tickets sounds a lot more boring than I want to admit. I really wanted to like this game, I knew it was building up to something, and now I don't get to experience what that something would've been. Luckily I bought this game when it was on sale, but that doesn't take away the dissapointment that after getting invested in my character and the story so much, I don't get to find out how my character's story ends.  Maybe if I got to finish the game, I would have given a good review.			"

												Did I enjoy it: YesIs it a good game: Debateable, but I'm going to say yesCons can basically all be pointed back to the choice of RPG Maker as the engine. However, if you can look past that you'll find a game that tackles some interesting topics in a novel way.How many games allow you the opportuntiy to be homeless and unemployed? Or face discrimination based on your race, sex or sexuality? Even the minigames in which you make money are an exercise in dealing with boredom - probably an artistic choice on the designer's part, but not a smart mvoe when making a game.All in all, I found it engrossing. It's basically a road-trip movie that takes itself seriously, and wants to explroe the darker side of the modern world. Dialogue can get incredibly preachy and go on too long about simple philosophical concepts, and some people feel they were rail-roaded too much in the latetr part of the game after the initial 'open world' experience of the first act, but these are minor niggles. The fact that most NPCs treat you differently based on race, sex and age are all commendable, showing that these choices matter.Always Sometimes Monsters delivers a good story, has some solid points to make and dares to do something different.

												This was a fun story, I had thought the choices would matter more but I loosely followed one of the guides on here (I was worried about messing up!) and the ending turned out fine. There are, however, a lot of choices you can make, which I liked. I was in a rush to get to the final city, but you can afford to take your time. I wish I had taken a bit more time during my playthrough, but what's done is done. There are times that you have to grind to get cash and skipping that could lessen the game's enjoyablility. They're making a sequel right now and I would totally get it. This game also allows you to not only pick your gender, but the gender of your love interest (and no one bats an eye!). The wiki is horribly incomplete, I had missed some side stuff that is really circumstantial to get to, so it'd be nice if there was more support on that end, but all in all I would definitely get the game if you have nothing else better to do. Note: getting back to the game after a few weeks of not playing was tough, I had completely forgotten the storyline and what I was supposed to do, so jotting down notes after every session would be beneficial if you don't play this in one go (which I don't recommend).

												I see a lot of negative reviews for this game but to be honest, I quite enjoyed it. Played through it three times to see the diffrent endings, and yea, the choices you make really affect how your life turns out. There is a lot of repetitive work invovled in earning the money you need to progress but I mean, if you're willing to put in the work, it's not so bad! Only complaint I had was how the ending kind of just... fades out, for lack of better words. There wasn't a whole lot of closure but I guess that's life! I have and will continue to recommend this game, and will likely replay it again myself.			"

												The game is story-driven and you have to ignore the fact that RPG Maker is not the best engine, I got it. But I couldn't enjoy the story and the characters whatsoever (just the old lady, the old lady is adorable). The characters are very poorly written. There's a lady who had a problem with drugs and she's supposed to be your friend. But why? I don't know! And you have to make a decision to save her. But I had no sympathy for her at all! And that's how I saw all the characters in this game: all of them are very shallow (including the protagonist). With no sympathy for the main characters, what's left? A monotonous game, full of tedious and repetitive jobs. The soundtrack is also very repetitive. I just don't recommend it.			"

												Always Sometimes Monsters is a game of tough decisions. I really enjoyed the game play, even if I found it frustrating at times to have to choose between a bad option and a bad option (hi, real life). The final section has a nice part where you have to justify your actions (to your ex's parent), and your gameplay throughout will dictate which ending you get. The opening scene where you get to select your played character and the love interest is nicely done, offering variety in gender and race. It would have been interesting to see gender and race have an impact in how those around you interact, especially given the nature of the game.			"

												To be honest with you guys and ladies, I'm not a huge RPG game-player but after playing this beautiful game, it changed me a lot. This game....... is either beautiful, depressing, forgiveful, bittersweet, or really monsturous depending on the choices we make on this game. This game will give you moments of sadness, regret, anger, or being jealous (pretty realistic in our lives don't you agree?). Anywho I highly recommend this game if you're into story rich RPG games like these. Here's my real review.......Pros:+Story Rich+Choices Matter+Characters+Dialogue+Gameplay+Multiple EndingsCons:To be honest...... I actually can't think of any cons for this game. Which means this game gave me a positive feel about the gameplay and getting my attention on the storyline. I highly recommend this RPG game! :D			"

The story, although the choices dont each branch out into a seperate variation of an ending,  (A little unrealistic to expect that, imo) is quite deep and the choices are nice and varied.This game will resonate with me as one of the best I've played this year. Reccomended to any fan of choice-based games (telltale for example), Indie games in generic sense, dating sims(It kind of plays like one),  and anybody who appreciates a decent story.			"

Not as much customization in the characters but you can be gay if you want and names are chosen by you so do what you will cuz a Pirate is Free, you are a pirate. Long game if you're not willing to really put your energy into it. To get all achievements, play through to the end past credits. Top tip right there. If you get emotionally invested and forget real life you probs might start sobbing due to all of the dramatic choices. It's supposed to show the duality of choice in life etc and how there's consequence and we're human and whatnot. Good game overall. Not the most entertaining for me but I would recommend it if you're into this kind of thing. Something Markiplier would play on his channel probably. Like To the Moon or something.			"

It's real, interesting, and you become invested in the character and, like in our own every day lives, question the choices that are made. Are you making the most morally right decision, or the easiest? I bought this game as my first Steam purchase after seeing a good friend play it and attempt to explain it to me, and it piqued my interest greatly - and I don't regret the decision I made. The game is easy, fun, and low-key enough that you can waste a few hours on it when you just want something to loose yourself in without getting too invested. It's a decent purchase and has a lot of re-playability that makes it worth the price.  "

												Light/medium spoilers ahead!! You've been warned!!!!Probably my favorite game of all time. I can't even pin down what about it I loved SO much, but mostly it was the reality of it. The atmospheres, the settings, were all so familiar. I imagine my life isn't too different from the MC's, because the places she goes and lives are eerily similar to my own. IMO it's very reflective of the USA's atmosphere and everything was incredibly well done in that regard.The sound and soundtrack was phenomenal, albeit maybe a bit repetitive, but it barely got on my nerves at all. The characters were all solid and unique and felt real. Even the background characters all had so much to say. There is so much attention to detail in this game it's crazy.I personally liked the grinding and the stamina aspect, I liked the gambling and fighting a lot. I liked how I could actually play as a gay character that didn't have the gay part glossed over--it was actually brought up multiple times, which I found very impressive and I really enjoyed it.I don't think I can say enough about how much I like this game. I don't think I have anything negative to say about it at all...I do wish that if the MC successfully objected the wedding the epilogue was a little happier. You know, maybe she goes to take a nap but kisses you first or something, just to show they're going to be on the right track.I was ridiculously attatched to everybody I met in this game.I started playing at about 10 pm last night, it's just about to turn 5 am. Night well spent.			"

												I liked this game enough to play through it twice (but that may have had to do with me missing a few achievements the first time...)  and I think overall, it's a good concept and story. Even though I put a lot of hours into this game considering the content, I really can't think of much to say about it. It was good, but nothing about it stands out to me. Actually, I think the bad and unrealistic dialogue from nearly every character is the thing that stuck with me the most. If I could go back, I probably would have played this game with a guide to ensure I got all the achievements in the first playthrough so I wouldn't have had to go back to play through it again. If you like RPGs and can handle the super-cringey dialogue, this game might be something you want to play once when the game goes on sale.			"

												A well crafted and enjoyable RPG, Always Sometimes Monsters is a nice getaway from what many might conceive to be a bland market. It has quirks and charms that you don't find in many games, and the gameplay is well paced and not overwhelmingly long, leaving the player content at the end. Music and sound are good, dialogue tends to be pretty decent, and the storyline is almost believable - again, something reasonably rare for a game.Only real fault I can find is that it may take a few hours of gameplay to pull you in, but I'd say it's worth it for the finished product. 7/10 for sure			"

												In a market saturated with first person shooters and early access survival titles, it was a nice change of pace to play as someone simply trying to win back their beloved. A surprising decent RPG Maker game where you make moral choices in order to progress which affect the story rather than fighting enemies. It can be redundant at times with its monotonous jobs to earn cash and unfortunately sometimes you're given the illusion of choice. However, it is worth picking up when on sale if you want to experience a simple yet engrossing story. A personal favorite of mine and absolutely cannot wait for the sequel.			"

But if you're looking for an RPG where you tell your own story and live it the way you choose it to be, then this game can never go wrong. The choices you make actually impact your game further down the road. Maybe its just me, but this is the first time I've played an RPG game that's not so action packed but more towards story. I was expecting this to be boring but I was wrong. So hooked I was, that I played continuously for 12 hours straight in order to finish this game. Depending on how your choices are, you could be living like a homeless vagabond who's had it so hard in life and things keep turning out for the worse ( That was my playthrough ). Plus, there's quite a sum of minigames in the game as you uncover more of its story. My tip on enjoying this game is to immerse yourself in the story as you play and it will be worth it. Although this game turned out to be a spectacular gem, there is something missing that I cannot quite put my finger on. Perhaps the lack of story since it all leads one-way instead of able to branch out and expand to something new (Despite the many choices you are able to make). Or perhaps that the game is very short and replayability is not quite there. Nevertheless, if this game had a sequel I would surely have no second thoughts on getting it. Kudos to the devs.8.5/10P/S : Devs, please make a sequel			"

												I don't write a whole lot of reviews, but I felt this game absolutely deserved one more Steam recommendation.Always Sometimes Monsters is a fine example of an indie game made with heart but moreover an exempliary case of a story rich, content driven game. (Not that the graphics were bad for the retro sort of style. And the music was really good too!) Despite the risk of sounding tacky I'd describe ASM as a deep dive into the wide spectrum of humanity and life. It was funny, sad, clever, delightfully philosophic, beautiful, simple in a complex way - and genuinely thought-provoking at times.Regardless of the medium, I do enjoy stories and anecdotes that make the gamer/viewer/user reflect some element of their own life, perhaps questioning it or, on the other hand, feeling reassurance over it. Or maybe just cause that, either warm or melancholic, ""Yeah, I can relate"" feeling.The freedom of choice contributed to a great atmosphere throughout and I found myself quickly immersed each time I played. Also, unlike in other multiple-choice-type games I decided not to reload and replay each fork on the road and opted to just flow with it instead. It felt right not to see what might've been and instead just experience it uniquely as it happened - kinda like going through life itself.As someone who dabbles with writing stories as their dear hobby, I must say: hats off to the developers for their vision and unique approach! Video game experiences like this are few and far between! I consider Always Sometimes Monsters a good story, good game, and definately an experience worth recommending!			"

												Always Sometimes Monsters is an interesting game, not great by any means, but interesting enough to play.The basic idea is that you're a struggling person trying to win back someone you love, you deal with a lot of hardships along the way and have to make choices that define your personal character and how others see you! A great idea.. But I think this game had a few problems with executing it. Your choices do change some things around you and change some of the places you see during the game but that's about as far as it goes.. It's pretty easy to get around the mistakes you make throughout and that puts a damper on the struggles you're meant to go through. The game obviously had a lot of care put into it and it's definitely an interesting story to play through, the choices can keep you intrigued and the general game feel has a nice real-life gritty feel to it that I find appealing! But the game devs did a few things that really took me out of the game and made some of more irritating than enjoyable.. The self referencing the game devs have were far too often to really overlook it and the story didn't really come together in a nice enough way, it sort of felt.. Wrong.. Like they were trying very hard to make something deep but it didn't come together and just felt too forced in the end. The story concept wasn't the best and it showed through in an annoying way when the effect of your choices and everything were pushed on you. It just didn't come together well and trying to be philisophical just seemed tacky in this.Pros -The character selection is unique and character art is pleasing.You get to choose your love.The story is interesting enough to get you into it.Choices are intriguing!The pixel graphics were nice and the world was well designed.Had a sweet old lady.I got to sleep on a matress in an alley way and fish for my supper.Also gambled my money away with lotto tickets.Cons -Self referencing delevopers.No options!!The music got repetitive.The weight of your choices and the story seemed too forced and became irritating.I ran out of things to fish up.Overall it's okay, play it for yourself! but personally by the end of the game I was really torn as to whether I enjoyed it or not.

												While there are portions of this game I enjoyed as a whole it was a pretty unsatisfying experience. Like more than half the game is farming for money to pay some stupid bill or another, which I understand was meant to add a level of realism to the game because life can be tough as far as getting money for bills, but it just really took away from the story line because it took so long to progress anywhere. And then you get berated later in the game for doing some ""shady"" things for the money to progress the story? Like I wasn't really given another option, ♥♥♥♥ing sorry you don't like the way I had to earn money.The story itself wasn't my cup of tea from the start and it honestly just kept getting worse and more cliche. Like the whole point of this game is to reconnect with an ex who left years ago because you accidently find out she's getting married. Like, who the hell crashes a wedding for someone they haven't even talked to in years? So I didn't even want to continue with the story in the first place but I kept it up to see if it got any better or made some really good point at the end. No, it doesn't. You just end up sad and lonely and you look like a giant ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and you learn nothing and you also just wasted all the ♥♥♥♥ing money you spent so many hours grinding to earn.Overall, it was just a lot of grinding away for a story that had little to no sustinence.

												This game may not be for everyone, but I loved the journey I went on. Unlike many other choice-based games (I'm looking at you Telltale, even though I love your games), the choices you make can greatly affect the outcome. Yes there are parts where it perhaps drags on a bit, but it only adds to the realism. The writing and characters are great, and I loved the message of the game. I tried to balance out acting morally and compromising my morals for the sake of making money in order to visit my true love.

												Game is not for everyone and specific but if you like to read and smth atmospheric with unobtrusive plot and funny staff - you should play! Such life situation can give some interesting view. Also I really love the art style and soundtracks (masturbation in the shower for liiiife). - not all were... clear???- mistakes in the text- ...wtf??- wanna kill our friend)0)))			"

Always Sometimes MonstersSynopsis:Set out on a cross-country journey to win back the love of your life and endure the hardship of making story-defining choices that affect your life and the lives of those around you.Pros:- History- Soundtrack- Various Characters where the player can choice- Every decision there is a sequenceCons:- Sometimes you do not know what to do next.Scores:History - 7/10Music - 8/10Graphics - 8/10Contents - 8/10Gameplay - 8/10Final Opinion:Congratulations to the creators for creating something incredible. I can not believe this was done with RpgMaker software.As soon as I saw the announcement of the game in steam I fell in love soon, I'm crazy about this kind of genre.It is undoubtedly a simulator of real life, each choice has consequences, good or bad. If you like love story this is definitely worth playing.I can not wait for the ""Sometimes Always Monsters""So I do recommend it.Note: 8/10			"

												Like an immersive storytelling RPG on a Gameboy Color.Not really a game though, more of a thought/social experiment.Interesting play, but don't expect entertainment or to casually blow time with this.It's for thinking about life decision's and why they don't really matter. "

												Many different endings you can get to. Some quests are harder than others and so many different choices to make to survive. It also shows a value in some parts of life. Showing a lesson when playing this game and the end lesson is at the very end. I would highly recommend this game.			"

												Honestly I felt the game lacked some things. There were no realistic consequences to anything you did whether it was truly horrible. The story was very straightforward and even with the different endings, it still didn't satisfy me. What was the sense of doing all those things in the game if you can still reach a ""good"" end regardless of your actions? I also found it annoying that the mac version of this game has a bug where you do not get any achievements.			"

												It's shenmue with drugs and broken relationships, for better or worse. I always sometimes appreciate everything this game tries to do, even if it sometimes gets tedious or frustrating or... outright bad in a few minute cases. The plot is compellingly written and the characters and situations you find yourself in are quite interesting. Really, ASM gets a pass almost exclusively due to how well-written it is. It's very good in that respect. It's when it remembers it's a game that it falters. Crawling around a labyrinthine series of ventilation shafts until I want TO DIE isn't really my idea of engaging the player with a deep narrative, and hauling around a ton of boxes - while strangely meditative in a way not entirely disimilar to shenmue's errant forklift simulation - just makes me think about everything else I could be doing with my time. I get why some of the more tedious moments are there, I just don't think certain parts of it work on the possibly-intended deeper conceptual level. Tedious is tedious. But most everything else is fine so I guess I can excuse a few moments of ABJECT SUFFERING. LET ME SUFFOCATE IN THE VENTS. THERE'S NOTHING ELSE FOR ME HERE.Always Sometimes Monsters is more than the sum of its parts. That's the tried-and-true way of saying that some parts of it are Not Good, but the thing's still worth playing.			"

												Always Sometimes Monsters was a game I picked up about 3 years ago during a July sale and I regret everything. This game could've been amazing but fell very flat for me. So let's get into the review.Pros:-Soundtrack is decent-Very nice art-Lovable, funny characters-Good sense of humor-Morality based chocies-You can name your character 'Titts McGee' or something equally as inmature and none of the characters seem to careCons:-'Moral' choices are not actually choices-ONE ending. ONE FREAKING ENDING-Lazy story telling towards the end-Characters do things out of character and ultimatley ruin everything-Goes for the predictable ending when it could've been something so much better-'Twist' MY♥♥♥♥♥SPOILERS REVIEW:The friend character Sam (girl or boy depending on which gender character you pick) ruins the whole game. They were a lovable character until the last hour. It's completely out of character for them to be a gambler and then OF COURSE they have to be the guy whose telling the whole story. And then they get shot by the gansters? It literally makes no sense and makes me want to break a kitten's neck. Sam and your character STILL COULD'VE BEEN FRIENDS BUT NOPE. SHTTY STORYTELING.Overall: 5/10 for the art and side characters for stealing the show. "
