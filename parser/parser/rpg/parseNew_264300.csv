												This game is a blast! A friend convinced me to buy this so we could co-op together and I had my doubts. I wasnt looking for insane graphics all I wanted was something fun that worked with no glitches. This game delivered. Its just straight up fun to shoot the hell out of the creative enemys. Loads of progression and replay value here. Your constintly trying to keep the horde at by while picking up as much cash as possible for that next upgrade. Its good old fashion shoot em up fun.			"

												A capable and more importantly fun twin stick shooter with tower defense elements and imaginative monster design.   Includes a sketch and text based narrative tied to a full location based campaign that attempts to imbue the player with immersion.   Store based system using in game currency allows for purchases and upgrades of weapons, armors, abilities and turrets.   Levels include set pieces and reward based mission based objectives.  Has multiple difficultly levels, the most difficult of which will test your skills and abilities. Responding to a friend of mine who is a fan of Nation of Red.  My opinion is that Guns n Zombies is more functional and has more elements which renders the game more distinguishable.  I'll enumerate to make my point.  - Turret placement- In game in level currency for purchasing and placing turrets providing a tower defense flavor.- Sketch and text based story tied to a location based campaign.- Store for purchasing and upgrading weapons.- Exploratory elements make levels not just about surviving but about exploring.- Imaginative monster design.  Actually where are the zombies ?  Guns n Monsters is more appropriate, however the unique monster designs provide for an indelible experience.- Set pieces.Nation of Red can be categorized as a rogue like twin stick where Guns n Zombies is a campaign based twin stick.  Both excellent games which every twin stick fan can enjoy.			"

												Guns n Zombies is a top down shooter in which you fight, you guessed it, Zombies. You fight hoards and hoards of them. This game was released in late 2014. You control one of two playable characters, one seems to be more of a standard run and gun character whilst the other is more of an engineer. You have two weapon slots in which you can customize which weapons you can carry by buying different ones via the upgrade shop. The currency that is used drops from various different zombies as you mow your way through the hoards.  Your character also has a special abilities, which have a timed cool down, and these again can be upgraded through the shop.  This game also tries to add in a little bit of tower defense mechanics too, each level has a number of different ""build points"" - where you can build your turrets, ranging from explosive cannons, to machine guns, or just something as simple as a slowing down sort of turret.  To me this feature seemed a little bit pointless as it didn't really add anything to the game for me. The controls are very simple. WASD to move around, mouse to shoot, and the number keys for your special abilities. To me this seemed like the best option over using a controller, but some may prefer to play twin stick shooters on a game pad. Graphically I felt like Guns n Zombies was not really up to par, it just looked dated and run down. Most of the textures were certainly not high res, animations look a bit weird, and environments just looked bland and boring if I am honest. All of the menus were also in a strange aspect ratio that I had never seen before. They looked like they were made for the hard of hearing. I am going to be honest, I lost track of the story about half way through - the game does a really bad job of explaining what is going on, it's all in sort of a Power point presentation show in between each level, and offers no clues on what is actually happening. For me to ended up getting to the end with no idea as to what had transpired. The difficulty in Guns n Zombies is actually pretty high. I was finding my self dying on the early levels, and often found my self having to go back to the previous stage just to earn more currency so I could buy the next weapon up. For me, that is just a badly designed way of doing it. I shouldn't be made to replay the content I have just done in this type of game - I could understand it in an MMO of sorts, but not a twin stick shooter like this. A playthrough on single player took me just under four hours to finish. For me that felt like way longer than I would of liked it to have. Maybe this was because I just wasn't enjoying my time playing, I don't know. Where all of the compliments and positive reviews seem to come into play, is the multiplayer co-op. Personally I wasn't able to find anyone to play with, so I was stuck with the single player. If you can get a few friends together to play, you may well have a ton more fun than on your own. Apart from the strange aspect resolution on the menus, there are no major bugs that I encountered, everything seemed to run smoothly at the higher resolutions, which is always a plus point. Sadly I am not going to recommend Guns n Zombies here; I just didn't have fun whilst playing it. It felt very vanilla, slow and just not fun to play. I would say that you really should not pick this up if you are planning to play it as a single player game, you probably will not have fun at all. If you are going to get one or two friends together to play co-op, sure, playing with friends makes everything better, but I can certainly see it making Guns n Zombies all together more fun. I would say pick it up if it drops below 50% off, just because it offers a good pick up and play feel, but nothing more than that.  Tom's Score Card1) Stay away2) Only recommended when on sale3) Recommended4) Highly recommended5) This is a must playIf you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up.

												Excellent and pretty addictive top-down shooter.+ 3 different characters (the last one, if you buy the dlc, which I strongly suggest you to do, since it gives a bunch of cool weapons, some new levels, new enemies and costs only 4€ without a discount...)+ Great variety of weapons, armors and special skills to buy and upgrade.+ Many different turrets, especially if you choose the mechanic -with whom you'll be able to try quite a lot of combinations- which gives a mild strategic tone in the gameplay, too.+ Hordes of zombies (and alliens with the dlc) to slay (personal favorite the reapers who in groups can be very difficult to kill without losing hp), plus 3 cool but not very difficult bosses (1 with the dlc).+ Good variety of levels and different locations.+ The graphics are nice, and the sounds are good, too.+ Frantic and mindless zombie/alien smashing is always fun and relaxing :)+ The survival mode.+/- If you want to gain every achievement you will need to do a lot of grinding.+/- The story is not original and quite uninteresting, but a ok excuse to start killing everything moving around you.- Some minor bugs here and there.- Sometimes there are problems with the pathfinding and the character gets stuck in front of invisible objects.- I think the electric rifles (added with the dlc) are a lot overpowered than the others, because, although they don't fire at a big distance, they do massive amounts of damage to the enemies near the character and from the time I bought the most expensive (and coolest) weapon of this category, every other seemed quite useless.- The game even in hell difficulty is pretty easy and I don't remember being killed by the enemies more than 10 times (most of them were in the last boss which is pretty tough and all of the other deaths were because I fell into the void many times in the last levels).Recommended to every fan of mindless top-down shooting even at the original price, although in the latest November sales the package with the dlc costed only 1€ which is a great offer considering it'll give you about 10 hours of gameplay if you want to complete the story with all the characters and a lot more if you want to gain all achievements.

												Guns N Zombies is a money hoarding, tower building, and mutant popping survival game with much more emphasis on the shooting than on tower defense. It takes roughly 6 hours to go through the first time and is actually pretty heavy on the graphics so it will heat up your computer despite being an indie game. The game definitely has its problems but it’s worth it to play if you enjoy horde survival games and are looking for a cheap one to kill some time.  7/10Guns N Zombies’ story is pretty thin, and is told through short cutscenes at the start of each mission. Some sort of disaster happens in the not too distant future, related to biological testing and cybernetic implants. It results in the world being overrun with zombies, but the truth is they’re more like the creatures in Killing Floor, since almost all of them are cyborg creations and only about 1% of them are actually zombies. Gameplay is third person isometric perspective, similar to the Diablo games, but with all guns and no melee attacks. This means you can get surrounded pretty easily, especially near the beginning of the game. When you kill an enemy there’s a chance they’ll drop a blue crystal, which is the “money” of the game. The more powerful enemies drop more crystals, but I didn’t realize until about halfway through the game that there seems to be a limit of how many crystals can exist at once. This means you need to pick up the ones on the ground if you want more to appear, otherwise you’ll be killing enemies, and nothing will drop. Between missions you can spend your crystals on upgrades such as body armor, better weapons, and upgrades to your turrets. Also bear in mind that you have a character level, which limits what equipment you have access to. Most of the gear you can buy has a level requirement, and the levels don’t actually have any other benefit (you don’t get stronger when you level up, you just get the ability to buy better gear).The “tower defense” part of the game is actually pretty limited. Each mission only has a few places where you can actually place a tower (referred to as turrets), and you have a “cool down” between placing and upgrading the towers. This means you can’t just lay down a huge number of towers and expect them to protect you. You place a tower, and you can’t upgrade or place a new one for about 30 seconds. This means that you’re going to need to fight for yourself about 90% of the game, don’t count on the towers to save you.  There are 2 character classes that you can choose from at the start of the game, a fighter class and an engineer class.  The fighter has more health and can have 3 special abilities (you buy these). The engineer can create more and stronger towers. I’ll grant you that some of these high level engineer towers are pretty awesome (black hole cannon!), but the 30 second cool down is a real party pooper. In many levels the enemies spawn endlessly, so you’re not just waiting 30 seconds, you’re fighting for your life while waiting for it.Pros:+Nice graphics and some cool enemies and weapons. There are also some boss fights but they mostly consist of running away as you shoot backwards at a giant monster chasing you.+I really like games where you have the opportunity to grind for money and buy upgrades (so you can become more powerful than you’re “supposed” to be). Guns N Zombies lets you replay missions as many times as you want so you can get more crystals for upgrades. I’m pretty sure you can beat the game only buying like 3 weapons out of 20 or so. You certainly will not have a high enough level to buy the most powerful guns without replaying missions A LOT.Cons:-There is very very little documentation for this game online. I couldn’t find much information other than the game’s steam discussion page. This is a real problem because the game does not have a tutorial or even an option screen to see key bindings. I don’t need to change the key configuration; I just want to know what they are!-The grind for money can get tedious by the end. Yes I like grinding for money, but if you want the most powerful guns in the game you really need to replay the same levels over about 50 times. I ended up buying the most powerful rocket launcher, and it was almost exactly the same as the second most powerful, it just had a larger clip. A waste of about an hour of grinding since there’s no save/load to undo the purchase and try something else. On the plus side, all that grinding gave me about 80% of the game’s Steam achievements. "

								If you're into games like dead nation you will probably like this game. But that being said it's not much of a story you basically just clear out levels by killing waves of zombies. For 5 bucks it's a pretty fun game and it is early access so there is plenty of room for improvement.

												Pros:+Lots of weapons to upgrade+Lots of armor and abilities to upgrade+Online Coop (see con)+Lots of achievementsCons:-No local coop-Only coop with friends that have the game-You get stuck on the environment a lot-Bullets go through enemies that are too close-Turrets die fast and are semi pointlessGuns 'N' Zombies is a twin stick shooter that feels kind of generic.  There's a story of sorts, but nothing that you'll remember.  There are a few bosses, but the bosses are extrememly easy to beat and the stages are very small and boring.  You can also place turrets in marked spots that either shoot at the monsters, slow them down or pulse a damaging element.There's a lot of weapons and armor to buy, but only one gun really matters.  Once you buy the electric gun and upgrade your armor that alone will net you victory!  Each gun you buy whether it's the machine gun, sniper rifle, grenade launcher, shotgun or the god like electric gun can be upgraded 3 times then the next tier of the same gun is purchasable.  The same goes for the armor and once you reach a new character level you can purchase new armor that can be upgraded 3 times to make stronger.  All the weapons can be carried at the same time and cycled through.There are a lot of different types of monsters throughout the levels and that's a good thing.  By the time you reach the end of the game you would have seen 10+ different types.  There's a survival mode that you can compete in also.  This mode is just to see how long you can last and there's a leaders board that shows EVERYONE that has bought the game and their score.The game itself is around 3 hours or so, but with grinding to upgrade your weapons and getting achievements you can triple the game time.  I'd definitely grab this game on sale (including the DLC for $1 total) to get a few hours of enjoyement, but it's not worth it at all for the asking price.  5/10.  Fun at times, but forgettable.			"

												This is a solid little top down/twin stick shooter!  It has some bugs here and there, but the game play is pretty great.  If you like the twin stick genre.The gunplay is accurate and you'll notice some differences when you upgrade your weapons which makes it rewarding.  The turret system didn't interest me much at first, but it's growing on me.  The graphics aren't mind blowing, but they make for a fun atmosphere for running around and blowing up zombies!  The story is skippable, I haven't paid much attention to it.  I'm just here to shoot stuff in twin stick style, which is ace.  As for bugs, I've noticed on a map or two where it doesn't register the end of a wave.  That's kind of a bummer, because you have to quit your current game.  There's at least one invisible item I can think of so far that I've ran into as well, which is difficult mostly becase there's a perk achivement attached to it.  Otherwise, I've had nothing but fun with this one.   There's also online co-op supposedly, but I haven't attempted it and the boards state there's a lot of problems with firewalls.  Be aware if that's your primary goal for this one. There's an upgrade system in which you can buy better weapons, stats, etc. and it all works pretty well.  It serves as a good carrot to go back and replay maps to grind out levels and beef up your character for the later maps.  However, there is no real tutorial that I found that shows you all of this stuff.  Not a big deal, you can figure it out easily enough.  You just may be confused for a bit. For it's current $1.19 price tag in the Halloween sale, GunsNZombies is a steal!  For the full $8, I may not have jumped on it so quickly, but $5 feels like a great price for it.  If you like twin stick's, come play it'll be fun.			"

Early Access Review
								I'm on the fence with this one, as the overall premise is fun (sorta top down shooter with waves of zombies to kill on each level - think alien breed with zombies) but there are some issues with framerate (which with 8gb ram, an i74700MQ and Nvidia 740M I should not be getting) and the controls feel clunky, with your character often getting stuck on random objects and just feeling...off when moving.  The game is also rather confusing as it lacks much of a tutorial system (it took me a minute to figure out how to use turrets and abilities, as the ingame prompts aren't very clear).  For an early access there are a good number of levels, and there is an upgrade system but I haven't played enough to really comment on it yet.  The game also features laughably bad english which adds...character.  If they can iron out some of the control clunkiness this will be well worth the effort, but now, well, its a clunky zombie filled dubstepy Alien Breed!			"

												I Had fun with this, and you might do too.There's nothing groundbreaking or particularly amazing here, but it's fairly solid, and does what it does quite well, I'm a big fan of twin stick games and am fairly easy to please, so bear that in mind :) The game has just been updated again, fixing lots of CoOp bugs and vairous other mishaps, also talk of updating to Unity 5, so I guess support will be going on for a while longer.If you have big doubts about buying this game I'd say maybe skip it, or wait a little while for more updates. If you think ""rad"" as soon as you see a twin stick game before looking at the details, you'll probably have some fun with this.EDIT* I think there has been more than 10 updates from last time I played.

MGN Review - 6 November 2014Pros:+ Follows a tried and tested formula, similar to many successful Flash/Mobile games.+ Variety of weapons.+ Familiar game mechanics.+ A lot of potential.+ Attempt at a somewhat different zombie-outbreak story.Cons:- Lacks innovation.- Repetitive gameplay.- No tutorial/lacks information.- Lacks polish.- Questionable UI design decisions.- Weak sound effects, if not missing entirely.- Co-op play is broken.- No oprion ro modify controls or rebind keys.Verdict: Buy at discounted priceWhile the game has potential, it's hard to recommend it due to the simple fact that there are similar games which are much better. It's an indie game, yeah; but that's no excuse for putting out a product that feels like an Alpha. Despite this, considering keeping an eye on this game. Hopefully the developers will continue to refine and polish the game.

 Guns'N'Zombies Lets start with the things I don't like. There are very few. The menus, I find them a little awkward to navigate (might be because i play with a controller, still there are alternative way of structuring a menu for controllers that i have witnessed that work well (Shoot Many Robots being one game that does this well)) The missions where you have to collect a certain amount of currency for the bonus star. This criteria often conveniently plops itself on the missions I don't want to replay. I just find this extra side thingy a little cheap and unimaginative. Dead ends in the level design. When kiting the zombies all Killing Floor style I like to have somewhere to run and sometime you find yourself in a dodgy alley with nowhere to go and yeah, you know the rest..All that is merely a single hydrogen atom on our vast sun. This game is nice. Co-op. Yep. Nice feature and all to have in a game however sometimes you find Co-op games can scale up the difficulty too much making single player a chore. The reason why Co-op is being mentioned here is mainly due to the fact that it works and doesn't ruin the lonely single player experience. Leveling is a nice thing to have in a game however mostly nit so much when its a grind. Luckily for us there is no grind as the levels are spaced out just right, leaving you with a nice sense of accomplishment as you go through the missions; put those stripper poles back in your attic, you don't need them. I finished the game playing normal (did the first 2 stages on Hell) and got to level 17 of which the final item is unlocked at level 20. Apart from what I said a minute ago about the dead ends the level design is rather nice, All of the levels look different so these guys haven't done that annoying thing that some developers do and recycle the bean can out of it. *phew* Enemy variation. This is done nicely. You can see where they got lots of the inspiration from. The Goon being similar to L4D's Tank, Witch is basically a Siren from Killing Floor and the Kamikaze being very much like the Suicider of Dead Island (Minus the creepy laugh and slurring of the work ""yeeeaaaahhh""). Each enemy has a easy way to clear them out. None of them are particularly hard to kill however they shouldn't be underestimated, strength in numbers. I found myself dying from the weaker enemies due to the sheer quantity of them coming at me. Weapon variation. You have 4 types of weapons. Assault Rifles/ Machine Guns, Shotguns, Explosives, Snipers. These get very sci-fi very fast with lasers and railguns and even singularity rockets. The idea to use fictional weapons in the game means that you can significantly vary how each one behaves making them different, not necessarily better or worse (You are now man and shotgun, you may now kiss your.. Please don't). Most weapons are an upgrade on the last so there isn't much point in going back to many of them however the few such as the singularity rocket launcher is very useful for controlling where you want the enemies to go and also condensing a large crowd. The classes in the game at this point are nice, I am excited for the DLC and arrival of the first female playable, It would be nice to see an even amount in male and female characters regardless of the demographic however if that's how the developers wanted their game, who am I to say anything. Anyway, off that tangent. The 2 classes are cool. The Warrior with a damage resistance increase however basically useless towers (Only really good as a distraction for enemies) and then there is my personal favourite, The Mechanic. He has a huge range in turret arsenal however this comes at the cost of only being able to have 1 ability (whereas The Warrior can have 3). Only having 1 ability isn't that damaging to your game as there are a couple that pull nicely and even in the later levels on Hell difficulty the turrets can really deal hefty damage, There is a singularity rocket turret also so that means you can switch out that Launcher for something with more damage output.This was just a small amount of the things I like about the game and i could go on but I wanted to keep this review short (Good job me!!). The amount of playtime you get out of this game for £5.59 makes that a very reasonable purchase, I finished the game at 7 hours however i had been messing around with both characters so it is probably completeable in an average of 5 hours or so. I got this game in the recent sale for a steal at 55p so my expectations were not that high however it has exceeded them with simple, fun gameplay.			"

								What a great game.  This game was designed very well, with replay value in mind.  There are many levels and locations to battle from, many weapons to choose from and upgrade, and turrets that you may place down giving it a touch of tower defense.  I would recommend this game to anyone a fan of this genre or zombie games.  There is one con I have found in this game, you get stuck on random objects, forcing you to scramble a few directions to get unstuck.  It happens more than it should and for how great of a game this is, it's a buzz kill.  However, this is the only 'con' I can find in a game that does so many other things right.If you're reading this review, you are already interested in buying and I say go for it!			"

												If you just have to have another arena style twin stick shooter involving zombie's that looks like it was made in Unity. Then I suppose you might as well pick this one up while it's on sale and dirt cheap. However that being said, Nation Red was a much better game. If you don't own Nation Red, then I would buy that before this. If you do own Nation Red, then buying this will be somewhat disappointing in comparrison. Enjoy!			"

Early Access Review
								For $5, this game was absolutely worth it. I love how you can change the difficulty on the levels so that it never gets to hard or easy. I really like the special abilities and the different kind of guns you can upgrade. The gameplay is awesome, the graphics are solid, and the music brings it all together. I can’t wait for cooperative! I did a gameplay of this game, check it out if you're interested!

												lol this game. I bought it simply because it is made by Krealit and I liked their I am Weapon (not Revival. That one is bad, don't buy).Pros: okay-level graphics and visual effectsrelatively simple mechanisms and neat interfaceCons:nearly everything else-trash music and sound effects-poor artwork-poorly designed level difficulty and ridiculously stupid objectives. Sometimes asking you to not gain more than 500 credits so you have to NOT kill anything on easiet difficulty and try to pass the stupid level quick, sometimes asking to gain 20K credits which is impossible to get within one try even on hardest difficulty so you have to play twice. Sometimes asking you to not get attacked by acid or witches, in which levels there are tons of acid and witches, while the AI of spider is stupid. And sometimes asking you to get gasoline, which is hidden in a very twisted and chaotic maps, while your jeep is left to be attacked....What the ♥♥♥♥ are even all those objectives??? Who the hell designed them and what are the purposes of them?? -gaming balance in early game and late game, are both, literally trash. You just can't pass certain levels without multiple tries after gaining enough money and ranks, and the game would end far earlier before you gain the final tier weapons, while unlocking them simply means you need to repeat former levels, which is an extraordinarily boring and painful experience-boring, long and repetitive gaming progress. You are just shoting at the enemies that doesn't seem intimating at all regardless of whatever the new type of zombies that are coming for you. Those recurring ""signature"" krealit monsters are just reused assets from former franchaise. Getting new weapons? Cool. It would look different, but the actual effects and damage doesn't differ much.   -monster design is bad as ♥♥♥♥. The models look totally no cool, feels ugly and unappealing, not terrifying or exciting enough to make you want to kill them at all, absoultely ruining your will to continue on-boring and repetitive DLC, which also has bad monster design and making-no-sense plot (spoliers: aliens crashed on earth get infected by zombies and becoming zombies aliens...whatever this stupid idea is, you get my point: don't buy the DLC) -weapon effects and monster actions in most of the times does not make sense. the cop shields can shield everything, even the highest tier late game super fantastic space sniper railgun, which is described as able to  ""penetrate toughest armor""-poor map design, tons of unnecessary obstacles hindered your path-poor maintainence. Knowing that all those garbage are actually made quite a while ago, you may ask why didn't the developers fix them according to user's reviews? Well the fact is they TOTALLY didn't care about your ideas at all. They just make it, throw onto the shelf, no updates par your request, no bug fixes, and letting it be bad and be rotten to disguest you. -game has quite a bit of bugs to be fixed. Okay cool, how many years have passed since the game released, and why aren't they fixed yet??Just don't buy. Even when it is on sale. You are playing to torture yourself.			"

												This game at first it looks boring and easy to beat and yea its pretty easy once you get the best weapons but, when it comes to harder difficulties the game gets intense and you nedd to plan head before they come at you i wouldn't say its the best its just addicting and you'd want to play hours until you get the best gear and figure out how to kill them faster and not get killed. The game is alright however when it comes to co-op no one is playing or the sever not working idk, but when you play survival they just keep coming and coming luckly this is infinte ammo so you don't have to worry.

												I love this kind of gameplay. The game itself feels like a rough, unpolished, mobile-port to boots, yet charming in the weird way. For the price you can get it now, it is worth the purchase.Gameplay is casual, pick'up and play. Mindless shooting, but enjoyable for the genre fans.However, the game is very short, and has limited contents. Once you know what you are doing, you can breeze through missions really fast. (you can 'completely' ignore every enemies in some missions, and finish them very fast.)It also has some minor problems I found so far likes, rockets fly over enemies until you switch to other weapons, and back, one enemy type that do nothing but teleporting, and AIs freeze from time to time under slow-field effects. Nothing is game-breaking through.			"

Early Access Review
								At first I was like ok simple over head shooter, but for the price you have so much to get for weapons and upgrades it's makes it so much better. Co-Op can't for I was randomly looking for zombie games over the head top down view and found this and am I so happy I did! Performance is awesome steady 60 fps no stutter. I like this game better than a lot of 50 dollar games. If you like over head games try its 7 dollars help the devs make co op even better! BTW this is what early access is for small dev's trying to make a name for themselves, not some million dollar company charging 30 dollars for early access.  To be honest they need to have requirement if the company want use early access on steam they shouldn't have revenue over 500k, unless a small indie company makes a good first game and does another early access. Big name companies are running the early access purpose by trying to lure customers in with it, it really needs to stop. This is a very fun game and addicting one, how many times have you wasted 50 bucks on crap games???? It's only 7.99 you be able to play and either enjoy it, wait for co-op or play a couple hours and never play it again but you will get your monies worth ONLY if you like top down shooters, I love most and this is definitely worth getting for early access and playing after it releases!  Keep up the good work guys!!!			"

												Guns'n'Zombies'n'Aliens is a short, but fun isometric action game. Co-op is where this game shines. In 9 hours me and a friend had played through all levels on hell difficulty, grabbing 3 stars for doing all challenges on each level.If you're flying solo it's decent for a few hours of action depending on your skill level. If you do play alone, I recommend playing an engineer because the turrets make everything more manageable and exploring levels less of a pain.			"

												Guns n Zombies offers a fun romp through 19 levels filled to the brim with zombies: a few things can get into the way of the fun but it remains a nonetheless enjoyable shooter.PROS:-fun gameplay, mowing down tons of zombies is always a good way to spend your time-charming graphics with a good,slightly cartoonish,art style-two different classes to choose from (three with the new dlc)-huge selection of weapons,turrets,character abilites and armor,all can be upgraded aswell-good amount of levels with different objectives-the zombies are interesting and there's quite a few different ones, each with their model and abilities-three different difficulty settings,plus three extra goals per level to give you an extra challenge-an interesting and quite original story-I can see this being a VERY fun coop gameCONS:-the game doesn't really explain himself,you mostly have to find out the controls by yourself-controls can't be changed,you're stuck with the preset keys-weapon sounds and level music can get annoying in the long run-movement feels a bit imprecise at times-it's not always clear what items/narrow spaces will block your movement and what'll let you pass, this can get annoying if you fail a level due to getting stuck and mobbed by zombies-certain levels are quite hard to beat without upgrades so you'll have to grind previous levels/hard mode to actually progress, this can get dull-advanced turrets/armor/weapons cost alot of money, making progression drag quite a bit-the two game bosses are quite unimpressive overall and easy to beat-a few graphical glitches with zombie animations and achievement counters-some less than stellar english in certain sections

The game for me was a very fun experience punctuated by a few boring times when I had to grind to upgrade my character. This reliance on grinding sadly ruins the story flow and I'd have preferred a system with a smoother upgrade curve.Still, Guns n Zombies is a fun game and even after finishing the story it left me entertained enough to replay a few levels on higher difficulty settings to get new weapons and hunt achievements.You can get it for peanuts on bundles or when it's on sale, for less than a dollar it's totally worth it, especially if you get a friend to play it with you.

												This game is fun, and there are plenty of upgrades to earn.  It has a cool story narrative and mini-achievements in each level, which can be played over until all of them have been achieved. It also has varying levels of difficulty according to the gamer's preference. Not done with it yet, but it's looking to definitely be worth the money I spent on it, as long as there are at least 10 more missions (on mission 3 now, Normal difficulty). This developer is competent enough to provide a polished, entertaining, final product. I would like to find out which development tools his team used.			"

Early Access Review
								An okayish top-down shooter that looks nice but has too floaty gameplay to be really fun. Your guy needs almost a second to stop after your told him to do so, bullets lazily flow from your gun like you're shooting underwater. Maybe it's just the thing for mobile gaming of meaty fingers on glass but with a mouse or even a gamepad in your hand such lack of speed, control and oomph feels boring.Russian review: Обычный топ-даун шутер. Приятный на вид, но слишком инертный чтобы по-настоящему увлекать. У героя уходит почти секунда, чтобы остановиться когда отпущена кнопка перемещения; пули лениво выплывают из ствола «калашникова», словно всё происходит под водой. Возможно, такая неспешность — то, что нужно на мобильных платформах, где приходится возить пальцами по стеклу, но с мышью или геймпадом в руке неповоротливость персонажа вместе с перестрелками, лишёнными смака, невыносима.

BottomlineThis is a very enjoyable couch game. Best enjoyed with a gamepad.Developer stills supports this gamePro'sSolid gameplay/mecanics.BalancedSufficient variationGreat Dev support!ConsThere is some story but because of the presentation i skipped it.A few tiny bugsI had to retrack previous missions for achievements to gain the money needed to upgrade my gear. The gameplay is fun enough, and the achievements are (for the most part) not that hard, so it doesn't feel like a 'chore'. To challenge yourself there are some more difficult achievements and you can increase difficulty whenever you'd like.This game doesn't excel at anything (but dev support) nor has any unique features. But it still is a very solid game and i had (and will have some more) a good amount of fun :)Dev support is everything i could wish for. An extremely rare feature these days.Got a gamebreaking bug, contacted dev through steam discussions and he fixed the game! (not the other way around)Game runs well enough on MBPr 13 (1280*800).Would definitly buy from this developper again.I haven't completed the story yet nor played the DLC and multyplayer.I will update once i have.

												Let me start by sayng I am neither a fan of shooters neither zombie games, I rather kill an orc with a sword than a zombie with a shotgun, i rather use plate armor than kevlar vest, you get it, I like RPGs. That being said I was amazed at how much I loved guns n zombies(-n aliens). It sat around in my library for a while, because i had got it on a sale a few moths before and I wasnt expecting much of it so I hadnt played it yet, when I saw they released the DLC n aliens, it was on sale as well, I got it and went on to finally trying out the game.Next thing I realized I had been playing for five hours and was late for my dialysys treatment (which i have to undergo 3x a week), when I got back home from it the first thing I did was turning on the PC to keep playing it, it´s really addictive.-The Good.Lots of RPG elements, leveling (though no real stats or choices when leveling, that would improve the game even further), which is mostly for item requirements, but so many diferent guns, all of them upgradable, armors, turrets(which you can use or not, it´s up to you). .Different classes, there´s one, for instance, that is specialized in turrets, another one in support turrets, I´m playing as warrior, specialized in combat..Replayable missions, each one with their own set of achievments and individual dificulty.You can resurrect by using a currency that you get as reward for some achievments, it´s really good to respawn from that unfair death when you were finally beating that level on hell difficulty whith all achievments, but it´s restrict to a few uses in the entire playthough, so it doesnt make it easy..Lots of creative guns, very well balanced, each one with a unique design and way to play it, they have really different playstyles for different guns, it´s amazing, all of them upgradable as I mentioned..top equipment is expensive(in-game money only ofc) so it´s a reason to replay missions a lot and aim for all the achievments, which reward you with cash or respawn currency..Lots of different enemies, very well designed, beautiful really, incredible AI, not easily tricked, each enemy has a different way to fight against it as well..Tower defense elements if you use turrets, the class I am playing doesnt have all, so I use them mostly to draw off mobs so I dont get swamped, although in some levels they are really helpful..good, compelling story.CHEAP, really cheap for what you are getting, and it´s often on sale..Have I mentioned all the guns?.A lot of replayability, you are going to want to finish it once with each classThe Bad.A couple achievments are broken, but the dev said they will fix it.It could have more RPG elements, like stats, and a character sheet, and choices to be made when leveling, skills maybe. ( they do it with gear pretty well though, but both things would be sweet!)Thanx for the great game			"

												For people who played a game called Dead Nation on PS3 putting it shortly believe it or not even though they are the same price this game is the ""poor man's"" version of that game.Now for those who didn't play Dead Nation. This game is pretty repetitive and not challenging. For the time I played it was repetitive wave after wave ""zombie"" killing (half of the creatures are even aliens, maybe it's from the DLC but I played main campaign so I guess DLC adds just new enemies to main campaign or maybe it's not that). All you do is just hold left button and run around and pretty much that's all you do, nothing else mission after mission and the upgrades of the guns are very, very simple. Not challenging? Why? Well because as I said you just run around and hold left button. Why? Because the zombies barely do any damage to you, even the ""special zombies"" don't do any damage so you don't even have to care about them and you also don't seem to run out of ammo, you just reload infinite ammo so you can just hold the button constantly and that's how you finish waves to complete missions. There is a thing called ""special ability"" that doesn't even add anything to the game. On top of everything the graphics are meh. I got bored quickly and so much that I just couldnt continue to play any longer. I personally cannot recommend this game.			"

												Guns n Zombies is a run and gun game where you must kill zombies and zombies and zombies and more zombies to level up and buy better and better equipment to kill more zombies.There are different kind and size of them and they try to kill you around different scenarios whose designs are uninteresting and a little bit repetitive.There are a lot of weapons available: machine guns, electric guns, crossbows, different kind of turrets that you can customize.... you can buy them via the upgrade shop, and you can also buy armours and other kind of thing to defend yourself or increase your powers.The main character is easy to control using five keys and mouse to aim and shot around. You must also use number keys to use some special habilities, for example in the first stages you can activate a dron that helps you killing every zombie near you.The main story is explained using slides between the stages but its not the best point of the game.Graphics are correct, music and sound are quite normal.The game has a co-op mode and I think that this option gives you a better experience than the single mode because this game remembers Gaunlet to me and in that game i was enjoy a lot playing with friends.It has achivements and trading cards.Nice game for sweating adrenalinePD: Thanks to Shade00			"

Review copy providedGuns n Zombies is a top-down shooter where you fight hordes of zombies and various other creatures through the power of guns.Story-As I am writing this I am still currently working my way through the story. From what I have seen so far you are in the middle of the zombie apocalypse trying to find out what caused the disaster. It gives some sort of slide presentation in between each level to try and explain the story, but overall it is rather ordinary. Gameplay-I am currently playing through the singleplayer mode, but I feel co-op may be better, and so far it has been quite difficult and to pass the stage sometimes you might have to grind up money to purchase a better weapon (which there is a wide range of) to enable you to succeed. This can cause repetitive gameplay which is always a bit of an annoyance but there is a variety of levels with different objectives.It can be enjoyable trying to lure zombies away from something you are trying to protect and to turn their attention to you so you can mow them down. However, if you accidently make them follow you into an enclosed area you will have no hope trying to awkwardly maneuver through them. This is also due to the fact that the maps feel very confined. You can choose to use your guns to exterminate the zombies or use turrets. When using the shotgun and letting out a small burst whilst trying to walk in a direction your screen will gawkily try to decide which direction you should be facing and kind of spaz out. This can also happen when you brush pass a zombie. When shooting I found that some of the shots wouldn't be detected on the zombies (this wasn't just my bad aim). Playing with turrets can make the game have a tower-defense aspect to it which was interesting, but the way to purchase them was questionable because if you press TAB to see if you can build one and find out that you can't, or you just accidentally pressed that key, it will lock you out of your ability to access the turret system for a short period of time.Graphics-The graphics are rather simple and not terrific in any way, but the cartoonish feel to them lets it slip by.HUD-Isn't much of a tutorial and there is no key rebindingMusic & Sounds- Music and sounds are okay. Nothing special.SummaryPros✔ Wide range of weapons✔ Turrets adds tower-defense feel✔ Enjoyable to lure zombies✔ Cartoonish style is effective✔ Levels with different objectivesNeutral✔/✘Music and sounds are okay✔/✘Graphics aren't special✔/✘Story is ordinaryCons✘ Repetitive gameplay, even with weapons, etc.✘ Turret system is questionable✘ No tutorial or key rebinding✘ Maps feel very confinedConclusionI am rather undecided whether to recommend this game or not. It feels like the type of game that should have ""Mixed"" reviews. It definately isn't bad it is just plain mediocre and really doesn't do anything new to this genre. That being said I did enjoy some parts of this game but I feel it might be better for co-op (I have heard there are some problems with it currently). Some of you may very well enjoy this game a lot so if you want it, grab it on sale as you may be disappointed paying full price for it.6/10Liked that review? I have others! "

												I enjoy this game, even though it is a bit grindy in later stages. Theres little side objectives for bonus loot that you can aim for in each level which will make you go back for more, especially if you are a completionist.Too bad that it's only for 2 players online coop, so one of my friends is left out. They should have listed how many players can play online at one time in the description.By the way, I bought the Ether healer listed under the turret but I can't seem to equip it or place it down on the turret stations. Is it a bug or is it a passive thing, or am I just doing something wrong? lol.			"

												Bought this game for the co-op, and it exceeded by expectations. For such a cheap price you get smooth multiplayer, good graphics, and fantastic zombie killing fun with a multitude of gun/character/turret upgrades and choices. I like they're added the element of turrets and different characters to layer the styles of play. I also enjoy the different maps and enemy types, especially the Bridge map.10/10 would brain again			"

In any case this game is worthy and bettert to play with a friend. It could get very difficult by your self. I am not sure if I would pay the full price ($10.0) for this game but even if you do and forget how much you paid you would most likely enjoy it.			"

												Totally bonkers. Non-stop firing and death. It is a bit generic but you cannot expect much from a $7 game. It isn't so generic that it ruins the game. The graphics, weapons, and enemies are all well done and the game is a total blast to play. The upgrade system is cool and the levels are fun to play multiple times, although the game does not have much staying power, meaning that once you beat it there is no reason to ever come back. It is mindless zombie killing and it is pretty awesome. It is short, under 5 hours, but it is priced well at $7. 7/10			"

You will get stuck in places, the GAME WILL LAG LIKE HELL.- There would be times that my coop partner or me would just totally BUG out and all the zombies and screen elements like pickups, mission stuff would just not be playable, but the host coop partner would play fine.- At times, coop partner would die and not be able to reborn- And at lot of times, there would be terrbile lag on screen but not due to Net connection.But yet we epically finished it.

												Good game. Better for co op I would think. The graphics are a little on the plain side. You have your character I played the mechanic. The graphics while very plain looking are ok. I do wish they were a little more detailed and the animations feel very stilted to me. Like the bad guys are missing some frames of animation. The maps that I played on felt very cramped and their was lot of junk on the ground that acts as walls. It kind of feels like a poor mans killing floor. However you can set up turrents that will fight for you. This isnt explained in the game very well at all. I had to do trial and error and I also sold a few turrents by accident as well thinking I was upgrading them. That was a tad annoying. Not much to say really. Its a very simple shoot em up like robotron where you use one joystick to move and the other to shoot. The game is ok. Nothing really stands out for me though. Its not terrible I just would have liked some better graphics. If I had to grade the game a 7/10 would be it. For co-op I would give it a higher score of 8/10.			"

												Spent quite a long time in the game.  It's fun forsure, but there are many bugs and glitches, lag and issues in certain parts of the game.Sometimes there are deadzones in which enemies just do not move or want to atk.  It's almost gamebreaking when you notice these spots.  You can make em bunch up and they don't harm you.Also normal and hard modes are way too easy.  The difficulty here isn't even with the zombies and the dmg you take or the hordes, it's the deceptive hitboxes that wont allow you to hit them at times along with the exploding barrels.  The invisible walls and the being able to walk through some ""objects"" is mislead as well.As for the contrast or brightness, it's difficult to see with the games color scheme.  You can't really adjust it and it's too dark when it shouldn't be and also too bright where it's blinding.  The zombies have terrible animations.  The graphics aren't stellar, which i could dismiss if the game was solid, but it's not.  The artwork in both the drawings and CG/rendered stuff just seems off.The game seems too generic, either the similarities from other games are too noticeable or it's just not standing out.  I've played games with less data consumption that look better because of the execution and charm.  This game seems to lack that.Again fun game, many bugs, like weird weird bugs with quests or enemies and it's annoyingly upsetting because you wanna get into the game, but you just tend to get taken out of the game because of these things.  It's not fun when parts get messed up or you're suffering with realization of old mechanics and glitches that appear in older consoles come up in a game like this.			"

												Det här spelet suger hårt. En riktigt värdelös arenashooter. Startade det, gav det ett första intryck, tänker aldrig röra det igen. Betala inte pengar för det här.


YouTube™ Video: Första Intrycket: Guns 'N' Zombies

			Krigsgeten testar ett litet indiespel från oktober 2014, pris 56kr på Steam. Köpt som en del av en indiebundle. Guns N Zombies är en arenashooter. Som verkar suga stenhårt.. :)

												I really enjoyed my time with Guns n Zombies and consider it a no-brainer purchase for twin-stick shooter fans when the game is on sale. Playing with a controller is definitely the way to go and you can expect to beat the game in a day or two.  There are a couple of classes and many guns and upgrades to play around with.  Sadly, the game offers no way to sell back weapon purchases and the stingy economy means you won't be able to easily experiment.That said, I had a fun time beating the game and considered it a worthy purchase when on sale.

												I have only done the first two stages, it is tough. It is a good game, but I need more dexterity. Maybe I shouldnt've picked the high-armour guy LOL. Nice game though, especially for the discounted price, can't complain. I like the graphics, the settings are fully customizable, I just wish I could run/sprint/jump. Slightly limited controls. 3/5. Pretty sure I wanted to say more earlier but I had not racked up enough minutes in experience.			"

												Guns'N'Zombies, what more could you want from a game?Guns'N'Zombies is a birds eye view based game, where you choose from either of two characters, Engineer or solider, both have perks of their own.When playing the game I found that Money does not come as quickly as you think so upgrades are important decisions based on your preferred style of gameplay, although sometimes it feels as though money does not come quick enough and you have to grind to upgrade something to help you with the next level.There are several types of different guns, Rifle, Shotgun, Long Range Sniper, and Explosive! There are 19 levels filled to the brim with zombies: a few things can get into the way of the fun but it remains a nonetheless enjoyable shooter.And, Well, the name certainly isn't misleading.			"

												There's some broken english in some descriptions, but all is understood along the way. Otherwise a competant zombie type story that takes a slightly different than the usual zombie outbreak cause. The gameplay is very competant in what it does and feels like taking the old arcade buddy top down shooter to the level we all use to think would be the future of such a game.All around, it's not revolutionary, but even for it's non sale price point, it's plenty worth it and a fun afternoon or three for about the price you would put into an arcade machine just for a little fun. Catch it on sale with a friend and you just really can't go wrong. Does it feel like a cell phone game in some ways? Probably, but everything done right and NOT in a bad way.			"

												I enjoy playing this game. Because there was a bundle of the DLC and the game for 99 cents, I bought four copies and gave them to some of my friends. So far, we have had a great time playing, but there are a few bugs. For future advice DO NOT PLAY THIS GAME ON FULLSCREEN. While playing on fullscreen mode, my friends and I have experienced many bugs. For example, on my friends MacBook, everytime he died while playing in fullscreen mode, he couldn't click on anything.Now on to the good parts. Personally, I am very fond of games in which you can upgrade your character or your weapons. This game is a great example of one of these. You buy weapons with in-game currency and you can upgrade them. You can also buy armor and skill upgrades. I love the design of the characters in this game. The zombies look intimidating but fun at the same time. Also, the pokedex-type manual for zombies is a nice addition that allows you to browse through all of the enemies you have met.Overall, I would rate this game 7/10!			"

Well, because it's true. Not the '79 refund', but the game, which is really suffering at many levels. But on the other hand, maybe this is just not a game that I would enjoy to play ... even if I wanted to and even if it wasn't such a terrible no-brainer (but unfortunately it is). Well, I guess you'll have to try it for yourself ... and get a refund. ;-)			"

												GnZ is one of those twin-stick shooters that have you shoot in all directions and move in all directions against horde of zombies (or aliens). And it is a horde. And often you are alone. Later you'll be able to deploy turrets using some nano-techno-thingamajig (not your expertise) with some bigwig scientist's help, but maybe he started it? But you don't really play this game for the plot, do you? It's just one mission after another, attack through an area, blast the objectives, etc. etc. Collect ""money"" and ""nanopower"" from the dead zeds, use them to upgrade your weapons and equipment (and you can switch among your weapons, like assault rifle, shotgun, electro gun, grenade launcher... ) including the turrets. And that's about it. With multiple starting characters (more healing, more turret, more shooting) and different upgrade paths, there's a little bit of RPG feel to it, but most of the time you're just too busy shooting. Graphics are a bit lo-fi for a 2014/2015 game but the things move at a good clip. Sound's unremarkable. Gameplay is exciting but rather repetitive. Developers do come up with some variations including defense, attack, clear area, but there are only so many ways to kill zeds. Overall, GnZ is one of those games that you should only buy when it's on sale.			"

												I bought Guns'Zombies'n'Aliens for $0.99 when it was on sale. For that price, I would definitely recommend it as I felt like I got my money's worth. However, there are a lot of objects your character can get caught up on and unless you grind a lot, you're not going to get all of the weapons, or even most of them. Some of the weapons are completely useless and glitched, and the medic is an awful class with no offensive turrets. Maybe she would be better in co-op. I'll rank the weapons and classes according to how good they are, so you might not waste your time with the crap weapons.It's way better to stick with one weapon type, or less, per level you unlock and prioritize armor and health.Characters (best to worst):1. Mechanic (TURRETS)2. Warrior (3 abilites)3. Medic (Heals, bad at killing things)Weapons:1. Sniper rifles (fully penetrating, good damage)2. Auto rifles (late ones pentrate, high rate of fire)3. Grenade launchers (later ones suck enemies into explosion area for CC, but do pitiful damage)4. Electric rifles (Close range, doesn't seem to damage all the time? Would not suggest)5. Shotguns (Terrible, why would you make shotguns horrible??? Only seem to damage at point of full spread)EDIT: Order of weapons.Also, I would highly suggest playing through on hard difficulty because it's not that much more difficult than normal and you can unlock more weapons, etc.			"

												I had this game installed in my PC and never went back to it for a long time. Now I remember why. The game is glitchy. It has bad camera angles where if you go to the edge of the map, the level begins to stutter. The enemies are a bunch of bullet sponges. More than half the time you can't tell what you are shooting at or if you are dealing any damage. The graphics are passable for something that looks like out of the n64 or ps1 era. The gameplay is very repetitive. I remember this game being 60fps. With the recent update this game got, the frame rate looks like it dipped into the 12 to 15 range. I'm playing this on a computer that is well above handling this sort of game. From what I read from other reviews is that this game is unplyable on anything above Windows 7. Now I'm playing this on a Windows 7 operating system, it's playable to a point. I can't even imagine how bad this game looks like on a Win 8 or 10 PC. Avoid this game. It's a 4/10 for me.			"

												I seriously believe the people that have upvoted this game are all trolls.  UI sucks, gameplay is meh, the english is horrible and you get TWO people to choose from.  This game just about made me want to uninstall my life for even having it in my library. With that being said- this game is poop. That's right... POOP!			"

												This is NOT a finished game. Terrible animations, iffy sound effects, camera is way too close. But hey, I could forgive that if it was fun or at least worked. But it wasn't that much fun nor did it really work. Waves stopped spawning on the 3rd stage and I couldn't complete it. Forget it. Move along and buy another game.			"

												It's nice little top-down, twin stick shooter albeit very buggy. Unfortunately, at the moment, I am unable to recommend this game to any one right now. I got it on the Halloween sale for a dollar and I DO recommend buying it at that price so that you can have it when it's, hopefully, patched and good to go. I have a Mac and I wasn't able to even play it until November 2nd, 3 days after release. It's really annoying when a game is released and I can't even run the game. It is however a nice looking game, but it does lag on fullscreen. Also, I am still even unable to purchase guns or upgrades; when I try, I just press the YES check and nothing happens. I was very excited to play this but it's been a very rocky start. Hopefully soon it will be patched and maybe then I could recommend this game.			"

												It's like a graphically inferior, more futuristic Nation Red with an obnoxiously dubsteppy soundtrack (just not my taste, there are probably people who think it's not awful), and a little bit of tower defense thrown in. It looks like a good student project, I like the weapon upgrades, but still too rough around the edges for them to already be releasing dlc. Although I wouldn't recommend this, it's definitely not terrible as far as zombie survival goes.			"

												Review Score: -3.5/10- as of Nov. 17, 2014. 'Lacks common and main core features such as Co-Op.'Just a heads up before you read the pros and cons; I am rating this game as a ""Finished and published product"" which it does not feel like. Perhaps the game will change over time, but for now I do not recommend this game. I literally purchased half a dozen copies in hopes people in my gaming community could play together, since this game was not in Beta or anything.. Thinking Co-Op would work. It does not; Repeat CO-OP DOES NOT WORK.Pros:+ Good variety of weapons.+ Familiar style game and mechanics.+ Has a lot of potential, and ""Possible"" features.+ Somewhat comical and cartoony outbreak storyline.Cons:- Lacks a tutorial (Not everyone is an expert Zombie Survivor).- Needs to bring something to the table (Nothing unique here, except the comical feel.. Wait other games got that too).- Repetitive gameplay (Gets quite boring if you're gaming alone, new zombies do excite however)- Feels like a grind - A not good one either, after the first runs of each 'Scene' funds become scarce.- Lacking sound effects, or not notable ones (That just draw you in).- No custom settings - Such as changing Keybinds, user interface, and other common options elsewhere.- Co-op isn't working.The game definately has potential- it's hard to recommend it due to the simple fact that there are similar games which are better; and the fact that it's a comical feel/cartoony game it's supposed to be for a laugh, yet it lacks that for the simple fact you cannot enjoy it with friends (Co-Op). I get it, it's an indie game and it's decently priced; yet that's no excuse for putting out a product that feels like it's in alpha, or closed beta. Despite all of this, consider this game down the road, it shows appeal and ideals that can forge this game into something fun and for everyone. Hopefully the developers will continue to refine and polish this game, and soon; I can't wait to see what it turns out to be.			"

												Boring repetitive twin stick shooter that has no point to exist on big screen. Basically the game is about the guy who is locked in small area and shoot things dead and plant some turrets to help him shoot things dead (gimmick alert).There is no story apart from some pics with boring text (humor is unfunny too), missions are bite-sized with grind-based progression. Literally you need to upgrade damage (the only stat) or buy a new gun which is the same gun but has more damage. Basically there is half of dozen different gun classes and each thing in class is essentially the same thing. And to be able to upgrade your damage you need to replay previous missions because you don't earn anything if you fail because you didn't had enough damage. There is some active skills (upgraded the same as weapons) and character leveling for unlocking the guns with more damage. Achievements are grind-based, upgrades, leveling, everything is grind based.You just shoot things and do boring missions, most of which are cheap and boring way to force you to replay the previous levels again. There is no dodge or melee mechanics, you can stop firing to move a bit faster and that's it. There is lives system - mobile-like - you have a pool of lifes for all levels which aren't refilled (as the game isn't f2p on PC, devs just decided to let them spawn as any other pickup on levels).There is no local coop too, which could be actually point of buying for home gaming system users.Yeap, you've guessed it right. It plays and feels cheap like a f2p mobile game which it actually is. Visuals and sounds are competent, there is online coop for boring people who play boring games, but there is nothing which may justify it's existence on big screen. It's just nothing to write home about - just another good f2p mobile game desinged as f2p mobile game that looks and feels like f2p mobile game. But this is PC. It'd feel right at home on Nvidia Shield or Playstation Vita, but on PC only undemanding boring people will play it. People like you, buy it on deep discount.Or if you want to have fun you might consider some of proper twin-stick shooters on PC: Shadowgrounds, Narco Terror, Gatling Gears, Renegade Ops, Lara Croft, Assault Android Cactus, WH40K Kill Team, Nation Red, Crimsonland, Meltdown etc. Buy them instead, they are superior in every possible way.

Zombie shooting at it's finestThis is one of the most rewarding zombie top-down shooters i have ever played but there are some things we need to talk about of course.In this game you need to survive several waves and you'll be killing different kinds of zombies waves after waves.There are alot of upgrades available in the ingame shop and you won't get bored fast.The animations are decent but still can get improved.The biggest issue i'm experiencing is that the audio effects are poor, when you are shooting you hear  a decent gun-noise but it directly stops after you stop firing and that's not realistic, that's something poor in my honest opinion.Let's continue to the ratings:~~~~~ Postive points ~~~~~ Gameplay is supreme, can't get much better to be honest, it's awesome, a true + point. Controls are very well set, especially the right mouse-click action can come in handy while in a moshpit. A good bunch of achievements. Steam trading cards support~~~~~ Negative points ~~~~~ Music is not very well chosen, it's not special and the audio effects are poor Game mechanics are not perfect, like connecting with MP lobbies can be improvedGameplay:The gameplay in this game is really addicting and i'm sure everyone can easily catch up with this and get addicted easy.It's a nice game to have fun really fast, it's easy to start up, hooking up a controller and organize a local-coop party.The game is not really fast paced but it's not slow either.Summary:Great zombie shooting with great gameplay and some innovative controls, it has it's cons but it's not even close to average, this game is above average top down shooters.I can't do anything else than recommending you people to get this game and try it out.Happy surviving and shooting !Disclaimer: I got a free copy from the developers "

								a standard top down bullet hell style game , except if you bump into anything .. you stop and you have to make your guy run again levels are litered with things for you to stop against and more often then not you wont even see the thing you are about to stop against . also dont go engineer at the start i did and the frustration of not being able to look up how to deploy turrets just made me angry key binds dont seem to be changable , music is irratic , running is lurchy .. the game itself is good but it has kinks after 3 levels of it simply dont want to play anymore.

 Meh...I've completed this. First I thought this is an okay game. But...- Camera movement is crappy.- Massive FPS-Drops for no reason.- Collision errors: Falling thru the floor and dying. Getting stuck for no reason.- You can't remap your controls.Save your time and money for something else. "

												I'm actually going to expand on my initial thoughts a small amount after playing some more. The game is really bland and just not really a well put together twin stick shooter to be honest. It's so damn generic you'll find every aspect of it in multiple other games. If you buy this at the $10 asking price, you wasted your money unfortunately. The graphics are mediocre and not particularly memorable, which usually helps a twin stick to stick out. The gameplay is standard twinstick with an ability your character gets to have and then on some levels you can build turrents, which don't seem to do much and only can go in certain spots on the map. I more or less ignored the story because it seemed really boring and generic as well. Some of the enemies do absolutely nothing and some of them knock you on your back and continue to do that, which rapidly drains your health and is quiet annoying to say the least. Just seems like not that much effort was put into this game to be honest. I also apologize for my previous review where I only played 30 miinutes and said it was an acceptable buy. Even with only 115 minutes or whatever I have now, I strongly recommend only picking this game up on sale and not to expect to much from it. 3/10 Generic Game is GenericInitial:This is a fine twin stick shooter. It's not phenomenal and it's not bad. I'd say it's average. I got it on sell for a buck and I think that was an overly good deal for me. I would say this game is worth up to about $3 but not the full asking price.Don't expect a revolutionary experience. 6/10			"

												From just a glance at the screenshots from this game, and I immediatley thought this looks mediocre as hell, man was I wrong. I picked this up for next to nothing on a sale and had no clue what it was, but the title says it all. You have guns and there are alot of zombies, thats about it. The gameplay is fun and frantic as you blast your way through hordes of the undead and each mission offers a diffrent set of objectives to complete. So the gameplay, at least early on, doesn't get stale. While the graphics will not blow you away, they are clean and the enviorments varied. Which is to say most people, not matter your PC setup, should be able to run this game smoothly. Overall I would rate this title 7.5/10			"

												A nice game with a few slight, but not breaking, quirks.If you like shooting zombies, and twin stick shooters, well, get this game for the current sale (today's date Feb, 6, 2016), because it it worth more than the current price, and seeing as its fun is lasting longer than the $0.99 snickers bar I got earlier, getting the game plus add on is woth that price.Now, just a few things that I doubt will be added in future patches, but I'd love to see anyway:Key, or in this case, control pad button rebinding. I'd love to use the triggers/bumpers to do certain actions, because that way I can keep both thumbs on the analog sticks.A camera angle adjuster, so I can make the angle I'm viewing the action more ""top down"" rather than at an angle. One time I almost died because I thought there was a narrow path through what turned out to be a dead end made by the edge of the map and an unseen object, because a sign or billboard blocked the view.Lastly, those vital blue glowing things that are the game currency are at times hard to pick up, what with dozens of undead swarming straight at you, and while they stick around a good bit of time, I still had moments of watching my hard eared blue glowing thingies dissappear because the masses of fleash eating abominations unto god wouldn't let me get them. Just a boost to the pick up range for these blue thingies would be great.Now, having got the negative out of the way, I just want to say this game is FUN! What's not to like about mowing down undead hordes with a variety of weapons, turrets, and drone helpers? Okay, it doesn't look as amazing as Killing Floor 2, but for such a budget game, it looks rather nice. game can be played with mouse/KB or controller, so take your pick, both worked for me. I like how even using a controller for playing the game, I can still use my mouse for menus and such, too. (far more intuitive to use mouse for that, I think)With 3 characters, it provides a bit of replayability, but I'm still early in the campaign.Short version: Wish i could rebind controls/ change camera angle/grab blue thingies better, but it's fun with replay potential, and the fun lasts longer than a snickers bar.

												TL;DR - recommend on cheap sale, not at full priceIt’s basically a twin-stick shooter, but it’s far from the best one I’ve played. Even in the narrowed niche of zombie themed, Dead Nation (on ps3) is far superior for a lot of reasons. The graphics were ok in this, but not great. The animations were pretty poor at times, and even the splash art is incredibly stiff. But it’s passable surely. Biggest gripe is probably controls. It just doesn’t seem responsive/smooth enough for the type of game it is. I was playing M+KB which worked fine, but it just seemed like there was something holding it back from being right. Might have just been how some of the guns worked. The sniper crossbow was kind of a pain to use. The aim laser would come up and shoot at the same time. It should be two separate buttons or just aim at all times, instead. The AK47 worked as expected. Shotgun was fine. The electric taser thing seemed more powerful but it’s very limited range, but at the same time it seemed like the monsters had to be in a precise distance from you or it didn’t work properly. Just weird quirks like that bugged me. Also, the WASD keys didn’t seem real great either. Maybe I should try the game with the steam controller and see how it works. There were sound glitches too. I’d be shooting but playing with a friend and his gun sounds would override my gun sounds, or the music would, or maybe the gun sounds just dropped out. So then I wasn’t sure I was even shooting. That’s annoying. The levels were ok, but the camera and some of the 3D obstacles were poor, in that I couldn’t always see where my guy was, or I couldn’t see that I would get stuck in a dead end, or something similar. The environments looked cool though. The enemies were pretty good (psi-brained doctor zombies), though sometimes pretty silly (motorunicycle riding cowboy gangs?). Actually, the models were a little hit or miss. Some looked really good, some were so simplified it was bad (floating skulls that just looked like orbs). Effects looked pretty good. Bodies/gore was not persistent, which is too bad. I didn’t feel overwhelmed even when there were a lot of monsters. Dead Nation had that down perfect. Actually, Dead Nation is a top tier game in this genre in every way, and GnZ is clearly a low budget indie, so maybe I can’t really compare them. I wish I had Dead Nation on PC. It was fun though. I experienced some lag while my wife was watching Netflix, but it went away after a while. But I was still able to play it, despite being 8-10fps, it wasn’t like rubberbanding or stuck in place or anything. We did have some weird connecting issues when we first started going and then one random drop. But mostly it worked well. The upgrades and abilities and things you can “buy” in between missions is cool. I played engineer, who starts with crossbow and access to turrets. Unfortunately you have to pay for turrets in game (with blue junk) and they can only go on nodes. Lame. I should be able to drop one anywhere. Also, you are completely vulnerable when trying to build them (in like a menu system that is really poorly done) But I had a cool floating orb helper ability that was quite effective. I also like the addition of objectives in each mission beyond survival and getting from point a to b. They are more like arenas instead. Dead Nation is definitely A-B levels. So this game is kind of a hit or miss. For 79 cents, absolutely recommend. I wouldn’t pay over 5 for it certainly.  "

												Did not enjoy this at all. After the first three levels i was bored and felt annoyed with the obstacle they make you run around to avoid the endless waves of zombie. After seeing the amount of equipment to purchase and upgrade I knew this was just going to be a big grindfest. Thats their gimmick repeat the level in a harder difficulty to upgrade or buy better equipment to progress. Nobody playing online as well.			"

												This game is very direct in terms of what to do and how to do it. The zombie mechanics is basic - zombies come after you in a straight line. Reminds me of ""Yet another zombie defense"" game that I got for ~10cents on sale.The graphics are easy to the eyes, clean and simple.If you don't mind spending a few bucks for a few hours of mindless fun I would recommend the game, especially since it has multiplayer option. Personally, the game is lacking challenge. The excitement and fear that comes from being chased by zombies, that I am looking for in such a title, simply isn't there.			"

												Guns ' N ' Zombies has a simple straight to the point title just as the game itself does. Sadly it seems though even something simple has too many errors in this game to be enjoyable.As a top down shooter this game has to try and set itself apart from the thousands others like it but for the most part it tries to remain as generic as possible. Each mission has different objectives such as killing enemies, collecting something and protecting something. The levels do change each time to something different but its nothing you haven't seen before in a similar game.One would hope however that the game play would fix this. I did notice some lag when shooting to start problems off. On top of that the game itself is just boring. After the first two levels the difficulty takes a huge spike upwards. You quickly get over run and your turrets go down quickly while you do little damage it seems. If you are protecting something they quickly swarm it ruining your mission.Your character can level up and gain access to new guns and such that can be leveled up. For the most part however I noticed that a fully leveled up gun doesn't change as much as it should.Overall there isn't many positives here that I can say to recommend this game. It's generic and has enough negatives to not be worth your time.Score :2/10http://apocalypticdemise.com/2015/06/20/gunsnzombies-quick-review/ "

												I'm actually going to expand on my initial thoughts a small amount after playing some more. The game is really bland and just not really a well put together twin stick shooter to be honest. It's so damn generic you'll find every aspect of it in multiple other games. If you buy this at the $10 asking price, you wasted your money unfortunately. The graphics are mediocre and not particularly memorable, which usually helps a twin stick to stick out. The gameplay is standard twinstick with an ability your character gets to have and then on some levels you can build turrents, which don't seem to do much and only can go in certain spots on the map. I more or less ignored the story because it seemed really boring and generic as well. Some of the enemies do absolutely nothing and some of them knock you on your back and continue to do that, which rapidly drains your health and is quiet annoying to say the least. Just seems like not that much effort was put into this game to be honest. I also apologize for my previous review where I only played 30 miinutes and said it was an acceptable buy. Even with only 115 minutes or whatever I have now, I strongly recommend only picking this game up on sale and not to expect to much from it. 3/10 Generic Game is GenericInitial:This is a fine twin stick shooter. It's not phenomenal and it's not bad. I'd say it's average. I got it on sell for a buck and I think that was an overly good deal for me. I would say this game is worth up to about $3 but not the full asking price.Don't expect a revolutionary experience. 6/10			"

												A nice game with a few slight, but not breaking, quirks.If you like shooting zombies, and twin stick shooters, well, get this game for the current sale (today's date Feb, 6, 2016), because it it worth more than the current price, and seeing as its fun is lasting longer than the $0.99 snickers bar I got earlier, getting the game plus add on is woth that price.Now, just a few things that I doubt will be added in future patches, but I'd love to see anyway:Key, or in this case, control pad button rebinding. I'd love to use the triggers/bumpers to do certain actions, because that way I can keep both thumbs on the analog sticks.A camera angle adjuster, so I can make the angle I'm viewing the action more ""top down"" rather than at an angle. One time I almost died because I thought there was a narrow path through what turned out to be a dead end made by the edge of the map and an unseen object, because a sign or billboard blocked the view.Lastly, those vital blue glowing things that are the game currency are at times hard to pick up, what with dozens of undead swarming straight at you, and while they stick around a good bit of time, I still had moments of watching my hard eared blue glowing thingies dissappear because the masses of fleash eating abominations unto god wouldn't let me get them. Just a boost to the pick up range for these blue thingies would be great.Now, having got the negative out of the way, I just want to say this game is FUN! What's not to like about mowing down undead hordes with a variety of weapons, turrets, and drone helpers? Okay, it doesn't look as amazing as Killing Floor 2, but for such a budget game, it looks rather nice. game can be played with mouse/KB or controller, so take your pick, both worked for me. I like how even using a controller for playing the game, I can still use my mouse for menus and such, too. (far more intuitive to use mouse for that, I think)With 3 characters, it provides a bit of replayability, but I'm still early in the campaign.Short version: Wish i could rebind controls/ change camera angle/grab blue thingies better, but it's fun with replay potential, and the fun lasts longer than a snickers bar.

 Meh...I've completed this. First I thought this is an okay game. But...- Camera movement is crappy.- Massive FPS-Drops for no reason.- Collision errors: Falling thru the floor and dying. Getting stuck for no reason.- You can't remap your controls.Save your time and money for something else. "

												this is a good fun game to play. my only concern is the lack of utility in the classes. thier only unique aspect is thier turrets and if u use engenieer you get all the turrets, leaving me to wonder why have seperate classes if you give everything to the engenieer and take away from the other two.my suggestion for haveing multiple classes named engenieer,medic, and warrior would be to make them more unique to thier respective classes. make the weapons and abilities class specific to make the game more stratiegic.outside of that this is overal a good game to play with some friends.

												TL;DR - recommend on cheap sale, not at full priceIt’s basically a twin-stick shooter, but it’s far from the best one I’ve played. Even in the narrowed niche of zombie themed, Dead Nation (on ps3) is far superior for a lot of reasons. The graphics were ok in this, but not great. The animations were pretty poor at times, and even the splash art is incredibly stiff. But it’s passable surely. Biggest gripe is probably controls. It just doesn’t seem responsive/smooth enough for the type of game it is. I was playing M+KB which worked fine, but it just seemed like there was something holding it back from being right. Might have just been how some of the guns worked. The sniper crossbow was kind of a pain to use. The aim laser would come up and shoot at the same time. It should be two separate buttons or just aim at all times, instead. The AK47 worked as expected. Shotgun was fine. The electric taser thing seemed more powerful but it’s very limited range, but at the same time it seemed like the monsters had to be in a precise distance from you or it didn’t work properly. Just weird quirks like that bugged me. Also, the WASD keys didn’t seem real great either. Maybe I should try the game with the steam controller and see how it works. There were sound glitches too. I’d be shooting but playing with a friend and his gun sounds would override my gun sounds, or the music would, or maybe the gun sounds just dropped out. So then I wasn’t sure I was even shooting. That’s annoying. The levels were ok, but the camera and some of the 3D obstacles were poor, in that I couldn’t always see where my guy was, or I couldn’t see that I would get stuck in a dead end, or something similar. The environments looked cool though. The enemies were pretty good (psi-brained doctor zombies), though sometimes pretty silly (motorunicycle riding cowboy gangs?). Actually, the models were a little hit or miss. Some looked really good, some were so simplified it was bad (floating skulls that just looked like orbs). Effects looked pretty good. Bodies/gore was not persistent, which is too bad. I didn’t feel overwhelmed even when there were a lot of monsters. Dead Nation had that down perfect. Actually, Dead Nation is a top tier game in this genre in every way, and GnZ is clearly a low budget indie, so maybe I can’t really compare them. I wish I had Dead Nation on PC. It was fun though. I experienced some lag while my wife was watching Netflix, but it went away after a while. But I was still able to play it, despite being 8-10fps, it wasn’t like rubberbanding or stuck in place or anything. We did have some weird connecting issues when we first started going and then one random drop. But mostly it worked well. The upgrades and abilities and things you can “buy” in between missions is cool. I played engineer, who starts with crossbow and access to turrets. Unfortunately you have to pay for turrets in game (with blue junk) and they can only go on nodes. Lame. I should be able to drop one anywhere. Also, you are completely vulnerable when trying to build them (in like a menu system that is really poorly done) But I had a cool floating orb helper ability that was quite effective. I also like the addition of objectives in each mission beyond survival and getting from point a to b. They are more like arenas instead. Dead Nation is definitely A-B levels. So this game is kind of a hit or miss. For 79 cents, absolutely recommend. I wouldn’t pay over 5 for it certainly.  "

												Did not enjoy this at all. After the first three levels i was bored and felt annoyed with the obstacle they make you run around to avoid the endless waves of zombie. After seeing the amount of equipment to purchase and upgrade I knew this was just going to be a big grindfest. Thats their gimmick repeat the level in a harder difficulty to upgrade or buy better equipment to progress. Nobody playing online as well.			"

												Like stated in other reviews... it's not particularly groundbreaking nor is the gameplay even close to mediocre at all. If anything you can call it mediocre once they get to the point where they can patch in something that registers hits with your bullets onto the zombies. It's overwhelmingly bad at that, but in everything else it does what it's supposed to. I feel as though it's not that optimized either given my computer had some issues with framerate stabilizing. I ran this on high with everything maxed, but I kept dropping from 90fps to 50fps randomly and it surprises even me on my build. However, the game is on sale as I write this and for 79 cents... I think it's at least worth a try if you like top down zombie survival shooters.  For the price... it's grand. As a game... holy cow it sucks.			"

												I don't expect a perfect game from anybody. There will always be little things that will bug someone somewhere but I DO expect the basics to be done right. Some things I found that were a little frustrating and shouldn't have been overlooked by basic testing.Pros:-Smooth gameplay-Lot's of upgrades-Decent graphicsCons:-Can't delete created characters (at least it's not easy to find)-Can create the same character withe the same name which makes it impossible to distinguish which character is which.-When using a usb controller the game was very unresponsive in the shopping menu. When I'd purchase things I'd have to press the esc key or else I wouldn't be able to do anytning else. It's like the game freezes when using a controller sometimes.-Complicated to navigate upgrade menuThese 4 things are incredibly embarrasing for a game that is ""sellable"". Who tested this game? They should be fired.			"
