												THIS GAME IS AN EARLY ACCESS SCAMDevelopers realized their game wasn't working out and had too many issues to fix.  But instead of telling their customers this, they rushed to a ""Full Release"" version that was hilariously unfinished in September 2015 so they could get the game featured on the Steam Store Front Page right before the holidays.They strung it along further by releasing constant ""Minor updates"" up through December 2015.  These updates weren't actually intended to fix their horribly broken game, but intended to keep it showing on the Steam Store Front Page as ""Recently Updated"" throughout the 2015 holiday season.In January 2016, by all appearances, this developer had stopped all development.  The community manager had left, they were inactive on Social Media and Steam, and nothing was done to fix the games issues.In April 2016, they posted a vague ""Please be patient"" message on Steam via a private steam account (Which, to this day, doesn't respond to inquiries about the game).  By ""Coincidence"", one month later, in May 2016, the game is featured in a Humble Indie Bundle.  The April Post was done simply to make potential Humble Bundle buyers believe that the game is being actively developed and supported were they to check it's news page.  The devs apparently had no intention of continuing work on the game, they just wanted to string folks along and milk every last dime they could from sales, even from within the Humble Bundle.Their website and forums were taken down after the domain names are currently up for sale.  None of their social media accounts (Facebook, Twitter, ect) have posted anything or responded to anything.  E-Mails are unanswered.  No new activity on Steam.This is a classic ""Take the money and run"" Early-Access scam, on par with what the developers of Towns did.  This needs to stop.  DO NOT buy this game.  If you do, you support these practices.  I bought into the game in it's Early Alpha stages and regret doing so.  Spread the word about developers like this and be more discerning in the future about your Early Access Purchases.  That's the only way this kinda crap is going to stop.			"

												Don't waste your money on this. Another early access game, full of promise , that ended up in the trash bin.Nobody entirely understands what happened exactly.I bought the game in it's Early Access. Was fun, despite the piles of bugs and issues all around everywhere.Updates were consistent, and everything looked great! I always checked the news to see what wonderfull things they brought into the game, and it was fun trying out those features! Bugs were smashed, problems solved, and additional content added on the way. Everything looked pretty great!Until it happened...Still missing tons of content, they suddenly for no reason released the game!One moment, there are regular updates with content and stuff and then poof, game released.The soundtrack was amazing, perfectly fitting the environment, and better equipment was being added so that players could get to deeper biomes.Then they decided to release it half-baked. There aren't even armor sets that would let you reach the deepest biomes!Many biomes can't be reached at all! And tons of other stuff was missing still!Combat was still very annoying, with enemies being extremely agile, having a very tiny hit-box, which sometimes wasn't even on the enemy! There was a crab enemy infamous of it's mis-placed hit box, because of which you could only hit it if you fire above it.They kept releasing very tiny bug fix updates and smaller content updates, that only seemed to make them look like they were alive, when they didn't really add anything important.Now, they have been silent for a long time.The last post was a sort of ""We are not dead but lots-a stuff going on now"" post. They said in max a few months they would explain things. That post was put up in April.Although nobody knows exactly what happened behind the curtains, but the most common idea is that the developers over time lost their determination to keep on going, and released the game early, turning it into a cash-grab.The fact that even now, not having responded to anything for months, the game still gets put on sale, and once it was even sighted on humble bundle, only supports this cash grab idea even more. And then again, like i mentioned previously , before they went silent, they were releasing fake updates, that added nothing but thin-air to the game, only so that they make others think that the game is alive, when it is not.TL;DR: Another early access game that had the potential and fun, but it mysteriously died out. Now it is only a carcass of a game that once was full of promise.Once again, for a final time: Don't waste your money on this! I beg you... "

												Permabanned on forums for pointing out, the devs pushed out beta updates, which added content, but locked that content behind drops that were unattainable, so noone could test said new content, this was about a year ago.Since then they pushed to release and have since bailed, even the Community manager moved to pastures new, while the dev team hire themselves out as 3rd party coders (sorry that should probably read as 3rd rate coders).Full release still has a lot of unfinished content, and serious game breaking bugs, esp where multiplayer is concerned, so far the devs have blamed "" logistical things"" for their abscence, with a more detailed explanation forthcoming...but coming up for two months later and those things are still restricting them, but doesnt stop them playing a lot of Overwatch...go figure.

												This game has promise - is what I would have said over 2 years ago now. When I first got it, I loved it! The aesthetics were appealing and it was like a fresh new take on terraria, one of my top played games at that time. After about 20 hours I was just screwing around in the ""end game"" with my buddy who I bought the game for as well (got a 2-pack because I liked the idea so much) And.. that was it. I was going to try playing again and went over the patch history, and it was basically barren. In fact it hasn't even  been touched once this year.Fortunately about 6 months after I bought this game I purchased Starbound, haven't looked back. If you're reading this and you're interested in a fun sci-fi side scroller just go for Starbound! It has the same sandbox elements with an actual story integrated, and about 100x as many features as this game. Thank you for your time, and RIP Edge of Space.			"

Early Access Review
								***DIsclaimer***I purchased this game upon release into early access.  At that time, many of the advertisements were compairing this game to Terraria, hence the nature of my reviewI had a lot of hope for this game. Let me preface this by saying I love Terraria.  I played a ton of it with friends and by myself back when it was first launched, and again with all the updates with my girlfriend.  I went from thinking it was a 2D Minecraft rip off to a great game that reminds me a bit of your old school games (Ghost and Goblins comes to mind with the new Expert mode)   Terraria had its charm in the exploration.  You died, a lot.  You learned from said deaths.  You learned different materials make different items.  You fail a lot, in funny and unexpected ways (i.e. Farming Wall of Flesh, then realizing that I had been equipping my armor in the social slot).  The exploration was in both the world itself, and the mechanics.  They gave you nothing, said ""Here is the world, have fun"" and that was it.   Edge of Space forgets that.  I start a new character, and I am inundated with tutorials as if I was a toddler.  The game literally stops everything to tell you to right click to pick up an item from a chest, including a video.  I am all for tutorials done right, but this one is just patronizing.  The UI is just trash.  I have a character menu, inventory, tech, ect.  They are all small enough to fit on the screen all at once, yet they are their own movable UIs with wasted space.  Not to mention if I want to craft something to equip, I may have to go through three different menus for it.  This developer took a huge step backwards in design.  The character control is also a problem.  It just feels slow and unresponsive.  I felt like I was on a server lagging in single player (and with the rig I have, this game should not give me any delays whatsoever).  The feel of everything was just off too.  Mining is aiming a laser at a rock and waiting.  Terraria did it right, because you would hear the clanking as you mined, making it feel like you were doing something.  Lastly is the performance.  It felt like it was running at 30, because I was getting that same blurriness I would get at lower frame rates.  The game however has a FPS counter that was staying at a solid 60.  I pulled up the Steam FPS counter, and low and behold, while it did stay around 60, it would very occasionally dip, but the in game FPS counter stayed at 60.  I have a feeling that this counter is not accurate, and the developer has static text up there, but I will not say 100%.  I will end with this, Have I been harsh on this game, comparing it to Terraria?  Yes, very much so.  They have marketed it as the spiritual successor to Terraria, and thus started the comparison.  Sadly, it fell very short of the mark they were aiming for.I wish to put this into the actual review itself, since this actually has me hopeful about the future of this game.  From the head developer in the comments from this review ""Thank you for your review, i think there rae some valid points we are trying to address. At the same time the game is meant to feel different.""  The developer actully listens top criticism in a positive way, which could make this game potentially great in the future.			"

												I played Edge of Space since the early days of its EA release, and while I enjoyed it a lot, I have to admit it doesn’t quite measure up to two more prominent games of its genre: Terraria and Starbound.The majority of exploration and progress is top-bottom, as is fairly common for sandbox exploration/building games, but where other games take place at a single land mass, EoS’ world is composed of numerous floating islands, some tiny, some very large. If you don’t feel like digging down, walking to an island’s edge and jumping to the one bellow is always an option. (And having a jetpack from the start helps you not to fall to death this way. Usually.) When it comes to combat, Edge of Space gives highest “Player vs Environment” feeling than other games of its genre. Instead of challenging powerful bosses like in Terraria, EoS’ focus in on fighting ever present and deadly “common” enemies, who present constant and serious threat.However, ever-present enemy threat has side effect of limiting player’s ability to build in lower areas of the world. Aside from danger to player, many mid-late game enemies has structure-damaging attacks, and will easily wreck both your base and landscape you were trying to preserve.Also on the negative side, Edge of Space is rather lacking in variety: there are only 3 main biomes in the game, and they don’t feel as unique as Terraria or Starbound’s biomes. Visually the game isn’t very pleasing to an eye either, and everything is mostly brown or metallic-gray (possibly done on purpose for “realism” – we all know that Real Is Brown).Overall, Edge of Space is quite good, and I can fully recommend it to fans of sandbox exploration/building, who already had their fill with Terraria and Starbound. And those who are more interesting in action than building will probably find that aspect of EoS even more appealing than that of other games of its genre.			"

												Looks like I got this game on July 9, 2013. Today the game came out of Early Access as v.1.0, and unfortunately, the game is still rather hard to digest.When I first played, the game had a few graphical issues, and it looked like it could have needed something like an editor to an author. Fine, I could always go back to it - though at this point I was beginning to regret buying this. At this point (and a couple subsequent playthroughs), I felt the game was not intuitive, unfriendly to beginners, and rather difficult for a game where you literally build your character to advance. Gathering materials? The laser pick was extremely weak and could not be as easily manipulated as Starbound's (as much as I don't like comparing, especially to Starbound). I took a long time gathering enough supplies (after dying a few times, some from mobs in the starting area and some from falling off the edge of the map) to make anything. Also, while the game no longer has the difficulty (sort of...) and the 10 free respawn limit, those things severely discouraged me from doing anything. So I waited.Today, I opened the game with no expectations of things and found myself facing similar issues from the first time I played. The UI needs a lot of work - this doesn't look at all like a modern game with a futuristic setting - the dialog boxes look like just hastily placed rectangles and fonts (I spotted some serif fonts...) look like they were not even picked with intent. Some of the tips need editing in syntax and grammar, and overall, the game feels very much like a beta still. I wasn't pleased by the ""tutorial"" either, since the first thing I saw was a codex full of unnecessary text.Nothing in the game has struck me as intuitive so far, even regarding the gathering of materials. I got the DLC items and the pick is marginally stronger than the starting one, and while it's got a wider beam (3 tiles wide), the width becomes useless because the pick target cannot be directly chosen - so if you just dig downward, for example, in the same direction, you just end up with a 1 tile wide chasm, walls either damaged or already ""healed"" to normal. Everything seems so grindy already - I know that games won't have you start off with good gear ready to kill bosses, but in the first quest of the tutorial, each one of those enemies (although they do no damage) took many hits to die. I don't see any fun in spending minutes killing common mobs (because face it, you're gonna attract aggro for all those missed attacks and some of those enemies move too fast with the starting rifle) and then spending minutes gathering.I'm going to pass. Sorry, I tried, but more than 2 years did not give sufficient progress for me to enjoy this - too grindy and too unpolished.			"

												I've played the game long enough now that I can give a basic review for the game. In terms of the knowledge progression I'm about 6% complete or so it says. I can say confidently enough that the game is interesting and has some decent mechanics that set it apart from similar games like Terraria and Starbound.However, this game is very much a buggy mess right now and I would not say this is worthy to be called V1.0, it is very much still an early access game in my mind and if you are hoping to play this game without upset, I feel I need to tell you that you will be let down.-MiningMining feels clunky at the best of times, it doesn't work like terraria or starbound where if you click on a tile then that tile gets removed, it's a directional thing and the mining tool isn't center with the playable characters model, it is off to the side a little and it makes mining a real chore.-MonstersThe monster spawns are attrocious, they spawn anywhere even in the air, which makes falling down elevators you dig suicidal, it encourages the use of teleportation but really I find this a constricting mechanic and very poorly thought out by the developers. A fix that would make everyone happy in my opinion would be to limit mob spawns to front tiles or certain background tiles (such as dirt, clay etc)-Monsters continuedMobs can spawn in the air, regardless of the foreground or background tiles, I have confirmed this, and this doesn't only effect elevators and general exploration, mobs can spawn inside hangers you built for your vehicles, and those ships will die as the mob mindlessly floats back and forth rebounding off walls etc. This is completely ridiculous and wastes your resources needlessly.-UIThe UI is a complete mess, it is extremely user unfriendly and lacks specific interactions like shift clicking to place items into recipe facility entities like the carbon refinery for example. You have to mouse them in one by one and when recipes require 5 items that are cluttered around your inventory, it is not fun to micromanage and makes organising inventory space and much more, a very annoying task.-UI overlaysTo add onto some of the UI problems the game has, the UI overlaps the screen in some instances, such as when ""dominating"" an area (or setting am item recipe as a task), the overlay that displays you have conquered the area acts as a none transparant pop up, basically it stops you from shooting or building while mousing over the overlay and this can lead to some pretty cheap deaths as I have experienced.-GameplayThe gameplay for the most part is fine, you progress at a steady pace and you are rewarded for killing monsters and mining generated tiles. However the dungeons you come across such as the zombie rooms seem to feel extremely off. You have to destroy 4 spawners and once that is complete, you have to plant 3 bombs, leave the chunk and then the entire land is just blown up. Any decoration blocks you might have wanted from the room are deleted, and you're left with an unappealing piece of land that does nothing. The game says you've ""dominated"" the land but you're just left with an ugly crater. Furthermore, you aren't rewarded in the slightest by blowing the chunk up, no EXP, no loot, nothing.-SNAILSHOLY ♥♥♥♥ING♥♥♥♥♥♥ SNAILS AND FROGS HAVE TO BE THE SINGLE MOST ANNOYING MECHANIC I HAVE EVER WITNESSED IN A VIDEO GAME. PLEASE NERF THEIR SPAWN RATE, IN FACT THAT BRINGS ME ONTO MY NEXT POINT-Spawn rateMonster spawn rate either seems to be so few or so disgustingly unbearable, the amount is completely random, you coulld be spelunking in a cave and come across one or two mud crabs, but then teleport back to base and an entire army of frogs, snails and crabs will rain from the sky.-Frame rateThis is a really unfortunate aspect of the game, I have a really high end computer and I get frame lock ups quite often, it's not a long lock up but it is very common and happens in loaded chunks even if I am standing still. I don't have a clue what causes it and as far as I can tell from other reviews this seems to be a common problem.-Rare crashesThe game as crashed a few times on me now. both times have happened when starting up a pregenerated world and entering a container too quickly. I am sure this will be fixed but it added to the frustration this game is to play right now.-Instance glitchesIn an instance you are similar in proprties to that of adventure mode in minecraft. You cannot place or remove blocks basically. If you happen to click too fast on a door (which is basically a teleporter to another part of the dungeon) yoiu can very easily be teleported out of bounds and you have to exit your game to fix the problem. The items needed to enter an instance dungeon aren't cheap so I find this to be a very harmful bug that impedes progression.-ExplorationNow this may be due to the overall difficulty of the game, and I may be playing the game without fully understanding the metagame and what not, but I find exploration into the second biome (I think it's refered to as the comet biome, it's the ice themed one) to be extremely unforgiving. I have the weapons to deal with the monsters there in small numbers, but as I have said, as you fall down to lower levels, mobs spawn in the sky and can basically 1 hit ko you as you fall, but that's not the only problem, as you land on the surface of the main tier 2 biome, mobs that are faster than you are generated all around you, on the ground and in the sky and that makes exploration and progression an absolute chore. I have tried to find a way to set my spawn down there instead of on the first biome and I'm not sure how. The wiki for Edge of Space is extremely outdated and many pages are missing.-Exploration continuedI have solved the issue of teleporting to lower levels, you have to build 2 command centres to teleport between areas. However now that I don't have to deal with the annoying elevator scenario, I have discovered that towards the lower half of the second biome, bears and penguins spawn in great abundance, regular bears can 2 shot you, and have more than doube the players moving speed so in tight spaces it is very hard to escape, they spawn almost everywhere in the cave systems down there and I simply cannot progress further below. I enjoy a hard game but I think something seems off with the spawn rate, they appear so frequently that I feel stunted to go any deeper. You might be thinking that I should gear up a little more before progressing, which is true, but all the radium I can find in the ice and all the illuminated crystals (that can drop radium) have been mined up in the top half of the biome. I made the mistake of building one of those NPC anchors with the radium (he was a useless NPC as well, did 100% nothing and that brings me onto my next point shortly) and now I lack the amount to create the desert armor set.-NPC AnchorsI really like this idea, it's another resource sink and the potential for some really cool bonuses is there, but the developers really missed the mark on most of them. I believe Rob the robot is the most useful, fully upgraded he will drop Titanium ore for you occasionally, I have about a stack and a half of the stuff just sitting around and as Titanium is a pain to harvest, I like this NPC and my investment was worth it. However, NPCs such as Vinny (The potato plant) do nothing, regardless of the investment, his one ability is that every time you feed him 5 biomass and 5 ice, he will glow in the dark. That's ridiculous, I have lights everywhere, the investment and the space for his anchor completely outway his use. This is very similar for the other NPC's too, they could provide cool bonuses like 5% to sneak, or ore in a radius will glow, something that would actually be fun to invest these resources into. But nope, glow in the dark plants are apparently useful.-Hit word limit, much more is broken-			"

Early Access Review
								***I will retain the original review here, but I will add and mark new points. If  you want my most up-to-date review, scroll down.***I'm going to be completely honest; there's a lot of potential here and I hope it reaches it, but so far I'm just not seeing it. I'm trying not to be too harsh, I respect the dev team and their game, but here are my impressions...    The first thing that comes to mind with this game is; There's alpha games, and then there's ALPHA games. While I play a lot of games in alpha and beta stages, I usually enjoy the experience because they often bring something new and innovative to the table to make them interesting. Sadly, I'm just not seeing it with the alpha of this game. There's little that I would consider standout, innovate, or unique. The mining lazer is cool, but not groundbreaking, and mindnumbingly slow without any upgrades in sight. At the very least, it should have the option to heat the targeted rock and at least one sqaure of the rocks around it at a slower rate. This would speed up the process while still allowing precision. Jetpacks are cool, but the limited energy and energy regen followed by blind jumps makes them more frustrating than anything. If nothing else, the early jetpacks could use a massive buff until more is added and that situation is sorted out strictly for exploration purposes. Beyond those two features, the game doesn't have much to offer.    My next gripe is the actual game's goal and layout. The game gives you the goal of terraforming, and that's about it. I really didn't like that goal. I don't feel like it's a goal at all. Terraforming is just something you DO in this kind of game from start to finish. I don't feel like something I'm going to be doing anyways -and can do at any point- should be my final goal. It gives little to work towards other than ""look I mined out this rock lol."" If my goal is to terraform, than I want to be given a final idea of what I'm terraforming towards, rather than just changing the landscape slowly. Which brings me to my other argument; the real ""goal"" players give themselves is simply going downwards. I feel like the only way to progress is to mine resources and then continue falling downwards in hopes of new discoveries. There's also multiple levels as you fall downwards, resulting in higher risk areas. This is great and all but then why terraform anything on the top levels if the better resources and more interesting stuff is downwards? Why even set your roots and your house at the top just to work your way back down and farther again? I'm not trying to be harsh, I just think some good thought has to be put into these concepts before the game moves forward and falls flat on its face.    I'm hoping that my investment, and the investments of everyone else gets put to good use here. I think somewhere in this alpha is a great game, but right now it's barely in a playable stage. It's just very unsinspiring when compared to the games everyone, myself included, will immediately pin it to- being Terraria and Starbound. Both of those games have unique and recognizeable art, music, gameplay, and attitude. Even the art in Edge of Space feels cluttered and weird and just like it needs to have its own personality to it. I will say that I love the music at the opening menu though.     Closing thoughts; I don't regret supporting this game and I hope it continues getting support so that it can become a full-fledged competitor with other similar games, and hold a meaningful spot in a steam library. That said, until the game brings proof that it's serious and has something to prove to the gaming world, I wouldn't recommend putting coin into it to have it gather dust in your steam library.*** As of Jan. 30th, a few months after original review    Well I'm not entirely sure I can list everything they did, but the devs are pulling through on this one. With some UI overhauls, and massive variable tweaks, even the initial few minutes feel much more active and fluid than before. The progress curve is much more obvious right now and you have to work towards your progress points individually. Exploration is a bit easier now as jetpacks have recieved decent buffs, nulling my earlier complaint about them. Also mining has been considerably buffed, with an early ""overcharged"" mining lazer now available that damages at least 2 layers of blocks at a time. So my mining complaint is decently nulled. There's a bunch of other tweaks/buffs that improve fluidity of gameplay including changes to weapons, monster health, so on so on.    My initial impression before was that the game was an unplayable wreck and I was a bit disappointed in it. Right now my impression is that I can really start to get into this game. Although I feel it's a bit lacking in overall content right now, yaddayadda it's an alpha, we've been here before. It could just use a bit more... Variation? Maybe just several different sprites for the wildlife or something. The sights get a bit repetitive at the start. I haven't moved too far in yet as there is quite a lot of grinding involved now.     All-in-all I'm refraining from saying I recommend this game just yet. While it has shown significant improvement and I feel like the devs have listened to complaints and worked to better the game, I'm still not ready to recommend this game. I'm going to see if the devs are still dedicated to improving the game and adding content, and if they seem committed and the game starts to come together I will change it to recommended in a heartbeat.

Early Access Review
								My first review on Steam, I wish it could be more positive, but I am tired of spending money to discover low quality lurking behind these overly positive reviews.  What can I say, this game has been done many times before, and in much better ways.  The time in development (in my opinion) should have seen ""Edge of Space"" in a much more polished state than it currently is, considering the 2D style of the game.  *For the record, I understand the nature of ""Early Access"", but I do not believe that games should forever exist in a state of early access simply to justify financial or developmental limitations.  Having said that; open world, 2D scrolling, space exploration, voxel-based laser mining, crafting matrix, etc....   we've seen this song and dance play out again and again with the expectation that, maybe this time, something new and refreshing will find us.  Well, for me at least, it did not with Edge of Space.  I could have overlooked the poorly rendered and seemingly unrelated intro clip, a clunky tutorial that introduced an even clunkier UI, and even the low-res character, enemy, and background models.  What I couldn't overlook, however, were the poor aiming/targeting/tracking mechanics of the various starter (and presumably all) weapons and tools.  Proper hit detection, field of effect, and cursor-reticle alignment are so critical to a game like this, that to experience immediate frustration and difficulty utilizing said tools told me most of what I needed to know about Edge of Space.  I know, I didn't even play for a full hour, but let me be clear: This is a Starbound, and thus, a Terraria clone.  Unfortunately, it doesn't even rise to the level of quality those games possess, not to mention the lack of charm.  I appreciate the seemingly responsive nature of the developers, and the consistent development blog updates, but this one seems to have hit a creative wall both visually, and technically.  Sorry for the detraction, but I will be placing this game on the back burner for now.<3 "

												I've tried to enjoy this game through its many iterations and complete changes. In it's current (release) state, the game is tolerable, but lacking in many respects still, the largest being actually fun. I only play games of this sort multiplayer, so the experience may be different for playing solo.The mining tool is my biggest gripe. It fires in a line, that is based on an unusual place on your character, making getting at specific tiles difficult, and hard to aim at anything but straight up/down/left/right. The mining tool is INCREDIBLY slow compared to other games such as Terraria or Starbound. In the latest incarnation, they added new mining tools that slowly (at about half-speed) dig out the tiles around the tile it's hitting, but generally this doesn't help much because it's slower and you can't generally dig in a way to take much advantage of it.Then there is dealing with the plants of the world, which require a saw of some sort to gather. This is even slower than the mining tool, you just sit and wait and wait for it. And finally get your 2 protovine or whatnot. Good luck finding any seeds!And then creating much of anything requires so many resources, but you have a tiny inventory and finding storage is time consuming. And though it is an interesting idea to have tiers of what sort of item something is (eg, ""Inorganic - Mineral - Radioactive - Uranium""), when you need to build something that just needs a mineral, it should just say ""Uranium"" or similar names... but it has the entire long list for Uranium, making it hard to tell exactly what it is you need without really long names for things.And the world itself is just a bunch of skylands, with occasional larger ones tossed in there for actual ""ground"", except that when you get lower, you have another giant gap of space before getting to the next ""tier"" of skyland below you. You generally find out about that after having walked off a cliff of your ""ground"" near the beginning of the game, because it is very abrupt: ""Just walking along, oh there's a little hill, let's hop down... no, there's no bottom. NO! Oh, I'm dead again...""The game USED to have an entire tutorial, teaching you how to use the interface, move around, use the laser pick, etc. but the release version removed all of that in favor of a talking shark that just tells you to get it things... without any details on how to do much of anything. I'm glad I already knew how to switch between foreground and background tile mining/placement from the previous tutorial, because I probably would have gone nuts trying to figure it out.There are now side missions that take you to your own personal instance that are not multiplayer at that point... there are random NPCs to get that don't do much (a couple give you ok-ish rewards for doing tasks)... there are various weapons, but most require ammo that is frustrating to get.All of this and, while playing, you still have no idea what you're actually doing. The premise seems to be something about terraforming, but to what end?			"

Early Access Review
								this game is getting a LOT of negative reviews and I see some same complaints-- No tutorial (There wasnt, there is now) - cant skip the tutorial (You obviously DIDNT read anything at all, did you?) - There's no content updates blah blah or theres not enough of X in the game yet... well I have been involved in a TON of early access projects (DayZ pops into my mind when people say ""No content"") and I would personally want them to re-hash and re-do gameplay mechanics before adding content, and this one has gone from having nothing but tiles, to having a power grid, to having a control system (Machines need command nodes to run) and more, and more content and bosses... went from having nothing but a few penguins with rocket launchers to terraria crossover bosses and random events... it is still early and the team may not be as large as you would like, but development is constant, and consistent-- meaning they arent working on other projects with early access money from this, at least not to the point its affecting development. Most complaints are people ""I cant find ores"" those people are used to easier games (Like terraria, which is fun, but face it, not hard at all) this game forces you to completely upgrade before moving much further through an exposure system (Go too low, die from the planets core radiation. makes perfect sense, but most people cry) and extremely tough enemies that dont take much damage from the starter guns. All in all I am excited to see where they go with the rest of this project. As 2 out of 5 biomes are done as of this review, and countless systems still planned, and some tweaks to existing ones. Amazing progression system if you arent a crybaby.TL:DR: Most reviews on this game are because people are stupid and don't read, this game is solid, and has constant updates and shows not just promise, but progress.... suppourt it if you liked terraria but it was too easy			"

												I bought this game almost the same day it was released as early access, at first i really enjoyed it and it showed a lot of promise. But it quickly became appearent that the developers really didnt have a well thought out plan for their game. I've seen the leveling and crafting system completely overhauled several times over and in the end they settled for a complete illogical mess.They then added dungeons and bosses, which are also a complete mess and some of the most boring things i've ever encountered.They added some more biomes with quirky and severly annoying and overpowered creatures. They are incredibly annoying and can spawn in large numbler right on top of you. They move erraticly and in all manner of illogical ways and this combined with the horrible combat system makes it all just painful. They didnt add enough biomes in the game either so the last one is just a barren lifeless landscape with nothing to explore.Considering the vast number of other good sandbox sidescrollers out there i really dont see any reason for you to purchase this one, especially not now since the dev's have completely abandoned it before completetion.

								I personally feel it is tougher than Starbound, with less immediate tangible rewards and is really meant for co-operative play. While you can solo most of the game, it is pretty tough without friends. The music is very decent as well.Fairly stable, server we had running did not crash. Took me a while to figure out how to get some of the other game mechanics running but once that is over, the crafting stuff works well. Only gripe is the crafting workflow could maybe improved abit. (too many buttons to press).Overall highly recommended if you like Terraria & Starbound. Can't wait for the game to be completed.			"

								Edge Of Space may just seem like another one of those Not-so-smash-hit Terraria replicas. However, if you actually explore the game you'll find that it's much more than that.First off, There's the hefty tutorial, and the (rather) steep learning curve. You'll probably be finding yourself tripping over yourself in the three different menus, each at a not-that-convenient spot on your keyboard.(V for Crafting? Really?)  All the while your having your energy zapped by one of those nice little energy suckers. But once you get used to the very confusing interface it shouldn't be much trouble.Now that we are out of the inital Edge Of Space experience, we'll start talking about some of it's better qualitys. First and most noticable thing is the Weapons. In this game, you can take the phrase ""No weapon is the same"" literally. Different types, Different Ammunition, Different Specs, just about different everything. Ever played Borderlands 1 or 2? Take their weapon system and apply it hear.Next:Updates. Your never not sure when another updates going to be out, because they have a in-game update timer, and the updates are shot out faster than most Early Access games can blink.THE RESULT:While many players will get bored and lose interest in the first chunk of gameplay, those who stick around sure will be going for a fun ride- and loss of outside-world productivity. If you're a patient gamer, I recommend you pick up this title right now.You won't be dissapointed.			"

Early Access Review
								This is probably the most enjoyable Early Access Beta I've participated in.The Dev support for this game has been stellar, with all my submitted bug reports and support tickets being responded to within a day at most, and the bugs themselves fixed within a few days. As of the Thanksgiving Patch, I have had no crashes or freezes, but there is also an in-game save option for those of us who get paranoid about beta crashes.There's a lot of systems testing and bug-hunting going on at the present stage of development, but there is enough content to really have a blast.The mobs at present are not pushovers, and can really tear you apart if you aren't careful. Personally, I like that the mob danger factor is so high, as it adds a real tension to the exploration aspect of the game. There is a mechanism in place for craftable respawns, which takes out some of the sting from dying. I've gone on some intense-to-the-point-of-adrenaline-rush missions descending down through the biomes to find and unlock tech upgrades, while mobs and missiles chased my tail. I love the descent into danger mechanism of this game, where there is always an element of risk involved, and skill with manoeuvring and shooting is rewarded.The gameplay is a combination of resource gathering, mob killing, building, crafting, and exploration. There are quest/mission equivalents, in the form of finding Tech Waypoints, where the reward for success is unlocking boosted statistics and/or new craftables, such as better weapons and armour. There are also wormhole events - at present these are time-constrained events where you have a specific timeframe to explore and loot what you can before your time runs out and the wormhole collapses. (Word from the Devs is that there will be a number of different kinds of wormhole events, including boss battles, which I am looking forward to)At present time, there are only two complete Biomes in the Beta, and a limited number of tech upgrades and crafting options. That being said, I haven't exhausted that limited content in the 30 hours I've played thus far, which isn't bad at all for a beta. Furthermore, from the official forums and chats with the devs, it looks like what is presently in game is but a small fraction of the content planned for launch and post-launch.I've found myself losing hours to this game, and do not regret spending money on it at all. As of 30/11, Multiplayer is still disabled, but word from the Devs indicates that this is only temporary while they finetune the coding. So at present, and likely for a few more weeks to come given the time of year, the game does only have single player mode. That hasn't stopped me from having a damn good time with the game though. I definitely recommend it if Terraria or Metroidvania-styled gameplay tickles your fancy.			"

												So here we are....finally at 1.0 and we still feel like we are in a beta. The game is laggy, choppy, the sprites clip and glitch around, the physics are wonkey for gravity (shoot enemy they fly straight upwards?), it's such a mess at the start. Their idea of a tutorial involves talking to a flying shark and gathering stuff.....it's very dull. I'm sad that waiting for nearly a year on this resulted in this mediocrity. Stick with terraria, this feels like a generic knock off terraria in space.			"

Early Access Review
								You've just crashed on a planet. All you've got is some utilities from your ship you were able to grab. You can mine, you can build, and you can craft. What will you do to survive? (tl;dr at bottom)If you're a fan of Terraria, but want something a little more bizarre, and more focused on space, this is definitely your game. Don't see it as Terraria or Minecraft knock-off, though. This game is one of the most unique games of this type that I've seen. Most notably, the crafting system. The way this game's crafting system works is just fantastic. Rather than picking around for specific blocks, you are able to craft things by finding blocks to fit the requirements for density, permiability, and other criteria for creating an object. There is more to this, but I'd rather let you find that out for yourself, as there are many machines in this game that would take a while to fully explain. As you can see the graphics in the screenshots, and audio in the trailers, I'm not really going to dive that deep into them. The only thing I'd like to note is character creation. There is at least a moderate amount of customization for your character off the bat, and even more when you consider vanity and armor further in the game, so if that's the type of thing you're into, consider it another plus. This game isn't completely great though, and I won't be able to stress enough that this game is EARLY ACCESS, and that's what you're paying for. A lot of it isn't done. There are bugs and glitches (though not really anything that will ruin the experience). tl;drPros:+ Crafting system+ Plenty of other machines to play around with+ Block variety (there are vending machines, TVs, etc that you can craft)+ Customization+ Boss fights+ Misc. world events (worm holes and such will crop up here and there)+ Concept (the idea is cool)+ Playtime (lots of playtime in this, even at this stage)Cons:- Graphics (while the graphics aren't bad, you could get sick from watching the world backdrop)- Not finished (bugs - bugs everywhere)- Emphasis on not finished (not that much content)I'll expand this review if anyone actually reads it, or has any questions.

Early Access Review
								I came to Edge of Space expecting a lot, having heard so much about it in relation to Terraria and Starbound.  I suppose that was a mistake on my part, and I'll admit as much.As such, I tried my best to look beyond the horrifically clunky and unhelpful user interface, the occasionally slightly janky graphics and the various spelling mistakes, grammatical errors and so forth...  And, for a while, I did.Unfortunately, what lay underneath wasn't all that great.  Yes, being able to ""fudge"" resources and use one thing in place of another is nice, but you can't combine two different types and the drop-down list bugs out if you have too many candidates.But then we get to the matter of the actual tech tree and what you're building with all this space junk...   The game praises its ""unique, Borderlands-style procedurally generated weapons"", but all this means is that rock gun 1 may have +2 minimum damage and +1 clip size, while rock gun 2 has considerably less of either but 15 more accuracy (note, I have yet to discover what, if any, effect ""accuracy"" actually has on anything.  It certainly doesn't do anything with the projectile spread) and a different abstract ""quaility"" [sic] rating.  And between the three first tiers of weapons, with a really vast difference in required resources, there was only a tiny upgrade in regards to damage and clip size.  All other stats were pretty much the same, and they all looked like so much jumbled bulk.There's no smooth progression, as all tech is unlocked by picking up and consuming data bricks that get dropped randomly by enemies.  Yup, you're gonna have to shoot a LOT of electric jellyfish before you can build that kitchen counter you always wanted.  You'll also need to do a spitload of grinding to get all the metals you need for anything beyond just dirt guns and mud armor, because ore veins are very rare and often stupefyingly dangerous to go near.Speaking of danger, this game incorporates a life system.  It's not game over once you reach 0, but if you die after that all the items in your tragically small inventory will get expunged onto the surrounding terrain.This game is early access, VERY early.  It's fully possible it will shape up in time, but right now it's clunky, incredibly grindy and half the items in the tech tree are obscenely expensive and serve no purpose.  In closing, I figured out how to infinitely duplicate any resource in the game before I managed to work out how to split a stack in two.  Wouldn't recommend in its current state.			"

												Cautious Recommendation.I waited till post launch to play this game as it was something both me and my bf were looking at since we enjoyed terraria so much. So I will go through a few pros and cons from my experience thus far.Pros - Gameplay is fun when playing with multiple people, there are features such as resurrecting dead players that you will miss out in if you play singleplayer.- Questing is quick and easy normally. It can be a bit grindy for some of the quests but the rewards seem to usually be worth it. It instills a sense of progression that is enjoyable to experience.- The details on your character armor and progression trees that allow you different armor if you play a certain style give a unique vibe and add potential replayability.- Knowledge skill trees give you lots of ways to specialize as you progress in early game and it is especially helpful if you have multiple players with you, letting you all specialize in different ways and combine your knowledge to progress quicker.Cons- Do not try to exit game and try to get back if you are running a server. The steam client will not allow you to start game back up till you take your server down. This is also a huge problem if you crash or have any gamebreaking bugs.- Got stuck in a wall by jumping into it during first hour of play, only way I could solve it was to quit game and log back into multiplayer server. Issue fixed as of sept 19th hotfix.- Exploding monster nests can leave the sound of bomb alarms going off long after its been destroyed, making an annoying sound that just wont disapear.- Monster ai leaves a  lot to be desired.- Building seems to take a while to make anything worthwhile and there is not as much a need to build actual homes like other games in this genre.- It is incredibly challenging to figure out how to get many types of building materials, leading to constant searching of wiki to figure out how to find many types of materials.- Certain materials that were used in many types of items were incredibly rare to find, making it so that more people you had with you, the more challenging and difficult it was to even find enough materials to get everyone basic items.Overall, I would recommend waiting on this game for a few more patches or unless you like what you see. The game is enjoyable but there is quite a few issues with it that can lessen the enjoyment in both singleplayer and multiplayer post launch.			"

												I can't write a real in-depth review because I'm not sure if I want to play this for much longer - it feels rushed, really rushed, with a lot of design and gameplay problems.You get xp from basically doing anything, and you can spend it on unlocking further tiers of sciences - but there are so, so many branches that's absurd. Melee weapon, energy weapon, projectile weapon, phase weapon - four different ones. Explorer, fighter and builder armor, utility, consumables - it's overbearing and really hard to notice what's useful. Crafting is also a mess - it's great that you can multiple materials when the recipe only asks for *metal*, but you need to pick the chosen one from a drop-down menu. There's an autofill button that uses the lowest tier? most abundant? resource of yours, but in that case I don't know why is that not the basic option. Not to mention that opening one dropdown menu doesn't closes the other, and they overlap - I can't believe this is happening in a finished, released game. And finding the actual items from the crafting menu is just a nightmare - if you check ""all"", there are too many options, but other than that, you can filter by type. And you know what does that mean - even more dropdown menu, trying to find out which one has a craftable, or even a useful item in it.Graphics are vibrant coloured ones, but it's like someone smeared something opalesque on it - hard to take out silhouettes, the size of the blocks, the aim of weapons/tools.    But hey, we have a spaceshark companion who's sounds are like a girl whining in an anime... ON A SPACESHARK.... just... no.If I should summerize the game in a world, I would say  it's  unintuitive. But to a high level.  Stay away from this one - Terraria still provides so much fun and depth, and even Windforge has more style with it's weird 2.5D graphics than this game :\  Maybe I'll come back to force some progress, but this game is a definite NOT RECOMMENDED.  Not to mention that the 15€ price is infuriatingly high.			"

Early Access Review
								I wanted to thumbs up this review but at this time I wouldn't recommend it to others.  It is a work in progress but a couple of key issues are preventing me from doing so.  To keep this as brief as possible, there's not hardly any ""How to"" up to date resource online - most of what I found was from more than 12 months ago and a lot of the game content has changed since then.  The in-game tutorial is better than nothing but it only goes over the basics and the in-game codex doesn't offer the detail needed.  If the developer would put up some current video tutorials it would help out a lot.When I first started playing it was a major red flag to me that you couldn't pause the game in single player.  The game can be fairly complex (which is a good thing if you have a resource to explain it) and most of what's available online is fairly outdated.  People were left to ask questions on the forums.  Not a major issue for people that have been playing since 2013, but for new players (even ones with experience from playing other similar games like Terraria or Starbound) they can lose motivation to continue quickly without knowing what to do next to progress.It's not a bad game, it has potential and it's still in development.  However I could not recommend it at this time.  I have uninstalled the game and will check back in a few months.			"

												I have stayed away from this game for a while due to its low ratings, but decided to buy it during the christmas sale. I wanted to play it for myself to see how it was. Here are my thoughts from just an hour and a half of playtime.Pros:+ Has something like a main quest line+ Has mini events that appear on the planet, with objectives+ Has a crafting system with trees that look like they have a reasonable amount of items+ Has an npc with a bunch of dialogue, uncommon for this genre+ Has a strange (but interesting) artstyle that reminds me of AVwW, but a little different+ Some of the equipment looks well drawn, and very nice as future outfitsCons:- Crafting system requires large amounts of materials to make mundane or low tier objects- Enemies and destructibles drop lots of loot and it feels like my inventory is weighed down with junk just a few minutes into the game- The tiered system for items/crafting isn't intuitive or sensible (other than weapons/tools named ""Mk. 1"", ""Mk.2"", etc.)- The tiers locking you out of building or crafting some items feel arbitrary despite being in an already arbitrary game setting- Mining the necessary materials for the beginning quests or items is very slow, boring, and repetitive; it's so unengaging that it feels like busy work- Mining laterally is A PAIN at times because the laser eminates from your upper chest and you can't mine a straight line below or above that level due to that constraint - you have to mine extra blocks to get line of sight for your laser (which technically makes sense, but this isn't real life and an arbitration could be made here, even just letting us CROUCH would fix half of the problem)- Moving the character is clunky, you stop on a dime and using the jetpack arrests upward movement to begin a slow acceleration upward (but using the jetpack to slow your fall does very little to slow you unless you were already falling at a slow speed)- The npc with dialogue is annoying, makes annoying sounds each time you respond to it, and doesn't help you with the early game much other than telling you what the tutorial pane (accessed with the U key) does.- Several parts of the game are very arbitrary, like being magically unable to mine in an event area until you complete the event (but then able to mine with no problem afterward)Conclusion: The game almost has the barebones of a sandbox crafting adventure game, with what looks like a reasonable amount of content added in. But content doesn't make a game, it only adds to it. The base gameplay, the platforming, the item collection and crafting, just feels bad. It does not feel finished. It feels like a prototype with extra content.			"

It's not diverse and it doesn't have a workshop, the worst part is that you depend on one metal for survival-- ALUMINUM! In the real world, aluminum is used for cans of SODA! SODA FOR GOD'S SAKE! And in this game, you land on one planet & sit there forever! In starbound, there are more planets to visit, and you get a personal ship! The creatures are more diverse, and the art style is more clean & not overly detailed like this GARBAGE. This is the WORST 2d platformer I've ever seen. Even CAT MARIO could top this.			"

												Regretful and disappointed.I have about eighty-four hours invested into Edge of space. (with about one third of my time in pre-release, over 404 hours in Terraria in comparison). It was exhilarating  to see a game with the science-fiction setting in the genre. I wanted to like this game, but it's been a letdown overall. Exploration and expansion become quite hindered by your armor and weapons. Crafting remains over-complex and tedious. It is all too easy to sink hours looking for resources that are a little -too- scarce. Items take sometimes a half-dozen ingredients to make (which themselves take several crafting stations). In comparison to Terraria, most items take three or fewer (excluding endgame content). This game is an example of a great premise bogged down by poor development. This is one of the few games I keep trying every so often to see if they've fixed it, and so far they haven't. I'm not yet at the point where I wish I could trade or return it, but I'm not too far from that either.			"

												I really want to enjoy this game, sadly I cannot. There are many UI problems and the whole thing seems too archaic and clunky to operate. Even with the tutorial videos I find myself struggling with basic things that even checking the key-mappings don’t reveal. One such example is how do you change the orientation of an object you are placing? How do you make that bed face left instead of right? The entire game is frustrating in this respect.The developers appear to have disappeared. Even the Handyman Studios website has long gone down.Edge of Space is far from a finished product, yet it appears that the Devs pushed a 1.0 release, a few fixes post release, then abandoned the whole game.Most disappointing, particularly as the game was sold with “Official Terraria” themed objects suggesting it would be a game of the same standard. It is not.Thoroughly disappointing and in it’s current state I would have to say a very clear “DO NOT BUY”.			"

												I cannot recommend this in good conscience.  There are many aspects of this game that I enjoy (largely, the overall concept/game idea) but the fact that the devs have more or less abandoned the game makes the delays and/or broken aspects of the game many of us have dealt with for months/years rather frustrating.  Things like the poor transition from biomes, the EXTREMELY poor hotbar usage, or the unfinished dungeons all add up to unfulfilled expectations.  In the end, I want to recommend this game but too many broken promises (and yes, me being an EA adopter is my fault, I accept that) lead to caveat emptor at this point.			"

Early Access Review
								This game is one of the good examples for Early Acces. The Dev team is really nice and are very present and working with the community. Constant patches and addet content keeps making the game get better and better and i don´t regret buying into this at all. The art style, music and ambient is just awesome and everyone who like this genre should give it a try. Even tho it got Terraria content in it it is by far not a clone and got it´s own unique feeling to it as it is more focused on action and plays more like a metroid game when it comes to progression and gunplay.A big thumbs up from me .

												The most dissapointing part of this game is that theres proof that it's went to $41T, ingame if you click the steam rewards button, it would originally take you to a place to redeem codes for exclusive items (see hollow gear and greenlight helmet) now if you click that button you are taken to a ""website for sell"" domain, So, i originally left an unhelpful and stupid good review on this game, i've since deleted that review and this game from my pc. This game is far from finished and seems to be abandoned, though it is a good sandbox, and good for people who want to build, but I suggest starbound for better building. it's sad and such a shame that this game had so much potential and has since been seemingly abandoned even though the devs say it's not...I hope they're truthful as I'd like to see this game become more than it is. but i've had requests to update this review to be more helpful, thus pros and cons will follow:Pros+Questing system+Story and Background+Dungeons, Events, Etc.+Npc's must be found around the world+Unique fragmented world, and the further you drop the tougher it gets+Unique and fun research/upgrade system+Challenging, and fun pass time+Sandbox+(to my recolection) you loose nothing upon death (maybe a few research points if that, correct if wrong)Cons-Seemingly Abandoned (the devs say it's not, I hope they're right, explained in comment)-No more exclusive/event rewards (unknown if will return, see greenlight helmet and hollow armor)-Repetitive-Quests can progress faster than you (power, level, distance wise, etc.)-Sometimes a bit too challenging-...as of right now, I can't think of any moreso untill this game is back to updating and no longer seems abandoned, this review will remain negative, (I would chose neutral or abstain if possible because this game can be fun sometimes)			"

												So I bought this game in the early stages of development, and I was going through my library today and saw standard edtion edge of space. I thought hmm that doesn't seem right it was in early access when I bought it and a lot of the stuff they have been working on was now DLC. I would stay clear of this game and it's creator. Terraria did it first, did it cheaper, did it WAY WAY better and doesn't try to charge everyone to pay for in game items. Starbound would have been a much better choice when I bought this game and now I suffer the consequences with this salty wound. Edge of space is a complete waste of time and sadly lied to its early access players making false hopes.~ Sincerly 1 individual that wants you out of the video game making market.P.S. Try and come up with an idea for yourself.P.S.S Just nominated this game for ""Worst Game Ever, With even worse developers!! ♥♥♥♥ you handyman studios!"" award for the game awards in december			"

Early Access Review
								Funny story, actually. I bought this thinking it was Starbound, and was horribly disappointing. I have no idea what build I was getting into.What I got into was pretty much ""build a base with a couple of buildings as a home-base, upgrade your characters and build armor and weapons, then kill the like 20 or so different enemies in the game.""I mean the way to progress your character was to get little data-chips that would increase your xp.It was cute, but it took waaaay too long to progress, and when you did a lot of the time it felt like half of your progress was for very little.Now it's been a while, there's a pretty clear line between enemies that act as a faction that alert each other and gang up on you(can get really tedious at times, but as long as this is a beta that's all good) whereas there's other wildlife enemies where some'll be more aggressive, but less factional in that they communicate with others of it kind, and then other creatures doesn't really care that much, but gets mad or scared if you attack them.Base construction used to have a power generator and a command center's CPU-distribution as their main sources of power for the base equipment. Now they have Command Centers that power parts of bases, but command centers will conflict with each other, so you'll either have bases build into segments, or bases placed in completely different edges of the map, still connected by the Command Centers as one can teleport from one CC to another.There's the separation between Phase-type weaponry (that doesn't use ammunition) that does less damage than projectile-based weaponry(which does use ammunition), there's signs that they'll end up giving us energy-based weaponry as well.Game's also got a few vehicles, as of patch 0.4458 we have the Zephyr, decent hp, medium speed vehicle, pretty large, would guess about 6x7 blocks-size or so? There's also a Thunderbird, which I haven't tried, but it's supposed to be more armored, but slower. Other than these mechanical vehicles there's mounts: A crab, a jumpy raptor, a fast raptor and a net with captured jellyfish that works like a hoverbike. Jellyfishbikes have very little fuel, but are way faster than traveling by foot, never tried mounts as I was worried their lack of ability to fly or hover would make it hard to traverse in any useful terrain, as there's not much to gain by scouting the surface, unless you're on-foot killing enemies for loot and XP.Hope to see the ability to equip and upgrade vehicles and/or mounts with different types of weapons/mining equipment in the future(choosing between phase, projectile and energy, potentially even one additional weapon slot in specific cases would add interesting layers into the vehicles section I think) Definitely hope to see refueling stations/refueling kits in the future as some vehicles are way to expensive to have them permanently expire after traveling a short distance, not to mention that giving the vehicle retrievability until it's destroyed could justify increasing costs of vehicles, and giving it said weapon/armor upgrades as mentioned earlier.Not sure what the devs have in mind in terms of npc's or vending machines, but so far this game is intriguing.The different AI behaviors are also interesting in terms of there being completely passive AI, passive-aggresive AI, faction aggressive AI's and some that will camouflage themselves rather than attack you for survival.Nature yielding multiple resources as well giving different elements like sap, bark, the leaves and seeds, which affects what players can do in terms of crafting. It's half interesting due to different categories of crafting materials (Inorganic(processsed)/raw, minerals/chemicals/organic etc) but I also halfway feel like plants and gems end up kind of taking up a little bit much inventory space, as much as I adore the complexity. It works, but with a limited amount of inventory space it's definitely tough if you're going solo. Which also makes the swarmy enemy spawns a bit tough to deal with. Haven't tried playing with friends yet, so would say this'd be way more fun multiplayer.All in all, in its current state I think that if you wish to roll solo and only go for weapons and armor upgrades I think the game'll last a few days. If you're going for exploration, building bases, upgrading yourself and essentially minmaxing on everything on your own it'll be worth everything from 1 week and up depending on how fast you are with these kinds of games and how much time you have to play it. I'm thinking 15+ hours a day being super efficient and lucky with weapon stats(Because weapons' stats are semi-RNG. Dmg per shot, in-game gun visuals, accuracy, crit rate, Ammo cap, MAYBE reloading time, and refire rate/rounds per second). Although it's a bit buggy and pretty slow in its current state, its simple ""complexity"" in crafting and although the devs(and their resources) are in charge of how much they can do with it I think it has sick potential, even if they end up sticking with the content they have right now, although more stuff's always beyond appreciated. I'm very glad I stumbled across this game, and I hope it goes even further as this is awesome so far.PS. Devs. PLEASE give me a way to change my looks. I'm stuck with a thing on my face that won't let me see the helmet-art.Also, there's a bug where when you blow up a thing that explodes upon death with an exploding projectile, the explosion caused by the dying npc will destroy the projectile post-explosion and will cause a chain explosion in projectile and dead enemy, which nearly killed my application. If there was a way to fix that that would be great, meanwhile I'll make sure to only kill explosion upon death units with normal bullets.			"

												Merry Christmas, Cheery Saturnalia, Happy Hannukah, Good Kwanza, loving Yule...Welp, if you are reading this I applaud you. I'm just gonna go all James Rofle on this.With a name like ""Edge of Space"" yo feel as though there will be some adventure involved.In the time it took to figure out how to install this hot pile of flaming garbage, I could have actually gone on an adventure to the stars, and met real aliens.In the time it takes to create a character, I could have become the next Bill Gates.In the time it takes the world generator to generate worlds, I was able to cook all of my family's christmas dinner.(above was the TL;DR)To start, I am running an Alienware area 51, with a an 8tb HDD, a 512gb ssd, 32 gigs of ddr4 overclocked to 5.8 megahertz per second, an nvidia titan graphics card with 8 gb of onboard video memory...During the install, the game got stuck at 12% for about an hour and a half, I had to restart the install 35 times before it actually passed that point. Next, the game wouldn't even load, like at all... I'm doing everything I can think of to fix this (aside from making a satanic sacrifice to Belzebub, and sacrficing the blood of the lamb, and the heart of the goat(jk))After fixing the not launching problem, I waited at the ""made with unity"" screen for about an hour [3:00 pm].After that, I had to create an avatar, and was completely unimpressed with the ""creation"".I then had to generate a world, which was great, It gave me time to make the stuffing, mash the potatos, roast the turkey,  toss the salad, bake the kings cake, warm up my vocal cords to sing ""God rest you merry gentleman"" on the bass cleft, go caroling, throw the green bean casserole in the oven, have eggnog and share stories with old friends, (you get the picture).... and it still wasnt even half way done creating the world [7:00 pm].finally at 11 pm, it had finished...I waited for a few seconds, and then was pleased(hardcore sarcasam) with the results. terrible graphics, sketchy sound quality, and non responsive controls. after 30 minutes of gameplay, it had crashed, BSOD'ed in fact, I could have spent the $3.74 on a cheap pocket knife.With love, Damien Shaydehart.

												An interesting experiment testing what would happen if a game was made with a quality programmer and a talented game artist but without a designer.  To me it feels like a game made by committee, everyone added a bit of what they wanted and no one walked away happy.  I dislike being negative about a game because its obvious a lot of effort went into this, but it feels, akward, and forced.  The humor is wierd, from the laser shark to the quests, the progress is jerky and unsatisfactory and the world is a jumbled nightmare.  Ultimately, this game has twice the content of a game like Crea, and none of the charm.tl;dr - good bones, awful execution, give it a miss in its current state.			"

Early Access Review
								I love the concept of this game, adapt or die in a hostile environment with nothing but technology to rely on! It's still in beta so there's still lots of improvements to be made and i can't wait to see them. So far the game mechanics seem stable and gameplay is alot of fun, the only problem is the somewhat awkward UI and lack of content, but what is already there is fun! The power grid system is simple to figure out and yet, can be extensive and complex in a good way. The developers look like they know what they're doing and know exactly how to put their vision of the game into reality.I definitely recommend this game and at $11.99 currently, it's very reasonably priced.

Early Access Review
								Since my first view of this title, the developers turned a slightly clunky and obtuse mining and crafting game into a stable and enjoyable game. It is apparent that the developers have poured a lot of work into improving the early access prototype.The controls have been tightend up, the crafting improved and a lot of content added - overall, the current version of the game offers more of everything then before.If you were sceptical about weither or not this would turn out like a knock-off Starbound, rest assured - Edge of Space is sufficiently different to make it a worthwhile expirience for veteran starbounders too.

Early Access Review
								Almost missed this title due to mixed reviews. Glad I didn't! Please do not let mixed reviews scare you off like almost happened to me. I will tell you why. Most negatives were probably from the early stages of this game and from people who expected a full game during early access.Pro's:-Excellent grahics for the genre.-Good sound effects.-Many innovations, like vertical progression and unlocking new craftables with Science points.(at first I hated the science points thing but grew to love it once I understood how it worked)-Darn good tutorial for an Early Access game.-Very few bugs so far.-Very involved and helpful devs and community.Con's:-Even though it has a good tutorial I found it still hard to know what to do next after start and what path to take to progress into biomes below after start.So there you have it, I think the label 'mixed reviews' is very misplaced. I can't stress enough that this is a solid and good game with friendly devs.10/10 Would commit suicide to bring my stuff home again.			"

Early Access Review
								TL;DR: It's an early access game with a strong foundation that needs more content, a little tweaking, and polish.This game just had a pretty big update from what I understand. Look at your review dates, if it is dated before Nov 24th, then it's not reflecting the game in it's current state.I'll have a more detailed review once I log more hours.First few hours:Cons:-Tutorial is a little frusterating, got confused at one point and thought my progress was blocked. (Turns out I was trying to craft the wrong thing during it)-Progress is not entirely intuitive yet.-The gear grind is a little on the slow side.Pro's:-Stong basic mechanics.-The one mini-boss fight I've been in was terrifying and fun. Tons of little critters coming after me in a cave putting out my temporary lights as they advanced. (If I didn't have the regen pack by then I probably would have died)-Fun building mechanics (if not entirely intuitive yet)-I made a jetpack out of dirt.Something I'm unsure about but rates mention:-Science xp, and these data modules: Maybe it's just because Starforge did something similar (and they did it poorly), but I'm wary of having to unlock recipies with xp and blueprints. This system could either make or break the gear progression in the game and needs to be handled well.So, should you pick up this game now? I'm leaning towards yes. The Dev's seem dedicated and attentive to their players, and the game has a strong foundation.			"

												Yet another testament to the great Kickstarter/Early Access deluge of 2014. The game has, as near as I can tell, been completely abandoned by the developers and the community manager, with one of the former regularly going on about a new project he's working on. No one from the dev team appear to have been anywhere near the Steam forums (nor the official forums, from what little I checked) for around three months now. The game seemed interesting enough, with an interesting (if somewhat grindy) Science XP mechanic, wherein mining and killing critters got you Science XP to unlock crafting tiers. Sadly, attempting to load a game, or even start a new world with a saved character causes a Coherent UI crash, which the devs have never fixed. IF you are able to get your world to load then you will be stuck without a HUD. No way to manage your inventory, and no way to transfer/drop/change items. Crafting is also impossible. tl;dr? Yet another dead, abandoned game that serves as a testament against Kickstarters and Early Access.Edit: And this is what you're greeted with when you start the game.


Stick a fork in it. This game's done, and never getting finished.

Except without any of the diversity or fun discoveries that make Starbound and Terraria great.Now including:-Terrible devs that clearly abandoned ship years ago-Ugly, generic spritework that lacks any of the rough-cut charisma that other pixel art games usually have-Weapons that all feel the same-Confusing progression-Very plain biomes that look the same no matter where you go (The lower biomes aren't any better. They're basically the same thing in a different color.)-Indescipherable UI (with no map, by the way.)-Stupid glitches aboundThe only credit I can give it is that it's a program that exists and can be run by my computer.1/10.

Early Access Review
								Edge of space is a very ambitious game with current plot holes and some minor glitches. The game however its self has a unique array of weapons, functions, game mechanics overall are interesting. At first I thought this would be somewhat like terraria but I was quickly mistaken. It only looks somewhat similar. Probably a concept overlap in overal cosmetics but other than that it all functions quite seperately. It revolves around you and your character who crash lands on archoa. You need to terraform the planet to be suitable, build a base, etc. Terraforming is not available yet unless they consider base building terraforming but that's unlikely. Overall, I don't have too much to say but this game is great. I'm hooked and it's absolutely a blast with friends! They come out with new content regularly, and while some times things break, other times you get cool things as of now like a gun that glitched past the clip capacity to have 65 ammo. Neat stuff all around. If you like the idea, please support the game and buy it! I pirated it first, and was happy with it until I ran out of cyro rods. That killed it, but then I bought the real deal and ho boy! 10/10, as of right now, I suggest it! The deal maker was cyro rods dropping from jellyfish for me and the fire fox. It takes a bit of brains to figure things out on your own, but do not give up arconauts, it is a journey to see through to the end! Checklist:Story: Work in progress but check.Weapons: Check! (wish they had bigger hit boxes, though you get used to it.)Monsters: I hate you. (check)Mechanics: Colorful. Lots of stuff to do and figure out. Check.Difficulty: Hell yeah! Check!Variety: I'm not sure. Check in my book.Fun: Check!Many moar checks, including bugs. Oh well! BUY.THIS.GAME.			"

												I've bought this game when it was v0.16 or something and played around many versions and at time i write this review i have like 200h played.To keep it short - i like this game pretty much and game quite improved since long ago. Shamefully, no longer supported.To tell the truth, 1.0`s feature wasnt suprise for me since i was in inner test team, yet those changes from last public build to 1.0 made game much more and quite much more entertaining. I'd even say it made game lively - tons of different events waiting for you to blow up (well, some of them do require you to bomb some places).So, what's this game about? - it's about exploration of planet, on which you had emergency landing when ArkCo`s shop crashed (watch the intro cinematics for more story) - thus you're alone (or not - if multiplayer with friends) and now you need to explore this world, getting resources and making better  equipment in process (typical for all such games). Further you go down - better resources, more dungerous enemies, new places to visit. For most actions you get XP to spend in knowledge window to get access to better gear and new facilities.EoS is about exploring ONE planet (different each time you make new world, following some generation rules obviously), furthermore - exploring it VERTICALLY - there are 3 biomes, which is placed vertically, even thought you will explore it in rather horisontal line, then moving down to next one. Also, note there isnt any solid terrain - rather flying chunks of it (codex it for why), thus you will not be forced to dig through solid terrain to get lower and lower.Many ppl complaining about game being too hardcore at start since weapon you begin with sucks at dmg (lol, ppl didnt even bother opening crafting window to see 1 scematics of better gun being avaible). But dont get too relaxed - most of things on this planet seems to be made to be human-killers and death can me quick and/or painful :3Ii expect ppl crying in few days about dying and respawning at start as annoying feature - even thought u can make and bind urself to better cryopods (respawn facility) to get respawn-at-dying-place points on time bases - cryorods.Btw - game has no tutorial, outside window with knowledge - CODEX - about thing you find/unlocked and flying laser shark, which will teach you some basics. Why? - well, for world's optimisation and....more hilariously, some ppl failed to finish tutorial or even simply passed by w/o learning and then stormed forum/reviews with questions tutorial had answer on :3Really, so far it's not very hard to understand a game.Those confused by low % of positive rewievs - most of negatives are made by those, who didnt bother to lurking around about game or didnt play enough (under 10hours - not even worth looking at), as well as people wanting Starbound clone.For more detailed comparison of EoS/Starbound/Terraria/etc visit http://steamcommunity.com/app/238240/discussions/0/540735426074163826/Pros:- interactions with developers - they do respond within a day (depending on timeline of yours) and they're friendly. Seriously, they even used to run server to play with players and they do take in account suggestions of players about what to implement;- helpful people;- Quite big sandbox-generated world - can travel to new places, see alot monsters and kill them. 3 biomes with different flora, fauna - so you will not see all the same things for whole game.- build your base, place facilities and decorate at your taste (alot stuff will be coming, thought even now you can spend few hours decorating);- rpg-oriented - alot stuff to research, player-style-oriented armor sets and kits;- quite nice amount of armors (3 trees: fighter, explorer, builder - all with unique and useful bonuses), weapons (phase - unlimited ammo and weak strikes, projectiles - limited powerful crafted ammo, energy - not present yet) and facilities to place;- SCI-FI setting;- some humorous moments;- Pretty nice graphics;Cons:- only English as supported language atm;- no way to pause game (thought placing command node and teleporting to command center placed in your haven saves the day);- a bit hard to set multiplayer server - there is a complete How-To guide on forum thought;- not exatly your average YOBA in terms of game's info - well, Codex, npcs and your brain should be enough to figure out the game (at least many questions are answered on forum since long ago)neutral:- farming - as in any rpg of such type, you gonna need to get resources for ur stuff, thpught getting most of resources isnt hard during traveling - just keep your eyes open. If playing solo - one might consider getting builder sets for quicker digging;- 2d game - yep, no realistic 3D graphics (like in 60-usd games);- not newbie-friendly in some terms (tutorial thing explained above), since not everything is explained, chewed for you and put in your mouth with spoon. If you run into trouble - i'm currently making game's guide:

Truth to be told, i donno about other simular games and their MP/SP orientation)state of game:- 3 biomes present and filled (with mobs, plants, events and stuff).- dungeons - instances to find some specific resources and bosses.- animal mounts and vehicles;- multiplayer (thought require to have someone hosting server);- guns (3 trees) and melee, armors (3 different trees w different type of bonuses), upgrades, facilities and stuff in quite nice amounts;- NPCs - somewhat funny bunch;- terrafroming is present))- achievements.- trading cards :3			"

I still have no clue what rock (I have 24) or clay (I have 2) looks like even though I have 2 in my inventory and using the jet pack is iffy at best. Sometimes holding the SPACE and UP ARROW together works to get me back to my cryopod from the asteroid below but mostly it just makes me jump up over and over. It's too bad the devs didn't spend more time on getting the tutorial to work (they apparently abandoned it) because I think this could be a really great game.

Starbound will at least give you a simple tutorial on how to play that you can also just skip. and terraria is simple enough to grasp but has SO much more content you can actually enjoy yourself.Please, please dont get this game unless you really want a bad time.

												Game design is one of those things that, when done really well, goes almost unnoticed. Sadly, this is the one area where Edge of Space really fails to deliver. The art isn't bad, the worlds are imaginative, and some aspects of gameplay are actually very fun! Tearing through rock with a high-powered mining lazer feels great. Unfortunately, these high points are all brought down by clumsily implemented features that are frustrating and poorly explained. A lot of things nagged at me during the 12-or-so hours I spent trying to enjoy Edge of Space, but I'll focus on the worst: dungeons.At a certain point in the game, progression through the tech-tree is halted by materials that can only be obtained from a dungeon. No problem! Except the dungeons are awful. The freedom of your jetpack and mining laser are stripped from you, and you're forced to clumsily hop along through some kind of half-baked platformer full of dark, confusing, repetitive rooms. Exploring the rest of the dungeon after going down a dead-end branch involves slowly backtracking through rooms that are even harder to navigate in reverse. It's so tedious that it's easier to just die so that you can start again from the top. The drop-rate for those materials you need is abysmal to boot. Just terrible all-around.			"

												I actually enjoyed this game when it was in Early Access. I felt it had a lot of potential. To be honest, this and Darkout (another failed ""sandbox-style"" game) are the games that got me interested in the genre.But now, the game has been released from Early Access incomplete - there is no story to speak of, some NPC quests are still broken, some recipes are still broken, overall balance is lacking, some deep biomes/strata are broken/bugged/non-functional, and the game is poorly optimized. It should have never left Early Access.Add on to that, there has been no news on the game in six months (as of this posting), said news being a vague-yet-ominous post about a future announcement yet to materialize, the official game page has turned into a GoDaddy parking page, and the developer has reportedly closed doors.I wanted to believe in this game, for Laser-Guided Flying Space Sharks with Human Teeth if nothing else, but in this state, unfinished and apparently abandoned, I cannot recommend it to anybody.

Early Access Review
								The game has a lot of potential, it's future looks brighter, but it makes no difference to the current state of the game. I'll put it simply; the game is complicated, too complicated. Refining materials is a key element to the game, and if you refine the same ore at different times chances are you'll get 2 random named metals that both cannot be used at once. The whole combat system is broken, along with it's promises of great intergalactic travel or something like that. Being this  complicated, you would assume a bussling wiki? Yeah, no. It's a regular wiki with stubs for LITERALLY every topic. Want to know a full list of tools? Yah, no-one has submitted an entry. The game doesn't have a functioning wiki, which is vital to a complex game that explains jack♥♥♥♥♥♥to you. This isn't even in beta. Even if these ""Features"" do exist (And I am pretty sure they do) almost no-one will have the attention span to slowly dig tonnes of crap, build high level armor and get down to get to these places. It's boring and repetative.I'm going to be honest. I bought this game thinking it was starbound. The only reason why I've ""gotten into it"" is because I wasted my money and can't get it back. Words are thrown around about this game, ""Terraria Clone"", and the like, but the one word I don't want thrown around is the word ""complete"". Check the global achievments. The only one is for starting the game, and only 13 percent have even touched the game. It needs a re-vamp, because I like it; enough to be sad if it does this badly.			"

												Eh. That is the one word to describe this game.It is an ok Open-world, sandboxy game, the areas are different, the enemies are kinda cool, the boss(es? I have only seen one) is/are ok. So when you start, everything seems like it will be good...BUT this game falls short. After playing for about an hour you will be bored as hell, you have to grind a huge amount for anything, missions are stupid as they don't work very well and all armour, upgrades, etc feel the same. No weapon seems unique or fun for that matter.This is coming from someone who has not played with friends, maybe it is a really fun multiplayer game? I don't know but If you want to/ think it looks fun then give it a try but I wouldn't recommend it too much. I really want to like this game and recommend it, but I just can't. It has too many issues.5/10 Fun for a short while then gets boring			"

												They say the game is released, but I don't really see it. It's still buggy, and it looks like half of the content is missing. The network support is terrible, the UI is uncomfortable. The crafting system is complex, yet there is nothing to craft. To learn the recepieces you need to grind for exp, and the ""quest system"" is rudimentary. The flying laser shark was funny as a ""first test of a quest system"", but I never thought it'll be left there after the release.All in all, it looks like the developers tired of this project half-way through. Now they are nowhere to be found, their website lies in ruins, and their promises are forgotten.Go for Starbound instead. While Tiyuri had his share of delayed releases and controversies, and while he was a couple of years late, at lease he delivered a game. You know, the one that works, and is fun to play.			"

Poor design choices coupled with lazy shortcuts and overall an incomplete and utterly unpolished final product.If you manage to get through the awful tutorials and figure out the meat of the game, you still wont have any fun with it.

Early Access Review
								This is a review in it's current state.I understand this game is still in beta, but in it's current state I'm not a fan. I definitely see the potential of this game and can forsee it being a really fun and addictive game like Terraria. Right now it's just frustrating. Especially since this game has been out in beta for over a year and the feel hasn't changed. It's sad when 3 of my friends and I can't stand to play this more than an hour every 3-4 months we try it.Many items that you find early in game have absolutely 0 use or in the item details it shows ""Will be updated in the future"" or some nonsense. The inventory feels clunky and can be buggy when swapping things in and out of your actionbars.For those of you who played Terraria, if you enjoyed the helper dude being there to somewhat guide you in the right direction you're going to have a harder time. The beginning gives you a brief sense of direction but then it's gone. To understand what a lot of things do, you must either spend lots of time trying to figure it out on your own or look it up on the wiki.While I feel games do need to have a little but of challenge in them, I'm not sure the start of this game goes in the right direction with that. Your mining tool is painfully slow. Your starting weapon is painfully weak. Materials needed to upgrade anything are way high. You also have lives in this game. So as you're digging down trying to find some sort of material you need to make an item you have no clue what it does, you come across some crabs that take 15 shots to kill with your weak gun and they kill you. You've spent 20 minutes digging, lost a life, and still have 0 of the material you need.The soundtrack is nice. Which is one thing I expected after playing Terraria and Starbound. Visuals look good for the most part. The gameplay just has a long way to go until I feel it will be fun.If you want a new Terraria style game, go pick up starbound instead. You'll be completely satisfied! Maybe in another year I can say the same about this.			"

												Normally only post reviews for games I enjoy. However, this game was awful enough that I had to post something.  I didn't buy this game when it released, nor when it was in early access. No, I KICKSTARTED this game. That was the promise and intrigue I had in this game. But it is just a slap in the face. Developers, which started out with constant updates, began to slowly abandon the game. The graphics, which are actually painful to look at, never got better. The crafting system is unique but just so unpolished. This game is a complete disgrace to the games it is copying.			"

												Never done a review before but I felt like this game deserved it.  I think the negative reviews are born mostly out of frustration with how long the game took to get from early access to release- this game has come a long way and, with it's 1.0 release, compares favorably with other games in the genre.  Edge of Space is a lot of fun to play- its bones are basically sci-fi terraria, but they've fleshed it out with actual character progression, mechs, rocket assisted dinosaur mounts and a ton of humor.  If you like this genre, Edge of Space is well worth your while.			"

												Bought this game since it first appeared in Early Acess. Played it on and off until they announced an official release date, so let's get to the details and where this game fell apart.  First, for a space exploration/craft game it's mostly about just digging down....down down and only down. The crafting menu is categorized but it's still very messy and not pretty. Explanations on how switches work with power are also few and far between so you're going to have to do your own troubleshooting for a while. There is a variety of weapons, i won't deny that, but in terms of USEFUL weapons there are only a few types which work well. So you can basically ignore all the melee and energy fueled weapons, stick to the projectile and plasma weapons. But the worst part of this game is the enemies...their hitboxes are really funky, and to make matters worse the hurt boxes on your weapons are terrible as well. So mixing hard to hit enemies with weapons that are hard to aim...great. And the movement of the enemies is particularly annoying and random. Otherwise I applaud its effort to be different but this game feels poorly done to me.			"

												When I first got the game, it was some what of a let down, don't get me wrong, the art was detailed and nice, the tutorial mission was decent for giving information (but was very boring, to me atleast) and there was some very nice potential for the game.But, the gameplay was, and is, really quite boring, the enemies (atleast the one I found so far) aren't interesting to fight, and really are to easy (atleast i think so), the tedious grinding for materials feels bland and unrewarding, and, currently, the development for this game has died and is most likely dead in the water.But, I do have some hope that they will fix these promblems, and that they start adding new content to the game.

												Sigh, was really hoping some of the other Terraria in space games would pan out, but this is so inferior to Terraria or Starbound that I can't even recommend it if you're desperate.Even if you think 'Terraria in space' is unfair for anything to live up to, the game is abandoned early access trash and not worth it even on its own merits. If it ever gets a transformative update, I'll gladly wipe this review.In the mean time, try Craft the World instead.  No, it's not the same but it's far more polished than this, and once you get the hang of not directly controlling an avatar, far more enjoyable.			"

Early Access Review
								Love this art style for sure and how helpful and friendly the dev team is. I play this game solo and really don't have any plans to play MP. I do enjoy the idea that all the fighting (for now) is with guns rather than melee. It is hard to get used to because enemies are smaller and fast but you get better over time. The game itself has just had a UI overhaul and progression is being changed up right now. I have no fear that this game will turn out to be bad in any way. The team listens to us and makes great decisions on their own as well. I have been part of some rough early access games (Warz :( , The Stomping Land :((  and Starbound :-\ ) so I have had my share of ups and downs. Edge of Space has kept me even, while I want the game to be done I am not demanding them. I know they are working on everything and it will be great no matter what. I originally came to this game because Starbound was updated and it killed a connection to a mod that made the game fun. (survivalist mod) Obviously starbound is so easy, no challenge at all. This game is actually much harder and makes you feel the need to be careful and play safe at times. Give Edge of Space a try some time or just keep it in mind and watch for updates!			"

												I was skeptical about this game when I first looked into it, the reviews on steam seems to have a really hit and miss feel to the game.  Since the game was on sale I decided to take a chance with it since I'm really drawn to the artstyle and general concept of the game itself.  I'm actually surprised that I liked the game as much as I do since I played Starbound before and it didn't really impress me as much as EoS does.A few things I do have to mention though is that, yes the tutorial isn't that informative but since a lot of people have played games such as Starbound or Terraria and Eos is in the same genre, a lot of the functions and basics are the same as well.Another thing is the lack of any active server searching function within the client, as far as I know of right now, servers are spread through word of mouth or in forum posts, but most of the big servers have been shut down already so there isn't a huge population in multiplayer that anyone can just jump in (Again, I may be wrong since I've only been playing the game for a little bit)Last thing I really wanna recommend to anyone thinking about playing the game is to really stick with it during the beginning, because things are slow and gathering seems like a drag, but once you start getting into the game more, you'll find that Eos has a lot of depth, potential, and it's own personality that separates this game from the other games in the same genre.  Seriously though, you can build a giant mech suit, what more do you need to convince you to buy this game?			"

								Edit for 1.0 release : Been super hyped for this and now that it's actually out, it didn't disappoint.Tldr; Buy the game. Best case scenario you love it and have a new game to play. Worst case scenario, you find out it's not for you and you can just get a refund.Pros : Toooooooooons of contentA much needed optimization (went from 25-30 to 60fps)Easy to set up multiplayer as long as you know what you're doing3 seperate tech trees for armor and 3 seperate tech trees for guns as well as a tech tree for melee.Every tech tree has 15 layers/ranksArmor looks unique and prettyIntroduction of nests that can be taken over (nice challenge at the start of the game)3 bosses already in the game with more planned for the futureSound effects sound great, especially for the weaponsOverhaul of world generation. No longer are titanium, ice, and other ores rare in the first phase of the game. Game promotes a natural progresion in that exploring, digging, and fighting will all give you exp you can put towards tech I really really like this soundtrack (thanks, Lori)Different types of weapons feel different. Phase are weak but infinite weapons, projectile are strong but very limited, and energy are strong but require you to decide between using them or using your jetpack since they both use the same energy.Wide range of enemies and great for people who like making very technical bases (with logic gates implemented and an easy to use power system)Funny loading screens to help pass the tedious but necessary parts of every gameCons :Weapons are a little hard to get used to and are sometimes hit and miss. Like with any game release, it has its fair share of bugsAfter the tutorial with Fineous, it's kinda hard to know what to do nextOver abuncdence of snails and frogs can get annoying.Game doesn't feel as grindy as other people make it out to be. I don't find it to be too gindy since there's always a lot of things to do.Finished playing Terraria with a friend and needed a similar game to play. With Gaben's infinite knowledge, steam recommended this game. After looking around and reading reviews for a few days I can honestly say I do not regret buying this a bit. Game felt grindy but with the new system being implemented, that's going to change completely. The devs are active and actually pay attention to people's positive AND negative reviews and react positively to both (Unlike starbound...). The reviews on the developers played a huge part in my purchase and I'll be buying a copy for my friend in the near future (aka the steam sale). Couldn't recommend enough.			"

												For version 1.0.3Though the developers have released this from Early Access, it really should not have been.  First off, the bugs:  missing image assets  broken dialog trees/subquests  spelling mistakes  crafting window which gets laggier and laggier each time it's opened.  constant shaking of the screen when left unattended for long enough (in my case, once to answer a phone call and another to deal with a someone at the door).Beyond the bugs, the content of the game itself is surprisingly sparse.  You just constantly descend without much incentive to explore other than to discover upgrade stations.  You can also find NPCs and get their subquests, but even if those subquests aren't broken there's no real payoff for completing them.At its current level, the amount of active development and polish needed before this would be worthwhile is probably measured in months, not days or weeks.  I'd check back in six months to a year to see if things have gotten better or if the move out of Early Access is an indication that the dev team is abandoning the game and so might as well call it done.

It still feels like there's more to be done with the game, like how Terraria has effectively been wrapped up, but I understand that such things take time. If you're patient, love the genre, and don't mind spending the money, buy it. If not, you know what to do.For real, though, it IS VERY DIFFICULT TO WANT TO PLAY. Only in the beginning.

								This game should be a repleacement for Terraria or atleast a comparable thing. Unfortunetaly it is still in phase of development. After completing few startup things (gathering resources, protecting robots) it is coming to a point where You are bored because You can't find anything new (~15 hours) or it gives You a head punch with difficulty level that is too hight (in the game events like 15 mobs spawning and shooting at You light bulbs that is extreamly hard to avoid). I do not recommend this game because sometimes recipes are not finished and in some points it is not intuitive (that is very important thing). Good thing would be adding some kind of direct portals (that You could craft on place with quite huge ammount of resources) to epic boss battles which would give You either uncommon/rare loot or resources that would be only available to drop out of this boss.Things that could be usefull:1. More boss fight (and except needed gear, also tactic required) + rare epic loot 1 in 100 or 1000 to drop2. More special monsters that grant a nice reward3. Combo shoots that gives a player sense of power (for example charging power for killing monsters and than when You want You can unleash it upon all foes dealing massive damage)My opinion:For now it is not as good as expected, however it offers creation of own server that You could play co-op/multiplayer. This game could use some features that will make it better and 12 Euro is a bit too epensive (but it's standard for most of steam games).			"

Early Access Review
								Edge of Space pits you against the environment as you progress downward as opposed to side by side.   You gradualy start to encounter bigger badder challanges that not only require you to be well prepaired equiptment wise, but it also requires you to bring more advanced tools.   The versatility in Edge of Space's tools seperates it from alot of other sandbox games because you can choose to have a longer, less powerful range, or a shorter more powerful version of your tools.   This gives you options to work with.The armor sets also differnt from other games in the aspect that they are not necissarly combat focused.   Instead of Ranger, Mage, Melee, you get  Builder, Explorer, Fighter.  Each armor catering to a particular task rather then a weapon role.  All items are created from crafting data of a specific sub catagory in crafting, so you can specialize and focus on one area at a time rather then pooling all of your science (aka accumulative xp pool ) into everything at once.Edge of Space also offers a challange factor with it's dungeons.  It disables things like jet packs and grappling hooks and building so that you can not cheese the boses for easy wins.   This should give you an idea of how the game plays out and how it differs from other games of it's kind.*Feb 25, 2015* Development Stage: Early AccessEarly Access Compitence Rateing:  9/10  -  Things were bumpy at first for what ever reasons, but things turned around quickly.   The developers never gave up despite the road bumps and updates are comeing in frequantly.   Edge of Space is a very good example of Early Access done right.Exploration:  9/10 -  The environment can be dangerous, there's danger around every corner and you need to prepair accordingly.    There are events and outposts that keep you busy and though it is currently in an infant state of things, I can see how the world will gradualy become more and more full as time advances.Crafting: 8/10 -  Crafting is based on xp and tends to get a bit grindy, but it's quite rewarding once you unlock new things.Game Controls:   8/10  -  Some obvious bugs are still around, but it will not hinder the game experince too much.   Jetpacks can also go wildly out of control and some of the grapple mechanics can send your character bouncing about.Game Play: 8/10  -  I suspect the game will greatly improve with time, but at the moment there is a limited amount of content to keep you busy, so the game becomes a bit grindy.   Again, I suspect this will change greatly in the near future.Music:  9/10  -  The music is very fitting for the game and quite immersive.Graphics: 8/10 -  It's gritty and retro, but also very fitting for the game style.  Some of the texture look weird, but it's a fair representation of what it is conveying.Newbie Friendly:  7/10 - Newbies will catch on eventualy, but the learning curve is a bit harsh.  But in a good way.   It is suggested to have some platformer experince before attempting Edge of Space.  Newer generation gamers may have trouble where as older generation gamers will have little trouble with landing platforms and timeing jumps.Community and Moderators: 9/10 -  Very few fights, healthy interactions.   Strong communication, very good staff members.  Moderation is fair and efficent and well handled.Developers:  10/10 -  Very approachable developers, they are always happy to answer questions.   They have sense of humor and are reasonable people.   Very good company to invest your faith and funds into.TL:DR Version:Is it worth it:  YES!			"

												Brand, brand new!! Got this game shortly after watching a stream on twitch with the devs.  I liked the look of it on the demo stream and definitely loved playing it in early access.  Since it's full release, I've put in about 12 hours on the game and am loving it!  I like the crafting system, the machanics, and the dry humor of the NPCs. The music is excellent also.  I definitely recommend adding this game to your collection.			"

Early Access Review
								I've invested in one or two early access games but what I like about Edge Of Space is the fact that they frequently update the game. To me that's a plus and the Devs seem to be dedicated and involved. Alot of people may be unhappy because they want the full game immediately but I find the pace is good so far. From the little time I've spent on it the game has a great deal of potential to find its own niche among titles like Terraria or Starbound.			"

												I've had my eye on this game for awhile now, and now with the release, the patch, and the sale, decided to go for it. I'm not disappointed! I love these little survival games, my favorite genre, and so far Edge of Space seems to have enough unique aspects to set it apart, and I've barely scratched the surface. So far, for me( knock on wood), no bugs and no crashes and game looks and runs great. Developer seems to be actively addressing issues that comes up which is always good.  If you love the genre, I totally recommend it!			"

Posted: September 20, 2015
												This game has come a long way since when it started in Early Access.  It is now the first 1.0 'Official Release'as of last week.  I'm a thumbs up but if you read my full review you'll see below what can be impoved on as well.I've stuck with this game and I still enjoy it.  It is a crafting, exploring game in 2D... but it's in space!  And if you like space games that are open world and exploritory, I think you'll find this one not to like.  The are lots of materials to search for, interesting knowledge tree to work towards for crafting new gadgets and gizmos, and plenty of creepy monsters and weird vegetation to learn about.  So if you like figuring out the unknown, you'll like this.  It's kinda like Terraria, Metroid, and Star Trek blended together, with a dash of Avatar but something kinda unique too.The Edge of Space development team says they will keep improving this game post release and I hope they do.3 things which need some immediate attention by the development team include:-  The game engine processes data and movement too slowly compared to other games in this genre.  The result is that movement is slow and battle can be clunky for game play.  I don't think this is my processors' or video card's fault as I play similiar games with even better graphics and gameplay, without so much latency.  Maybe the coding could be tighter / more real time.  Seems like a lot of processor overhead going on.- The opening movie is pretty untelling still.  It's better now that it's 1.0 but this is supposed to be the intro to the adventure.  The user doesn't get a good sense of what the background story is and where they fit in.  And what's with the other 3 organizations with different symbols?  Are they competitors or allies?  Are they the Ark Corp council?  Are they the ones who blew up our ship or was it an alien war?  It's hard to tell and it shouldn't be.-  The addition of Fineous the Shark has helped teach new players (and older ones) what the controls and game mechanics are.  It could be a little more obvious though.  Probably the best way is to make sure the Codex has more content and the user knows right away that this is their one stop shop for learning about their new world, and how and what an agent of Ark Corp is supposed to do and try to acheive.  Some more work on the goals of the game are needed.  The Codex should be like our 'Hitchhikers Guild to the Galaxy'; everything you need to know when you thunk on a new planet in a Cryopod without any friends or contact with where you blasted off from, after a long cryo-frozen nap. I like the sense of humour though so far; keep that going.That's my thoughts on this game so far.  I recommend, as long as you don't expect perfection just yet but I think it's worth supporting and playing.  It's fun and interesting to explore.This Review was written Sept. 20, 2015. "

												My question is how is this game still being sold when it is DEAD? At the least Steam should tag is someway so people are not dumping money into it. This and StarForge is why I am done buying early access, you think you are helping them make a better game but it is a scam to get the game to full release with minimal features then run. Starbound I bought when it came to full release and I can say that is a viable alternative to this.			"

												I playied the beta, I waited untill it got better. I played the horrorible 1.0 release that was still 60% complete (full of glitches, wrong item icons, wrong stats). I kept waiting to write the review, waiting for the updates that would give me a complete game and they never came. The game feels like grinding, boring endless repetitive grinding, the new materials feel like the old ones, the enemies are overwhelming some times and some times totally boring but the MOST irritating thing: It is FUKKING SLOW. I don't have a top of line computer, but it runs Fallout 4 on low graphics and fallout 3 on full. And it can NOT run this ♥♥♥♥ing game in a decent framerate. THIS IS A SIMPLES 2D GAME! It is absurd how lagged, with poor framerate the game feels. It does not make any sense. This and all the other critics you can freely read in the page. Would neve recomend. Go play terraria or starbound.			"

Early Access Review
								Normally I don't do early access reviews. Partly because early access is really about development, not playing (and reviewing) a finished product. Partly because everything is in too much flux for the review to be valid for long.Mostly because I'm too lazy to write reviews for finished games, let alone one still in alpha/beta.But I'll make an exception here, because even in it's current incomplete state, it is already one of my favorite games. It's also a fine example of what early access should be: An engaged development team that listens to feedback, works with the community, and simply wants to deliver a great experience to the people who buy their product. From an investment standpoint (which is how early access should be approached IMHO), this is exactly the type of product I'd want to back. The fact they're making a game I want to play makes it even better.			"

								For those of you that are worried about buying this game while it is in early access, you have nothing to fear. The developers update this game VERY often, and most of the time they are ahead of schedule. I bought this during the steam summer sale and have already seen several updates roll out, fixing issues, adding content, etc. Without a doubt the most updated early access game I've ever bought.As far as the game play, picture Terraria, but way more complex, futuristic and just full of pure awesomeness. I play with several of my friends and we all have a blast with this. I wholeheartedly recommend this!			"

								Could never really get into this game like others such as terraria. I often thought to myself why haven't i played this game much, but then i start it up, get bored and quit. For some reason this game just doesn't capture my exitement or creativity like most games usually do. It's just my opinion.Maybe it's just me but i'd probably wait until Official release and go play other games in the meanwhile  and see if it's any better then.I'd give it a 5/10  as i can see its potential and i hope to one day come back and be completely immersed within it.

Even if things are bad I would still try and at LEAST do monthly updates with your fans to let them know what the hell is going on. They said they would KEEP IN TOUCH back in April. It's September now. Don't waste your money on an unfinished product. Until they pull their fingers out of their a**es this is not worth anyone's time, free or otherwise.			"

New updates are always fixing things, and the new research and XP system is awesome!A highly entertaining and humorous game, as well as a very unpredictable one!9/10			"

Early Access Review
								Edge Of Space is a really well made side-scroller/sandbox game, it is still an early access game but in the future I think it will be extremely sucsessful since it is only beta. EoS has a really good character customization layout, and for a beta game, it has a lot of variaty and choice, it even has 'Deal With It' sunglasses!! EoS is a Single-Player and Multi-Player game, which is very impressive since it is only beta. It does make sense how EoS is such a well-made game, the developers of EoS have also made some really sucsessful Side-Scroller/Sandbox games e.g. terraria, an extremely sucsessful game and has many fans, and is what brought me to that kind of genre of game, so if the devs have made an extremely sucsessful game like Terraria, then EoS has quite a high chance of being really sucsessful game, and it even has the chance to become even more sucsessful than Terraria itself! When you start the game there is a tutorial in your spaceship which gives you objectives to show you how the game works, and gives you items which you need when you go to the surface of the planet you are on, so far I have seen three lifeforms, which i will not spoil to everyone, you should buy the game to see everything for yourself. The crafting interface is really cool as you can select  what you want to make, then instead of going into your Inventory you can click on select on the material you need, then it shows you how much you have in your inventory and how much you need. Overall i think that when EoS is at its Prime, It could me the most sucsessful game of that genre.9.999999999999999999999999999999999999999 / 10			"

								Very fun, if you liked terraria you'd most likely get some enjoyment out of this one. My only concern is that with the infrequent but still coming updates they add content that they dont really explain. My biggest concern for the game at the moment is the lack of tutorials past the basic gameplay. i'm left completely confused on how to craft or even get the crafting materials for 90% of the items in the game + the machine i craft for it also have no tutorial or show-how that tells me what exactly they're used for and it becomes and guessing game that leaves me wanting more because i cant friggin figure out how to get a helmet or what i need to kill or mine in order to get a single piece of equipment for a new crafting recipe. otherwise it is still quite fun and some people may like that no hands-holding way of thinking.

Early Access Review
								Update  7/15/14:  Do keep in mind this game is far from done and my review below didn't have enough time in to see how far along it was.  The timer has a few days till the next update so I'll update this then but I have exhausted about all i can do in its current state in a few days time.  I do think it had more that is currently being rewritten that may be blocking me but don't expect the complete experience of a game like terraria yet but what is here is great and I'm happy to of supported this game early.  I could build more, explore for more upgrade capsules and such (and I may) but recipes are limited, just a warning.Only 6 hours in so far but I like what I've seen.  This and starbound are apparently the 2 biggest games like this getting made right now (darkout deserves mention here since it could easily be the best if it gets more love) and with all the negative stuff I have read about starbound and the dev's attitude in general, edge was the one I chose.  Its fresh and new to me so I can't really critique it properly until I get to endgame to see how wiring and engineering possabilities stack up to terraria and have a better feel of the progression and what exactly is available  The fact that i have schamatics for various relays, switches and 'and gate' 'or gate' and 'not gate' makes me very happy even though I don't know if its possible to use them yet.  One thing I can say is that it will get enough time out of me to, at least, pay for the game in my eyes.  This won't be one of those many games on my list with 1.5 hours played and never touched again.  I'm more of a mechanics style gamer style game but I can already tell it has a ton of customization to those that like to decorate with TV's and such for whatever reason in the places they build.  I do appriciate the more advanced stats this has like various resistances and damage types.  Time will tell how it stacks up with terraria but I can't see any reason not to grab this if you want a new terraria experience to relax with at the end of the day.  It also has timers to show when updates are coming so thats nice and its kind of cool being in on the development cycle since I didn't play terraria till it was finished.  This way I get to see new stuff added and get ot be excited about it as it grows and expands.			"

								Lots of fun, little bit counter intuitive from terraria since they incorporate the mouse much more, and the crafting menu is a bit different. Still a good game and worth the money especially since the game seems perfectly fine on its own already even without being 100% done.			"

								If you're a fan of Terraria or starbound you may find this early access game to be enjoyable. While it is unfinished, it has all the basic neccessities. While it lacks content (common for early access), it has potential to be a side-scrolling, sandbox heavywieght. Although, at its current state it has a more relaxed feel. While there are enemies, They are fairly non-threatening.  Keep an eye on this one.			"

								Edge of Space is fun Terraria like game in which you start with basics and build your way up. Unlike other early acess games like this such as Starbound, the game feels like it is complete, even though it is still in early acess. It constantly is getting updates and it is obvious the developers are working hard on this game to get it completed. At first the game seems tough until you start to gain upgrades and level your base up. I am satisfied with the current state of this game and am looking forward for what the developers have in store for us in the future.			"

								Wandering around thinking what can i do. Going trough my ""waiting list"" i stumbled on EoS. At first i was not intrested when i saw it was 2D, looking old and something of the late 90's? Don't be fooled by it's ""first glance"" appearance, this game has a lot of gameplay and good times to offer! If you like space-adventure-survival you should buy it ( its only 13euros atm).Don't let the graphics fool you, after a while you love it, you will see it's pretty on it's own very unique way.Gameplay 8,5/10 -> its early access and the bugs it is having are annoying-> get past that and you will enjoy itGraphics    ?? /10 -> you can't compare these with mainstream 2015 games -> it is an other leaugue of graphicsPrice          10 /10 -> Early acces price is very acceptableOveral result: Just buy it already :-)			"

								Edge of Space should get some kind of 'worst UI / user experience' award -- I found the interface very poorly thought through and unresponsive, downright unusable; combat -- the main part of the game, as it seems -- felt unresponsive aswell, with bullets sometimes jumping through mobs without dealing damage. Crafting was poor, aswell.I honestly tried to get myself to like it so I could play it until Starbound arrives, but failed.Dont get this.			"

												I have over 600 games in my Steam account, and the vast majority of them are still unplayed. So now I'm dedicating an hour to each of these games and writing a series of One Hour Reviews. An hour isn't very long to judge a game on, so think of this as more of a first impression, and take this review in the spirit in which it's given. Be sure to read other reviews from players who have spent more time in the game. One Hour Reviews #54 - Edge of SpaceYou'll get an immediate sense of the quirky writing in Edge of Space as you start by having a conversation with a talking shark.  There isn't that much of a story to tell, just that your spaceship crashed and now you are stranded on a planet.  The writing is definitely tongue-in-cheek.I liked how the game began, and appreciated that it wasn't too difficult to begin with.  Although I do wish they had explained some things a little better.  The game includes a ""tutorial video"" that I felt was kind of a shortcut, as opposed to just better integrating a tutorial into the game.  Still, the first set of quests you get involve gathering various components to then craft into items, which is a pretty major part of the gameplay.I wish the controls were better.  I found mining to be frustrating at times.  You use a mining pick that you aim with your mouse.  But the aim is weird at times.  I kept wanting to just point my mouse cursor at a block to mine.  But the aim is actually based on the position of your cursor relative to a point on your body in order to determine direction.  This means sometimes, even when your mouse cursor is on a block, the aim is actually causing the laser to hit a different block.  It's a minor annoyance but mining is such a major part of the gameplay that it definitely adds up.If you've played Terraria, then you'll pretty much know exactly what to expect here.  It's pretty hard not to consider this game a knock off.  There are some minor differences with crafting, like the way you can use different items to fill a recipe.  But as a whole the gameplay feels extremely familiar.   I don't hold it against Edge of Space for being a knock off, but when you're borrowing from another game, you should at least make some notable improvements.  And it really doesn't feel that way.  And when you add the fact that Terraria is cheaper ($14.99 vs. $9.99 regular prices), I really can't recommend this game unless you've just played Terraria to death and want to scratch that itch with a different game.

								Pretty cool game, little more confusing than Starbound when I get into it for the first time but I feel like the more confusing a game is the more fun it will be later on depending on the game type. It is more similar to Starbound than it it to Terraria if anything, I didn't get too far into the game so I can't say if it is much like Terraria at all.			"

								What we have here is Edge of Space. Edge of space is a really interesting game, it plays differently from Terraria and starbound, it's truly a breath of fresh air for the genre. The weapon focus is more on guns at the moment, although they told me they are to add melee weapons in at a future time. As for graphics, the graphics are amazing and have a interesting feel, actually kinda throws me back to the days of the SNES, kinda breaking away from that pixel feel but also sticking to it. As for the music the music makes me feel a lot of things it's ambient and interesting it's kinda sad but in a good way. Point is, It's a fun game really, the level design is interesting and there are many canverns and areas to explore. The game is challenging as a rhino trying to climb a tree made of tomato skin, it takes some getting used to. It's a little slow at first but once you figure it out, it's awesome. On that note be sure to check out the tutorial and actually PAY ATTENTION to the words it says, there are quite a few giggles in the script too. Just pay attention and get immersed in the atomsphere and you will fall in love with this game as I did. This by the way, is coming from a terraria/starbound veteren. So purchase it and give the devs all your money as they're a fantastic bunch. 10/10 'nuff said. Also did I mention LAZER SHARKS.			"

												Ahh, I can finally review this without giving it a terrible review, the Tag may say mixed, but at this point i feel its coming along very nicely, the sun actually sets now, and doesnt just go dark all of a sudden, major improvements to how lonesome it felt sometimes with just the shark, there is more to this game now, the laser has been improved, and wearing the builder armor can help in early stages of exploration, events have been added since last i played, common they blow up once you finish it and you get to take practically everything that was in them, the gameplay still starts out pretty slow in the beginning, its natural for many games like this, im glad they have added more quest/npc interactions.Give this game a shot if your into the space 2d side scrollers and delving genre.  It has improved and im glad i bought it when i saw it on early release, they are close to releasing the game, but i hope they don't and keep taking in improvements and more from the community.I'd give it an 8/10 at its point in production, this could change later due to me just starting the game up since awhile.

												Edge of Space recently came out of Early Aceess, can i just start off by saying that this is a brilliant start. In an industry where developers leave their game to die with no content and sparawling fans: ""cough, cough"" DayZ.Edge of space is a 2D, Openworld Adventure game. The main story goes like this, You were in cryogenic sleep when your ship broke down, so you wake up and you go exploring the planet beneith you for recourses, not too shabby for a starting story. The story continues with a character named Rufus who is an interesting character to say the least. I wont spoil any more but i doubt you were looking at this game for its story. You want to know about the gameplay, the exploration. Well im glad to say that it's awsome. The game has many simularities to Terraria and Starbound but it improves on these things and adds more to them. For example in Terraria you have your ranks of gear going from a wooden sword to a Gold sword going to a Lights Bane. In Edge of Space, you have sooo many more options mainly because you have to earn xp to unlock new items which is awsome because you dont grind xp by killing mobs (well you can but there is a more enjoyable way to do it) you get xp for mining ore and it basically rewards you for exploring. You will also encounter these things called ""nests"" which you can explore and destroy for even more xp, which is cool. You also have your character skill trees, but when i say skill trees i dont mean like the stealth, the tank ect. I mean you specialise in what your doing. For example i could get builders armour, if i was interested in building stuff in the game, this would neglect the mob damage and illiminate annoyances that might stop you from building. There is a large range of things to makr that you actually want to get unlike other games where they have you craft random crap just so you can continue with the story, Edge of space doesnt do that, instead they let you build mechs, pets, new weapons and badass jetpacks. These arnt just useless vanity items they do infact effect the way you play and make it more enjoyable. So far im loving this game too pieces, being a big fan of Terraria and Starbound helped i guess, but i'd honestly reccomend it to anyone who loves open world exploration games as there is stuff to find and tonnes of things to make, there is no doubt a wealth of content here.....which is really great! :)Want a review that you can listen and see?

Early Access Review
								Hello readers!Let's get the obvious out the of the way: it's in Beta. There will be changes. There are glitches. Boo-hoo. Pros: It's engaging, especially compared to the garden variety of miners and crafters out there. There is a multifaceted approach to crafting that requires both raw materials and the know-how of a specific skill to be able to craft. Science Points (SP) are awarded for everything - killing baddies to laser-punching dirt - and are used for increasing skill levels in broad categories such as Base Construction (BUILD BIGGER CHESTS!) to Utilities (MAKE STRONGER LAZERBEAM!) to Consumables (WHO NEEDS CRYORODS ANYWAYS?). Once your skill level is increased you can then craft a better item for yourself! Enough on crafting.. Enemies! They're gorgeous! They're varied! They kick my♥♥♥♥♥=( They have weaknesses that make it an engaging combat game beyond point-and-click. Angles of attack, parabolic arcs, and reload times all need to be taken into consideration when fighting the local floral and fauna. Build stronger weapons! Fight bigger baddies! Get more SP! Build Data from SP into building better weapons! Rinse - repeat - pwn. Dungeons!  Just when you think you've found it all - suddenly you're platforming through a mega-dungeon fighting off mechanical brains with well-timed plasma rifle shots! Loot Loot Loot Loot. More dungeons!  Did you know penguins like pre-marital sex and Daft Punk? Play this game to find out why. They're promiscious. And deadly. More Loot! Why do I need all these brain stems? SCIENCE!Cons: It's in Beta. Lighting sometimes ♥♥♥♥♥ itself - sometimes there's no shadows at all! Hitboxes have been off before - but appear to have been patched. Nothing gamebreaking that I've run into with my 38 hours. 1/2 the world isn't filled in yet - but I'm sure it will be amazing when it is! There's more than enough to explore as is. The only gripe I have is lack of map - but it is a planned implementation, and I'm sure will be here soon. It's a large and confusing world - even with teleportation available you still get your♥♥♥♥♥lost. OVERALL GRADE:WOULD BUY AGAIN / 10 I give it a solid 8.5 - with the possibility to be a 9 or even 10 when all the bugs are worked out and content is added. The time I have put into  it should say enough. As a fan of Minecraft and Terraria - both Vanilla - the Edge of Space more than meets my expectations and is my current crack.  "

								Before I write my actual review I need to say something.  This game is so Early Access it sometimes hurts, but it's still an AMAZING game.  I'm just going to make a simple Pros and Cons list to sum some stuff up.Pros:- Original story- Heavy content- Amazing gameplayCons:- Random enemy spawn- The item descriptions could use some work- There's really no tutorial. I mean, come on, who  doesn't  know how to jump. It took me a bit to actually find out what I was supposed to be doing.Overall I  would  recommend this game.  The cons I listed are very small and didn't impact the gameplay that much for me.  It only took about 30 minutes to understand the game.  ***If you have read this review, bought the game and understood it, please, please,  PLEASE  feel free to visit it's official wiki and put content on it.  The wiki is very small and definently needs work, thanks!***			"

								While I do not reccomend getting this game at this particular moment, I do reccommend the game for near future. I came over from Terraria, expecting a similar game, but Edge of Space isn't another Terraria. While some core features remain the same, the game styles are very different. I am very fond of the developing team, and I think they're amazing so far. Their updates go as scheduled, and if there's a bug or a problem, they address the issue right away.I have really high hopes for this game, and I believe it has a lot of potential.

								It's the love child of Terraria and Contra. If you dig the suvival crafting genre you owe it to yourself to try this game out. It's by no means perfect with its occasional bugs and hiccups; but if you can get past its flaws it's a wonderful experience.Edge of Space has a killer soundtrack (reminiscent of Mass Effect), it has RPG elements in it that make it unique in the genre, and it's only gonna improve more.So, as it stands, I'd give the game a 6.7 out of 10. Not because it's bad, but because it's more of a sugar rush experience due to the game not having all of its intended content.			"

This is like the best parts of starbound and terraria mixed in with touches of original content for good measure. It even impressed the guy who made Terraria. Its on sale for 5.00 right now, you wont be sorry. Please over look the spelling mistakes ""Basc"" instead of ""Basic"" I am sure they will proofread and fix them later.			"

												well ive spent about 20 hours on this game and i can say that at this point the game is just not worth playing anymore. Exploring: its pretty standard, you go out find monsteres and stuff and you need to kill them to get their materials. most are nutral, some aren't. they have little zones with events like ""kill the zombies"", ""kill the crabs, ""Save an NPC"" which are fun but super short, like done in 1 min and thats it"" Building: building is pretty similar to other games of its like. you dont need as many as other games from what i can tell. getting new building recipes is pretty unique. you get XP for everything you do, and you trade in that xp for new teirs of items. Fighting: the fighting was pretty standard, thir weapons and teir systems are so annoying that finding the right weapons was just a chore. it doesn't say what the possible damage of the weapons are you just have to build them and hope it was worth the materials. mining: its pretty standared, nothing special. im sure it might get better later on, but ill never find out. but within the first few levels of you mining laser, it was pretty standard. Organization: their teir system wasn't done well AT ALL. i only got about half way through it and i found myself getting frustrated when trying to find stuff. like they have mark1weapons and forward, and if you need a mark1weapon you can't just search ""mark1weapon, you need to click on each weapon and see what kind it is, got really annoying. there are some items that are broken in this game that you can't get, but im sure they will fix it in the future but for now it makes it impossible to get any of those items. Dungeons: these just suck... like hard, they tried to make them a cool platform area, but they aren't they just suck and are annoying as all hell, and when you die you have to start from the beginning and fight your way back to where you were at. and if you wanted to get all the material you need from these dungeons you have to spend hours and hours in them. its just not fun. then there is another dungeon where its a boss one and its ♥♥♥♥ing impossible, i barely did any damage and died almost imediatly, and icouldn't build anything else untill i got those materials from thsi dungeon. (there might have been stuff that i could have built but there was no ♥♥♥♥nig way to figure out what i needed to maybe beat him, the organizaion of items in this game are ♥♥♥♥ing BAD. there might have been items to help me, but damned if i could find them.)all in all this game still has a long way to go and if you don't mind dealing with a game that has alot of work ahead of it, then have fun, but i for one stopped having funa round the 10hour mark and was just hoping it would get less frustrating, and it didn't 20 hours in and im done, im just interested in anything else this game has to offer, it seems like the further i go the more problems there are. they need to stop adding things to this game and fix the problems at hand.

												The game is out of Early Access now and I've played what I consider to be the majority of the content in the game, so I'm updating my review.This game's pretty good and I do recommend it for a good 20 hours of playtime.Pros:Scifi setting is niceGoofy humour is good and prevalent throughout the game if you're into that kind of thingGame runs smooth for me and I've encountered few bugs since coming out of early accessA lot of different blocks and placeables for building basesA lot of different items and armoursDungeons are a lot of funMusic is great and matches the moodNPCs that give questsEasy to fast travel between basesCons:Nothing to really do in the 3rd biome but grind for materials to build end game gear.  Also, there doesn't appear to be a dungeon in the 3rd biomeLight radius is small (spamming torches helps but that's just annoying)Weapons never really get powerful, even the Death Dealer takes multiple hits on spike balls (personal con, I like to feel powerful when I get to the end of a game)Still a lot of stuff that feels unfinished (many items share sprites, no dungeon in 3rd biome)I didn't try multiplayer but it sounds like it takes quite a bit of work to set up a server and to get people to joinThey are still working on the game, but at a much slower pace.  I hope they make another game because I have enjoyed Edge of Space for what it is and I would like to see something new using what they have learned developing this game.OLD REVIEW:I would recommend the game at the stage it is currently at if they sold it as a finished game.  So, the fact that they are still working on it and improving it all the time makes it an easy recommendation.  The devs are very active in the forums and constantly updating the game.  One of the devs even broadcasts on twitch sometimes while wearing a shark suit.  This game has come a long way from its original early access release and is going to go a lot farther.			"

												Those who are willing to put in the time to explore the world of Edge of space will find a colossal amount of content just waiting to be discovered and enjoyed. The sheer variety of weapons, deployables, pets, mounts, materials, dungeons, bosses etc is impressive, and although there are some obvious similarities to Terraria for instance, it is in fact a very different game. I would definitely recommend trying to find someone else who you can play with though, as it does enhance the experience a lot.There is a sort of tutorial in the form of a friendly laser shark who asks you to do a few short quests to get you used to the basic mechanics of the game, but the rest is mostly left up to you to figure out, (there are instructions on how to do everything if you dig in the menu) and so a degree of effort is required in order to get into the real meat of the content. Once you do however, you'll realise just how much there is to do and discover.Edge of space is very colourful and is graphically the equivalent of eating too many packets of Skittles in one sitting, the pallette is well chosen and easy on the eye, the art style is great, and everything stands out. Some players have complained about the lighting system but personally I haven't had any problems with it. The music is great, very relaxing and suits the mood well. The best thing however is the splendidly warped sense of humour that the developers obviously have and that comes across not only in the design of the world but in many of the descriptions and explanations that are there to be read if you take the time (and I recommend that you do)Gameplay is a lot of fun and some of the weapons in particular are extremely satisfying to use. I know I have only just started to scratch the surface but already I am enjoying flying around on a net full of jellyfish with a small glowing fox creature following me around and helping to light my journey into the planet's extensive cave systems.In summary, if you like randomly generated 2D exploration games with crazy amounts of content and are willing to put in the time and effort required to get through the initial learning stages, then you will get very good value from Edge of space, even more if you can find someone else to team up with.

Early Access Review
								Firstly, the combat is annoying and clunky, especially when all the enemies are darting around erratically making it infuriating to try and hit them; and when you do eventually land a shot, the enemy (in the first zone, less than 20 minutes in) is totally immune to your weapon, and firing back homing explosives which are very had to evade or shoot down. The AI is clairvoyant, always knowing where to aim at any moment, and the explosive weapon of one of the first three enemies you will face can break large holes into your base, allowing the rest to hit you directly, killing a player obscenely quickly. Secondly, the crafting is on a tech tree, requiring spelunking with useless tier-1 equipment to try to unlock tier-2 and so on, sadly, the depth you can reach is restricted, and a player will often never find anything before death forces them to their respawn point. The crafting is clunky and difficult, the UI is a battle to navigate with almost no quick access to the comically named ""hotbar"", and the tutorial is laughably incomplete. I bought this game believing I was buying into alpha software, and it felt like that, in mid-beta. The gameplay feels confused, torn between rogue-lite and Terraria-esque sidescrolling sandbox. Enemy variety is good, and the art style is unique and appealing, but the gameplay needs severe work. Avoid buying this title for full price, if you must buy it at all.			"

												This is less of a review and more of a warning because the game is broken and unfinished. If you can deal with game breaking bugs for multiplayer and game hindering bugs in single player then by all means purchase this to get a taste of what a great game it could have been if it was finished.I was a part of the Early Access players that enjoyed Lady Ajew (or whatever her name was) performing damage control for erroneous coding (not to be confused with erogenous) and a poorly timed ""Full Release"" which was thrown upon us a proclamation that it was neccessary to release it as full to iron out all the bugs; of which there were countless! (I'm sure the Early Access period was the time to do this, but as Lady Ajew the damage controller stated; it was the perfect time for a Full Release!?)I feel that if you buy this title you'll yearn for updates to address issues with mountains of bugs, misinforming dialogue and higilty pigilty coding of both the game and the GUI.This game could have been fun but is just far too busted to be fully enjoyed; it's just unfinished and broken.If you try this game and want it to be complete it may hurt your soul, even if just that tiny little bit.

								Dear readers,I highly recommend this game, for a range of reasons. Perhaps most importantly, it is actually fun to play. I was initially dubious, since I am new to this genre of game, but, at the behest of a friend, I decided to give it a chance. I am very glad that I did, because flying (even for short distances) with a jet pack is all that I hoped it would be. I am still waiting for my real-life jet pack, universe! As I have never played this type of game before, it took me longer than the average person (I assume) to get through the tutorial. This was not, however, because the tutorial was not well-structured. In fact, it taught me all the basics I needed to know for this game without much superfluous fluff. I just had trouble with, for instance, remembering that I could jump down platforms. In addition, it is clear from the regular patches and updates that the developers are highly invested in making the game-play experience as bug-free and enjoyable as possible. This is the first early access game that I've purchased, and thanks to my positive experience with Edge of Space, I will be taking my chances on other early access games in the future. Best,CV			"

Messing with the controls like this is an instant turn off in an age when we're over exposed to cheap entertainment. Put your efforts into other forms of individuality.

Early Access Review
just a slice of my thoughts on the game by no means encompassing the wholeLast play through 31st August (about two weeks before release)::the good::This game is a hell of a lot of fun.  I have spent my time building a main base and burrowing fully enclosed tunnels outwards in every direction to mine the resources whilst being able to protect myself after sun down.  The monsters are punishingly difficult to control and kill hence my paranoia.  I found the difficulty initially frustrating but having conquered my local landscape I feel proud.  Any attempts to venture outside my zone of control are met with caution but as my confidence grows I am becoming more able to endure the relentless onslaught.::the bad::The science research tree is full of gaps.  For example, you will research tech level one in 'companions' and be able to craft your own floating torch but unlocking tech level two will garner you nothing.  Why not merge tech trees from different categories?  The intention may be to keep a certain clarity by separating 'companions' from 'weapons' from 'base building' but I am only just starting to understand that fact by writing down my thoughts.  At the time of playthrough the science tree just felt unfinished.  That is probably also symptomatic of early accesss games.			"

												REVISED 11/4/2015Being a follower via Early Access; I must say that this game has come a long way in its development, and I am quite happy with the launch result. The game runs smooth, the 2D graphics are amazing; I definitely love how the developers broke away from the typical pixel art you see in most games of the genre. What definitely makes me appreciate this game, is not only the quality of the visuals and the sound; but what makes it different from other games like Starbound or Terraria. That being said, it has its drawbacks; which are mainly peeves on mine as mentioned in the cons section.Pros:+ Exceptional 2D artwork and visuals, definitely shines brighter than others of its genre.+ Nice and fitting contemporary Sci-fi theme.+ Biome diversity and abundance of interesting places to explore.+ The PIOS system which allows you to wire power to objects.+ Technology tree and research aspects are present.+ Nice crafting system. Uncertain:= The game feels grindy, but at the same time it prolongs the game.Cons:- The NPC's you get are really lame. You have a flying shark that sounds like a 5 year old, and a bunch of annoying furry ""aliens"". Really devs, couldn't you be more creative and make up some interesting sentient alien species?- Sometimes, there is an excessive amount of creature spawns. - Some creatures have a very obnoxious knockback.- There needs to be more biomes/content.Overall: If you like these kind of open-world, randomly generated 2D platform games; this is definitely for you.

												I've had this game in my library for a while.  I bought it back when I was looking for a Terraria-esque game, and either Starbound wasn't out yet, or I hadn't discovered it.It seemed VERY promising at first.  So, I decided to put it on hold and come back once a few updates had been released for it.  Unfortunately, by the time I did come back...the developers had pretty much abandoned the game.Now, that's not the only problem - the other problem is that you gather resources too slowly; now, you could make that argument about Terraria or Starbound, but there's a difference: in those game, it's it was slow at first because you needed to update your tools; and over time, you upgraded your tools, reducing the time it takes to gather resources.  Not to mention that they gave you other stuff to do in the meantime, like quests, boss battles, or exploring dungeons.  Here, it's because the things you need to upgrade are too hard to find.  It takes WAY too long to make something like a house - in Terraria, you can have a simple house up by nightfall; in Starbound, it's a bit longer if you decide to build a base on a planet instead of your ship, but it's still completable in a reasonable amount of time; in this game? ...You'll be lucky if you're even done with a quarter of the house by that time.Even then, the other problem is that...well, once you get past the tutorial, it's empty.  There's nothing obvious for you to do.  This is because of the lack of an NPC to give you hints like in Terraria or a quest system like in Stardew Valley.  At that point, it feels like a 2D Version of No Man's Sky, minus the ability to go to other planets (to be fair though, at least this game doesn't cost nearly as much as NMS).It's a pity that this game is now abandonware, since it does have some good ideas - I like the power system idea, since it makes you plan out your base; also, the research system is a good idea in theory (although in execution, it fails).If the developers ever decide to pick this game back up and start updating it again, I might give it a second shot, but at the moment, I cannot recommend this game.If you're contemplating buying this game, I would suggest passing on it and instead picking up Terraria, which does the idea of a 2d Sandbox game a lot better (not to mention it's cheaper); but if the sci-fi element is a must for you, go for Starbound instead, since while the worlds in that game aren't as big as the worlds in this game, the rest of the content more than makes up for that.

												Okay so this game is a 2D sandbox game that basically tried to rip off terraria or starbound... the game is litterally a mess I am supprised a youtuber I watched even told his viewers to check it out, when you load into the game you spawn at this point and the game throws a crappy instruction manual in your face with a video that only explains half of the controls. I feel like half way through making this game all the devs where just like ""I'm gonna go take a really long coffee break."" and just left the game half way completed, in the end this game is a sad excuse for a game at all... when I started my world I jumped off one of my plantes to check out more, there was a zombie nest but there was no possible way for me to kill the zombies the game told me nothing of how to get farther, basically if you want to get any where in this game you have to look it up! I can't believe this ""game"" costs more that a dollar if you are considering buying it... Don't!!			"

								I have played over 200 hours of terraria.so i know what i'm doing in these kind of games.-----------------I hope that the game is still under development, it could become great.Right now the start of the game feels very slow and repetitive. I have been playing for 4 hours now and i do not have the feeling that i accomplished something.EDIT:24-4-2015The game has been improved, it feels a lot more playable in terms of actually being fun. The start of the game is much faster now, thanks to the fact you can collect ores much quicker both through mining and killing certain creatures. The inventory system has been slightly improved, you can actually make multiple items at once now! Progress has been made and its getting better! Keep it up!			"

												First, I love this game, I loved terraria, and I definitely believe this game has so much potential just like terraria does. Throughout all of the builds I have loved this game, they tried a bunch of new ways to have the player level up and go through the story and I gotta say I like this one the most.Hey, I know the game has some issues running right now, but I have confidence in this team, they have been developing the game for the longest time now and they are always improving it, if you don't like it right now, that is fine, but maybe in a month or two you can come back and check it out again to find it to be more than satisfactory.This game has amazing art, cool combat, and a crazy terrain. Only boss I found was Omegatron and he was pretty awesome to fight, but just imagine the other bosses they made. Again, there is some optimization needed in the game, but the game is fresh out of launch and perhaps this isn't what they expected to happen at launch and I bet they are working on it right now, so just take it with a grain of salt, ok?

								The game is generally good yes but be warned there are somethings I wish they would fix.A. THE HIT-BOXES!: I have to directly hit the enemy and if my shots go past it then I don't do damage. That definitely needs fixing. Try it yourself you will see why. (If your reading this, and its been fixed, then disregard that)B. Enemy Detecting: I cant tell an enemy from a friend, the next thing I know a tiny little bug incapacitated me. The game is spacey so why not add a techno enemy detector or something spacey? It would be nice to have done in those 28 days before the MEGA UPDATE!C. Objective: OK so in Terraria (Not related just thought this was a lot like it) you knew if your friends told you or not that you had to slay something and survive through the world. Well this game is very spacey and from what I have played this game needs an objective bad. VERY bad.Now here is a list of what I officially think of this very game! Trust me this should cover why I enjoy this game so much.Well I have to say the game has very good potential. And it has Terraria data so that is kind of exciting, if they do read this I hope they know that I am routing for them and hoping they prosper and flourish in their glory, they have made a master piece's outlining, now can they finish the painting and how that is my main question in this all. But it does not matter I enjoy the game and I think they will go good with it.FINAL RANKSACTION:5/10DESIGN: 7/10CHARACTER CUSTOMIZATION: 7/10OPTIONAL OPTIONS:10/10 (OPEN WORLD OF OPTIONS!)IN GAME TECH:6/10PUT TOGETHER: 10/10 (LIKE BUILDING BLOCKS)OVERALL FUN: 6/10LAG: 10/10 (ANTI LAG POLICE)MASTER RANK: Spacey Space Space Of SPACE!YAY OR NAY?: YAY! :D "

												Yeah, when this game was in EA it was a little rough around the edges, but it was still a game, which I can say is more than most can say at this point, but it's out and 1.0. Does it still have a few rough spots? Sure, but what game doesn't on initial release, but they are working hard on it, to fix what is going on, and are very connected with the community giving us regular updates on whats up.The game is built around the idea of exploration, terraforming and expansion. Each of which is handled very well.The experience system that has been added in replacing the old way of researching is MUCH better and a welcome addition, as is all the UI cleanup that has been done.One thing I love about this game is there is nothing you pick up that is completely worthless (except building structure tiles if you don't plan to build with them). You can use Dirt, Stone, Biomass, jelly, shark stuff, to make guns, armor, jetpacks, tools and ammo.The Game is deep, and has more content in it than I will ever have time to discover, but for those of you whom have enjoyed Terraria, Starbound and Crea this is a welcome addition to the collection.Like I said, it's not a perfect game, but it still a heck of a lot of fun, I'd give it a 8/10.(Also be very warry of the negative reviews, most were done while it was in EA and a lot has changed since then, or many have been posted since it went live, but they have 0.0 hours of play time since it has.)

								This is a game that came before Starbound, and if you took Terraria and Starbound and inbreed you would get this game.3/11/14 content and priorPro's Cheap price, and as of this review you get a bonus copy for a family or friend.Nice backgrounds for biomes.Sounds: Not Starbound and not as enjoyable as Terraria, but it fits the sci fi theme.Jetpacks: Jetpacks!ConsTutorial, Doors fail to open, chest have the wrong things in it. Command help comes a little too late.Items that don't work, example starting gun you make does 1 damage a hit but enemies take 0 damage. You die before you can kill the weakest of thingsUsual glitches that I will not list because this is an early access.So in final I would tell anyone to give it a try while its cheap and you get the bonus copy, after that go watch some let's play of it or perhaps some one streaming on Twitch.

												I rarely review games, but this one is exceptional. Never mind the old negative reviews, as they were made way back when the game is still in Early Access, with lots of bugs. Now there are still bugs out there, but it has improved greatly.UP points:- Vast world (The first biome can easily as big as, if not bigger than, a Large map in Terraria);- Various quests, both main and side;- Interesting mechanism, both leveling and crafting;- Good sound effects;- Neat 2D graphic;DOWN points:- Bugs. Bugs! BUGS! There are a lot of bug fixes needed.- The menu is not actually scaled with windows' dimensions (i.e. you cannot create new character in 800x600, in-game UI is partly of screen, etc.);- The whole world is loaded in Unity so it will greatly drop you FPS on low-end PC;- Character control is poorly built: the character's arm is like a stick attached to the body, it cannot bend so it is really awkward in close-ranged action;- THERE IS NO HORIZONTAL INERTIA! There is vertical onertia, which mean it take time for you to speed up and slow down vertically. Horizontal: Nope. If you jetpack around and suddenly stop midair, you will drop straight down regardless of the initial speed.The bugs are not game-breaking and are being quickly fixed by the developers, so the UP points outweigh the DOWN points. Worth every cents I paid for it.			"

												If you are the type of person who is ok with having to remember on your own every detail of every inch of your world as you explore it, or are one of those people who can go exploring, end up in a running barrle, and die and know exactly how to get back to where you got by sheer accident than mayby you will like this game, for the rest of us I would say don't bother.  there is no in game world map, just a mini map.  it is entirely possible to fall through a series of areas and get completely lost.  there is no way to see where you were to get back there, you have to memorize everything, and for people like me that play once in a while you have no idea where everything was.  the nature of this games series of floating islands is what really inflames the problem.  unlike in games like terraria, a great deal of your time will be exploring by traveling through empty sky to see what is out there.  if you miscalculate your fall angle for the return trip you will miss what you found completely.  it is similar to trying to recreate a randm painting as a connect the dots puzzle when you can only see the dots your pencil tip is next to.

												So far so good. I have no clue, where da tutorial at, but whatever. I'm a fast learner. Game looks nice, works nice.

Also found out I can wear helmet, and take off my jetpack. Also, I have a jetpack. Nice! I don't know however, how to open those crates laying on the ground. Anyway. Back to the exploring!@Edit: Also, I can ride on a snail. Not the fastest way to move around, but hey. It works. xD22/09/15 06:58I just found out, that this game has quite awesome intro! Also I thought, quick restart would fix the fps drops. It did. In the meantime a tree grew up next to my cryopod. That's good I guess. xD Back to exploring.22/09/15 08:04Figured most of the controls, cleared 2 zombie infested buildings (And blew them the hell up. xD), finished helping my sharky friend. Today was a good day. Quite lost now, but whatever. I'm tired for now. Game's so far great. :)22/09/15 22:27After a long sleep, I'm back. Received some tips from the Devs, and that is awesome. :D Started to build a safe heaven on this weird planet. Died after quite a long drop. Guess what. Main land ain't exacly that main. Back to building.22/09/15 23:52Things are becoming a little complex. Power nodes? Command Center? Command pods? Factories? Mounts? Wehicles? And you thought building a base will be an easy task. Also terraforming. Yeah. Other than that, I built myself a sweet shotgun. So at least some progress was made. xD			"

								Pros - Good game so far. Playable. Hours of game play. Survival. Dont have to remember Crafting. Music. Can make anything with anything. You have the right to record EdgeOfSpace I believe. Has Mutiplayer. Tutorial on basics at the beginning. Achievements(Not a good thing to the game, just something I like about games).Cons - Needs bug fixes, and more ores to find early on. Crabs are too OP at the beginning. Run out of energy too fast. YOu dont regain Energy as fast as you loose it. Everything wants to kill you. No tutorial on how to make Energy work with the doors or CommandCenter(which i believe will be added?). No trading Cards(Not a downside, just something most steam games have, which I believe this game will have shortly later).Personal Review - Ive only had this game for 1-2 days, but I can tell you, this game is a great game and has a lot of potential for a early access game. Look forward to the updates and how it will improve to be a better game than what it is now. I strongly recomend this game if you are looking for a game like Terraria and/or Starbound to play with your friends. The energy/electricty system is a little hard to understand first, but I hope it will get better with the updates. With mutiplayer you can get things done a whole lot faster, as ive played with my three other friends. If you want a survival game I recomend this game. The music is great, and has a spaceish feel to it. Mutiplayer is easy to use, just open your ports, and get the IP, boom youre in. Playabe, and has hours of game play just to get the basic things. I Love this game so far, and I am looking forward to the updates to make this game even better! I am planning to make a gameplay series of this game, show the updates, and how to do things in the game. Keep up the good work Devs!			"

												Let's start by saying I've been playing this game since it first came out on Steam.  I also voted (before that) to have it ""greenlit""...  Greenlighting a game in Steam means that out of several recommendations that Steam gives you for upcoming games they'd be willing to add to their service, you chose the ones you like best.  Not all games actually make it!It didn't take much to impress me, this game had it all.  That's not to say it needs to improve highly, but the devs once promised there is a lot of updating planned for it. I really love this game so far, it has major potential.Having played Terraria for some time, I knew this game would be a great addition to my Steam library.  It has a long way to go, even after it was released to the public, there is a lot of content that needs to be added, and lots of bugs that need squishing.  Nevertheless, I am looking forward to see that happen.Still the best ""Terraria In Space"" anyone could find!			"

												This game seemed to have a lot of potential especially if it continued to develope.  I will say that the Devs are very active and not just ""Holiday season"" active to make it seem like they are still putting time into the game. This team keeps pumping out updates almost 1 to 2 a month and providing feedback for future updates. The game is a little hard to follow and a very pricy for it's type. If you like this type of game though and can catch it on a really good sale, pick it up, you may find something you like about  it. I don't feel that I can recommend it though, for the price to value ratio just isn't there. If you like Terraria, and are expecting this to be as good or a lot like it, you would be in error. Other than being the same type of game (2D crafting exploration game) it lacks a lot of polish, and flavor. It is still early access though so it could becore a great game, but I don't know yet. If it ever does, I will have to update my review.			"

												this game just wasnt ready for primetime. it should be called mining simulator cause the majority of time spent was on mining materials to make crap to mine crap faster.I dont think any amount of tweaking can fix how boring and tedious this game is. on top of being boring its poorly designed .It had potential but it falls flat on its face from orbit. The dungeon design is so bad its a sin and your boosters are disabled in dungeons so its even more boring than it should be. there is no soundtrack just some depressing background ambience crap. most of the dungeon fights take place in really cramped quarters with no whrere to dodge (I still managed to beat the enemies for the record) .  The pathfinding is even worse sadly so its easy to get lost because of dead ends and dungeon loops. Ill continue to try at later date hopefully with updates the game is less painful to endure 4/10 for now			"

												Still some bugs, like Invetory UI will start to lag, And other vierd slowings whit longer session. Base Idea quite good, has something different compared to other in same gendre.Like The terraforming stations making the world habitable for humans but the full potential of ideas is not yet implemented as the game is alredy V1.09.Don't buy this. Eaven whit the discount Get terraria or Starbound insted.			"

												I have a split review about this game, (9/19/15 edit NO LONGER SPLIT) so below you will find my pros about EoS. Pros:Amazing graphics, sure there is better, but the graphics amplify the futuristic feel of the game rather then the classic 8-bit.Kind playerbase, I have been to many a server on EoS and only 1-2 of them have had a non-userfriendly community to come along with them, but those that do i mostly delete from my server list.Understanding Devs, unlike most early acces games, EoS has devs who always respond to complaints and try to fix them. Most of what usaully turns me away from early acces games is the devs forget about the players after a bit and turn the game into a money grab for them, but thankfully Eos's devs show no sign of doing so. (thanks guys)Addictive gameplay, EoS has a feel that you have to keep on going to the next thing, boss after boss, domain after domain. The fact that you have categories instead of a specific item being needed for every recipe. In my opinion, this really helps because you can swap clay for dirt for mud for rock etc. This helps because you dont have to grind your way through the world looking for specific resources.It has a story, unlike most games (except starbound) this game follows a story that explains why you are randomly stuck on a planet with a cryopod as a respawn point.Cons: As of 9/19/15 i cannot think of any consThe advertising video is a complete lie: 9/19/15 edit: not anymore!!! the trailer pretty much sums up the gameplay (congratulations to the devs for finnaly completing it)The sections of the research list (my hotkey is L) of Experimental armor, Assualt armor, and Recon armor: 9/19/15 edit: no longer relevant =xAlso you cant get structure blocks for a base until a few hours in: 9/19/15 edit: FIXED: can get this almost immediately after creating the worldAlmost forgot to mention the tiny damage of the starter gun: 9/19/15 edit: FIXED ;D starter gun is now has fair damage and guns are easier to craft Good Job Devs			"

								Fun and interesting-sadly its a bit prolonged to progress and it seems like overall it will be rather short-thats only because its in development-there are two areas I've seen and two more that you can't survive in yet(far below where you spawn at) however it seems like it may develop into something drastically more interesting-including if the biomes gain their own variation of biomes(currently biomes only represent a certain relation of depth) so I feel that this game has potential to develop into an amazingly fun game.

								First thoughts.Smooth movement, clunky UI, (guys I know terraria did the esc-key menu, and you don't have to copy that, but it really is far more convenient as an initial bind, get with it).Yay, maybe a terraria-esque game that isn't in dev-hell.  Or maybe not, time will tell as presently we only have what amounts to a shell of a game, and that shell so far feels so devoid of life I go out for 5-1o minuts before returning to more stimulating atsmosphere.  Hope to see good things, but at the moment If i want to play 2-d legos i'll use other games.			"

												Gameworld consists of giant floating chunks of dirt and if you go mining through them you fall six miles onto a pile of crabs that instantly kill you.The U.I. is horribly setup.The art in-game is quite ugly to me, and building is annoying and unsatisfying.NPCs in game are ""unique"" but they are so outlandish for no reason in such a ugly game the come across as if a five year old came up with them. If I remember correctly, the guide is a robo shark with miniture people for teeth and whenever you talk to it, a cringy audio cue plays that sounds like someone is flossing inside your ear drum.Reading other reviews for this game I see a lot of let down people and broken end game goals I cannot reach without dying from boredom or frustration due to the interface.

												The concept is good but the game itself is bad or I should say, there's not enough content and there's many flaws, the random generated levels system is weak, each time I'm creating a new World, it feels like the same previous World, again and again.There's few weapons, few armors, few creatures, few of absolutely everything you can name.There's just not enough content.I would not suggest you to buy this game especially since the developer has probably left it to rot.You should get Terraria, Crea, Signs of Life or even Starbound if you don't have already have those/one of those but stay away from this one, It is not worth it, It wouldn't even be worth 3$ Believe me.And even if it goes on sale for 1$ Do not buy it, do not give that guy money he doesn't deserve.3/10 The concept is good but the content is too weak and there are many flaws, not worth it.

												This game is trying to be Terraria with a lot more mechanics but none of these are intuitive. There is no proper tutorial, so you just have to figure it out for yourself. The mininig is terrible and all the minerals look the same. Beside that you cant see anything more than 5 blocks away, even on the surface, and all you do is die.			"

Product received for free
												Scam Alert! What a mess this was. They came out with a fun concept of a vertical based survival mining game and really goofed it up. Then when the chips were down and the sychopant chorus sang but it is early access it will be great when its done! They Notched it and released the buggy rough hewn work as a finished product and scuttled off with the dollary doo's. Yet another reason to never trust early access. A bit about the actual game is that you have to wait for machines to churn out recources you provide to progress. Then you have to complete dungeons using resources you harvested to access. Its a monotenous poorly scripted bullet hell that turns arbitrary resource gathering into a byzantine mess of mechinization and waiting around till you can get 45 nanocarbon fiber units or whatever you need to not die instantly in the next zone down. Remember: If the game is bad and unfinished after years of non progress like DayZ its never going to be done. If you buy a game like that and its got obvious bad spots where its poorly made has bad itemization or other red flags. Return it immediately!Don't buy these games as jokes, you only support more of this. Finally just wait for the version counter to tick over to 1.0 before you buy!			"

Early Access Review
								This game has been a great experience, it seems quite complex at first because it has a somewhat lack of tutorial and guide on how to start out but figuring it out was half the fun. I can tell I will be sapping fun out of this game for a while since there's so much content to explore and it's really tricky getting ores.. .-. But eventually I'll probably find an easier way to do it.I would recommend this game to anyone who likes to explore but yet build structures that link with eachother in complex ways as well as some simple functions that aren't complex.

												Boo. I bought this game cause it looked like the Legendary Game Starbound. When I played it, it was way to confusing and I didn't know what to do. The jellyfish and crabs are annoying and it takes forever to get good armour, weapons and XP. Also when I tried to download the latest update that was awhile ago I got a Trojanhorse virus multiple times at ""100% installing"" and it never finished. If you want a good game. buy Sarbound, it is x1000000000 times better than this dumb game. Needs tons of improvements. So just avoid buying it, for a looooooooong time. It may be better, when the sun blows up. That'll happen in about 4-5 BILLION Years. But that's a guess.			"

												PROS:Progression-I appreciate the progression in this game, it's not something where you get to end-game gear in one day. I still haven't got to the end-game yet, in fact, I barely even started. According to my character, I have learned less than 10% of everything you can learn in the game. Progression Part 2-This may seem grindy, but Edge of Space made this slow progression curve actually fun. They broke up the progression in a way where there's branches you pick, like armor crafting, weapon crafting, base construction and even pet creation, and there's 15 tiers of progression in each branch, each successing tier costing more knowledge points. Everything gives you knowledge points to spend to progress further, and the deeper you dig into the planet, the more points you earn. NPC's and Crafting Stations-There's NPC's that hand out quests, which keep you busy, some requiring harder to achieve materials than others. And on top of these NPC's, there's a large amount of crafting stations, requiring you to have some kind of base. There's also command centers, which provide power to nearby devices which require power. It's a neat system I don't see in too many games.CONS:(Let's be honest here, no game is perfect. So, let's get to the chase, and say the things I've noticed and dislike about this game. Also, keep in mind that everything I have said is my opinion)Textures-Quite a few items in the game share the same texture, like Soft Chitin and Penguin Explosives. These 2 items are very different, but they look exactly the same, and it's a little annoying. This is one example of items sharing the same texture, and there are a few more instances.Multiplayer-Multiplayer is a bit janky. When me and my friend played on a server I hosted, we noticed you can have only 1 of each Quest NPC in the world, and command centers (They provide power), cannot be placed anywhere near each other. So, what I'm saying is you and your friend have to share a base, or your friend has to live far away, and one of you has to walk all the way to the other player's base to talk to the NPC's. Also, the quests are independent, but at least the dungeons you can go to are publicly accesible which slighly makes up for this. But all in all, I was far ahead of my friend, and had all the quest NPC's, which ruined his experience a little bit, because we were independently progressing.All in all, this game has more pros than cons in my opinion, and makes for a great game. If you don't feel comfortable paying $14.99, then wait for a sale. I got this game for only $4.99 around Christmas, and trust me, if you think this game isn't worth $15, then it most certainly is worth $5, because this game has potential for hours of enjoyment!-KLuebbert			"

												I waited a long time to review this game, mainly because I don't like or want to contribute to negative reviews. I acquired this game in pre-Alpha back in 2013 and it was a rather RAW version of the game back then. The forums were kicking on the main webpage and wheels were turning with update ideas and the direction of the game. Fast forward 2-3 years and there is a lot of development, a lot of change, and a game that has been finished. There were many character wipes and world wipes along the way = That was to be expected. I bought it on pre-order before early access, and played for about 6-8 months through early access, so a few save wipes isn't a huge deal. However, I think another user said it best "" I think the negative reviews are born mostly out of frustration with how long the game took to get from early access to release."" Here we are three years later with a game that is no longer in Early Access but still has clunky controls and somewhat of a grind feel. However - it has come a long way, and if you came  here NOT expecting to grind in order to craft and survive, I don't know what you were expecting.I played some of the most recent updates and will update my review from not recommended to recommended, but with a disclaimer attached: This game still doesn't feel 100% to me. But, Terraria never did either - far from it - and everyone loves to compare this title to Terraria. Terraria was lacking in story line, direction, but had an abundance of content and playability with constant updates. This game is proceeding along a similar path, but a  year or so ago they introduced a Tutorial stage at the beginning of the game. Instead of the tutorial level - the game now appears to have something else, that exists more as a dialogue feature that I won't spoil.I""ll keep checking in on the updates as they come along.			"

								*Early Access Review* *Not final review*This game is a 2D mining sandbox game, but it's not a generic clone of Terraria, but it does feel like a clone. First off, combat only consists of guns right now, this is quite annoying, but the amount of guns is pretty good. Crafting is very complex, you can substitute some materials for others, but this also makes the crafting system feel slow and clunky, which I hope this is fixed later on. The developers update the game VERY often, and make changes based on community feedback, like an early access game should. I recommend this game based on sheer content alone, but buyers beware, it's early access, there ARE bugs.			"

												Most of the reviews point out the same thing, the game is abandoned by the devs. So why do I recommend the game?I had fun.The graphics are pretty good, the weapons and armor were fun to play around with and to fit different play styles the PIOS was ambitious and confusing at first, but does work. That said it, among many other things, still need work. The game never left beta and only did because the company folded. Bugs/crashing: I didn't come across any bugs. Not to say they don't exist or might be in the late game content though. Not one crash. Sure 15 hours isn't a ton of playtime, but that is still 15 hours without a single crash. (window 7 64, AMD, ATI hardware)Abandonment: Don't pay full price if you are curious about the game, wait for a sale or bundle etc. I have to say that for me, it was worth the money spent for the time spent and amount of enjoyment I received. That said though, I don't really want to support a publisher who leaves unfinished games to just cash in on. A price reduction is certainly in order.TL:DR - sound gfx and gameplay was fun but game was abandoned so any bugs/problems will never get fixed. Get on sale or skip. Or get Terraria.  Pleading to publisher or Valve: Open the game to the steam workshop and allow mods.Think of other good games like Bloodlines, it released with game breaking bugs that required community patches to fix. If the ambitious players could make mods that would allow for us to finish the game and add more content. Sucks that it is left to the players, but at least it would be something because the basis for a great game was left on the table here.			"

Edge of Space has 3 different ways to play, experience point and a large crafting system. It is well worth the giveaway price of $14.99. Also, it is quite different than Starbound and Terraria which I own and have spent many hours playing (Starbound 109 hrs played.Terraria 164 hrs played).			"

												Its gotten pretty good.An Information how to use science were great, but i figured it out.All in all a solid game, micro stuttering after 1 hour ingame, but it fixes when you reload the world.Didn't got far into it yet, only at Tier 2.Seems interesting enough to play a little more.			"

								I enjoyed playing this game.  It has a lot of work to be done to get to the final stages, and it's clearly an early access project but seems to be getting there.I got it as part of a Humble Bundle after having over-looked it so many times as another Terraria / StarBound clone.  While this is kind of true, the way they do it was in fact enjoyable.  Would probably recommend it to others.			"

												I bought this game a long time ago on that other thing... what was it... desura! pre-order kind of thing that gave me access to the demo. when it came to steam, I remembered that I bought it and started looking to see if I could get a code to import my desura copy to steam or if I had to strap myself down with another content management thing. I could! wonderful.The game plays well enough, its a bit goofy really. Thing is, its a bit under the radar as far as games I keep my eyes on. updates are always going on, and over time they really do make a difference, but somehow I always forget I have it. Then one day, I spot it and realize ""oh hey, thats a thing I have. lets see whats up. oh these are neat changes."" Ill play it a bit, and then get distracted again. Its a decent game though. It's been streamlined and improved quite a lot since I got it all that time ago.There are a lot of negative reveiws for edge of space though, looking through them I see that it's down to the devs comparing it to terraria. Personally, that was a mistake on their part. When you take game giants and start throwing comparisons around, inevitably people will become incredibly salty about it because ""WHAT!? THIS GAME IS LIKE THE GAME I LIKE!? LETS JUST SEE ABOUT THAT!!! WHATS THIS? THIS GAME IS DIFFERENT THAN THE GAME I LIKE!? *insert verbal abuse and hate aimed at others who do enjoy it and it's developers here*."" Edge of Space is NOT terraria, it is it's own game. Take my word for it, give it a try and you'll see.			"

												So, ill start with addressing the mixed views.. most of the bad comments you see about this game are from back when the game was in pre-alpha.. since then this amazing team has made this game beautiful and have really come a long way.. I should know I played this back before it was even on steam, but thats my opinion.  AND dont let my time played on steam fool you, trust me I have hours soaked into this game.Now for the pros and cons. -PROS--tons of weapons-tons of armor-lots of really cool mounts, such as SPACE RAPTORS, gaint crabs, mechs and gunships, even ones that help you build and mine!-lots of really cool decor and important building items-has a really cool power system in which you can root a power supply to your lights, doors, and even crafting stations.-a great number of really cool enemies to fight from flying jellyfish to polarbears with artillery cannons on their backs.-has dungeons with some rather awesome boss fights-3 types of armor, fighter, builder and explorer, each pretty self explanatory.-constant updates which always fix problems and bring in awesome new toys.-as is,  the game has a ton of fun content that will keep you busy for hours.I could keep going but I think you get the point.-CONS--You dont own this game-has a few bugs, nothing really GAME breaking, except for the UI problems, opening menus and such lag the menus out, this while really game breaking is being broken down on as we speak, so in a week or two you can most likely ignore this.-needs a bit more upbeat music, mostly for events etc.Well honestly thats all I can think of.. if you are a fan of games like terraria or starbound, or just a fan of 2d games where you can build, then give this game a go its great!  With the speed of updates and endless content they can put out for it im sure this game will keep going strong for a long time, once they fix that UI lag... good bye social life. "

								If you played all you could of Terraria and Starbound and absolutely love the sandbox genre of games then you will love Edge of Space. This game combine many of the elements of Terraria with an Edge of Space trim to it. The gameplay itself is similar to Terraria, but with a Starbound spacey theme. The game is unique in its own way. Game music is good, better than starbound but not as cool as Terraria. The game is more complex then Terraria and Starbound which can deter players who play it for the first time. The tutorial explains the basic controls and concepts of the game, but in my opinion, more could have been done to explain the game mechanics for crafting. You have to read your codex entries after the tutorial to figure out what you need to do. Once you do that the game becomes very fun to play. Explore, craft, fight... All is open to your disposal. This game is still in beta, the developers are constantly patching the game and adding new content. The game only gets better from here.			"

												Outstanding game!  Do not be fooled into thinking, you will be playing a new terraria or starbound.  This game feels more like Metroid with sandbox elements.  The Tech Tree is a amazing and the in game humor is something that kept us laughing all night!  We have not gone through the entire game but the random events and encounters have been incredible. Highly Recommended			"

I have been playing this game now off and on for the last like 8 months.  They keep updating on a regular bases and i feel the devs listen to the community.  Any ways go ahead get the game and be as confused as i am on the negitive reviews.			"

												This one is pretty hard for me to judge objectively, as it was given by a now-gone Significant Other.As such, I've desperately tried to like the game and pushed myself to give it more chances.Now, with that in mind - The game has potential. There's some really great ideas in there as well as a unique art style (Though given the size of the sprites, I can't imagine there's much modding going on with people skilled enough to pull it off).The problem is, as always, execution. Edge of Space feels very empty, despite its vast size, and there's not much to really  do other than ""Dig deeper, grind for better gear"". The controls feels pretty floaty, and the gathering mechanics tend to get very weird when you want to mine a block right in front of you. Their attempts at humor are dry and fall flat on its face, as I've come to expect of indie games lately. Also, on top of frequent bugs and crashes, the game also needs some SERIOUS rebalancing around the crafting system and output. Often times you will have to grind your butt off to get a better gun, only to find that the one after that is almost trivial to acquire. Enemy frequency and damage scale up disproportionally to your ability to defend yourself.So what DO I like about the game? The crafting system is quite brilliant - Much like the (newly released at the moment of writing) Fallout 4, you mostly rely on braking down items into basic components, in this case minerals. For instance, you can build a nice looking base with just some basic metal and dirt, no joke.Building is also a charm, as you can place blocks all over the screen without a fake limit. It's also quite refreshing to get a hi-tech tool from the get-go. I s2fg, if I have to deal with another spacey game that gives me a pickaxe, I'm rioting.When the game works, it can feel very satisfying.In conclusion, I cannot recommend this game, since it still feels heavy WIP, even if it improved GREATLY since launch (It was simply awful then). The content is limited, and it's pretty clear that the game is very much unfinished at this point. I've found a way to enjoy it, but without the intial reason, I would have abandoned the game for good.			"

												I simply cannot recommend the game in this state.I was trying to wait out for updates, I was trying to wait for the developers to come back from their ""logistics stuff"" that they've been doing for months (it doesn't take that long for someone or even multiple people to move), and the developers have seemingly fallen off the face of the planet (maybe into the Edge of Space!? lol, couldn't resist, sorry).Starbound did a similar thing where Chucklefish relocated their entire company, but yet here's the thing: Chucklefish at least continued to maintain their website, and actually continued communications with the playerbase. Since Handyman Studios posted that update in April (It is October as I write this), there hasn't been any communication whatsoever, except for 1 tweet that advertised the game being on sale somewhere.So, since this appears to be abandonware, I believe I can attach my own review of this game.Do I recommend it as it is now? NO.Do I think it could be a good game? YES, but only if the developers actually come back.Do I hope they would come back and make it better? YES!The game has a nice premise going for it, but there are simply too many things wrong with it to make it an actual good purchase. If you really want a tech demo to mess around with, maybe for inspiration or ideas, go ahead. I'd wait until it's on sale, though.So, Pros/Cons:Pros: -A nice recipe unlock system-Good graphics for a sidescrolling indie game-Lots of inventive ideas (pets, character upgrades, etc)-A unique take on the sandbox exploration game (you progress by going down)-You start with a jetpackCons:-Control/UI Bugs (your character will shoot their weapon or use their tool while dragging items around in the UI)-Unfinished game and obvious missing content (the last two biomes are not finished, some tech unlocks are empty)-Blah combat (you always feel weak as bleeep because your guns all suck, and it takes 10+ shots to kill anything)-Melee combat is useless-Cheap enemies that can fly through solid walls to attack you-Dungeons are buggy, some of those bugs were fixed in the last update, but some remain from what I've been told-No Real Map System (this is the huge deal-breaker for me -- you only have a ""current"" minimap of what you can currently see and that's it)-Somewhat clunky UI system (inventory management, everything freshly obtained gets dumped into the hotbar etc)-UI LAG. Yes, the UI lags when trying to move items around.Recap: A game that has/had a lot of potential but sadly fell way short. I tried hard to like this game, because when I first started playing it, I was like ""I hope they finish this game or make it better!"" But sadly.. it doesn't look like that will ever come to pass. If you're a game developer and you're looking for some inspiration, I'd suggest picking this game up on sale, maybe someone else can develop something else that is similar but way better?			"

I told them it was a very boring game and someone told me to replay it (as you can also see in the comment).

								For a early access game,this is already done pretty nicely,and they are still adding more things;even fixing things as they go along. My friend gifted me this game,and we played together for a while, it was pretty fun;I would greatly recommend this for single & multiplayer. Somethings aren't extactly balanced yet,but don't lose hope they should fix it eventally;so if you don't see much in the game right now,you can wait a while to see further development. You might like it a lot later in development;this game is really good for those who played Terraria,and it even has a Terraria based boss. (who turned off in the update we are in as of writing this.

								This game has come a long way. I bought in on a whim in my early terraira burn-out phase. Wasn't much then, but the developers have been working hard to improve the game and it shows. Countless patches later this game could launch today and it would get solid reviews. I recommend this one to anyone with a love for rouge likes and has a taste for the sci-fi our fathers used to enjoy. Outside of that, this is at it's core a mining/crafting game. Nothing special to remark outside of differences from other games in genre. Overall not bad compared to other offerings either when it comes to controls, content and depth. Sure, it's not on the same scale as Starbound, and nothing is as polished as terraira, but this game has character and immersion. The rough edges of this work in progress are limited to a lack  of good interface and general tutorials that leave much to be desired. I haven't truly logged enough hours to speak about end game, but I want you to know that I havent regret my purchase since day one (well over a year before this review). Check it out, I think you'll probably end up feeling the same.(Additional Edit: 4/26/15)I just wanted to update my review based on the current state of the game. I noticed recently that this game was at a ""Mixed"" review status. Please, if you are like me and weary of seeing such things before you purchase, give each and every negative review a read to make sure. This game is a work in progress. It should go without saying, but this is going to have bugs. It's going to have wipes. They are going to release patches that break, change, or completely destroy previous things. Accept it or dont buy early access titles. For what its worth; I still give this game the ""safe to buy in"" approval. It's a little clunky here and there, but they have really done SO much to improve the game. Its got everything one would expect from a game of this genre. If you're a fan of SciFi and Crafting/Rouge-likes, you would be doing yourself a disservice to not take the dive on this one. Its a solid game already and the Developers are VERY attentive and constantly updating. Don't let the mixed review status turn you off. From what I have read, there is alot of nit picking over what is a really early access title that, even after two years, is STILL being worked on constantly. Jump in, help out with the progress of this game, and enjoy the glorious Science!			"

								Though the graphics are a bit too pixilated for my tastes, this is definitely a fun game and I look forward to witnessing its evolution.  If graphics aren't a big concern and you are looking for a fun, replayable sci-fi game, this is a very good choice.  The game has a beautiful soundtrack and I went as far as to order another both versions just to get the extras, having initially purchased the standard package.			"

Early Access Review
								Game is very early in its stages but has great potential. This is like Terraria... but Space-ier. Although, there are not many servers up (that I can currently find). Game is a lot harder than most other survival games (like Terraria) that I play but is also more complicated. If you enjoyed Terraria or other survival games and you want a progressive challenge, this is the game for you.			"

												""Promise"" is what I saw when I got this game. My friend got it on an impulse buy so I had to get it too. So to out do them, I got the Special Edition. We couldn't even play together, it was so buggy, and it still is, after 1.5 years. Now, I'd be happy to overlook the multiplayer problems if the singleplayer was fun/even slightly entertaining, but it's not even terraria, it's just boring. The Special Edition didn't even work when the game was 'released', it just kept crashing the game. I wasted a 25 dollar giftcard I could have bought StarBound with, what a disapointing mess.If you want to see evidence for yourself, go to http://playedgeofspace.com this WAS their website where you could recive free stuff in-game.

												i had this game for some time now, been expecting updates and maybe even better changes!  the changes only got slightly better and nothing else was extended to go down further onto the planet, nor better items and that is putting it lightly.  my own opinion, i am not happy at all with this game on their updates.  yes the game is fun but only to an extent and the atmospheric ambiant music is quite nice, but i would love this game finished!  it seems the devs are incredibly slow to non existant to this game when it needs attention.  when i mean slow, i mean as fast as a rock can move on its own.  i don't think this game will ever be finished and i had my hopes up for it back then.  seeing how this game now gets a lot of negative reviews, i agree with most on what they are saying about it.  now do i recommend this game?  not really... but play it at your own risk...

Except the thing is the game is abandoned after that release its kind it, nothing new is gonna happen at least it seems like it. Nothing new for a long time now. if you want to play another terraria overhaul this is a game for you, otherwise i dont recommend it if you are looking for a game with constant new content updates, its not going to happen			"

Early Access Review
								Don't get me wrong the game is solid already,  but even at this point early access,  the base game just doesn't feel very involving.  You start out in a game with a spawn point and are given lots of blueprints to activate then craft.  Where I get pretty annoyed and usually give up is the whole downward scrolling aspect of the game.  To reach the first 'layer' of a surface, you need to drop down,  which requires building stairs back up to the initial block of dirt you spawn in to presumably build your starting base.   Getting back to the whole verticle scrolling aspect of the game.  Going up and and down all the time requires building lots of stairs and frequent use of your jetpack.  The problem is, it recharges extremely slowly,  resulting in a lot of time just waiting to use it.   Lighting is also trickier than in other survival games:  there's a few flareguns and torches to be placed,  but they all require using the crafting menu,  which is tedious. For example, to craft an item you need to select the materials you want to use first,  sometimes there's a huge list of materials you need and if you are missing one, you'll have to re-select all of them again if you want to try and craft again.   A lot of the time you'll find yourself in the dark trying to climb out of a pit of some sort, and hope you don't accidently fall further downwards to certain doom.Speaking of tedious,  everything just feels tedious to me about the game.  Mining is about as exciting as watching blocks smoke from heat before turning into collectable ores.  Crafting requires dragging a blueprint to your inventory slots, selecting the slot,  holding left click to activate the blueprint,  then right clicking the inventory slot to remove the blueprint.  This is just a typical example of how something is done in this game and honestly I don't feel like any of it is as intuitive as it should be.   Combat is also pretty sleepy.  You shoot enemies,  and they die.  There's no real weight to the combat and it's just not very gratifying.  Overall tho, the game does feel solid as I say.  Personally I just fall asleep trying to figure something out,  but that's just me.  Many will find the game appealing because there is much to do and there's a lot of content,  so if the aforementioned things don't bug you, feel free to dive in.			"

												Ive been playing this game for the last couple of days and i have to say that it is a phenomanally gameplay rich game filled with fun and engaging contenet.  Alot of people on here are claiming it is a Starbound ripoff but at least this game is finished and runs smoothly on my pc (with the minor hiccup here and there) but all in alli have had no game breaking bugs or crashes in my play time. As i mention there is alot of content to play with, one example is the ability to travel to dungeons changing the gameplay from a Terraria style build and crafting game into somthing a kin to Super Metroid or Castlevania Symphony of the Night. The gun play is satisfying and a multitude of guns gives a lot of choice to the player as to what they want to use.  Do you use the laser shotgun to blast your foes to pieces with a point blank blast to the frontal lobe? or do you take the Volter and electricute two enemies at the same time disintegrating there bodies!  when it comes down to it i would definetly recomend this game!!

Quests are just boring and happen randomly while exploring. Kill some jellyfish or disarm bombs. Repetitive. Pass on this, and stay away from any games they make in the future. If you want a good game with similar gameplay, go with the far superior Terraria or Starbound.			"

												After extensive playing of Edge of Space since the release I decided to rewrite my review.Pros:Sci-fi setting with a good intro video explaining why you are on a planet that’s hostile and heck bent on killing you.I love the sci-fi graphics, and the look of the broken planet landscape.Excellent array of items to craft, in fact, the list is HUGE, including three different sets of armor (each with their own upgrade tree), all kinds of different weapon types, and a lot of other things that give my love of farming resources, and collecting new, interesting bits and pieces, a lot of reasons to feel content.A very large selection of base building decorations, workstations, defenses, etc. And yes, the advanced items require extensive farming and playing the game to gather enough resources to make, which some might feel is grindy, but I feel motivates me to keep exploring and mining for “a few more minutes” and then turns out to be two-three hours of game time I didn’t even know slipped by when I glance at the clock.I’ve heard a lot of negatives about the user interface, but personally I see nothing wrong with it, and you can see it demonstrated in action via screen-shots, youtube videos, and streams, so it’s not like the developers are trying to hide something… If it doesn’t interfere with my game-play and fun, I don’t see how it’s a problem.Lots of biomes, and mobbies, and some good humorous moments.Tons of new areas to explore, and lots to keep you busy.Developers that are getting the kinks worked out as fast as possible, and they are very active and responsive in the forums begging those with issues to send them logs so they can fix any issues for everybody else.I’ve put a ton of time in and I am thoroughly enjoying myself, because I find the game both extensive and challenging.I myself haven’t crashed even once, and though I experience lag here and there it only happens for me after playing for several hours straight. My computer is an Asus Rog Gaming Laptop, win 10, and I have an nvidia card.The mini patches since 1.0 hit have improved the game a lot, in my opinion.Active Devs that really want this game to succeed and are willing to do whatever it takes — though they get knocked around a lot by players that seem unwilling to give them time to hear and fix any issues that might be present…Cons:The Lead Dev has said the game was designed more for multiplayer, so mobs tend to spawn in waves that can overwhelm a single playing character… After reading that bit of info, I was sad, because I look at these games as something I wish to spend a lot of time with soloing. Like in Terraria when I played with a friend he wanted to kill this boss, and that boss, and I wanted to just find resources. I never played with anyone again, though once I got to Moon Lord I lost interest, because I realized that fight wasn’t balanced for single player at all (my opinion).EOS needs some patches to iron out the kinks, and I bet my life SO WILL Terraria Otherworld when it’s released. Even Terraria has had at least a half dozen mini patches since 1.3 hit, and I don’t see anyone knocking Terraria for it… And Starbound will continue to see many updates and patches before and after its 1.0 version hits… Whenever that might happen — sooner than later, me hopes!Players rush to leave negative feedback, rather than logging the problem and helping the Devs get a handle on it. They have asked and asked for player input via logs, but some grumpy, unhelpful players would rather sink their chance at sales than help get the game working perfectly for everyone.The game is extensive and resource gathering takes a long, long time. And some ingredients are very hard to find and farm — like Penguin parts and even Headhunter parts, and though I love to farm resources, even I wish these dropped more often…Sometimes things feel unfair, unbalanced, such as weapon upgrades that don’t do much to make you feel like the mobbies are being hurt… I swear there was a penguin laughing at me at a Penguin Rave — it was hysterical, this little penguin dancing at a Rave as I’m shooting him, pew pew for half a minute…It seems New Players find the beginning confusing, and perhaps because the game is so extensive more time should have been put into a longer, more engaging tutorial, with an option to skip it for more advanced players…Final thoughts:Personally I’m enjoying my time in the game, and though I have a large library, it keeps pulling me back with that one more node feeling, and I wake up excited to play and find new areas and new upgrades, etc. Some might not like gathering, farming games, and if the game is balanced around MP, I think MP should have been a bigger priority, as I believe a lot of complaints have stemmed from the MP community, AND I feel us solo players might not find the game as satisfying in the later stages, if the game really cannot be completed single player (which I’ve no idea if it can or cannot, but I’m hoping!!!)

Posted: January 5, 2016
												Quick Review:Edge of space is quite a relaxing game. It obviously lacks of fun and ecxiting things to do but it has its simple charm of just simplistic things to do, I'm sure you'll have a good time if you don't compare to terraria and starbound. (unless you hate these 2D kind of games... why would you even consider buying this if thats the case....)Long Review:Lets start with describing what its missing and what needs to change. CONS:First of all, as everyone would say about this game, is that its various inventory and crafting ""pop ups"" are complete rubbish. They need to change all of these because has it is for now, you have to press around 7 different keys to open 7 different things that literaly take up ALL you screen. And btw it also doesn't pause the game so you'll be sure to be killed if you don't pay attention. So all this inventory bussiness needs to be sorted out. You'll also have a hard time getting used to this weird new crafting mechanic they use. Even though it isn't the worst, it sure is quite different... I personally don't mind it because it forces you to go out of your base and mine and kill stuff for experience. You then spend this experience on different types of weapons or armor. Tbh the armor and weapons they have at the moment are quite boring. There is nothing special about them so you'll end up just picking what does more damage and what benifits you the most. They will need to make each weapon type more special and more ecxiting. Finally the envirnment is also quite dull. A lot of what this game lacks of is just fun and cool stuff to do, to craft and to explore. There are some locations to fight and conquer, but there's nothing ""special"" about them... So now that we've discussed the cons here are some of the PRONS:This game has this ability to really start you offvery easily with barely any enemies to attack you at the beggining but has you go further down, the enemies only get stronger and thougher with chaging backgrounds as well. Not many games allow you to start off like this like this game does, and it really helps just to work out what you are supposed to be doing (cause thats quite hard at the begining).For the reason above, this means that this is quite a relaxing game. It has a wonderfull soundtrack to it which really had an impact on me the first time. I really managed to fully relax and enjoy the game with this wonderfull soundtrack. I also think the mining in this game is great. You are able to last as long as you want (usually) just peacefully minning away without some great powerful monster sneaking up on you. (lol I'm getting tired of writting so I'm ending here)I think that since this game is now out of early access, it isn't getting as many updates anymore so I wouldn't get it if you will be expecting more of this game for the future (although I could be wrong). I would say to buy this if you are looking for something out of the oridnary and isn't trying to follow the same foot steps that terraria has left so give it a try (when it isn't as expensive as it is wight now because it definitely isn't worth that much money, basically get it on a sale if you are bored, k bye im done here...)

Early Access Review
								Currently, the game is in VERY Early Access, without a significant amount of content or progression.  However, what is here is all good.  Edge of Space, unlike other games of this genre, is much more combat focused - collecting ""tech"" upgrades and data from the creatures you murder unlocks the next tier of craftables, which is a pretty nice change of pace from the genre staple ""dig downward to win"" scheme.How it works as of this patch, however... kind of grindy.  It's definitely in need of tuning (and the devs have mentioned it's going to get said tuning) but the system itself is a nice change of pace.What the game sorely lacks now is content - the core systems appear to work well, so it really just needs to be loaded with items, enemies, ores, and mores.

While I was unsure of how much i would enjoy the game since im not a big fan of terraria and even starbound to a point...with that said this game is far more action based then the other 2 and with that comes more enjoyment at least for me. If you are looking for a fun game that differentiates itself from both its compitors edge of space is the game for you.			"

												This is a boring game and overly complex. There are tons of games like this out there and I asume it tries to stand out with its falvor and all that. But I feel like the menus aren't well designed, the crafting and collecting is needlessly complicated and not fun, and all attempts to pull me in and interset me fall very flat. Oh and most of the visual design is at best messy.There are a lot of better games that are very similar, just get Starbound,			"

								I found the over all game to be overly complicated, a 2D game should be simple a great adventure and easy to pick up. This game has a complicated biulding system, an odd way of jumping, and isn't ovral fun. While i was asspecting like space terriaha 2, I was disapointed by jetpack guy with a mining tool.			"

								November 28th, 2014Picked this up during a sale. I own Terraria and Starbound but the latter left me burned with it's launch and follow through by the developers, but this isn't about that.I'd been interested in Edge of Space for some time and had it on my Wishlist for a couple months before finally picking it up. A quick look through the history of the games shows I missed some of the blunder years the game held and am playing it after a UI and tier revamp so I can't comment on anything prior to the date above.The game looks good, though I wish there were more customization items for characters, the style they've presented works well and I had no probably playing my marathon session of the game these past 2-3 days (17 hours) and the music is pretty darn good as well. Normally I listen to my own music collection during these types of games but I left the background BGM on and didn't grow to hate it. The controls are smooth as well and how you can move is really limited to your gear and how well you can control your jet pack, using weapons can be tricky sometimes however. The game has a few different weapon types in its starter tier from the basic automatic rifle, sniper rifle, and mortar launcher. I've found myself using the sniper rifle and mortar exclusively. You have unlimited ammo but there is a reload timer but that's not why I don't use the automatic, the main reason is damage and difficulty hitting enemies. I played exclusively in a local hosted server with friends and there were times were you can't hit an enemy due to their size, movement, and shots just passing through (most likely due to the server lagging) so we found more success with the area damage of the mortar and taking the risk with the sniper rifle.Crafting is pretty extensive as well. There are three armor types and many branches of crafting to ""skill up"" by using Science XP gained from mining, crafting, and hunting monsters (which is the best gainer later on) and unlike Terraria and Starbound the dungeons aren't found in the world but you rather transport to them after gaining enough coordinates to get to them. Once you enter the dungeon the rules change, you can't use your mining laser or jet pack. Having these taken away really changes how you go against an enemy as you now have to time your jumping and can't block or tunnel away from an enemy (or through a stage) and personally I feel is nice change. Unfortunately I haven't seen the dungeon boss yet as during the dungeon we had problems with the game failing to load or players games blanking to grey in the dungeon.Overall however, I am really pleased with the purchase and look forward to future updates with the game. It does have a learning curve and some of the UI elements are weird (I've hit escape hoping to clear a open menu more times than I can count, it doesn't work) but overall at it's current stage it's fun and playable.

												Its fun at first, but long term there isnt much to do and there are still alot of things missing (like bimomes on the bottom that are completely empty except for random continents). Better Bang for Buck than some AA titles, but falls so short of Terraria(which is cheaper) that i can not recommend.			"

												Review Updated as of 4/3/2016How far my hopes have fallen.This games started out with such great potential. Nice graphics, good crafting and world building mechanics. Even the inclusion of EXP and special in-world events! There were even going to be NPCs. Notice how I say 'were' in that last sentance.The Developers seem to have left this game behind. In December, they assured us that the next update would come out after they got back from Christmas break, but days turned to weeks, and eventually into months. No update, no word from the Developers, no hope for this game.The end product is a lot of good ideas that never got to see their full potential. The framework of a great game is there, but now it's never going to be completed.I had high hopes for this game, and I have no idea with the Devs vanished so suddenly. But despite my dashed hopes, I cannot recoment this game to anyone.			"

								I do recommend this game if you go into it knowing it's early access and not a complete game yet. That said it feels it has potential to be amazing. Starbound and Terraria had a baby, one where you think someone may have cheated on the other with Super Metroid. Controls and seem to handle well and be responsive, the issue is no real way to set up items to hotkeys so have to scroll through a list of items to get to the desired weapon/gadget. I assume this is something that will be taken care of at some point.  Environments looks nice and sharp, music helps sink you into the world,  and you start off with a jetpack. Not a easy game but After the little bit I have played, I'm sure it will be a great game.Edit: New patch added the ability to assign items to 1-8 =)  nice!			"

The massive scope of this game includes a robust and in depth Power system (PIOS) along with Atmosphere Proccessing systems places the control of the world completely into the players hands.  Incredible enemies inspired by some the greatest classic games of our time will have you gawking in awe.

								I really wanted to like this game, but as of right now.. I can't recommend it. The tutorial kind of sets you off right till they send you the the alien planet where you need to complete some objectives in order to go to another part of a space station. well, for me it was at night and this games lighting system is the worst part of the game for me. Literally you can't see jack and how the heck are you supposed to find stuff when you cant even see 1 inch past your character. After jumping around looking for stuff, how the heck should you know when your next jump will just rocket you 1000000 feet below to your death? nothing.. literally jumping around then you just die or fall in a 100 foot hole in the ground with a little fox with a horrible light that instead of 1 inch, its now 2 inches from pure darkness. So! right off the bat, I don't like to explore because everytime I leave something kills me or fall to my death and the crafting is kinda clunky. You will be mining a lot and the mining laser takes ages for 1 or 2 squares of dirt..... really....really... boring. So, I tried to enjoy this game and I think it could have a lot of potential, but after watching a youtube video that was posted 5 days ago from this review, not much has.			"

								Great game in the vein of Terraria or Starbound, but honestly it's quite a lot different. The art style is quite great and the newest update really fleshed this game out and made it a ton of fun. I've had it early access for quite some time now and was a bit afraid when the updates stopped coming, then all of a sudden BAM they put out the king of updates. I cane safely say this game is well worth the price especially if you like metroidvania exploration platformers. The interface takes some getting used to, but works very well once you do get used to it. It actually makes quite a lot of sense for something so far stretched from similar games. Really honestly give this a chance, it's got a lot of potential and they are certainly doing their best to make us happy.			"

								""Edge of Space"" is a construction/adventure game in the vein of Terraria, only in space!  It's a very simple premise, but somehow, as of this writing, the game doesn't quite deliver on either its potential or the intellectual legacy of Terraria, which great effort is put into establishing.The first thing to realize about this game is that there are some really cool ideas!  You've got a laser drill, and you start with projectile weapons!.  The graphics are a miss for me (I'll get into why later), but are certainly more detailed than Terraria's, and may not be as offensive to another gamer's eye.(The following edited as of 21 May 2015...)The game has vastly improved since my playthrough last year!  The general user experience is far less irritating than it was, and actually warrants my giving this game a chance now.What WorksThe game's crafting system is awesome.  Pretty much, the game is already similar to the ""Terraria Leveled"" mod in some ways mechanically, but the research lines are well-defined, and the experience amounts required to unlock a tier feel correct.  What's more the amount of things you can craft without a crafting station is great for upgrading your field arsenal (from what I've seen so far.)They fixed the guns to always hit.  This was the dealbreaker for me before.  Thank you.  Note to other game developers: in an action game, RNG-based miss mechanics are very very bad.  What's more the base tier of stuff after completing the tutorial is actually useful, which is nice!Speaking of the tutorial, it appears simplified from the version I played earlier, and is effective at basically teaching the game.  Less was indeed more!You can rebind keys.  This helps to mitigate some of the confusing keybindings in this game, and let you play Your Way™.What Doesn't WorkFirst, you still spawn on a sky island instead of the planet's surface.  I think this is a mistake, even with jetpacks being available immediately, because jumping into a void beneath your little sky island is too much of an early risk, that I don't think a new player wants to take - at this point, we're still getting a feel for the game and the world.Second - re-evaluate your default key bindings.  V for crafting and C for character are really counterintuitive to me.  While providing rebindable keys is nice, nailing a good preset will help this game immensely.  It was irritating to have to click the menu button every time I wanted to craft something, until I found the hotkey.Speaking of crafting, the way you spend XP feels incredibly clunky, and the increment/decrement textfield used to implement it clashes with everything else.  Since the upgrades are straight lines, not trees, why not just allow me to click an upgrade or a button on the upgrade in order to ""buy"" it with the XP?The visual style to me is hit or miss, but this gets into personal preference; if Terraria is a Saturday-morning cartoon, then this is Archer on Adult Swim, which is what I think they're going for.  This point may or may not be a sticking point for you; this ""Doesn't Work"" bit is purely subjective.  Some sprite mods or the ability to create sprite/tile image mods might be a good idea, though.The (New) TL;DROnce, I did not recommend this game; it wasn't ready for the public.  Luckily a few patches seem to have come and gone to help resolve that situation.  The developers need to study up on good User Experience (UX) quite a bit more, and take it as a lesson learned going forward - UX seems to be one of their weaknesses that they have to fight against.  However, the interesting ideas in this game seem significantly closer to fruition.I recommend watching this title more closely...			"

								Edge of Space (EoS) has just entered Early Access and is now up for grabs.EoS is in the explore and self-direct style of gameplay that was pioneered by Minecraft and Terraria. So if you're familiar with and enjoyed those games, this will be familiar to you but space flavored.If you've never played such a game, then let me boil it down for you. EoS is an action oriented exploration game where the world is created procedurally (randomly) and you possess no state goals aside from survival. You'll take your trust space pick and mine out a little bit of safety while hoarding resources to use later. Use on what? To craft bigger and more elaborate spacesuits, jetpacks, weaponry and gadgets.Except, it is beta, so how far that road goes is sort of limited. If you're the type who enjoys seeing games get bigger and more fleshed out then take a chance now and support the devs. Otherwise wait for the full buffet to come out later.			"

								Badass space version of Terraria. Graphics better but are more like SNES or Sega Genesis, so it still has that retro feel. Currently amazing even though it's in beta as I write this. Probably worth getting it at the ""Dirt Cheap"" special edition price, for an extra 5-10 dollars or so, but not sure yet. I am indeed enjoying it however. Ranged mining is quite useful too, crafting is simplistic, but it's a good challenge to get the materials. Night has been recently added to the game. The night could use a little work IMO. ( Without light you can see the background, which clearly has some form of light, [e.g. Stars] and your character perfectly fine above ground but when you look at the terrain, it's pitch black. Plasma torches are not hard to make, however you get one per craft. I'm probably overcomplicating; after all it's a video game. ) Once servers are running I'd like to have someone to play this gem of a game with. I recomend this if you enjoyed Terraria and/or would like more of a challenge and/or are into complex playing and/or retro looking games.			"

Early Access Review
								So far this game is pretty fun and playable. If you're a big fan of Terraria-like games, this is definitely something to check out. It's a good deal more difficult and it takes a lot more getting used to than other games of its type that I've played. The UI, windows, and keybar are kind of a pain to deal with, but I'm sure that'll be fixed at some point. It's probably the most detailed of these pixel-y, crafty games out there, but I feel like the game should be a bit more ""zoomed in"" so it's easier to see all of those glorious pixel details, especially of your character. All in all, I feel that this could easily be a hit for.. Whatever the hell genre these games are, but, of course, after it gets worked on some more. For the moment, I'd say that if you don't have Starbound, you should check that out first. But if you already own it, then definitely give this a shot.			"

								I bought this from kickstarter long time ago, during its ALPHA stages it was great and showed a lot of promise.They removed most of the enmies for a long time which was kinda frustrating as the game felt like it only had 3 enemis to kill. They made the world smaller and only go donwards direction which makes it really hard to travel as you cant predict if your jatpack can take it or you die falling. The quest are a good addition but mostly impossible as with the weapons you can get early they do 1 damage so destroying a craps nest takes so long you cant destroy it before time runs out. Same thing with defend defence platform, once you take the quest 8 enemies will spawn inside the defence platform and destroy it less than 10 seconds hitting it 15 dam per tick inside the platform.Also its kinda weird that enmies that hit it are seen in the game wilderness as non damaging mobs and yes they will even hurt you even thou they should not.The new research system takes far too long to get anything build. Even the basics. As you need to grind load of enemies to get 15-25 points in certain research gategories at random in order to advance it further which requires 1000 or more per level and enemies wont drop reserach date always when killed.Currently for some reason you cant even build the next weapon in line as its material tables are bugged and it wont allow you to put any of the right materials in to build it.Also the current weapon system is kinda sad as you can only upgrade your weapon and not really build more weapons jsut the one you have.Enemies can spawn anewhere, even inside you and they sure like to spawn inside your base all the time. You need to constantly clear it out.Enemies also tend to have so much hp that with your 1 dam pea shooter you need about 30 shots to kill one enemy and yo ueven have to reaload it slowly. Thou the weapons are made randomly if you are lucky you might get weapon with 2 dam.The lighting day and night system is getting an upgrade soon which is a great thing but at its current state it is horid. Black boxes that dont even fade in but appear instantly when night comes. Luckily this shoul be fixed soon but its been this bad for a long time.There are many normal alpha game buggs that dont bother me like animatiosn are the wrong way, characters spazzing out when looking up ( this will be fixed soon too =) ), etc cant craft things, de-sync at servers, etc.The developers are very active and have improved this game alot thou sometimes things have gone the other way too but currently I dont recomend this. This will prolly be good at some point but not yet. Consider buying terraria, 7 days to die, minecraft or maybe crea while you wait for this to pop up good.I will edit this review as the game updates, hopefully it get better. I really hope so.			"

								I'll start by saying that this game is fairly fun, but only if you like Terraria and Starbound type gameplay.  The game starts you off in the wilderness wearing some basic light armour, a jetpack, and a rifle in-hand.  Using your laser pick you can mine out the natural resources of the world, and using your rifle you can blast the natural fauna of the world.At first you only know a handful of recipes, so as you go you will build data disks to unlock more recipes and more data in order to advance even further.  Unlike in say Terraria, you don't know every recipe off the bat, and unlike in say Starbound, you don't have to deconstruct or kill a boss to learn new recipes.The game seems simple and easy, until you get hit by a random event, in which case you might end up losing all of your clones in a matter of minutes as an unrelenting anomally continually destroys you as soon as you spawn.  For this reason, it's very much recommended to upgrade your gear as soon as you can.  Good luck!			"

								I got 10 hours out of it, which is about the same as Bioshock Infinite, Walking dead etc.  Although its not near as fun, it seems to be only about 15% complete.  Looking forward to the upcoming patches and changes.  The islands need to be bigger and more frequent as I find myself falling through them and finding nothing to dig/do a lot.  Only about 5 types of AI who miss 100% of the time if you stand to their left.  The ideas there and I see potential... its just a bit early.			"

								A very enjoyable game even though it is still under its earliest of development stages.I currently have played the Tutorial and replayed the Tutorial, during three different stages of the BETA.I have also played the first accessible world Acheao and had much fun even though the BETA often changes things that can both make and break the game!Uniquely, everything has remained stable, everything playable, and the only problem is the bugs that are few in number and worked out with every update of the BETA.And every update has added either new items, craftables, creatures, events, or even progression forms.I'm enjoying the BETA. I will enjoy the game when it leaves BETA too. It is a lot like Starbound, but set in a different dimension with slightly differents rules, laws, and phsyics. Oh, btw, if anything, you can customize your character to be a human, space kitten, cyborg, android, as well as being tenchologically altered, influenced by a slime symbiote, and more, so it all ends up really cool with character customization! Starbound has its races, EdgeOSpace has its many bizarre character feature combinations, inventing your own race and what not is easy (its only aesthetic though)!I'll mention new things in my reccomendation as they come up... for now expect the occasional character wipe and the rarer world wipe as they alter and add things to the game.

												Edge of space is a waste of time and Money. The Crafting and building is ok but the grind to get the needed ressources for better equipment is plain boring and way to slow and the building Options are to limited. Combat is boring and there are like 10 enemys total in the game. Bosses and dungeons are ok the first time but the dungeons dont change and when you have to farm them for mats they get boring fast. All of that is topped with an unlogical research and upgrade system and a barren last biome.If you like a rpg variant of Terraria try Crea instead, If you have never played and 2d  Sandbox Platformer try Terraria. If you really want to lose 15 bucks i can give you my bankdetails, that way you at least saved your lifetime :)			"

								As a person who was hyped for Starbound, this game brings to the table a lot of what I wanted from it. While it still is very much an incomplete game, it offers a comfy environment to build your bases in and already enough diversity to satisfy my curiosity. If you enjoy fighting monsters, mining for resources, raiding dungeons with your friends, or just messing around then this game with its 12.99 price tag is absolutely worth it. If you have doubts, buy it now and wait for it to be finished. The team is giving regular patchs and communicating with the community.			"

								The game is good. While the art is ""love me or leave me"" it somehow managed to add some originality to the sandbox concept. We all know Terraria is the godfather of this 2d sandbox style, and while Edge of Space has to compete with other big titles like Starbound (F.e) for its own space in this genre, it certainly has that ""something"" that draws your attention for hours even if its to grind for new weapons or build something pleasing to the eyes.Give it a chance if you have the spare money, or wait for the full release. either way, even Terraria's creator, 'Redigit' approves this one.

It wouldn't even need to be moved, if there was a way to remove the tiles underneath it.The combat damage is way to OP, 90+ damage from flying jellyfish is a bit much.But none of the bad things listed should detract you from trying this great game out.

								Been playing for a few hours now, and it's really awesome the sheer amount of content that has been packed into an alpha game. There's a huge amount of depth to this game already. However, this does come with some drawbacks. Not everything is mapped out for you, and while this may not seem like a big deal, with so many branching options on how you want to progress in the game it can become overwelming fast. Some sort of talent tree system, or unified menu for research and it's current level would be a huge help. A wiki for this game is something that the community is more responsible for, but as it gains momentum this type of resource will come naturally. Updates for this game are seriously quick and seems to flow constantly. Be ready for new content or fixes often, and tweaks to things you already know. Yes, I highly recommend the game for those who like sandbox games, and especially those who have a friend to play it with. Just remember that starting out is tough, and the end rewards are worth it. This is no terraria or minecraft or any other crafting game you've played. This is Edge of Space			"

												Edge of Space has come a long way since I first started playing. Movement feels a lot better; I have fun just jetpacking around and taking jumping-trickshots at the wildlife. The last minute addition of an entirely new category of weapons (melee) is fantastic, and I really like using them. There is a ton more content in every respect; creatures, events, billboard tasks, crafting, base decorations, and resources.A lot of people have mentioned that it's a bit tough getting into the game at the start, and I would have to agree with that. Fineous's dialogue options help, but it can be really difficult deciding where to spend those first precious Science points.My best tip: upgrade your jetpack (fighter, explorer, or builder) and make a better primary weapon (phase or melee) first! Having an upgraded jetpack makes a huge difference to mobility, and the starter weapon really seems to only be there to get you used to crafting -- by making you craft a better one.All in all, I'm having a lot of fun. Thanks for the game and congratulations on release!			"

												NEW REVIEW: Better now, still tends to be grindy and non-intuitive. If you really enjoy this type of game and/or you play it with friends you are probably going to have a good time.  Still can't completely recommend it but I am more on the fence now rather than a full thumbs down.  Try it on sale if in doubt and you likely won't be too upset if it isn't your cup of tea.Note: very involved and hard working developers.  I am sure this game will continue to improve as time goes by.__________________________________________________________________________________OLD REVIEW:OK game but quite repetitive, crafting doesn't make too much sense, i.e. use dirt and make armor, crafting button instead of 'craft' label has a 'science' label,... can you say non-intiutive?.  Early access so game not finished, world and characters deleted relatively frequently for updates.  Forced limits of exploration depth based on equipment type, i.e. can't skip equipment and just build higher levels tiers you need to plod through each level of equipment.  Never seen the cool shark and polar bear enemies advertised on the store page, just crabs on speed, flying jellies, cyborg flying brains with beaks, velociraptors, and a few others, some weird ecology going on there.Recommendation: pick up on sale but don't expect much and/or buy later when it's complete			"

								For the game as it is right now is absolutely amazing, but I am a biased reviewer as I adored Terraria and liked Earthbound a hell of a lot.I have came across very few bugs and the game is obvious when playing that it's not a finished product (I think it needs some smoothing out with some controls and actions) but I have came across very few games that achieve this calibur of early access.Can't wait for it to be a full release with everything.TL:DR- My rate is 8/10 for an Early Access game.

												If you're looking for a game in the veins of Terraria, this game focuses mostly on combat.  However, the game is not finished yet.  It's out of early access, yet the ""final biome"" isn't done yet. You just fall down to a dark area with nothing but dirt, meaning that there is no end game.  So yea, I can't recommend a finished game.  And if they didn't finish it in early access, then I wonder if they will ever finish this.  Just stick with Starbound or Terraria.			"

Early Access Review
								Professional Preview (Italian): http://www.everyeye.it/pc/articoli/edge-of-space_provato_24950Abstract translated in English:Edge of Space is a promising heir to the 2D sanbox legacy initiated by Terraria, which introduces deep changes in one of the fundamentals of the genre: the crafting system. Having to invest your hard earned experience points in developing every single Research branch to discover their advanced recipes is both an incentive to explore the world in solo play and specialize your character in multiplayer games. There are bugs here and there, but the developers are actively supporting the game through continous patch deploying. We can't wait to see what new features will be introduced in the next updates: we'd like to see a compass that aims to your last bound cryopod or a geological probe to see what resources can be found in the area.Commento in Italiano:Edge of Space è un promettente erede della tradizione sandbox bidimensionale iniziata da Terraria, che introduce novità incisive in una delle meccaniche principali del genere, il crafting. La necessità di sviluppare i singoli campi di ricerca, investendo i punti esperienza ottenuti interagendo con l’ambiente, per scoprire le ricette più avanzate, aggiunge un incentivo a procedere nelle partite in solitaria e, allo stesso tempo, permette una maggiore personalizzazione dell’esperienza di gioco in multiplayer. I bug non mancano, ma le continue patch pubblicate dallo sviluppatore mitigano in parte la situazione, oltre a introdurre nuovi elementi di gameplay. Non ci resta che vedere quali altre feature verranno introdotte nei prossimi aggiornamenti: magari una bussola che punti verso la propria criocapsula o una sonda geologica per mappare le risorse presenti nell’area circostante.

								Rate of progression in this game is really damn boring. You can't get anywhere without spending an hour or two collecting only one material and find out you need alot ♥♥♥♥ing more of it. I found this games tutorial to be very annoying and confusing. For being what it is I can say that it can still improve it's just that I did not enjoy it. All of the special mechanics make building bases very stupid and taxing. The game goes too slow in it's own gameplay than anything I've ever played.Edit: Almost a year later and the game is apparently been released. One definite thing though, It's still awful.			"

												I bought the game when it was on Greenlight a while back, and while it has somewhat improved since then, there's still some lingering issues with the game.The gameplay itself is fairly solid. If you're familiar with other side-scrolling survival games like Terraria or StarBound, you'll be right at home. The progression system to be able to craft better items for your base and gear gives you goals to work toward. Crafting that one weapon that plows through enemies you were having trouble with is always satisfying, and having missions to clear out an enemy nest is a good change of pace from resource gathering.The biggest issue I've had with the game is the UI. Tooltips for players new to this particular game would be helpful. There are times when the screen becomes cluttered by the menus and crafting screens, and the screens themselves will become somewhat unresponsive at times after long periods of play.Regardless of the game's issues, which I hope can be fixed in future patches, this is still a fairly fun game, and it's good for a change from the other survival side-scrollers. Give it a look if you can.			"

Early Access Review
								I've put about 13 hours into it at this point, and I'd say that it's definitely worth it at the current sale price.  It's obviously a work in progress so there are things that are in flux and there are tweak issues (finding particular types of elements), and what feels like a memory leak (not confirmed yet...the last hour was getting laggy and warping, but the twelve previous hours ran perfectly).I admit I was slightly cautious about picking the game up for months because the art seemed a bit ""fuzzy"" (not as crisp as some of the other similar games), but didn't seem that way when playing...maybe it was an impression I got from early gameplay videos.Gameplay is close enough to Terraria that you won't be totally lost; though there are a lot more items to craft and there's more of everything.  The variety of weapons and the distinction of the armor, etc, are a plus.The world is alien and more broken up than Terraria...morea bunch of floating islands, some of which are quite large.  I haven't played it enough to distinguish layers and there is some environmental damage mechanic which resulted in the odd death when going to far down but is still a bit mysterious in its workings.Monsters and combat are more complex and interesting.  One thing I find interesting is that somethings are neutral under certain conditions and then hostile in others (sleep mode?).  You will often be in a situation where you have to decide how you will engage because indiscriminate shooting may aggro otherwise neutral beasts or plants that will jump in your combat and make your day really bad.There is a bit of silliness, but so far the majority of the game plays pretty straight...just had the occasional polar bear with jet boots thing but otherwise seems staple scifi.So yes, I would recommend if you like this type of sandbox game and are willing to do your own research rather than have everything spoonfed in one guide.<Note:  Reservations below are describing the current gameplay experience I am having.  They are just things to note and may be addressed tommorow for all I know.  On the whole, I am enjoying the game and look forward to seeing it get the polish that will really make it shine.>My main reservation is that, especially in such a ""complex"" type game with many concepts and crafting being such a main component, that documentation is sparse.  Of course documentation is one of the last things put in a game but even the community is really light in consolidated guides (at least in English...there are other language guides that may be more fleshed out).  This isn't a reason to not pick up the game but it will get a lot easier to play when you don't need to troll forums for basic game info (ie: what are dungeons, what do you need to go there) or how do you upgrade weapons.Other more minor reservations include ""Hmmm, I build this item and put it in my base...just what does it do again?  Perhaps pop up tooltips for placed crafting stations or maybe an intergrated icon to jog the memory.Ladders, or other ways to go UP besides jump packs.Some sort of ablative heat shield/air bag for when you jump into an abyss that is many screens deep.In the crafting menu, have another grouping ""misc"" for all items that don't fit under weapons or base items or any of the other crafting subgroupings, so that when you want to craft something you don't need to scroll through the ""all"" category to find it.An interface to show you what items you can make in list form all on the screen at once (and the ability to hide items that are outdated).  Sort of a tech tree at a glance.The ability to choose how long info stays on screen before disappearing, and the ability to configure what is displayed.  IE:  I don't need to know xp as it accrues, but I would like to know when I ding a level in crafting what new recipies I had without looking through the browser.I assume XP bar fills and you get no more?  If so, maybe some sort of on-screen alert so you know to burn that XP instead of wasting time doing things with a full bar.			"

I was just looking around steam when i happened to hear that there were new updates, ok so no i recently downloaded the game again and got in to it. After these updates the game is actually really fun. I have clocked in over twenty some hours in already. Unfortunately most of that was offline but you should really get this game. The soundtrack is also really nice and soothing. The bad things about this game include not knowing what to do. whenever you get tutorials take them don't skip them.

												Really awesome game, however you should problably wait a few weeks before investing in it. The game as of 1.0 is not a game that should have been released asl the amount of buggs and unbalanced elements is more something that you would expect from a beta version and not a finished product.The devs are however very active on both forums and with removing bugs so in a few weeks this game will most likely play as intended.

												I've played the game off-and-on for the last couple of years, and it is a fun game.  It's Terraria or Starbound, but with better graphics.  However, the content of the game, while not terrible, is still lacking a bit, and there's still a lot of work that needs to be done.  The recent 1.0 Release I feel was a bit premature, as they actually removed some content from the game with the intent of it being added-in later (hopefully not as DLC).I tenatively rate this with a thumbs-up, but I might change this depending on how it progresses.  I've heard some rumors that some of the planned content for the game will instead be released as DLC, but until that's confirmed I won't downvote it, as I have gotten my money's worth out of the game.The easy description of this game?  Starbound with better graphics but with less content.			"

								This game is completely awesome. Starbound was great for a while, but it will never have the ""chase the dragon"" addiction this game offers with it's leveling system. If you played Ultima Online, compare it to that with more control. You spend your mined resources on data for certain skills which allow you to build nicer items in that particular field. It seems very class oriented. There's like 13 skills right now as well as 6 stats. 3 armor skills and 3 weapon skills, giving you a fair amount of customization. Your skills allow you to do things like build different vehicles, different accessory buffs, an interesting spin on animal taming where you clone different animals that each have their own separate function, specialize in gathering+passive buffs, similar to UO Alchemy an entire skill dedicated to consumables, and even a cosmetic skill to make your forts look nicer. If these developers know what's good for them, they will continue to add more skills without changing the actual skill system.			"

								With so many ""mine, craft better pick, and mine some more"" cames out there you might expect that they are all the same, however Edge of space offers more of a survival gameplay that makes the game very interesting.  The crafting system alows you to craft an item without having the exact resource, for example.  instead of neading sand it might say Raw/mineral  which means you can use any dirt/metal/ or stone for this part of the recipe.  The vertical map design makes the gameplay more interesting as well.  The world is made up of floating islands of varying sizes and the dificulty and enviornmental hazards increase the lower you go.

So I got a new one and tried it out. Terraria in space boi. I somehow got anyother copy of the game for free. idgaf what other people say but If I were you I would wait for a sale before buying dis game. Just sayin! If you really want what this game says it gives, Starbound is a better option. But if you really want it wait for a sale. A summer sale. This summer sales its on 3.74 maybe you can buy it. I don't know. Or  If you really dont want to spend money on it come to me. I have a copy I would trade with you. 5/10 Would wander aimlessly again			"

												CAUTIOUS RECOMMENDATION:As of now this game has a solid start. The premise is good and the skill tree is interesting, easy, and fun to make your way through. The game itself is still a bit buggy, with framerate on a singleplayer world as if you were lagging on a multiplayer one. The UI also leaves you wanting something a bit better and easier to use. However, the developers are still putting time into fixing up the game so I am hopeful that issues such as the framerate and UI are addressed. There is also a drastic increase of difficulty as you move deeper into the world, as the enemies become much faster and stronger than you really have any feasible hope to overcome...which means lots and lots of deaths, a minor issue. It just begins to feel grindy and repetitive after the silly penguins and/or bears kill you out of nowhere for the 100th time while you are minding your on business.			"

												Personally, I like it.It's not like I played a ton or anything but its still all gud. I got it early when it was $12 and it wouldnt run on my old af pc. So I got a new one and tried it out. Terraria in space boi. I somehow got anyother copy of the game for free. idgaf what other people say but If I were you I would wait for a sale before buying dis game. Just sayin! If you really want what this game says it gives, Starbound is a better option. But if you really want it wait for a sale. A summer sale. This summer sales its on 3.74 maybe you can buy it. I don't know. Or  If you really dont want to spend money on it come to me. I have a copy I would trade with you. 5/10 Would wander aimlessly again			"

												Unity strikes again - well, it's not Unity's fault, but bad developers love to use Unity to inflict bad, unfinished products on Steam. This is basically almost a sci-fi ripoff of Terraria, it's a 2D platformer, lots of promise, no real reward.   They put some effort in, but ultimately a game should be fun.   And really, we've advanced beyond the limitation of PCs only capable of rendering graphics in 2D.  There's no reason at all to go for this.   Uninteresting, clunky interface, bland gameplay.			"

												CAUTIOUS RECOMMENDATION:As of now this game has a solid start. The premise is good and the skill tree is interesting, easy, and fun to make your way through. The game itself is still a bit buggy, with framerate on a singleplayer world as if you were lagging on a multiplayer one. The UI also leaves you wanting something a bit better and easier to use. However, the developers are still putting time into fixing up the game so I am hopeful that issues such as the framerate and UI are addressed. There is also a drastic increase of difficulty as you move deeper into the world, as the enemies become much faster and stronger than you really have any feasible hope to overcome...which means lots and lots of deaths, a minor issue. It just begins to feel grindy and repetitive after the silly penguins and/or bears kill you out of nowhere for the 100th time while you are minding your on business.			"

								Very, very alpha, beware!  Do not buy this game expecing to be able to play it right now.  There is a lot of content missing or outright broken.  Several portions are completely unplayable.  Additionally, there is no promise (there actually seems to be a point of pride) that the game as it is right now will even represent the game as it eventually will be.  That takes a lot of fun out of playing it as there are so many bugs that are game ending and the bugs may never be fixed as they might change the direction of the game before they get around to fixing it.Sorry, I can't recommend this game right now.

I have no idea what I'm supposed to be doing. And some things just don't seem to work. I got the Special Edition Sugar glider and it says that it's supposed to go find items for me...but the damn thing doesn't. He just sits next to me and does...nothing? I switched him for the firefox. Anyway...long story short, there doesn't seem to be a story and things are broken.

								There are many reviews that go ionto specifics about the pros and cons of this game, so mine is going to be short and sweet:As it stands, it is not worht the $12.99 I paid. I really want to like it, but it is clumsy, aimless, and unnecessarily challenging. A poor user interface only makes it more glaringly obvious that similar games are better. The art style for the characters is a nice touch, but the textures for the more common things like dirt and mud are ugly at best. The music needs work and there are some game-ending glitches. Wait to purchase this one until it has some polish. I wish I could say ""more polish"" but it feels like they haven't even started yet. I'll be going back to Starbound for the time being.			"

								This game shouldn't even be in early access. I just played multiplayer with a friend and with-in 5 minutes the game crashed. The in game window that notified me that the game crashed wouldn't even close. The Ok button doesn't even work. So you are forced to terminate the program to close it. I mean come on the Ok button doesn't even work. Other thing to know. Game is very unclear on what to do and how to do it. Many many many bugs.  They are constantly deleting the worlds you create so don't plan on getting very far before its deleted. So you are forced to start from the beginning again. You may say ""well the games still in early access."" Yes it is but that's no excuse. I mean the OK button doesn't even work. That's not early access that's just poor programing. They didn't even check to see if what they programed worked. They just enter code and assume it works with out checking it. That's why there are so many bug. This game has potential but the makers really need to wake up. It almost seems like they have given up on their own game. Save yourself some money and don't buy this. You will regret it. There are many way better sandbox games available that will not disappoint you like this one disappointed me. So sad to see a game that could be great frustrate me so much I don't feel like playing it anymore.Don't let the trailer fool you!! "

												Edge of Space game team presents nicely polished product. Proven concept of Terraria taken to space works very nicely. Constant flow of updates ensures new content as well as bug fixes and patches that are already polishing the game despite its early access. Content is already rich in current build, more biomes are coming and planned. I personally hope for linux support which is currently not planned but there is only minor thing as it was not promised in the first place. Sound part is nothing to be ashamed of. Catchy song in main menu proves this 100%. Graphic is nice and art fits the theme very well. Interesting design of enemies should be mentioned. Where else are you going to meet bear with rocket launcher on its back or legions of crabs swarming you all directions.Early access is a big thing recently and it's up to us, gamers, to drive it in the right direction by supporting the developers who deserve it and excluding those who don't. Very responsive community management of EoS to all concerns shows how developer-community relationship should look like. This is certainly one of the best parts of the experience. Handyman Studios shows how early access should be done. By very active approach they are building nice community and nice reputation.			"

Early Access Review
								EDITED AS OF VERSION 0.3765, 3/31/2015I was going to leave my old review below to compare, but Steam has a character limit so I didn't. Consider this first paragraph a big ♥♥♥♥-you to whoever implemented a character limit ON REVIEWS.Now, the actual thing.First I want to acknowledge issues I had previously that have been fixed, the foremost of which is the ability to craft better weaponry. The devs clearly listened to their player community on this one, replacing the old system with a way of generating research data and using THAT progress to create better guns (and better everything else as well!) The ridiculous placeholder drops on the second biome flora have been replaced with the real deal, and though I suspect it took me about as long to get there as the last time (seeing as I have neither x,y coordinates nor a map nor my old world to reference for comparison) I found the trip less crappy for having a weapon that can KILL THINGS. This is a major improvement over the last attempt.Some of the new tools available include better saws and picks. THANK YOU, DEVS. THANK YOU SO MUCH! Being able to mine -quickly- makes generating both resources and science xp (used for science) much, much faster and more reasonable to accomplish. I am also fairly certain that either the costs of chests (in terms of aluminum) have gone down or the availability of aluminum has increased: either way, THANK YOU AGAIN. Early game resource management sucked the last time, much less so now.Combat got more fun. This is partly due to the fact that I CAN KILL THINGS NOW because my gun NO LONGER HAS TRAINING WHEELS. Seriously, I cannot say enough how this particular change makes the game better (and I also cannot say enough how confused I am that the old loot % system was used AT ALL before, eminently terrible as it is: good change is good). The enemies feel overall a bit less the same, and I genuinely live in terror of those little blue bugs in the second biome. Guh.Now for the less cool stuff.Screen shake. Cool effect, but this (like controller rumble) should always have an off switch. Making it non-optional is excessively lame to your players.Weaponry NEEDS a key that reloads it that is NOT shared with another function. Maybe the R button? Just a thought.Disabling jetpacks in headhunter temples. This is kind of awful, honestly. I have the entire rest of the game to get used to using my jetpack to maneuver, only to have to change my reflexes in the more challenging parts? Where I would dodge basically without thinking before, here I am forced to remember a change in play that IS NEVER PREFACED while in the middle of genuinely tougher combat. Let the player use the tools you've given them in game. Let them think laterally. Don't feel like you need to take away one of the most fun parts of your game to add ""challenge"": execution challenge isn't satisfying. Depth challenge is satisfying. At the very least give some warning about the change beforehand.Weapon customization needs to happen. When reload times are long, a mod to make them shorter is muy bueno. When ammo counts are small, a mod to make them bigger is muy bueno. Not having this sort of thing to replace the old random weapon stats system? No bueno.Tl;dr, The changes I've seen are massive, and merit me changing from a not recommended to a recommended. Way to go, game devs! You guys genuinely fixed things that were broken, and what I'm seeing now is much, much more enjoyable than when I bought it. High hopes, guys.			"

								Played both Terraria and Starbound and I still don't know what to think about this game. Although it has some original concepts, it still needs loads of work. I would die for seeing the final product and I'd keep my fingers crossed for its success. Presently, game is rough, unsharpen and coarse.			"

								Its an okay game, but you have to figure out everything, and sometimes the enemies can get really annoying.Though it is much better to play it with friends, in my opinion at least. It is a great improvement on Terraria, though I still lean more towards playing Terraria; alone or with friends. Maybe if it gets some more updates I'll update this and maybe it'll be 100x better than Terraria!			"

												Edge of Space takes dedication to be appreciated. I recomment this game because I've grown to enjoy it after about 2 months of intensive in-game experimentation, but it was a winding road with a dull beginning.The biggest flaw with EoS is its glaringly lacking help menus. This is a significant flaw because the opportunities offered by the game far outweigh the amount of helpful information about the different tools and installations you can craft. This can lead to extended periods of aimless mining and construction that can feel pointless and frustratingly anti-climactic (I've been surprised quite often at how little I could accomplish during long hours of continuous play because of a lack of clear objectives).That being said, I've grown to enjoy Edge of Space very much. Here's a bit of context: you are dropped on a foreign planet after a spaceship crash and evacuation. Your codex (the help menus) is obviously incomplete and written very much like the entries in The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy: unfocused and essentially devoid of any useful information beyond vague hints at a distant purpose. As the player, it is your job to extrapolate meaning -and ultimately results- from what little help and guidance you are offered by your interplanetary employer.Edge of Space plays very much like the old NES and SNES Metroid games, with the added elements of terraforming and crafting. The bottom line is that once you've ""figured out"" the basics, the game works. Very well.So, provided you're willing to tolerate fuzzy objectives and the occasional quirks, you should enjoy Edge of Space for what it is: a wacky, competely over-the-top sandbox with a lot of potential and a ton of fun! And laser sharks!FREE TIP: Keep digging deeper. And when you think you've gone deep enough, keep going. Edge of Space offers a BIG world!			"

												While I recommend fans of 2D/sandbox/crafting games try this, I myself, could not get into it. I didn't like the graphic style, the music, or the collection mechanics of the tools. There are also some bugs with respect to dominating areas and getting credit for it. I find the quirky server startup in an empty command prompt which grabs focus annoying as well.Good game, not great for me... might be great for others.			"

(one of which doesnt even deal damage) there is always fun in exploring and getting meterials and i think this game will definetly be something great when it is fully released, however there are definete comparisons to Terraria and Starbound. however i do not think this game will ever surpass terraria, it is still a good game and great for all those fans of Terraria to see their favorite armors and bosses carried through to this game, its good to try but i would maybe recommend holding off until more content is released, but if your excited to see what its all about then i prompt you to try it, thanks.

								It is a good game, but it NEEDS A WIKI.This game is very complicated and a lot of things that are supposed to be basic, are confusing to me even with 20 + hours of playtime.Also, swords would be nice or SOME way of fighting close up... The moment you have to fight something in a tight space, you are ♥♥♥♥ED. And the guns- oh god don't even let me get started on the guns...Even with all these things, I somehow have fun with this game so I will recommend it. However, if you do not have high patience, do not play this game. It requires grinding and grinding and grinding which is damn hard because you can never hit the crabs. Even with a friend this game is really hard.I understand the game is still very early access, but I hope they can fix these problems soon so that I can enjoy Edge of Space to the fullest...			"

However, I bought this game for multi player use, and there seems to be no hope for a user friendly  multi player selection. That being said sadly i would rate this game now a 4 out of 10.

Product received for free
												I enjoy this game a lot, my standards were set low since i already had terraria and starbound, but i really like Edge of Space, it has an Xp element that i like, a nice detailed yet still stylized look and i have had no problems with it other than a simple fix error on install.My main complaint is something that the developers cant really fix, nobody is hosting servers, as far as i could see, which is a shame, since this game is loads of fun and with the Xp system, i think it could last longer than terraria or starbound as time goes on.I'd say buy it if you have the money and want it, the steam sales are even better, but i think the game is worth every cent, i only wish i had got the special edition just to send what little extra support i could.P.S. i got the game as a gift, and looking back on it, i should have bought it a long time ago for myself.

												I bought this game because I was looking for something along the lines of Terraria. This game teaches me to read the damn reviews, because it sucks. The controls are very poorly done the graphics remind me of alot of the old 8 bit games only worse. Even tho this game was super cheap(including the dlc) I wish I could get my money back. If this game was any more poorly done the makers would need to pay the players (alot) to play it. Finial piece of advice for anyone who reads this. Don't buy this game unless you are into pain. I mean WAY WAY into pain.			"

												I want this game to be good so badly. I really wish the devs didn't abandon this game, because it could have been so much. But it just feels like nothing. With the little reference in Terraria, even wanted me to like this even more. It feels too undone. There's way too much loading. The world feels empty almost. I would stick with what everyone else is saying and buy Terraria or Starbound instead.			"

												If you are looking for a review for this pice of garbage, then this is not the place.  If you want to read a childrens book than this IS the place.The sun did not shine.  It was too wet to play.  So we say in the house All that cold, cold, wet day.I say there with Sally.  We say there, we too.  And I said, ""how I wish we had something to do!""Too wet to go out and too cold to play ball.  So we say in the house.  We did nothing at all.So all we could do was sit! sit! sit!  And we did not like it. Not one little bit.And then somehting went BUMP!  How that bumb made us jump!We looked! Then we saw him stem in on the mat!  We looked! And we saw him!  The Cat in the Hat!  And he said to us, ""Why sit there like that?""""I know it is wet and the sun is not sunny.  Bu we can have lots of good fun that is funny!""""I know some good games we couldplay,"" said the Cat in the Hat.  ""A lot of good tricks I will show them to you.  Your mother will not mind at all if I do.""  Then Sally and I did not know what to say.  Our mother was out of the house for the day.  JUMP SCARE! But our fish said ""No! No! Make that cat go away! Tell the cat to go away!  Tell that Cat in the hat you do not want to smoke weed, it is unhelth my dear little babe.  He should not be here he should not be about.  He should not be here when your mother is out!""Now now! have no fear.  Gaben is here!"" Said the cat in the hat ""My tricks are not bad"" said the Cat in the Hat.  ""Why we can have lots of fun, if you with with a game that I call up-up-up with a fish!""""Put me down!"" said the fish.  ""This is no fun at all! Put me down!"" said the fish.  ""I do not wish to fall!""""Have no fear!"" said the cat.  ""If you fall and die I am sure someone will revive you, thats how it works m8"" said the Cat.And then the cat did stuff, it was lame, I don't want to type that all, I am lazy.  SOOOO,  thing one and two came out and saved the day and everything was fine and stuff and Blizzard plz don't sent me to jail for plagerism, I don't deserve that.  BTW this is not my story it is The Cat In The Hat by Dr. Seuss!  Ha can't get me now i saved myself, dunked on.  What am I doing with my life, ah well at least this was still more fun than playing Edge of Space, the game is bad.  RIP OG I though miricle could do it but he failed us all.  Hello whoever is reading this still, save yourself while you still can.

At THIS point in development, I wouldnt really recommend it but i think that if the devs fixed these problems and made a little bit more of a storyline, this game could be GREAT.			"

								Attention! Do not buy this game YET!The game is playable but unfinished. The game starts with this vague tutorial. Ofcouse, tutorials are there to help you in-game but this tutorial is kind of weird. A tutorial should show what is really good in a game. But instead of giving that to you, they give you this level of an depressive room I guess.The game plays laggy and unsmooth. It feels just like a flash game. Seriously. In the trailer you see smooth NPC's/Players, but when I bought the game and started it, it wasn't that at all. I bought the game to quick. I'm a really big fan of Terarria and when I saw this, I was completely sold. But I felt betrayed when I played the tutorial. Yes, it is an Early Access Game. But do not buy this because you thought the trailer looked ''cool'' or whatever . (Me) But I do see alot of potential in this game and I hope that the developers make a great game of it. And that is because I DO RECOMMEND this game. Developers , please make a good game of this.- Booker			"

								Dont get this game, get starbound instead. Even if this is in early access, it still has barely any content that is worth mentioning because of it's lack of originality. If you do actually enjoy the game, i would wait until its finished and not waste your money now seeing as how the developer doesnt frequently update the game at all.*EDIT*Gameplay-wise: The UI and the crafting are terrible / counter-inutitive, inventory management and combat is sub par, and the atmosphere is just boring and lackluster. Music is either just ambience or just music that feels like it is someone's first time with FL studio.  There are the usually bugs gliches here and there but that is subjected to change since it is in beta.			"

								This game has suffered mass criticism from players, critics and just gernerally people don't like it. I DO NOT see why people hate it...This game is great...Better than Terraria? Nope but still better than other side-scrollers and also you cannot compare it to Teraria as they are pratically two different games.First off, you create a charater, mine an awesome-looking female with a mask which screams ♥♥♥♥ off to any crab,jellyfish or any 'badguy' that thinks they can take a piece of me. Then we have the tutorial. I have read reviews where they say that the tutorial didn't help or it didn't give enough depth...well I'm sorry but you must be playing a different game. The tutorial has a video in the bottom right corner of the screen which demostrates how to do stuff and what you needed to do in order to advance through the tutorial. Yes I admit that at times the video played a bit fast so I couldn't keep up with the voice BUT there was text above the video so I didn't even have to worry about it.Once the tutorial finishes you are thrown straight into the world with little knowledge of what to do next. My thoughts were to build a base...Captain Obvious here...Digging is simple, just like other games, and it wasn't long before I had a decent amount of materials in order to make a base. Now I had two options, Build it in the sky surrounded by jellyfish or on the ground overrun with plants and creepy crawleys. My choice...the sky. Now I'm not going to run it for you...Try the game you will like it. The ideas that are in this game are truely awesome...There are different guns and ones I would of never thought of such as the Ark Light which shoots torches for quick and easy light...'Oh boy I wish that was in Terraria' was said a few times.Good side-scroller...CheckGood ideas...CheckFlaws...a few but none ruined the experienceGame of the year...Maybe not but still goodTerraria or Edge of Space...Terraria but I'm am still a devoted fan This game will grow...New patches often...New features...Yes I've played only an hour or so but my first hour was a good experience so here's to the next 2218947947918 hours of my life :D			"

												8/10-don't trust the current steam rating, the majority of the negative reviews are 1-2 years old, this game deserves at least a 80% rating. (imho)-fresh outta EA, this games has a few little bugs here and there, which is only natural. but there's certainly nothing game breaking.-unlike other devs, you can be sure that these guys will fix bugs within a reasonable time and answer 99% of your questions in the forum.-similar to terraria and minecraft, this game won't hold your hand: there are some npcs and a in game guide (codex) that give you some hints, but quite a few things you'll have to figure out by yourself, so at least bring a IQ of 80 with you.-taking terraria as a reference value, EoS does some things better (again, imho):--> better ambiente: mainly due to the excellent in game music, EoS feels beautifully melancholic and mature without being depressing, it makes you thoughtful. coming back to terraria, you'll figure yourself on a happy LSD trip.--> better in game music (see above).--> placing tiles works smooth and easy from the beginning.--> beautiful art style, and it gets even more beautiful the deeper you go, especially the individual zone backgrounds!--> devs are 10/10 straight.--> progression is more versatile: get exp, spend in many different tech trees, find hidden stat upgrades in the world, random stats and bonuses for weapons.--> you can fly from the getgo with a jetpack, yay! (watch your fuel though!)Keep in mind: Overall, Terraria in it's current state is better, naturally. Terraria started this whole 2d sandbox genre: Due to a astronomically higher budget and a longer development time, you can't really beat it. If you played Terraria ad nauseam though, if you want to play something similar yet in many ways different, get EoS.			"

								I like Edge of Space a lot. It's not my faovrite 2D sandbox but it's up there. I think it's the Devs that make playing and supporting Edge of Space worth it in the end. I have not played much Edge of Space because I have a new thing where I don't play early release game. I only give them a test run and either pass or fail them or sometimes give them more time. I did not vote positive or negative on edge of space back in the day. But I felt the game was pretty bad! But I knew it would get better. And I have watched 30 or so hours of the game in recent updates and now I can safely say that I love Edge of Space and it's great being able to listen to the Devs and see how they take both positive and negative feedback and work to improve the game.

								I'm giving this game a recomend.Keep an eye on this game. I enjoy it, and I believe it will be a really good game when it's finished.I don't usually write reviews for early access games, but I'm giving this a positive because it has so many unjust downvotes from people who didn't give the game a chance. I believe the review system as-is doesn't quite work for early access games and needs a redesign that would be more fair to the product and it's changes over time (or lack there-of) and the reviewers who give their opinion.The biggest positives of this game:If it has a bug, the devs will fix it as quickly as possible.They update the game regularly.The devs really listen to the feedback, and replies from the community managers and devs themselves are often.I enjoy the game and the gameplay. This one is last because it's an early access game that is unfinished and somewhat unpolished, but I'm positive this game will keep getting better and better (as it already has been), and it will actually reach a 1.0 version and players will be happy with it.

												This game is ready for primetime and worth the cost, with active developers who have made a fun project.If you like Terraria, you might like this - it's not as crazy-full of content, but it doesn't have the benefit of time and money that Terraria has had.  It's fun and different enough from Terraria that it presents some unique value.There are a couple cons: balancing and game progression.  You get relatively little guidance in the overall 'purpose' of the game - what you're trying to accomplish, all the features, crafting progression, etc.  This can be annoying, especially absent a robust wiki which Terraria possesses.  Moreover, the damage done by enemies is all over the scale, and it's hard to predict how a particular tier of armor will prepare you for the next group of baddies.  Right now it feels like enemies can swarm very quickly and do crazy amounts of damage quickly.			"

Early Access Review
								Since I first started playing EOS I have noticed a ton of improvement.  The game gets regular updates and the devs are very involved with the community here on Steam.  One thing I really enjoy about EOS is the multi-leveled crafting.  Each resource is needed from the start to the end, so I don't feel as though I'm waisting my time gathering dirt, mud and rock on the way to the more valuable resourses.  You unlock new crafting opportunities by earning XP.  With this XP  you can ""buy"" data.  The data (once you get enough) gives access to better equipment.  I really like this system, I'm hoping that this is the one the devs settle on.  There are a few frustrating things about the game, such as the amount of time required to gather resourses for the equipment you need to progress.  Also, much like Terraria, the player is super vulnerable at the start of the game (this can lead to much frustration for players not accustomed to this type of game). The issue I struggle with the most is the lack of direction in the game.  The crafting is so much fun, but I have no idea what certain resourses are for or how some of the better equipment is crafted.  If you get too lopsided with buying data from one or two catergories you will be totally lost.  Make sure you unlock the data evenly to avoid any problems.In conclusion, I totally recomend EOS.  I remember being frustrated as hell when playing Terraria after it first came out, but as time went along and I slowly learned new things the game became really fun.  I am 100% convinced that EOS is offering the same type of experience, who knows, maybee it will be even better than Terraria when all is said and done.			"

								Updated review from my last one.In my previous review I stated how bad this game was and how it seemed to be going nowhere. It felt amateurish and pointless. The tutorial was vague and taught very little.That was at the beginning of the year and I recently reinstalled the game to see what was new and if things have improved. I'd like to talk about these changes after some brief gameplay:The first impression that I got was that the tutorial is way better. They aren't always necessary for this kind of game, but before I was baffled on how to build things, now I know. Immediately you are given a gun, fairly weak, but it does the trick, whereas before there seemed no way to kill enemies other than using the mining laser on them or the plasma saw or whatever it was.So what do I think now? Alot better, my hat is off to you guys for improving upon a royal mess. Not perfect, but still not released. At this rate of improvement I am confident, however, that things will get ironed out.Some minor problems:For some reason the install for a game of this type and look is enormous. 1.5 gb download and 3gb disc space. Where it all goes, I'm unsure, but as the art seems to be bitmap and bitmap has large file sizes, I'm inclined to think that it is that.Screen tearing is quite bad.Bloody snails pushing me around. Probably by design but annoying.The worlds seem extremely small. Could perhaps do with you being able to go to other planets or at least make the worlds alot bigger.Overall, my opinion has swayed. I see potential in this game and I am impressed with the improvements. Keep up the good work.			"

You unlock new crafting opportunities by earning XP.  With this XP  you can ""buy"" data.  The data (once you get enough) gives access to better equipment.  I really like this system, I'm hoping that this is the one the devs settle on.  There are a few frustrating things about the game, such as the amount of time required to gather resourses for the equipment you need to progress.  Also, much like Terraria, the player is super vulnerable at the start of the game (this can lead to much frustration for players not accustomed to this type of game). The issue I struggle with the most is the lack of direction in the game.  The crafting is so much fun, but I have no idea what certain resourses are for or how some of the better equipment is crafted.  If you get too lopsided with buying data from one or two catergories you will be totally lost.  Make sure you unlock the data evenly to avoid any problems.In conclusion, I totally recomend EOS.  I remember being frustrated as hell when playing Terraria after it first came out, but as time went along and I slowly learned new things the game became really fun.  I am 100% convinced that EOS is offering the same type of experience, who knows, maybee it will be even better than Terraria when all is said and done.			"

Early Access Review
								Updated review from my last one.In my previous review I stated how bad this game was and how it seemed to be going nowhere. It felt amateurish and pointless. The tutorial was vague and taught very little.That was at the beginning of the year and I recently reinstalled the game to see what was new and if things have improved. I'd like to talk about these changes after some brief gameplay:The first impression that I got was that the tutorial is way better. They aren't always necessary for this kind of game, but before I was baffled on how to build things, now I know. Immediately you are given a gun, fairly weak, but it does the trick, whereas before there seemed no way to kill enemies other than using the mining laser on them or the plasma saw or whatever it was.So what do I think now? Alot better, my hat is off to you guys for improving upon a royal mess. Not perfect, but still not released. At this rate of improvement I am confident, however, that things will get ironed out.Some minor problems:For some reason the install for a game of this type and look is enormous. 1.5 gb download and 3gb disc space. Where it all goes, I'm unsure, but as the art seems to be bitmap and bitmap has large file sizes, I'm inclined to think that it is that.Screen tearing is quite bad.Bloody snails pushing me around. Probably by design but annoying.The worlds seem extremely small. Could perhaps do with you being able to go to other planets or at least make the worlds alot bigger.Overall, my opinion has swayed. I see potential in this game and I am impressed with the improvements. Keep up the good work.			"

												This game is ready for primetime and worth the cost, with active developers who have made a fun project.If you like Terraria, you might like this - it's not as crazy-full of content, but it doesn't have the benefit of time and money that Terraria has had.  It's fun and different enough from Terraria that it presents some unique value.There are a couple cons: balancing and game progression.  You get relatively little guidance in the overall 'purpose' of the game - what you're trying to accomplish, all the features, crafting progression, etc.  This can be annoying, especially absent a robust wiki which Terraria possesses.  Moreover, the damage done by enemies is all over the scale, and it's hard to predict how a particular tier of armor will prepare you for the next group of baddies.  Right now it feels like enemies can swarm very quickly and do crazy amounts of damage quickly.			"

								Mixed is not true... Simple and plain. If you have been with these developers as long as I have been so far, you would know that the developers are going to make this game better then Terraria has been. Dont get me wrong by any means, Terraria is a AMAZING GAME. But this one shows so many new great changes in the games function. Edge of Space comes with great function and it also has gotten a great face lift from its game friend Terraria. Yes. I only have 1.1 hours on the game. Dont let that fool you; I have many hours on Terraria and have been comparing changes between them. The game still shows much progress and they have not even hit 1.0v. The tutorial is one of the best early access tutorials I have seen yet with very few bugs if any now.  Don’t let the mixed reviews throw you off too much. Early access game with this much function is nothing to be mixed about. This game will be a good one.			"

								Edge of Space just does not even come close to being a decent game. In beta for a while now nothing seems different, it feels like someone just ate terraria and starbound and barfed them back up with some crap GI joe action figures they ate as kids. I have tried a few times over the months and I cant see this game becoming an outstanding game. Maybe I will be wrong which I hope I am, because at this point I have paid for something that is just as good to me as a banana peel in the garbage bin. How the terraria guys even let them put some of their content into this game is beyond me its really not that fun. Go get starbound thats in early access and it is a joy to play. This game just does not have what it takes to be an amazing game.			"

								Overall I would definitely recommend this game, as of the writing of the review the game is still in Early access so i can only imagine it growing into a HUGE game, if your not to sure as to whether you should buy this yet then definitly keep it on your wishlist or follow it,I have just bought this for myself today, played a total of about 2 hours on it so far and still just learning the basics, in my opinion it does have a steep learning curve, its a game that you have to plan what your doing ahead of where you currently are, the restrictions on the crafting can seem abit unfair at times (its just making you explore more and be more active in the world your on), unlike some similar games it does have a backstory meaning it can be good for beginners and advanced players alike. Also for those wondering if they can run it, I have a pretty basic set-up that ive ran it on; 2.0ghz quadcore processor with AMD Radeon 8400 on board graphics and 6gb of ram, i can get a solid 30FPS most of the time (trees falling causes a small amount of lag,)  "

								Full disclosure, I got this game in a Humble Bundle, I did not purchase it for this game. Now, I just have to say, in the smidget of time I've put in, I knew it wasn't a game I was going to ever play. The animations are clunky and the art just isn't great for that ""retro style"" devs have been shooting for. The user interface is terrible, the tutorial is obnoxious, and window placement is not efficient.I know, I know, it's an early access game, BUT this has been early access for over 2 years now. How much longer would you be willing to wait for a game? When games are announced at E3 are you still interested 2 years+ later?			"

												So first off, let's just say I don't particularly like this game. And when I say that I don't like this game, I mean that I really don't like this game.I got this game on release day, installed it on release day, played around 2 hours on release day. It was a weird experience to say the least. I think that pretty much everyone who picked up this game on release day was expecting something that was literarily just ""terraria in space"". This game is anything but that. From a terraria perspective, the characters are a weird size, seeming just too big. The game is similar to starbound with the way you mine and build things, but starbound just feels more complete. The game has a weird graphics style that just doesn't quite complete. It seems a bit rough around the edges. I am not saying that no one could love it, just that I can't. If you own Terraria and want a similar experience, then get Starbound. ""But I already have Starbound"" you say? Wait for an update to Terraria and then you will be right.If you own Startbound and want a similar experience, then get Terraria. ""But I already have Terraria"" you say? Wait for an update to Starbound and then you will be right.I cannot recommend this game for the simple reason of there are already games out there that do everything this game does but better; want a great 2D building/exploring/sandbox experience? Get Terraria. Want a great 2D space building/exploring/sandbox experience that isn't quite complete, but still great?. Get Starbound. Want some weird space thing? Get Defy Gravity.P.S. Just as a warning for this game, there are save wipesP.P.S. I have also played this game since release day, enough to find form valid arguments about this game.			"

								This review is based on the December 2014 version of the game.  As it currently stands, it holds alot of promise, but suffers from usability problems.  For example. there is nothing you can do with your old gear - when you make new equipment, you can't salvage or sell your old items that are no longer useful, you have to delete them (or store them if you're a pack rat).  Also, the UI is still pretty rough - some recipe names don't match up to what they create.  This is a problem when you are trying to figure out where the 'crafting bench 1' recipe is, because its actually the 'computerized work bench' recipe.Overall its decently fun, but the clunkiness of the UI drove me to give up on figuring out what I needed to do next.

								Fun if you like buggy Beta games. For a 3 month period or so, i couldn't even load the game without it CTD! The dev's fixed that, but it's still a long march to the finish it seems. Oh hey guys, Terreria content! C'mon, get some original ideas for Christ's sake! Pixelated avatars and a big skull boss do not make me want to re-install. Cool original content, maybe, but not re-hashed ideas borrowed from another game, pshhh! ******MMORPG.com - Best Indie RPG at PAX East 2014****** <--- this bothers me, because it's NOT an RPG, and it's being rated by an MMORPG report, which furthers my distain. Firstly, it's a sandbox crafting game, with zero RPG elements. Sorry, but being in control of an avatar does not constitute, otherwise EVERY game would be an RPG. And just because you can augment items does NOT mean it's an RPG, nor is that even an element. That being said, NOT AN RPG, and it's certainly not the best, and I'm sure there were dozens at PAXE2014 lol. In order for it to be a Role Playing Game, there needs to be an implemented stroy line with varried choices offered to allow alternate paths of progression.			"

												Disappointing. I wouldn't recommend to friends.The release version of the game feels more like a version that should be releasing on to Steam Early Access for the first time, to go through those last few months of finishing, polishing and feedback before actual release. It still feels in a rather ""beta"" state, which is disappointing for a game that's already been in Early Access for two years.For instance rockets are represented in the player's inventory UI as an ammo type, but there is actually no weapon that requires it, nor any recipe to make it. An unfinished stub of a feature like this shouldn't be left in the release version, it's misleading and cringingly ""beta"".I wanted to like it, I like the genre and loved Terraria. I wouldn't have stuck with playing this for so long if I didn't, and I like some of what it does differently. I could list other problems I perceive with it, but instead I'll just say that overall It's a disappointment, and probably needs another year in the oven.Edit: It's been over a year since I posted my review, and a year since the last minor patch. It doesn't seem like we can expect any major patches, and I don't think the game will ever reach a state that I could consider finished, so my recommendation is unlikely to change.			"

The UI and gameplay changes so often it's like your trying a new game every month... that glitches and falls apart within minutes. (yea yea beta blah blah, how long are you allowed to stay in beta/early release?) ""Terraria"" feels finished, ""Edge of Space"" looks like it's in its first  stages, but sadly it's not. The game promises a lot of potential, but it just looks awful. There are numerous amounts of graphical glitches and things that just seem out of place. The H.U.D. and game mechanics are just.... awful. Skip this one for now, until then check out ""Starbound"".(Notice how I didn't wait 1-2 hours to write my review?)			"

												First review:Played 15 minutes and had enough.More a chore than a game. Graphics are poor and over saturated, gameplay is clunky and the inventory system is a pile of s♥♥♥.Second review:After my first review the developer sent me a message asking what I didn't like and saying that maybe I haven’t played enough to like it. Well guess what… I played it again (another 15 minutes). The game should be enough and shouldn’t be so needy to rely in the codex. Is a real pain to read that much instructions for something so simple… find stuff then build stuff.The game is derivative, is like the Frankenstein of games but in a bad way. The graphics are just wrong… “Hey lets draw one sprite that make no sense and is not iconic and multiply it all across the screen, no matter if nobody understands what that is.”Very poor move making enemies harder just because you go deeper... lack of imagination.On the bright side it has a lot of funny bugs like the moonwalking and how the whole screen trembles whenever you try to pass through a gap in a wall.By the way the collision system is a complete mess, it reminds me the game CheetahMen form Action 52’s for NES.For those who don’t know what CheetahMen is (or what NES is…) here it is:

								Fantastic Terraria replicate, its got a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ of stuff to do even now just in early access. My favorite part is probably how awesome and unique all the block textures look, you can really go for just how you want your shelter to look and it makes the building an actually interesting aspect of the game unlike terraria. Cool game would reccomend.			"

Early Access Review
								Note: This review is only for the game as of 8/2/2014The big drawback for this game is the user interface (which is so bad that I gave up after less than an hour, hence the lack of play time). At its current condition, the UI is far too complex and spread out to be used effectively. There's something like 5-10 different 'windows' that you can bring up, each with their own UI's and submenus, all of which the player must navigate in order to effectively play the game. Did I mention that the windows can only be brought up by hotkey, and have no onscreen hint as to which hotkey brings up what?Compare this to similiar games such as Starbound,  Terraria and Minecraft, which are far more streamlined in terms of UI. Starbound is the most complex out of the three, but even that has only a couple of ""main"" user windows - the inventory/equipping/status menu, and the crafting menu. Minecraft has a similar setup, with a combined inventory/equipping window and a crafting window, plus some other assorted windows depending on gameplay style. Terraria has only one ""window"", which is the inventory/crafting/equipping/status overlay that is accessed via the escape key.The graphics are ok, and the gameplay is nice, but unless the user interface gets a rework, I wouldn't recommend playing this game - you'll be stuck navigating windows, menus, and submenus half the time.

Early Access Review
								First off, this game is amazing even though I haven't played it recently so I don't understand why there are bad reviews. I hardly ever write a review but I felt this game is worth my time reviewing. With all the new updates, I am actually going to set out some free time to play it again. In fact, I enjoyed this game even before all the big updates and patches were made (wipes included).  It is similar to Terraria in the aspect of genre but uniquely different in terms of content. Edge of Space speaks for itself what it's about (almost). You are an alien thrown into an unknown ""world"". Whether it was a planet or on an asteroid, even I'm not quite sure. Everyone complains it's hard to grasp but there is a tutorial at the beginning which I happened to accidentally skipped. Even so, I didn't find the game entirely hard to follow if you know the basics: collect materials, build a house/base, kill monsters, etc. Not to mention all the cool pets and mounts you can create. Come on...a laser to collect materials and space guns?! Jet packs to fly! It really sticks to the sci-fi feel. Oh, I would also like to add I love how smooth the movements are in this game.The challenge is in figuring how everything works and the satisfaction when you do. Since last time that I played, the only thing I really would complain about is how each character was bounded to certain worlds if they were made in multiplayer/single player. You can't select any character to load into a world if that character wasn't made in that particular world. Some materials that can be collected in single player were unable to be gathered in multiplayer (but before I stopped playing this issue was already fixed). There weren't as many boss fights as I would like and their drops weren't always anything special. Overall, when I stopped playing I was merely waiting for more content to be released. I've seen a lot of reviews comparing this to Terraria and Starbound. If you like those games more then play those games instead of comparing it to this one. Why? Because if this game was exactly like Terraria then...that defeats the purpose of making a uniquely different 2D Sandbox game. Also, if you hop into the game for less than an hour and deem that it's awful then you're not even giving the game a chance. I would also like to repeat that this game is in EARLY ACCESS. There will be bugs and the sort so if you don't want a game that's in DEVELOPMENT, I would advise you to wait if you have no patience for an unfinished game rather than buy it and give it a bad review because it has a lot of potential.

								This game is utter♥♥♥♥♥♥ The crafting is clunky and nonsensical, making machine rifles out of dirt and mud and other things. It is also clear that it's aping Starbound's layout but being even more irritating and difficult to use, needing to push the craft button multiple times in a specific place for it to even work. the worlds are impossible to navigate without dying from a massive fall, there is almost no character customization unless you count the person's face. And just their face. Just get starbound. This game is fugly and the enemies are nearly impossible to fight due to them being tiny and do half of your health bar's worth of damage on a hit, and utter lack of melee weapons. Now for me, the aesthetic is garbage except for maybe the backgrounds and sky of the game. It's like one of those minecraft knockoffs with 'HD' textures that look like garbage and not because of the fact it's a voxel-based sandbox world building game. Do not get this game if you are thinking of getting it over starbound.			"

Early Access Review
								Disclaimer:  This is an early access title, so as always, buyer beware.  It may or may not make it to the finish line, but from what I've experienced over a few years development cycle with this game, it's team is nothing if not dedicated and focused on the goal of pushing this game to release, so I'm fairly confident it will be released, just not as hastily as other titles.  The question to be answered, is whether or not this game is worth buying right now.  While it's in the same sandbox genre as popular (and depending on who you ask, infamous) titles such as terraria, minecraft, and starbound, the graphical style sets it apart fairly decisively.  It's not super high-res, but the cartoonish yet realistically proportioned characters are a nice change from the pixelized Devs-Don't-Give-A-Damn you sometimes see.  What can I say, some people like pixels, others don't.  For my part, I do like pixels.  Anyway, see the screenshots for a good idea of the art style.  At the very least, the art style is consistent throughout the game as far as I've seen.The devs have taken an interesting direction in the way of progression, in that every action you take, whether it be killing monsters, felling alien vegetation, or just digging up some mud, nets you experience that can be spent toward research in the area of your interest.  It's an interesting component that I suppose promotes cooperation and teaming up with other players who can fill the gaps in your research to help fully kit out your base.  Materials aren't enough to build all that you need, you actually need the experience and research level to create equipment and objects, unlike terraria and starbound where you only need touch a component to know how to put it together.The alien environments don't take the typical planetoidal approach to world generation, and instead you find your avatar cast adrift on a sea of floating islands, which you can hop from one to the next with a handy jetpack, which you get from playing through the tutorial at the very beginning of the game.  It's necessary to build a suit of armor with exposure protection in order to delve deeper into the world's depths, so progression is a multi-pronged challenge as you have to gather experience and then spend it correctly in order to build a base and equip yourself for the dangers you'll find in the lower levels of the planet.There's not much else for me to say about this title, but if you're still on the fence after hearing all of this, know that the game is still in development, and in order to expedite the process your characters and worlds may be wiped.  So bear that in mind if it's a factor in your decision.For my part, I bought it at 20 dollars a while back, and like where the game is going.  I trust this dev team enough to get the job done eventually, and really look forward to when it's finished.  If you have the money to spare and want to put it to a project, and this one sounds good based on all you've heard, great.  Honestly, this either is your cup of tea or isn't, and that's okay.  I will say that it's my cup of tea, and an interesting and very different entrant to the 2d sandbox genre.  I don't regret buying the game.			"

								Shogun wanted to love this game but my friends had to make new Characters just to get past the starting doors because it just picks if your charater is gonna be able to countinue on or be trapped forever in the starting room, but moving past all that we never gave up and made it to the end and this is what happend.The very start we all picked different things to level up so we could all contribute in a team effort to go faster together.We all built a base and struggled very hard to get our base working correctly with the power needed for each thing you place just so your stations will work so you can craft your things.We tried out mounts and found them to be the worst thing in the game to invest your resources in for every reason you can think of, you cant take them into worthless dungeons, they die forever, they cost a ton and get killed super fast and are too slow to avoid damage as well as too big to get around like you thought they would be used for but no jetpacks are the best for getting around and always will be.Dungeons are the most worthless waste of life in the game right next to Mounts, the gear you get from them is outdated the minute you can gather enough parts to make the dungeon key to enter it and the dungeons are so bugged you can't complete them most the time and the bosses are harder then the gear you have at the time to fight them to win, also most of your things dont work in the dungeon like jetpacks,mounts,doors, even entering the dungeon will some times crash your game and the doors teleport you to random locations some times making you unable to back track or even go forward or even leave the place alive so everything about it is a waste of life.and at the end of the game you find yourself grinding parts and EXP to make your medic gear as well as waiting for your carbon fibers to be made because the dang machines just decide to eat your refined metals and not make any because the game is broken and super coolent is broken in the same way as well.So in the end your friends all end up thinking the same thing as well as yourself...Explorer armor is the best along with builder just so you can progress the game and its all about trying to get as far down as you can as fast as you can and all the side stuff to explore is broken because the far right of the map crashes your game and its just boring,filled with buggs that have never been fixed and have been around since the start of this game and they seem to be ignoring the community that has been reporting these buggs, im pretty sure a team of 3 people is working on the game and the rest are streamers and sellsmen that dont work at all and just screw around on tumblr talking about their feels.  Sorry for bad English~Shogun			"

When i do get into the actal game however, after I do my best to make a somewhat good looking character, I create a world, and I'm beside some weird machine and a FLYING SHARK. They really need to come up with a better tutorial NPC. Aswell as the games art looks Half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and the world generation is terrible. 1/10			"

								I can't even playing the game. If I make it past the loading screen then I can't do anything in the world because my keyboard stop working when I load into the world. Most of the time I don't even make it that far, it will be stuck on the loading screen forever and I am forced to close I because it will never pass that point. If it did work for me then maybe I'd recommend it but since I'm not even able to play this game I do not suggest getting it. Terraria is much better and it does work more often then Edge of Space. Maybe this game will be better later but until then I cannot recommend it.			"

Early Access Review
								Disclaimer:  This is an early access title, so as always, buyer beware.  It may or may not make it to the finish line, but from what I've experienced over a few years development cycle with this game, it's team is nothing if not dedicated and focused on the goal of pushing this game to release, so I'm fairly confident it will be released, just not as hastily as other titles.  The question to be answered, is whether or not this game is worth buying right now.  While it's in the same sandbox genre as popular (and depending on who you ask, infamous) titles such as terraria, minecraft, and starbound, the graphical style sets it apart fairly decisively.  It's not super high-res, but the cartoonish yet realistically proportioned characters are a nice change from the pixelized Devs-Don't-Give-A-Damn you sometimes see.  What can I say, some people like pixels, others don't.  For my part, I do like pixels.  Anyway, see the screenshots for a good idea of the art style.  At the very least, the art style is consistent throughout the game as far as I've seen.The devs have taken an interesting direction in the way of progression, in that every action you take, whether it be killing monsters, felling alien vegetation, or just digging up some mud, nets you experience that can be spent toward research in the area of your interest.  It's an interesting component that I suppose promotes cooperation and teaming up with other players who can fill the gaps in your research to help fully kit out your base.  Materials aren't enough to build all that you need, you actually need the experience and research level to create equipment and objects, unlike terraria and starbound where you only need touch a component to know how to put it together.The alien environments don't take the typical planetoidal approach to world generation, and instead you find your avatar cast adrift on a sea of floating islands, which you can hop from one to the next with a handy jetpack, which you get from playing through the tutorial at the very beginning of the game.  It's necessary to build a suit of armor with exposure protection in order to delve deeper into the world's depths, so progression is a multi-pronged challenge as you have to gather experience and then spend it correctly in order to build a base and equip yourself for the dangers you'll find in the lower levels of the planet.There's not much else for me to say about this title, but if you're still on the fence after hearing all of this, know that the game is still in development, and in order to expedite the process your characters and worlds may be wiped.  So bear that in mind if it's a factor in your decision.For my part, I bought it at 20 dollars a while back, and like where the game is going.  I trust this dev team enough to get the job done eventually, and really look forward to when it's finished.  If you have the money to spare and want to put it to a project, and this one sounds good based on all you've heard, great.  Honestly, this either is your cup of tea or isn't, and that's okay.  I will say that it's my cup of tea, and an interesting and very different entrant to the 2d sandbox genre.  I don't regret buying the game.			"

												I have over 100 hours into this game and I've been here since Alpha.  I've played through about 3 revisions of the game, so about 40 hours or so per playthrough.  The game went thru some major changes since Alpha, and even though it's not 100% finished, and hasn't gotten any updates as of lately, it was an extremely fun game to play.  The fact it's unfinished really doesn't change much, as there's no main storyline, it's more of an exploration, creation, and upgrade game.The Penguin music alone is worth the money I paid for this game while it's on sale.  There's 3 completed biomes of enemies, thousands of items, I think like 45+ full sets of armor, 3 seperate lines with different attribute upgrades and abilities, and a bunch of alien techs to find that upgrade your passives.In short I'm completely happy with my purchase.  I hope they add more content in the future but I well got my moneys worth.  This game in alpha felt more complete then most of the crap I buy nowadays anyways.  It plays ALOT like Terraria.     I have no idea why so many haters due to one biome being unfinished, but I'd totally recommend this game, especially if you like Terraria.  Don't listen to the haters.			"

												It's been a while since I've played this game, mainly since the last update came out December 2015. What I mainly remember about this game is that it felt slow and unsatisfying.Unrelated to the game directly:  At this rate I wonder if this game will reach the same fate as Magical Drop V , another buggy game that has gone YEARS without an update. Actually, this game is still more playable than that one and they at least said something. This game does not have a childhood connection like MDV does though. The only good thing about this game is the title/main theme, which you can listen to here. If you don't like that either, this game has nothing to offer to you that hasn't been done better by others.			"

								This game makes me happy.This game has come a long way since when I first played it. This game is hard, unlike terraria or starbound there is a challange getting the materials you need, and exploring new lands. So the basics of the game is to get better aromour and weapons, then go lower into the world. Where you will find harder creatures and enemies to kill. This game is really challenging, and in my opinion way better than Terraria and Starbound.			"

								I went into Edge of Space, hoping for something of a cross between Terraria and Starbound. Unfortunately, it did not deliver.Firstly, there are several menus. too many menus, assigned to keys that you could possibly change, but why? why are there so many?Navigating story text is also a pain, and the tutorial is horrible. it conveys the controls, but the way it does it is more of a chore it has to do, ticking off parts of the game on a checklist. You don't feel like you've learned anything.Then there is death. this is perhaps my biggest axe to grind. it turns death into some complex process involving crafting a chamber, and using rods, and I just give up at that point.I spawned in, tried to slowly edge down from the top of a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ asteroid field it dump-ed me into really? couldn't have started with rolling hills? something normal??) and died. I had no idea what to do or how to do it.Edge of Space is a game full of potential. however, it is far, far too complicated. it has a LOT of work to do to get the gameplay user-friendly, and the death mechanic needs some serious reworking.It feels like this game is trying to be terraria 2.0, while also trying to be starbound, but not grasping what makes starbound fun. It takes the sci-fi all right, but it takes the grungy abandoned-spaceship theme. Not the adventuring and simplistic controls.			"

												The positives: Uh...... it has a terraria reference?The neutral stuff: Kinda grindy and mining is slow. The stuff that are pretty big flaws but could have been okay:  A ""research"" system. In other words, not just one, but TWO methods of forcing you to work your butt off to get a incredible reward!..... Just kidding, you 'll also get stuck behind so many progression walls there are enough for several mazes of utter misery with the slow mining and finding out SURPRISE!you now need a new workstation. Alright, i'll go dig out ANOTHER massive crater to get some XP so I can research that. (An hour later) Alright let's see what I need for this thing. Looks like some uranium and a ton of aluminum (That's not actually a recipe but an example of the sorts of recipes there are) Time to go get some aluminum!.... Got that, what about uranium? Oh... I can't mine it. So what do I need to make a laser to (hopefully) mine it? Looks like more giant crater making for me. Hooray. Three cheers for whoever decided holding down on your mouse and moving it for hours was a neccecary game mechanic.What killed the game: There's no satisfaction to ANYTHING. Completing quests? Grindy and unrewarding. Exploring? Fun until you realize all the terrain is the same. Progression? There's progression? Where? Where'd you find precious progression? WHERE?!?! Combat? Yes there is! It's combatting the woefully weak jellyfish who die after about 20 seconds of holding the mouse button down! There isn't even different fighting styles. Sure you can pick between ""pew pew"" guns, ""pew... BOOM"" guns or ""PEW............... PEW"" guns but compare that to terraria where you can get a massive variety of weapons, from classic swords to lances to boomerangs to flails to variants that deal more damage, look cool, fire off an array of projectiles from various actions (hitting enemies, when swinging, whenever there's an active hitbox...) or inflicting debuffs. And that's just THE MOST BORING CATEGORY. Not to say they aren't cool, it's just they're the trump 6 out of sixes and tens. There's also guns, bows, bow/gun hybrids, spellbooks wands+rods and staffs, throwing lances, throwing knives, shuriken, yo-yos,  a portal gun, a voodoo doll, and that's just the stuff I thought of in a few minutes. Sorry about the massive rant. Overall, it's a 2.5/10 on the scale of games that aren't stupendous but aren't one of ""those"" games. You know them. Zelda CGI, Flight Control, Slaughtering Grounds. The type that get videos dedicated to laughing at the sheer amount of crap that they are. Anyway, hopefully this helped the devs and the people who are thinking about buying it. Here's some games that hold up to the 1$ per hour of fun rule. Terraria: a 157 hour epic, and i've only gotten to late prehardmode and skill is the limiting factor in that. Cave Story+: The original indie game with new graphics and a handful of extra content including difficulty settings, new characters and a new level cut from the original game because it was apparently too dark (clones of a friendly character who attack you) which makes no sense considering it involves drowning as well as being forced to kill a character who was fed the red flowers (you'll understand if you play it) along with a character who tried to protect his friends and killed them accidentally. Seriously. It also has multiple endings. Undertale: AWESOME game involving SPOILER SPOILER who SPOILERs SPOILER. It's kinda loses half its appeal if you already know the story. Not to say the story is great and the gameplay is bad; all of undertale is fantastic. It's just that the story and gameplay are SO interconnected that spoiling one makes the other not quite have the impact it's supposed to. Also, bring a friend and a tissue or two. Seriously. Undertale is the only game ever to make me laugh so hard or cry anything exept tears of frustration.			"

								Honestly... I just don't like this game. I love Terraria and Minecraft though. (like Terraria, I don't think it should be compared to Minecraft). The game just doesn't look good in my opinion, is very slow paced, and is just generally boring. I also think the tutorial should be taken out of the game; if you buy this game, you have most likely played Terraria or Minecraft, so you know about crafting and things like that. Some of the fun from these games is learning what to do yourself, and one of the common complaints from the console versions of Terraria/Minecraft is that they even feature a tutorial. Not to mention that it is just FAR to long.			"

								It's really hard to believe that this game is ""finished"" and shall be released September 2015, at the time of my review it's August 14, 2015.I really can't get into the look and feel of this game and its game play, it certainly is no Terraria or Starbound, and there's nothing really unique in the first 1.5 hours that makes me want to keep playing. There's just the prospect to mine blocks, or grind creatures for XP, to ""unlock"" things that I can then build.I think that the UI is terrible, it's visually not appealing, it gives next to no feedback, and it's unresponsive. But I think I already read that 2 years ago. Once you mass up (unlock) items to build it gets rather hard to use. The components required to build things are questionable at best. Dirt, mud, clay, rock, to build a large variety of items, huh.There are billboard missions you can take to get more rare stuff (is it the only way?) like aluminium or uranium, they are simple and seem buggy. For example, having two missions to collect 50 dirt immediately completes both if you have 49+ dirt in your inventory, and collect just one more piece of dirt.When you play the tutorials where you need to shoot humanoid training dummies, it becomes immediately apparent that the hit boxes are... let's just say, you have to hit them in a certain spot, their legs for example are completely off the hit box boundary.If you have neither played Terraria, or the Terraria 1.3 update, I'd recommend that instead, or keeping an eye on Starbound. I've put over 100 hours into Starbound around December 2013, when they first made a public Alpha release, which really puts a unique spin on the whole Terraria feel and it has an absolutely amazing soundtrack.

												I have played the game for around 558 hours and have really enjoyed the experience so far. The only downside is that it takes a heck of a lot of searching for some crafting items and there is little in the way of instructions on gameplay for quite a few things. This will probably change over time since this game recently came out of beta and there were a ton of changes just in the last year. The developers have done a great deal of work on the game and I appreciate all the detail in appearance and play. The game is challenging and fun. I recommend this game .			"

								So at one point in starting to play this I thought ""where'd they get Starbound's source code from?"" and then realised it was just a little bit more than that. I'm not sure what to think of this, but I know one thing: over the years I've been playing games and then trying to recreate them in my own way, trying to get some idea of good game mechanics. This is what would happen if I successfully did that after playing Terraria and Starbound. The reason I can't recommend this is that I can't recommend Starbound either, - and Starbound even adhered to certain game design principles Edge of Space does not. For example, DLC or content purchases - and I can't help but feel like it's Starbound remade. /impressionsSince reviews aren't just opinion meters and-Oh, they are. Well here's a breakdown anyway:ArtThe art is quite good, but I can't look past the animations, which I personally don't much like. They seem slightly unnatural somehow, as if forced or overacted. The music is okay, and at times reminds of a certain game that parallels EoS a lot.Then again, there isn't a whole lot of it yet, so I can't be sure.UsabilityOne thing I quite like is how the game is actually somewhat intuitive. I mean it has all that arbitrary stuff where you go through the tiers of equipment and unlock things that you would realistically have beforehand, but I can overlook that since it's an industry standard, no matter how dumb it is. The tutorial goes through the mechanics and controls at lightspeed. Something that's great for someone like I, who plays games like Xonotic, but would be really damn hard for anyone who isn't used to learning new controls extremely quickly. The rest of the game seems to just leave you to do what you want after the tutorial, which is good and bad, depending on how you look at it. GameplayAs usual, sandbox style progression using ""tech"", and unlocks of new gear.There isn't much emphasis on building, possibly because there's not really much need, and possibly because the small hotbar and needing to manually stock it with stuff all the time is a nightmare, at least coming from games like Starbound which allowed you to place things by picking them up in the inventory. A small issue I have with it, but I'm sure many people would feel the same. Systems, bugs, exploits, map generation, etc.The map is automatically smoothed by making every top corner (tiles y-1 and x±1 are air) 45°. Not a great feature, since building with this in mind can be very annoying. There are too many bugs to go into. I'm hoping this is because it's still in EA. The map generation algorithm is pretty basic. Very similar to Starbound, but less to explore for lack of content so far. out of the few worlds I've looked at, all are the same flattish top island with other small islands above and below. It's a little like an extremely dense asteroid belt. It's not incredible. Overall, this seems kind of interesting, but not so much so that a person who just bought the Weekly Bundle would give it a good review. I don't recommend the game, but I don't recommend not playing it either. It's one of those things where you just don't quite know how it'll turn out.			"

								I would not recommend this game it is a poorly made terraria knock-off that is more than twice the price for the ""complete version"" so avoid this game and buy terraria it's cheaper, more well made, you don't have to pay extra for the full version, and best of all the devs care enough to keep updating the game without asking you to pay for said update.

												So I got this back in its EA days and thought it had promise. I thought it would be a nice game to take the place of Terraria. The game never got very good or polished and then the Devs decided to call it finished and released it. Well you can call it what you want, I guess, but finished is certainly not how I would describe this game. If you don't have Terraria, play that instead. If you've burnt out on Terraria and are looking for a replacement- run. Run as fast as you can as far as you can.			"

While I haven't played it as much as Terraria, it has a narrative with interesting characters (e.g., the laser shark) and a fascinating world. If you like side-view exploration and crafting games, you should consider getting this.			"

Early Access Review
								If you like Terraria, then yes this is a game to get. True, it is in the early developmental stage and there are a plethora of bugs, incomplete items, and overall balancing issues that still need to be worked out. For a game still well into its beta, i find it damn impressive that it wants me to keep playing as much as it does. Gameplay is not as smooth as i would prefer, e.g. no invinicibility frames upon taking damage, enemies ridiculously hard to hit with guns, having a ceiling on the max amount of ammo you're allowed to have for everything besides phase weapons. In all honesty, I felt that Terraria handled the ammo situation for projectile weapons very well, where you could have as much as you wanted as long as you had inventory space. Reloading of course is something they didn't incorporate but the upper limit on ammo makes projectile weapons nearly obsolete. Haven't tried energy weapons yet, hope they are better, otherwise its sticking to phase weapons forever just because of ammo constraints.Mining can be tedious, as i have not found any new ores or reasons to mine besides the fact i need resources to farm xp from the enemies flying around, and your upgraded picks dont seem to be digging that much faster. Dungeons on here are very exciting to explore, i was amazed when i first discovered the headhunters dungeon, and again when i found maps to other dungeons as you went lower. Transportation mounts, like the raptors, can't teleport with you to different command nodes, which i found to make them  not very useful since you get to them so much later in the game and need to move around between your main base and hub bases quickly. random events that happen are interesting, they are usually pretty tough, although the rewards are severly lacking. Kill x/x monsters and you get a couple blocks of some ore thats not very rare? not worth it. also can we get a map early on? exploring's a ♥♥♥♥♥ without one, even if we have to make it but make it available from a fairly early point please.I am very excited to see this game get completed, hope that this review persuades others to invest in this game and help support the developers.

												I understand I only spent a few minutes in this game, but unfortunately that was all I needed.First problem I encountered that immediately threw me into a rage...audio crackling.Normally I would believe this to be some sort of sound driver issue, but as someone who regularly uses Skype, Pandora, numerous other games and software with absolutely zero problem in sound, I found this to be the foreshadowing of the only stain in my library out of (currently) 147 other items. Reinstallation of drivers and the game itself has produced no fix. Fabulous.Second issue, which I should say was already mentioned by someone else in the reviews on this item...sluggish gameplay. It feels like you're trying to swim through molasses. I was trying to gun down uh, floating jellyfish and other unpleasant critters and it felt like I was in a slow-motion Matrix scene (minus the badassery by a long shot, that is).Third issue. There were no prominent enough sound effects for mining or busting something's skull in. I expected some splattering or crumbling or something. What I got was a♥♥♥♥♥♥poor puff noise for most of it. Seriously? What kind of horse crap is this?Fourth issue. I'm very happy I was able to adapt to the game itself as quickly as I did, because the game not pausing with the tutorial UI up in my face was extremely unsettling and left me open to get owned by the nearest hungry maw. Someone with very little experience with games like this will not be so fortunate in the future.Fifth issue. This game  has some sloppy sprite work on the player avatars. Normally I would let this slide, but I know this game has been worked on for quite some time, so no, I am not going to let it go. Hell no. You can definitely tell a lot of the features you're able to add onto the avatar in creation were lazily pasted on. Thankfully, the fitting futuristic artwork helped balance it out.Sixth issue. OH HOW CUTE THE GAME ONLY HAS A RESOLUTION CHANGE OPTION AND V-SYNC FOR GRAPHIC SELECTIONS. LOL WTF IS THIS, 2004?!Edge of Space was supposed to be the answer to the demand of an outer space sandbox game like Terraria. In fact, when it was advertised, it was proclaiming to be better and a bit of a sequel to the installment. What a waste of cyberspace and time! Terraria is everything this game wanted to try to be. You know, functional and good?In fact, if you want a good sandbox game similar to Terraria that occurs in space, either sit down with Minecraft and some mods, or get a game that actually does this♥♥♥♥♥♥right; STARBOUND.Save your money, ladies and gents. This title belongs in the dev studio for quite a few years more before it should touch the stores.I can't believe my friend wasted his money to get this for me. I want to actually pay him twice the amount of what he spent on this game just to compensate for the disgrace I went through in giving this a chance.			"

												well i hate to say it but this is just a mess multiplayer is non-existant as it currently fails to load most of the time. charecters are restricted to per instance/world loading (you cant have charecters in multiplayer on both you and someone elses world.) the game is very laggy often crashes even in single player. the multiplayer uses a vulnerable port that often cannot be opened/hosted while an antivirus is running or a firewall is active. finaly multiplayer isnt easy to setup as you need to know how to forward ports find your ip and other technical knowledge that most players like me lack completeley.the singleplayer lacks a story and most of all is very repetative each 3 layers adds 2 new ores.... wow.... it takes hours to actualy find most of these ores in a descent quantity and often the mobs kill you before you can mine it. talking of mobs they seem to spawn everywhere especialy in the 3rd 6th and 9th islands the 6th island is inacessable to players without armor found 3 layers deeper (that you then wouldent be able to craft) the games drop rates need a massive boost as they currently are taking the p~~~. the ""bosses"" in the game lack any difficulty whatsoever and additionaly drop next to nothing for your time especialy the dj penguin whose armor set may need 30~40 kills to aquire and 21 hours of my gameplay was wasted making it. the game`s mobs are no better the egnoid matiriels take hours to find also the mobs that drop them dont seem to spawn as often making it very hard to get anywhere endgame the dungeons are nice but dont have any reward execpt 1 mob worth of science xp (not worth it) the ambient mobs eat viechles so it isnt worth crafting them especialy as they are single use finaly the singleplayer lacks a map and this isnt acceptable the maps is needed for the game to be minorly enjoyable as of now players just get lost in the middle of nowhere.

								Wouldn't recommend you buy this at least until launch. They claim a launch patch is rolling out September 17th but it's August 22th, it's in 'beta', and the main quest is completely broken. Hard to think they'd launch when the previous version is so buggy. I can only hope it launches more complete.The game itself, or at least what I've been allowed to play (what is not bugged) is pretty barebones, featuring very simplistic ""randomized"" quests (with a time limit, oddly enough), and an awkward MMO-style XP system (mine blocks, get XP, get slightly further towards your ridiculously numbered goal to level.)All in all I'd recommend just waiting and reading reviews for when this game is more finished or just staying away.

								This game really is on another level as compared to its other successor, ""Terraria"".  I liked Terraria a whole lot but when I played Edge of Space, I was blown away.  The tutorial let alone was quite deep and informative but exploring was another thing because you just want to keep going and going!  I also like the researching aspect in the game as compared to Terraria because it feels like grinding on some monsters actually serves another purpose, so props to the developer on that!Although it is in Early Access mode with the casual grammatical and spelling errors, I would definitely recommend it to anyone who has time on their hands.  If you are looking to have a quiet time with a couple of friends, this game is for you!  One last point I want to make is that the game's graphics is quite amazing.  When I bought the game, I thought the graphics wouldn't be quite nice but you will be surprised when you go in!~Definite 10/10 for me.			"

												Just another game that I feel lost some potential.It's your typical survival game.Gather resources, build a shelter, you know the drill.That's all fine for a survival game, but this just doesn't feel... ""fun"".Not to mention the fact that hosting an actual server is kind of a pain to do.			"

												Took a bit to get into but overall I liked it.  Definitely think a few things could change but it wasn't as bad as some of these reviews seem to be portraying it.  I didn't like the completely polarised armour for sure.  If you want a decent amount of inventory you need to give up health and damage, if you want damage you can't have inventory or health, etc.  That bugged me because I don't want to keep 3 sets of armour on me at all times just in case.  I think the worst thing though is that in the late tier you get some special weapons and tools but they can only be used while wearing a very specific armour.  So unless you want to carry that armour and the tool these great items become entirely useless.  Levelling also seems to be a huge grind.  I ended up just creating the machines that mine quickly and straight up hollowing out entire massive chunks of land to get the xp (I think it has a name in the game though, like Research or something instead of xp).  I still found it fun to progress solo, though.  One of this games big issues is the crafting system.  It would be really nice if you could initiate crafting while in a chest's inventory so that both your inventory and the chest's would be checked for crafting materials.  Its really annoying to have to constantly take small things from chests for each thing you need to make, especially since there are so many different materials in this game (which is a good thing but cumbersome in this case).Tl;dr Its a good game but it takes a bit of dedication.  And if you aren't the type to look past small issues or annoyances then this might not be great for you.			"

												Its a developing game still and i can see why peope got the game mixed, spend a little more time with the game and you will enjoy the game. Oh btw i dont think its a 'clone of the game', its related somehow to Terraria in the lore. Terraria has terra in it and terra in latin (or greek idn) means change like terraform which is what you do in the game. Think about it for a while and it makes more sence. so what i think is that this game is the prequel to Terraria (mabie), also sceletron and OMGtron.			"

Early Access Review
								I tried, i really tried to like this game. To win the battle against the horrible UI, annoying crafting system, constant dying, dull surroundings, dull music, dull combat, dull mining, dull building, dull everything. And to find the ""potential"" that people seem to be talking about. But it was a failure. I mean, what were the devs thinking? You know, ""BETA"" stage of development starts when you have an almost ready-to-go product, so you just need to eliminate bugs and test some features. Not when you have a game that's almost unplayable, AS WELL as buggy and unstable.Where do i start? The world is pretty tight, so you can only explore downwards, but since you have no way to tell what's below you, 90% of the time you'll end up falling from great height, crashing and dying on impact. Not to mention that you can't go too deep since the exposure and/or mobs will kill you there. In my book that's not ""exploring"", just pointless trial and error.You can build a base, but what's the point if you can't even respawn there? And it's not like in Terraria, where you always build a base near the surface - here you won't be able to get back up there unless you die again. And if you build it deeper, then every time you die, you'll have to go and find it again in the midst of a thousand identical floating islands. Oh yeah, and who would've guessed that these super-advanced spacefaring guys won't have a device to make a MAP of the area.So here's how your first couple of hours in EoS will look like: you'll be jumping around, searching for at least something different from the dirt\mud\clay surrounding you, trying to get deeper, but mostly falling and dying constantly. Even if you succeed, you'll see that nothing really changes down there, except for tougher and more aggressive mobs, and the exposure timer won't let you go deeper until you get better equipment. And unless you think that painfully slow mining and crafting some aluminium pants or whatever is fun, then that's it, that's your only option here - you won't have anything else to do. To make things worse the game gives you no clue on how things work and why would you need them. So i can build a GENERATOR and a COMMAND CENTER, cowabunga, now what? It won't even explain the basics. Like if you played Terraria, you know there's a difference between a block and a wall. But here, there are only ""walls"", by default functioning as blocks. You actually need to hit ""TAB"" button to be able to place your ""wall"" in the background where it belongs. Only you'll never guess it unless you stumble on it in some random guide, like i did.Yeah, whoever in the devs team is responsible for the UI deserves a bullet to the face. Why can't i place items just by dragging them from my inventory? Why do i always need to bind a hotkey to do this basic thing? Why the crafting window is so bizarre and complex? Did you see how crafting looks in Terraria? Well, look again. Probably there is some difference in the later stages of the game, but i gave up here. It's not like ""playing a game"" to me, more like trying to fix a car without any idea of what you're supposed to do. And with the wrench constantly slipping out of your hands and falling so you need to go pick it up again and again. Overall, this is my most frustrating early access experience since Project Zomboid, but at least i didn't spend my money there.			"

												Basically, if someone saw the concept art for starbound and tried to make a clone of that but for the Sega Genesis...I bought this game AGES ago, but because of the negative reviews, I thought I'd wait till the 1.0 launch to give it a propper chance.  It feels very much unfinished, and there is no real goal to the game.  Progress feels very slow and grindy(e.g. an upgraded version of something takes lots of resources, but then is not noticably better)Graphics 3/10Gameplay 3/10I think many aspects of this game may have seemed like a good idea in isolation, but unfortunatly it just hasnt come together well.  I dont think this game can be improved much though, because many of the problems are fundamental game-design issues.I imagine people who would like this game would also like Starbound.  Anyone who has played Starbound will see how heavily EOS has borrowed from it.  I have problems with starbound too (slow development, bad community management, broken promises). That said Starbound is a much more polished game than EOS, and has much more game play (from what I have seen so far).even its its slow, poor development never reaching the and of beta state.I really wanted to like this game... but I just can't do it, after 2.6 hours of REALLY trying to.  The game play is responsive enough, and I have found only a few bugs.  I would suggest watching a gameplay video before buying though.			"

												99% of the bad reviews are from attention w hore trolls. Nothing more. Most of them have OVER 100+ hours of gameplay. (Yeah! The game must really F-king suck if they sunk 100+ hours into it Am-I-RIGHT? )Here are some facts:Game is 100% playable, and you can finish it in about 2 weeks of 8 hour days playing. (I timed my wife's second runthough, exactly 89 hours to complete on easy for an experianced player.)Multiplayer works, and YES there are a lot of people populating them. (although a large ammount of them are locked like most multi-player games of this sort).Co-Op with 3 of your friends is a blast!Neat electrical system!! You get to actually plan out your base so you get the most out of your power sources.LOTS of cool creatures with verry unique traits/attacks/funny habbits.Lots of minerals, and things to craft with! Lots of things to craft!!! Lots of Decorations so you can really personalize your base. Some of the bosses are from Terraria!!! The maker of terraria LOVES this game, and gave a blessing, and the rights to use Skeletron!!!https://www.engadget.com/2013/08/29/terraria-content-coming-to-edge-of-space-in-cross-over-event/ Great music and atmosphere.

								Edge of Space is a game still in development. There will, of course, still be bugs and pending/missing features. However, at this stage, it is still a pretty fun game to play. I'm still relatively early in the game, but I still got plenty of stuff to do and to look forward too.However, and I will say it again, IT IS STILL IN DEVELOPMENT.At this stage, not many people may like it as it is. The developers are still working on getting a lot of things in the game. They have lots of features planned to be implemented which are currently not present at the moment. The game is not done and there is still a lot to add.Another thing: Stop comparing it to Starbound. Just because it's a randomly generated, 2D scrolling, sci-fi themed, mining, crafting, and building based game; it doesn't mean it's a clone of that game. It has many different mechanics and the devs took a different approach to the genre. Don't compare the two.My final note is this: If you want a fun terraria-like space game, you can go with either Starbound, Signs of life, or this game, Edge of space. Whichever you choose, don't compare it with/to the others two. I've only played Edge of Space, and I've loved it. However, if you don't like to playing unfinished games, I recommend you not to buy it; or at least not right now. It's up to each one's preferences.8/10:Can't wait for each update. "

												Edge of Space is very addicting...just like any other Gathering / Building game! You can very easily find yourself losing track of time as you dig a hole on a quest for that elusive material that you need for your next craft. Really enjoyed the music and the colourful settings! The crafting can seem overwhelming, but once you get the hang of it...it's really easy! Only wish there was a fullscreen or windowed fullscreen mode (maybe there is, but i couldn't find). This game would be fun to play with friends, as you can become a fighter, builder or gatherer...so there'd be some nice synergy with a few others! Pick this game up!			"

												Edge of Space is a Terraria but sci-fi effort in the same vein as the more popular Starbound, even going as far as to include Terraria crossover content, which was one of the selling points of the game for me. It is also one of the most tedious and uninteresting games I've ever played. The basic gameplay loops are completely uninspired and dull. Terraria has wonderfully satisfying Metroidvania progression that makes slowly mining the world in order to acquire better gear and be able to defeat more difficult enemies an absolute joy to play. In the strictest sense, it's a very repetitive game, but it all feels so good that it's wonderfully engrossing. Edge of Space achieves none of that. It's a grind that just feels like a grind, and even in 1.0 is still a bit toward the wonky side, particularly the jumping mechanics.I have issues with Starbound and it also misses some of what made Terraria work, but it at least feels like there's potential there, and even still in beta it is a lot more fun than this. Edge of Space needs fundamental design overhaul and the 1.0 release really is just polishing a game that never actually worked on the most basic level. One thing I can say for it is that I don't think the graphics are as bad as some other people are making them out to be. Don't get me wrong, they're certainly not great, but I don't think they're intolerable. In a very fun game, they'd probably be fine. Unfortunately this is not a game that plays well.			"

												Overall:I think that in it's current state the game shows a ton of potential and has some very great features. I really like the Terraria/Starbound 2D worldcraft type gameplay and the controls/combat of this particular title does the style justice. If you're a fan of these, this game is a must-play as it is a bit more forgiving than Starbound or Terraria in some ways but also very challenging in it's own right.Positives:There is a great amount of appealing content in the game so far. The combat is a lot of fun. I like how easy it is to find and upgrade resources as well as unlocking content by simply fighting monsters and mining. Each (fighting/mining) give you exp points equally. There are also mini-dungeons you come across regularly to clear out. These in addition to deployable tower defense and other styles of mini-game dungeons adds a fun spin to the roguelike worldcraft indie style.Negative:The biggest issues I have with the game are stability issues and bugs. After initially binging on the game for several hours, I lost everything I had built due to a client crash. I still had my character and all the inventory, but the planet/area's safe file was corrupted so I had to start from a fresh new save. This made me lose all my storage and the structures/bases I had built.  Also it seems that about half the time the game has trouble deploying your character as playable into the world. Sometimes the screen is dark and everything responds, but you cannot move or take control of your avatar. It is easily fixed by a restart or two (if it happens sequentially). Neutral:This game isn't a solid world like in Terraria or Starbound. There are large open spaces inbetween land masses that you must use your jet pack to travel between while heading deeper in the map without taking damage on impact as the gravity is similar to that of earth. This I feel like has both negative and positive effects for creating elevator shafts and fast-travel between different levels. For instance, one thing I liked about terraria was creating an easily navigated mine-shaft to drop very deep very quickly, although in this you can just build a teleporter wherever you want and teleport straight to it. So it really allows you to focus on more combat if you want to.End thoughts. Worth overall. I will update my review as it is developed.			"

								At the moment I dont recommend the game right off the bat. The reason is because the progress in game is way to slow and makes you feel like your more on a resource collecting errand then an open world sandbox. First the world is very small at least vertically, horizontally if you continue to craft new armor you can dive deeper only to find the same ores with sligtly tougher monsters.Don't get me wrong the game has the base of a good formula but as of now thats all it is.Wait a bit before buying. Ill update it when they content has changed to a more fun approuch which I can tell will be soon!			"

								Not sure yet.For an early access game it certainly shows some potential, but there are a few things that really bring it down for me.Pros:- I like the art style, characters/enemies/backgrounds all look nice.- Some character customization is nice.- Space age laser pick axe type thing with rifles to defend yourself is always promising. - Has a decent tutorial that I would have probably been 100% lost without. - I liked the quest/task system in place that was used for the tutorial. I would love to see this used a good bit in later builds of the game. Random quests/tasks/challenges while exploring the world would add a good bit of excitement for me.Cons + personal opinions/feedback:- The UI. Oh man the UI. This is the one thing that, if not updated significantly, will stop me from playing this game again. Every time I'd look for something I felt myself straining my eyes trying to discern exactly what I was looking at. Similar looking icons in inventory, small text in several places, and a very clunky and unrefined crafting menu (in a crafting game) made it so that every time I'd stop blasting things with my laser saw to go look at my loot or craft something I would grumble to myself a little bit about how I had to go back into the menus. I hope updates are coming for some of UI/menus, especially the crafting menu and/or system. Please oh please.- Also didn't care for the health/jetpack meters being on such a noisy panel up in the corner like they are. It was a hassle to try and read while running/fighting anything. I would rather just have a couple of bars or numbers above my character or some such thing so that I can see a gauge while I am looking at my character and moving about.- The [lack of] transition from day to night was so abrupt that I thought it was a bug or my game was crashing or textures had stopped drawing. Day/night is great to have, but needs to be a transition, not instant.- It seems like the way to unlock new things to craft is by collecting these little book things that give +25 or so to various crafting skills. I don't much care for that as a gating mechanic, maybe it would be better if more was available initially or if there was a better indication of how using different materials to craft the same item would make a better one. Additionally, I really didn't enjoy that I would find these little books, then have to go into my inventory, select them, equip them on my action bar, and then pull them out and use them in order to gain experience from them. Unless they are to be used for something else I am unaware of, I don't understand why they are inventory items instead of just experience type pickups that occur automatically and scroll a nice little ""+25 Furniture!"" or something over your head.  I should stop rambling. There's my 2 cents.I hope some of this has been helpful if anyone's read this far. I know people compare this game to Terraria, which I have not played. It may very well be that much of what I don't like is based around Terraria's success and these elements I don't like just aren't to my tastes. If that's the case then I guess it just isn't for me - ignore all that junk above. :)My conclusion - As it exists now, several different issues come together to make a disappointing experience. I hope that is just due to it being in an early stage, and that we'll see much more polish/improvement in the next few months. I think that when/if the right things are made better the whole game could come together quite nicely. "

								I was expecting a lot of fun combat, with mining and exploration but Edge of Space dissapointed me... Maybe I didn't played long enough, but in my opinion game shouldn't need 6 hours to get to ""fun stuff"". Doing same boring stuff for 2h just to drop one item I needed for gun upgrade. It would be OK for late game grinding for maniac players but at the start? Getting all aluminium I needed was also pretty non-exciting. I don't mind mining, I like minecraft, terraria or Starbound and all the mining didn't get me bored there. But here there is almost nothing interesting to find underground (or anywhere else TBH) and ores are sparse.Sure it's early access - but I played many early access games that weren't that boring.+ crafting system - every material belongs to few ""classes"", crafiting recipes often require generic materials (for example - if recipe requires raw/metal  you can use aluminium or titanium or whatever else belongs to raw/metal),+ upgrade system - enemies drop upgrades that after use give you point in given subject (for example Armor), after gathering enough poinst you unlock new recipes,+ interesting world concept - small and large floating islands,+ base that actually is a base (different stations - like rafinary or w/e - need to be connected to main command center you build by blocks you craft - can't get away with dirt house)- your first gun is ♥♥♥♥♥♥. It's pretty weak, you reload more than you shoot and bullets are ugly and slow flying making shooting fast moving enemies nightmare. And you won't change it fast (after 6h of playing I managed to upgrade it to a bit less ♥♥♥♥♥♥ gun that still looks and behaves similar). I loved how guns ""felt"" in terraria (speed, sounds, power), here basic gun is terrible, it feels like shooting from plastic toy and you are stuck with it for long time.- I met only few types of enemies so far. Jellyfishes that suck your energy, small crabs that are freaking hard to hit with basic gun, flying brain-tentacle-thing that shoots at you and some kind of... errr... something that fires homing balls of death that get you through walls (and are hard to shoot down). And there were no ""Hordes of enemies"", usually just few of them at same time (and more would get you killed)- upgrades are pretty random, I still didn't managed to discover other classes of weaponry,- it's hard to tell how long will you fall after you jump (world consists of flying islands), you often die by falling down few screens because of missing island you couldn't land on beacues you didn't know its there,- islands don't vary in any way,- your pickaxe is slow (6h of play without getting a upgrade), ores are hard to find. You spend a lot of time at slow mining.- UI is bad:     - prompts you all the time (everytime you craft it shows you result in a window. it would be enough to show prompt only for weapons)     - selecting stuff to craft item and amount just takes too much time     - if you click outside inventory it will ask you if you want to throw item (again - prompt!) instead of using it. it order to use item you have to put in hotbar (annoying when building or using upgrades)+- sci-fi feel (compared to Starbound, with is kinda mix of fantasy with sci-fi)+- I don't like graphic style of game (but that's very subjective)+- no swords in space (on the other hand I was begging for some melee weapon in some situations) "

												It had some nice concepts and ideas but quite simply, failed to excute properly. The game is a complete unorganized mess (with the map layouts, menus, spawns, and pretty much damn well everything) and the tutorials can be confusing and annoying. Even though they provide a few written tutorials I have little idea of what exactly i'm even supposed to be doing.			"

								(Written 7/18/14)Terrible UI, Clunky Controls, I just didnt find myself having even close to the amount of fun I had with the other ""space Terraria"" game, Starbound. Over complicated Menus, and lack of direction made me bored pretty quickly. This is Early Access, so of course this stuff can still be kinda fixxed. I might come back later to see how it turned out, but I think I will stick to Starbound for now. But No, I don't feel like I can recommend this to my friends. I hope it gets better with future patches though. "

												If you are looking for a game that is as good as StarBound or Terraria, let me just stop you right now.  In my opinion this may be the worst ( at the very least worst controlling ) game i have played in a very long time.  If you like this game, more power to you, but this just isn't the kinda of game that people like me can get into. P.S. - The charactor custimazation to this game is a joke			"

								I'm not a fan of this game. I bought it on sale and I am glad because I uninstalled it after beating on it for an hour. It's just YATC (Yet Another Terraria Clone). Instead of allowing the player to discover crafting recipies this game adds a grinding/research mechanic to earn them. Surprisingly this didn't add to the enjoyment for me. I don't know, there is something to be said for the simplicity of the crafting systems of Minecraft and Terraria. I give it a 5 out of 10			"

								This game is marketed like as a clone of Tererria. This is only partially true. I really like Tererria, but I don't like this game. I understand that this game is still in early development, but based on what I have seen so far it is headed down the wrong path. 1. Everything is much bigger in this game. The character is bigger, the blocks are bigger, everything. This means you cannot fit as much of the game on the screen at a time, so you cannot see as far.2. There is no map. I use the map all the time in Tererria to find my way around and locate resources. One of the things I like about the map in Tererria is it shows open areas near you, so you can dig towards them. Since this game does not have a map it also does not have this ability. Finding resources is extremely difficult. I have spent hours digging around and ohly found very limited usable resources. Instead Edge of Space has a radar system that you have to craft, and beacons, which you also have to craft. Since it is so hard to find resources it is very difficult to find enough to make these items and so it is difficult to find your way around. Even with the radar, all you get is a little blip on a small radar screen to try and find your way around. This is so much less effective than having a map.3. So far I have not found any hidden treasures. In Tererria treasure chests and breakable containers are a great way to get resources and gear early in the game. This game does not have these so you have to manufacturer everything yourself. This results in the game moving a lot more slowly. 4. This game does not have biomes like Tererria. For example every Tererria map has desert, jungle, forest and ocean biomes. These go along way to add variety and keep the game interesting. Since this game does not have these it gets boring really quickly. In tererria you also have weather and other events, like blood moons and such. This game does not have anything like that.5. Weapons suck. The only weapon you have is a gun and it has very limited ammo and has to take time to charge. This is a big pain because if you get attacked by a mob you quickly run out of ammo and have to run away until it charges back up. This makes figinting really difficult and not fun. In addition gun are not good close range, so if the enemies get close you will not be able to hit them. Upgrading the gun is also a slow process. You first have to get enough experience to unlock the plans for a new weapon before you can build it. Since gathering experience is slow it can take a really long time before you are able to upgrade.6. This brings me to my next dislike. The experience system is completly messed up. There are 18 different categories for experience, and upgrading them depends on which items you pick up. This means you may find a lot of upgrades for furnature, but not for weapons, which has happened to me, and so you have great items to place in your base, but really crappy items to fight with. I like Tererria much better because you only have to gather the materials and you can make anything.7. You cannot use items directly from your inventory. To use an item, even things like health and other consumable items you first have to put them in your quick bar and then switch to the item and use it. Then when you have consumed all of them it stays in your quick bar with a big red X over it. I would prefer that the item was removed from the quick bar when it was used up. Your quick bar has a very limited amout of space, only 8 slots, so you will be juggling things in a out all the time.8. Detail screens are split up into 4 different screens. In Tererria if you hit the esc key you see your inventory, weapon, item, and vanity slots and everything else. In Edge of Space you have to hit I for inventory, V for crafting, C for armor and item slots, and L for Experience. The 4 different screen also cover each other up and cannot be moved. So if you try and drap something from the inventory to the armor slot you have to juggle the two screen and make sure they are not covering each other or else it is impossible.9. The bug reporting system is lousy. When you go to submit a bug you fill out what looks like a standard email form with a place for your email, a subject, and a message. However it is extremely limited in that if you make a spelling mistake or want to go back and clarify something you cannot just use your arrows or mouse and go back to previous text. The only way to go back is to use the backspace key. This means you loose all your typed text up to where you want to change.All I can say is I am glad I bought this game on sale because if I had paid more than $5 for it I would be extremely upset. Right now I am willing to wait and see if it gets better.			"

								This game is probably one of the best games I've ever played. It is filled with content from start to finish, never once have I encountered a single bug. Did the developers forget to remove the early access tag? With how developed it is, it shouldn't be early access.I mean seriously one of the best well put together games, and its replayability? Unlimited.....simply unlimited. Terraria / Starbound can simply NOT compare to a masterpiece that is this game.This game makes Terraria look like an early access piece of junk. Same with Starbound.The tutorial explains everything so well, definitely the best tutorial I've ever seen in a video game before. The tutorial alone is worth playing the 13$ for, a lot of fun to be had. And it explains everything so well, with ZERO bugs.Oh also, the combat? It is simply spectacular, tremendous, this game makes GTA 5, Mad Max, Metal Gear Solid all look like pieces of junk (compared to this game), hell any does not stand to the greatness that is Edge of Space. If I could give this game to everybody, I would, everybody deserves to play this masterpiece of a game.			"

Not a very well-rounded GameRead past this first paragraph if you don't want to read what someone posted made up of hate comments and cranky statementsI only wish that steam would have accepted my refund request. They probably would have, if they ever played the game, and had access to the notes you can add if you say ""My reason isn't here"". I realize this game came out a long time ago, and I might like it more if there were actual guides on how to do stuff, rather than a little note saying what there is. Even if this game came out long ago, that just proves the developers are lazy and have no idea what else to do! Maybe post an in depth guide? Try doing something that hasnt been done many times before? Nope! They just went straight for clone of a game that is way better: Terraria. The only things I see different is that this game has some back story, and the scale of character to block is larger. And even then the developers are trying to only get good feedback by deleting every post with some negativity. I'm sorry, but this game needs some serious work to make it worth the money i'll never get back.                                                                                                               Now that that's out of the way, some things to fix: The scroll function is backwards, which gets annoying. They fact that there is an area that counters all exposure protection, completely takes away the usefulness of exposure protection, I never get any warning about exposure with Earthen Armor anyway! General Turk's (or was it Tuck? Turck?) introduction makes no sense, and I don't even know what happened after hes said to make a bunker! Was that it? Will I see him again? Or is he a useless NPC designed to make you annoyed and confused? The knowlegde tree that grants locomotion isn't all that useful, in that it take almost 200,000 experience to get to stuff that doesn't require a cloning machine, which is also near impossible to get, becasue I have no idea how to unlock the knowledge tree that grants you it! The Research knowledge tree also seems useless, what does it even do? All I see is a button to spend your EXP, and some pictures of guns. The decoration items should also be unlocked through the Base Constructor knowledge tree, because nobody wants to spend valuable EXP which can be used for much more useful things instead of a useless knowledge track that is only apealing to fashion freaks.After you play for about 4 hours, you just get stuck. What else can I do? What is there to find but a large background with clouds that never changes unless it becomes night? The game is just to empty or lacks hints as to what else you can do.Maybe reduce the amount of EXP it takes to unlock the Raptors? After seeing a screenshot of them I rapidly aquired EXP to get them only to find that i needed over 20,000 EXP to get access to them.Maybe add in a health regen system? This kind of game needs one otherwise you just get frustrated everytime you go underground and find a couple Lively Slime who are very hard to kill and reduce your health to about 1/4.Maybe add to the flying laser shark thingy (sorry I forgot his name, I feel really bad) an option that lets him explain the knowledge tracks more in-depth? Such as making an option that opens up another list of options for him to explain the knowledge tracks separately. Some of them are very confusing and seem like useless things made to confuse you (as I said before).I hope this review draws the attention of sereval developers, and for the Steam user looking for a game to check out: I wouldn't recommend this game until it's out of early access or unless you can find an in depth guide out there that tells you what you need in order to progress beyond what 5 hours can get you.Responses To Developers:LordShaggy:About Turk:He May have been triggered by me having what I think to be mid tiered weapons, such as the first Sniper Rifle available in-game, and the Assault Rifle-type weapon with a 35 round clip (both of these being researched under the weapons that require no ammo to be made)Although I would love to do internal testing for a game, I am sorry but I cannot ""go out"" to any streams, as I am actually only 13 and my mom or dad arent really interested in taking me anywhere.

								First time I loaded it up I created a char. When I started loading a new world it froze at 75%.Alt+F4. Tried again. Froze at 75%Reinstalled and tried again. Froze at 75%.Verified game. Still froze. Reinstall. FINALY it worked.Start off with a tutorial covering basics on how to move around the world and open things. Also gives you some info on how to use the UI. I found it pretty difficult to use myself. Then it moves on to the crafting system and has you make a ""laser pick"" out of dirt.... what? Okay whatever. The crafting system is pretty off the wall, I can deal with that.  Then you move on to the combat system tutorial using a gun you made out of dirt again. Some stationary targets then some moving ones... Odd test dummy looking guys running around backwards. After the tutorial you are dropped on a cluster of floating islands with some pretty rough enemies that you'll have to grind to get items to craft higher teir weapons/armor/tools. I understand this is still in dev and a lot has to be done. With that. I'll be back when things a a bit more smooth			"

												Edge of Space despite is bugs is still a good game to enjoy, the research system is nice, the craft system its easy to understand, the artwork is great in my opinion, the soundtrack is also good.This game is mostly a mix of Terraria and Starbound.I trully dont understand why the developers have abandoned this, they have got in hands a trully gem that with work and more developing could be better than the big two.Despite of all its a good game.+ Reserch System+ Graphics+ Soundtrack+ Simple craft+ Fairly content+ Got flying sharks :D- Some bugs- Abandoned game  I only recomend to buy this game with a big promotion, many times is 4€ here on steam.7/10			"

								This game's Multiplayer is very broken. Extremely broken. Has potential, but I only bought it to play with a mate; it lags immensily every time it generates, which is every 50ft or so in game. Couldn't get past the first world after the tutorial without disconnecting and uber lag. Has alot of potential, but at this stage, it's hella broken. The UI, launcher and worlds are unpolished; rendering it quite an ugly game (looks like it's made in gamemaker pro), network issues out the wahzoo; and performance issues even on the best of machines. This game could be good in the future, but for now, it's not even worth $0.99, let alone $15.00. Very dissappointing.			"

												DO NOT DOWNLOAD!The game starts off with a tutorial given to you by a cyborg shark who claims he is about to get eaten by floating jellies...Really mate?You can just tell by their progress screen ""7 Hardrive failures"" ""7 Tutorial Revamps"" ""40 Mental Breakdowns"" That this game is simply crap.The frame rate of this game is bullsh*t and my game can never keep up with the cursor even though my computer is gaming pc quality.The graphics are also bullsh*t and make you want to commit suicide for a game you got when it was 50% off.So then they decided ""Fu*k this fu*king bullsh*t game, lets just realise it and leave all the crappy software in it"" and then they ditched the game, made a cool looking intro video so it would lure people to the game.If the game was still in early access then I GUESS this would be acceptable even though it was in early access for...lets see here:812 Days (more then 2 years)Please do not make the same mistake I did and buy it because it looks similar to Starbound and Terraria. If you want a sc-fi sequel to terraria, then get starbound.If you recommend this game then you should go and see a doctor.			"

								At its current point, this game is not very good. I didn't pay for it, a friend did a while back when it was two for one sale. I played for a bit and I found it almost like terraria, except for less to do. The tutorials are annoying, and there are a couple of bugs that I noticed that make the game unplayable. Until those are fixed, not a great game.			"

								Sadly, I cannot recommend this game, especially not for 13 Euros, (yet).The game actually gives you one of the most tidious tutorials you could have, one that is unskipable for following characters, on top of that.And yet, the tutorial is absolutely worthless. You drop into a world with no goal and no idea how to unlock new technology, which is essential, to do things as simple as self-defense. You find yourself digging at a CRAWLING speed (pun intended) for materials, within an underground that is so dark, you will be wasting your huge♥♥♥♥♥torches like crazy.The wiki is pathetic and I couldn't find a website for servers.I would perhaps recommend Starbound, if they had ever sensibly lowered the price of their game, so I can recommend neither at the moment. Stick with Terraria.			"

												Updated Review (10/10/16): I tried to give it a chance. The only discernible difference from when I reviewed this game until now is there is just a lot more clutter on the planets. It's just not a good game and from what I can see the dev's have largely abandoned it. RIPNot worth it in it's current state. This was my first ""early access"" game before I even know what EA was, I unfortunately fell for the trap of some cool trailers and the incorporation of some Terraria elements, making me hope this was a Sci-Fi terraria. While the fundamentals are the same (a 2d minecraft), the execution is just not even close and the polish of the current state of the game is going to make me wait unto 1.0 release. Upon character creation and the 10+ minute load time (I timed it once) you're forced without choice to go through a tutorial which is extremely frustrating after a character whipe. It lays out the very basics which you then shortly forget and feel very lost in the coming gameplay moments. Building and equipment progression seems confusing and not very straight forward, it's difficult figuring out where to get some of the less common materials without just randomly digging and hoping to hit a vein and what exactly you should be building next. Unless they aren't implemented yet, the distinct biomes are non existent. I walked a bit away from my spawn point and jumped down a few ledges and started taking environmental damage. I presume this is a barrier to prevent you from digging a hole straight down (a-la terraria) and gathering the best materials within minutes of starting a new game. I'll update when the retail version is released but at this time I won't be spending anymore time with this game.			"

Early Access Review
								As someone who greatly enjoyed games like Terraria and Starbound i have to say this was a huge dissapointment, I bought this game for me and a friend to play and neither of us got as far as the multiplayer screen since there was a confusing and easily broken tutorial that was compulsary to access anything else which is just stupid. The graphics are quite laggy (Not a cause of my computer) and very jerky, the movement did not work in the slightest and i had to anticipate where my character would move to due to a 10 or so second lag in the control inputs. I had to play the tutorial itself about 4 times over to actually unlock the multiplayer and overall around 7 times as it became unplayable due to something missing or not loading.The gameplay elements seem very copied and remind me of a less playable version Starbound, the game itself just isnt worth the £9.99 and you could buy a much more worthwhile such as Terraria it self if you don't own it already. When i played it i got a certain something said by Yahtzee ""Terraria? Never heard of it and also we're sci-fi and therefor different to the thing we havn't heard of"" Which does describe this game perfectly. Putting the price at £9.99 for an unfinished, unplayable game such as this is stupid and £14.99 for the ""finished"" version (which will probably never actually come around) is even worse.Even though this game is only in ""BETA"" (moreso to an alpha) it won't be excused, plenty of ""Early access, BETA"" games are being pumped out and this is the worst of the worst and at a higher price than most. Although if you have someone on your friends list that you really hate you can gift this to them. To put it at an end, Don't buy this game, go buy something else			"

												So the crap hit the fan. Game is 1.0. So far:-You can't create new avatar or world at 800x600 resolution, cause buttons are cut out.-To change resolution you must restart the game.-World generation takes ages. 15 minutes later world still generating...-After  killing the game with task manager and running it again world finally loaded-If you want to play windowed 800x600 GUI elements and quest goals will cover most of your screen and half of your active bar wont be visibleWhen you place a torch on a block that block is indestructable. For real, if there is a teleporter just make a base walls covered with torches and its eternal. Looks a little better than in beta, but still design is archaic. I wont even bother to play any further as basic mechanics of building make this horrible, torch is standing on this block so even nuclear explosion wont destroy it. I must add that vechicles simply vanish when they get out of fuel...No words for this failed game, and no hope.Not worth the time and money at all. Stay away at all cost.			"

								Buggy, unresponsive, ugly, needs a UI update, inferior to Terraria and Starbound. I suggest either of those instead. No idea why Re-Digit decided that they wanted to promote this game instead of the far-superior Starbound which was created by an Ex Re-Digit employee (Tiy).			"

Early Access Review
								I got this on a sale and my only regret was getting a 4 pack of a game I now know for sure I cannot gift with a clean conscience. The early game plays nothing like the pretty screenshots and trailers. Instead you will be hard pressed to find the necessary materials and blueprints to progress down the tech tree. Only dirt and rock as far as the eye can see. And you cannot get everywhere you can see either: radiation exposure will keep you from delving deeper unless you craft the requisite playtime-padding gear. I get the feeling this game is deliberately padding its time so as to ration the little content it seems to have.Except for the artstyle, this game is outdone by the much similar Starbound, even though this has been on Early Access for much longer. And we all know how Starbound turned out.I should have learned my lesson to not trust Early Access no more. This just buries the remaining hope I ever had for such a model.			"

								I bought it because it was recommended by the creator of terraria.And so far, I am not really happy with it, I know it still in devellopment, but putting terraria stuff on it won;t make it better.I wish the creator would keep his own idea and be a bit more ""out of the crowd"" with more original concept.

												i wasted 10 dollars on this game to get a complicated and confusing hard drive waster. The game seemed like it would be alright but when i got it i had no idea what to do. But then the complete version came out and it deleted my old character and wouldnt allow me to create a new one. Making the game impossible to play . I dont know if this just happened to me or not but with my experience i highly do not recommend this game.			"

								UI is an unintuitive mess, progress is tedious within the first hour, there's no sense of direction whatsoever (labeling your game as a 'sandbox' is not a legitimate excuse for this) and the launcher barely works. That's always a good sign, right?Might be worth revisiting in the future especially since it's nice how crafting isn't particularly picky about material type, but for now? Not worth the headache.

								I tried this game, i really did.I bought this game because of the crossover event it had done with terraria and terraria is one of my favourite games, and the trailers and screenshots looked cool.However, once i had bought it it took about a few minutes to install but once i had started it up it took about 15 minutes just to load the intro level. Once i had actually started my own world i almost instantly found myself falling from a floating island into a pitch-black hole with no source of light except my mining tool's laser pointer which was next to useless. I looked around for possible solutions to this on the internet (getting out of the hole, being able to see more than 5 pixels of my surroundings at a time, etc.) but i couldn't find any good sites that really gave me a good solution.If you have bought this and expect it to be as good as terraria, please just don't waste your time on this game.

								Not so great at this moment of time in my opinion. Feels like alot of things are unfinished and won't get finished. I know its ""early access"" but I still feel there is nothing new in this game that hasn't already been done in other games, which also the other games have done better. In all fairness £10 for two copies isn't nothing to lose sleep over and you won't feel robbed but in that same context it's incouraging game developers to release these ""early access games"", take your money for a inferior product and never finish it. Abit of a rant I know so for my end view I wouldn't recommend it, if you want 2-D space crafting sandbox game maybe try Starbound.			"

								I would like to take this opportunity to call this game silly and bad. Terraria is better, cheaper, and the people who make it are nicer, so go get that instead. This is just not a good game, and to this day remains the one item of my library that I truly regret adding. With all others, I was intelligent about the purchase, and bought them only after careful research, playing of demos, reading of reviews etc. (or getting them in a bundle, of course)I learned these habits from my run-in with this game. I guess you should get it if you're constantly giving in to impulse buys, so that you may learn the ways of the Steam Ninja Lords. too silly, didn't read; 4/10 go buy Terraria or Creeper World 3, which is a great game			"

								I Can't Believe I payed 14.99$ for this last year.First of all, everything just doesn't fit in. The textures, the sounds, the mobs, literally everything. You can't even do much in the beginning, so why release it in this stage? It doesn't sound like it's a beta version. I wouldn't recommend buying this until it's fully developed and has a cheaper price.			"

								I would not recommend this game at this time, it is VERY dull within the first 3 hours, the first 30min-an hour you spend (if you play the tutorial) being told things that anyone who has played ANY other game like this for 10min could figure out. Needing to research the crafting recipes slows the game down a lot. The combat at the moment sucks, all weapons needing to reload and no weapons that are not guns, (that i have seen) and things to shoot that ether are to bloody small or move around so much you just kinda wag your mouse around and hope to hit them with one or two of your shots. These are just a few of my complanets but i don't want this to go on forever, i will finish this by saying I want this game to be good, but at the moment it just isent, Terraria and Starbound are just better games. 1/10 not worth the price, Its a 1-2 quid game being sold for 8 quid for the standard version or,  the bargen price for the special edition 15 smeging quid! When you can get both Terraria and Starbound for 15 quid, i would deffinitly recommend getting both of them over this game, at least fo the moment.			"

								Sorry Edge of Space, but I actually thought this would be cool. The moment I turned on the game, first of all, I noticed the graphics. Not to be super pushy or judgy about what others do that I can't, but it was like stereotypcal sidescrolling sci-fi graphics. Nothing too special. I begin a game. It's not very smooth and the gui controls are all over the place at first. I understand having tons of game mechanics is nice and all, but look at Terraria for example. They've got a pretty good idea of how inventory works. And lasty, It took a long time for my friend and I to connect and then meet up. I would've expected more from a game that boasted such an awesome trailer and feature list.			"

								the ""beta"" aspect is VERY evident here. right from the start, the intro videos have been butchered and ruined by horrible artifacting and pixelization. the UI is in terrible shape, and it has you reaching all over the keyboard way too often for various menus and functions, where things like right click, shift click, and altclick, are almost never used. its possible to pretty much trap yourself in the tutorial before it teaches you wiring, too, requiring you to start a new game. i dont reccomend it *yet* but if i see a lot of changes during development to improve the look, and make it more user friendly and intuitive, that opinion is open to change.

								This game is VERY VERY unpolished, i understand that beta is beta but this is just bad. The game starts you off with a gun that does hardly any damage and isnt accurate and gives you NO information on how to get a better gun. I sat for what felt like 5 minutes shooting one enemy. Also there is a system when you die, you use cryorods. You get 10 cryorods at the start and use one upon death, when you run out your character gets a stacking debuff that makes you weaker. To remove that debuff you need to use cryorods which the game once again fails to inform you on how to get more. I felt cheated out of my money.Wait for the finished game, right now it isnt even fun.			"

								it hurts to play this, when i heard it had terraria content i bought it thinking it be a good exspreince, the terrain genoration is litearly just tons of flying boulders so you are most likely to die from fall damage at the start then mobsalso the mobs can spawn anyware, and i do mean anyware i built my own house and the only sapce i had around me was a 1x4 block, i went afk only to return to be incapasitated ebacuse 4 mobs spawned next to me in a well lit room, its a anoying system.progression is hinderd not beacuse of difficult mobs but just gameplay itself.terrain is clunky, mobs are terrible at just being there (not difficulty), and yes the tuturial does not exsplain things properly.only hope in the future they sort this stuff out but its not worth the £9.99 i payed for and certainly not the $14.99 for the final product if it reamins in this state.

								I can't recommend this game to be honest, the game feels very unintuitive and unpolished. Of course it is in early access and various aspects of the game get improved and expanded upon but I bought this game quite a while ago and since then the progress has been rather slow, there are new refinements and added content but it usually ends in a large amount of bugs and other issues.Overall the game just feels to ""raw"" and has a lack of progress, there is no sense of progression or much to do. It's pretty bare bones at the moment and needs major work. So please, think twice before buying this game.On another note, the developers of this game seems extremely unprofessional at times as seen on the forums. Their way of talking to the customers is not acceptable in my opinion, they seem also be rather easy going instead of focusing on it. But don't let this judge your view upon the game.			"

								This is a game that was advertised to be like Terraria and Starbound but dosent feel like either, but i like some of the concepts. I know its in beta so i cant be too critical but i would like to see some of these cons fixed in the future...Cons--Plays like 20-30 fps, needs smoother animations-There is no on screen toolbar without pulling up a window-Some of the colors are off putting and too vibrant-Enimies can be very difficult to fight-Landscape is too scattered-Needs more explorable dungeons and different landscapes to feel that real sense of exploration that  Terraria and Starbound had Pros--Interesting Enviorments-Cool Weapons and Armor-Unique and Interesting Art StyleThere is some things this game does do really good at, but more that it does not. It almost feels like it's trying to hard to be like Starbound/Terraria and it's failing to be. I think this game has potential but at the moment is just does not stack up to what i expected it to be, so i cant recomend this game :(			"

												The game is simply too laggy to even bother with. While in-game, I seem to be locked at 6 FPS, with delayed sounds and actions. Controls are fine, intuitive, and dare I say the UI is pretty nice, but there's no possible way to play it without a computer made of adamantite and cooled with the lifeblood of the gods. 0/10.			"

Early Access Review
								8 Months and a BS marketing scheme later..and I finally have an opinion of this game.1.  Its still broken beyond belief.  They've had 8 months thus far to migrate the game over to its new ""format""...and they are finally getting multiplayer launched...which was promised back in July.Its still a pain in the butt to do anything in the game: the mining and gather is slow as molasis, the flow of the animations still feels like an old flash game, and they constantly have to ""rework"" the environment , monster spawns, etc.  Not just tweek it...but rework it.I just dread having to start over in that game, unlike in other games of the same ""genre"" like Terraria.   And considering how infrequent and archaic their update process is....restarting happens ...painfully often.2. Their latest marketing scheme to push dried up sales just kicks every Early Access owner in the jaw.  The people that adopted this game early...and tried their hardest to help improve the game....get called ""Entitled"" and  ""Trying to smear the companies good name"" by asking for their free copy of the game that they should get which is part of the new Early Access purchase.  No grandfathering the changes...just a solid FU tot he ones that helped make the game even possible (financially and development wise).Its not like this is a Game Lauch sale...or a 8 months from Retail Release sale; its still in Early Access...like it has been for the last 8 months....at the same exact price it was back in June/July.Yea...I can see why they dont want to give out the extra copies to the ones who already bought the game. Then they may not get any new sales imediately...because their game sales were already stagnant.  Whose the entitled one again?  This game and the comapny have been pretty ""stagnent"" since day one.  If they are trying a really big ""last ditch"" effort to generate sales before the game is even Launched .....while angering all the people who funded the game/company to get them to this point....it might speak a lot about the future of this company.

								So. I played this game for an hour or so about 6 months ago. Then, in the same day, played some multiplayer. It was then I realized how early the game was in developement still. So we didn't play it for a few months. After giving it a second try. We found out not much had been done. Don't buy this. Its not worth the head ache. The game has the nerve to compare it self to Terraria and offer so, so much less then it. But then want more then Terraria costs. I am a firm believer that early access games are a plague on PC gaming. This experience has confirmed that. Paying for beta? Get that♥♥♥♥♥♥out of here.			"

								Spend the extra cash to buy Starbound or go buy Terraria instead of this trash. Both Starbound and Edge of Space are in Beta, but it's painfully obvious which one is much better. This might be worth buying later on, but it definitely isn't right now. Do not waste your money like I did. I implore you not to buy this, at least as it stands right now. If you like this type of genre, you more than likely have played Terraria/Starbound/etc. Keep playing those, ignore this. Trust me. It's not worth it.EDIT: This came out on June 28 and it's almost a year later. From what I've played, it feels like it came out a few weeks ago. I'd hate to see the state this game was in last year.			"

								Not worth it. Just feels like a cheap rip off of Terraria and Starbound... which it is?I'm aware this is an early access game and I hate to give a beta game a negative review but...this game is SO boring. It is supposed to be similiar to Terraria and Starbound but it falls VERYshort of making any attempts to surpass them. I cannot even force myself to play this game for any longer than the amount that I did. The goals in the game are in a codex you have to READ to really understand what your next stepis to continue or progress. It just seems lazy to me to force a player to read paragraph after paragraph explaining what to do. This was a huge turn off for me and I regret not doing more research beforeinvesting in this. Other comments have mentioned that there is room for improvement, but I'm goingto be brutally honest and say that this game needs a HUGE overhull to give it any actual potential. "

								this game made me sucidal. i attempted to shoot myself, but the gun did not shoot. so i pointed the gun down, and accidently shot myself. i fell face first onto the monitor still showing the ♥♥♥♥ing piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥""edge of space"".  the desk collasped around me, and my ddog came up to me. the broken pieces of desk made my dog break his two legs and i laid there. eventually the ambulance came and took me in it the back of it. however the game was so bad that the ambulance crashed right as i said the name, ""edge of space"". during the fiery crash, i lost a limb. my family seen my bloody body lying in the street and killed themselves from the stress. i got to the hospital by nawing off my left leg that was trapped under the ambulance. i crawled with one arm and one leg to the hospital, that was four miles away. the nurses jumped out of the window when they seen me crawl into the emergency room. the doctor asked what happened, and i stared him deeply in the eyes, and said ""edge of space"". thats when the nurse arund and he was the joker, and the hospital suddenly combusted into a giant mushroom cloud. my entire life is now a armless, legless, bloody mess due to this game. do not buy.

								Do not buy this game, period. It says it's in beta, hardly, try more like alpha. Virtually none of the systems are in place. They  list pets as a current feature? It's a droid that circles around you and does nothing. Loads of various armours and weapons? There are 4. Yes I played it for 51 hours, but only because I kept trying to figure out how to do things. For example it says on the wiki page that you need to build an O2 generator to fight exposure. Guess what? It's not implimented.Do youself a favor and wait for Starbound.			"

												meh.First, this is just an opinion of mine. Second, others may feel completely different then me about this game.I bought this way back in the beginning on desura when it was just a wee pup. Did some basic exploring, fell a million feet to the hard crusty core a million times, got bored and didn't touch it for a couple years. I thought the final game would be well rounded with some good end game content and perhaps missions etc, what I see here is the same boring game from day one. I.... just... coundn't... get into it. Game progression was dismal. I haven't found any cool structures or bases or bosses or anything other than stupid space jellyfish and floating orbs of death. I dunno, perhaps if I put in an additional 100 hrs I'll find all that I'm missing in the game but ain't nobody got time for that. I say buy it on sale if you really want a go at it or else find a more polished 2d minecraft-esq game.Pros:The graphics are pretty awesomeThe creatures are very originalYou can build huge fortressesYou can craft a whole lotta sh.... stuff.Multiplayer!!Cons:Quite boring playing soloEnviroments are very much the same as far as I could tellNo actual story line or Lore to keep me intrigued in the world I was living inNo NPCs to interact with, buying selling of goods and suchNo Goals that I could findNo real point to playing.... I feel sh... bad saying it but there it is.... Sorry Devs, I really hoped it would turn out better.  I wish there was a ""Not Yet"" button in the recommendation field. Keep my money though, at least you finished developing the game. I'll check back next year and see what improvements you have made.PS: I thoroughly support the development of indie game such as this and while I particularly am not satisfied with EoS, I would still pay full price for this game just to see more like it come into the light and to keep 2d platforming alive.LONG LIVE METROIDVANIA GAMES!!!!!

The Special Edition has one purpose: It allows for those who wish to show extra support for the game to do so. While you feel negatively toward the game, others don't share your opinion, and have been very excited to score some extra items while showing they were behind us. Just like all the knock offs before it this game has failed to even come close to the original.... which is sad because the promises the devs made for this game and how it looked like it would shape up to be would have made this game amazin :(			"

								After convincing him the game would be amazing, my dear friend Mason purchased four copies of this game for us and some friends. After only 10 minutes of playing, we all concluded this game was nothing but♥♥♥♥♥♥ I swiped my computer from my desk and it crashed onto the floor. I'm typing this review on a new computer I had to buy because of this game. We have all become very depressed, and Mason has even killed himself with satanic symbols drawn in his room and bloody scripture written on his wall that said ""Edge of Space."" I attempted to throw myself from a bridge but was stopped. I have developed paranoia, mild insanity, and depression from this game. One of my friends has been put into a mental asylum and the other has been caught using any blunt object to beat the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of himself.

												I've heard a lot of people express their fear that this game might become another Starbound- to those people i can say that they put out a different trick, which in the end yields the same result.You see, the game is in ""1.0"", it's a released game, however the amount of bugs and the complete lack of any form of polish will make you think you're playing a tech-Alpha.It's an unfinished game, and that's really all i can say.I've had people tell me the devs are actually nice guys and that they put a lot of work into the game, that they're dedicated and have been steadily developing ever since the game was announced, but i honestly can't see how someone dedicated to their work could put out something like this for the world to experience and associate with them.However if that really is the case, i'm sorry for the harsh review and i hope to see something better from them sometime soon.

												Ok......The review.......Mixed?????Before anyone else bashes this game more for being ""Terrible"" hear me out, this game was released September 17, 2015 which I remind you this game before hand had been worked on for a consecutive 4 years before its release.The reason I bring the release date up is that the popular game ""Starbound"" came out on Dec 4, 2013 and yet it has yet to have come out of early access.To remind you Edge of space yet it came out earlier got out of early access faster then ""Starbound"".Another important issue to point out is how people after buying The ""Edge of Space Special Edition"" complained about not getting the content immediately, let me remind you that a game is very difficult to program and create a whole new game from scratch,Oh yea and if you want to see how much was put into this game look at the The ""Edge of Space The Journey through early access"" image.I am one of the not many people on steam who will accept any game no matter what it is . In my oppinion this game is great because it has just the right amount of content.A message to everyone on steam before you rate a game think about how it took this person or team hours of their own time to create the game you are criticizing.

												So I come to find out yesterdays negative review has been deleted.  Today v1.0 came out. Ever hear the term 1 step forward, 2 steps back. Prime example here. The tutorial is no longer available. Just some message flash on the screen, too fast for me to read. and off to combat you go.You get 5 exps for every block you dig, it varies for plants and none for combat to a maximun of 5k. If you go over 5k, you don't get any more exps until you spend what you have. Techs start out at 500 exp cost and go up from there.They've removed the graphic pictures of the items in the crafting window. You can no longer match the icon with what you're crafting with what you already have. So unless you know the game well or remember everything, you'll probably end up crafting the same item twice.I took an instant dislike to this game when I found out they use ""OR"" ""AND"" ""NOT"" and some other gates to get your power working. Seriously!!? You shouldn't have take a electronics class to understand how to use power in a game, after all it's only a game that supposed to be fun, not a lesson in science. Some of the items have the same name. For example, the Bosom Blaster, it's in 2 different tech tables, Phased Weapons and Research 1. So apparently I have to buy it in both locations in order to build it. This part really isn't clear to me.The other thing I don't like is in the tech tree is that there are no stats for the weapons. So it's hit or miss as to what weapons you research.Frankly for me, it's too much grind and repetativesness and not engaging enough to want to come back and play this game more often.			"

								Beware, this game is utterly broken!I tried to set up a server and play with a friend of mine.We didn't even get half way through the tutorial...My friend got stuck when the tutorial wants you to open a door by pressing a button.The problem being that neither the button is highlighted nor is anything in the room actually able to be interacted with.After randomly jumping around the room for quite some time while hammering the F-key, the door miracoulously opened for me.(It never did that for my friend)But I got stuck in the next room when the game tells you to craft a laser something, which turned out to be impossible without having the required materials...Needless to say that the game does not provide you with any materials at this point and even goes ahead telling you that everything is alright....until you continue along the tutorial (and some rather poor jokes about antibiotics) and are forced to use that laser something.(Which - you guessed it - you don't possess because the game failed to provide the needed materials)That was around the time that we decided to quit and wait for several rounds of patches and bug fixes.To be quite frank: if the game utterly fails to guide you through a 100% scripted (and hopefully tested!) environment, how on earth would it be able to accomodate all the random stuff that we would hopefully have done outside of the tutorial?!

												Do not purchase this game.Now that you've got a conclusion, let's cover the reasoning.  This game is, at best, a pre-beta.  It's not stable enough to be a beta, the mechanics are either half broken or entirely unbalanced, and the game lacks enough content to be playable.This game is unstable, and runs poorly even on a beast of a machine (3930k and 7970 GPU).  I've had numerous crashes, and the game occasionally just hangs for a minute.  During that time I've been destroyed by numerous enemies, lost progress, and lost items. The crafting system is entirely broken.  Enemies level up several orders of magnitude faster than your equipment can.  There's no invincibility mechanics, so a swarm of enemies can strip even a well equipped character in seconds.  You bounce when an enemy hits under you, so you can be air juggled to death.  Numbers mean nothing.  You start with a paltry heath and shield, but coming back with 10 times bettter stats doesn't make you live longer, because the game occasionally just spawns a dozen enemies around you.  All of this is predicated upon oyu exploring, but that's realy a joke because any upgrade past to most basic will require hours of random tunneling to get anything.  The real kicker is the crap weapons.  You have to craft ammo, but even worse the weapons requiring ammo aren't great.Content has recently been dramatically expanded.  The waiting for resources to process has been removed, and there's more to make.  Unfortunately again, this is useless.  You spend huge amounts of time now searching for resources, to synthesize into other resources, to synthesize into useable goods.  After all of that grind, you're left with gear which still allows the enemies to absolutely curb stomp you constantly.  If the point of this game is crafting, then they really need to go back and rebalance enemy strength, progression rates, and the insane cost of items.  There's no reason that you shouldn't have all research completed prior to finishing the second area, and even if you do some of the end game items require an amount of resources which literally exceeds those present on a single biome.  In a single sentence: this game is fundamentally broken and the rate of progression indicates that we'll see completed project in a few years at best.Negative comments generally warrant some thought.  In the case of a review, you should provide the people who made the prokect a way to fix it.  Let's start there.1) Stop trying to be Terraria.  You've got guns with and without ammo, crafting, and resource gathering.  That doesn't mean you are as good as Terraria, and you shouldn't invite the comparison.2) Ditch your current crafting system.  It requires too many diverse resources, it's convoluted, and there's no 1:1 comparison for item utility.  Combining that with the random nature of weapons means I can get a weapon worse than my current one, while spending much rarer resources.  That's frustrating, but what's even worse is having dozens of different armors that show no clear progression.  You've got a needlessly complex system, too many resources, and none of it is balanced.  Stop adding more, and just get the bare bones in place.3) Rebalance enemies.  They're cheap, their spawns are a giant middle finger to the player, and more often than not they have too much health.  Spending 45 minutes fending off the Head Hunter boss isn't a challenge, it's a gruelling grind.  This particular point is arguably compounded by the crap weapons choice.4) Develop the game.  I'm going to be blunt here, you aren't putting any appreciable effort in here.  It may actually be huge from your side, but I can't see it as the consumer.  In almost a year I'm still dealing with poor balance, no content, and unfulfilled promises.  Either discontinue the game, or finish it.  Right now this is looking to be an alpha we have to bay for, that will never be up to beta standards.  I can tell you that I'll never be giving another cent to anyone involved with this project unless they've got a completed game.  This extended beta is absolutely worthless, because its triumphs are drowned in a sea of failure and unfinished code.After 3 separate returns to this game, I'm done.  You don't deserve anyone's patronage, unless you can tell us when we're going to get something worth the money.  This garbage surely isn't.			"

								This review is for the beta product. I intend to return to the game once it is fully developed and see if it has been improved upon, but this review is for people considering purchasing the beta version.I want to like this game the way I want to like every Terraria clone. Maybe this game will be good one day. Right now, it is not. The menu system is needlessly complicated and completely counter-intuitive. One thing I imagine will sadly not improve is the art design. Personally I play way more indie games than AAA titles - high end graphics aren't a selling point to me. But there is doing low res graphics well, and then there is this. It is terribly ugly to look at. If you want to spend money on one of these work in progress space Terraria games, Starbound is the only one worth paying actual money for currently.			"

								One of the worst games I've ever played, Beta or not.  Performance is horrible given the power of the gaming pc it's being played on.  Crashes extremely frequently.  User Interface is such a hassle to work with. Audio skips constantly, deaths are far too frequent, and several items that have appeared as collected on the screen never appeared in my inventory.  Bought this on a whim since I loved starbound and terraria and the latest version is supposed to include terraria content.  Too bad I can't stand this game enough to even get that far.  Perhaps when this is past Beta, I'll try it again, but this is abysmal.*EDIT* 11/27/14As of my last attempt at playing the game, many of the above issues had been rectified.  Performance is no longer sluggish, crashes are much more rare, the audio no longer skips, and dying is harder to do unless your early game gun's stats roll poorly.  I'm glad to see a developer actually working on their early access title and improving it greatly.  Unfortunately, the interface and structures in the game are not intuitive nor simple to use like other games in this genre.  Terraria took some getting used to, but it at least had a learning curve.  I sadly have to stick by my negative recommendation on this one.			"

												Nice intro. Nice music in intro and main menu. Too bad that here end the nice things and game begins.This game took lots of inspiration from Terraria. Developers analyzed flawlesly what is the best about Terraria - the open, proceduraly generated world, great combat system, pixeled but detailed graphics, massive crafting, home building, interesting and very different bosses, etc, and with expert precision took it all out.The combat system is bad, your greatest enemy are not the very few mobs, but aiming system, reloading and limited energy. The game is far from polished, it looks like beta+, not full release. Graphics are relatively nice and detailed, but for some reason look worse then Terraria. Crafting is on one hand better - you don't search wiki for recipes, but that is the only plus it has. World generation is strange,  on one hand looks completely unnatural, on the other is hard to navigate and the way jetpack is implemented is not helping you. There is no real need to build your home - at best you create long flat terrain to place your factories at.I could continue, but enough is enough. I Can't recommend this game. Maybe, maybe in a year, if they fix the bugs, mobs, world generation and combat, it will be interesting game. Of course, such complete overhaul is very unlikely.Edit: played mostly in offline mode, so real time playing doesn't display in Steam.			"

								This game has alot of bugs to work out, regardless of the buy one get one, this company needs to see no further purchases till they invest some time fixing issues. Constant crashes while both solo and running dedicated server have caused me to simply ""wait till further improvments"" before playing anymore. Also there needs to be a solid way to dictate where the game saves its server information as many of us do not want it in our ""Roaming"" folders. As of 3/9/2014 still a thumbs down IMHO.			"

												Deep down inside there might be a great, fun, crative, and expansive game here, however it doesn't present itself in an approachable manner. Games in this genera are good at letting us learn how to play the game and create things as we go along, which gives players a feeling of accomplishment. This one makes use of endless text boxes, intro videos, and gathering quests. Usually this would make me feel like I'm being patronized, but I still have no idea what I am supposed to be doing. I think it suffers from trying to do too much too quickly, which makes it exhausting approach. I'm trying not to compare it to Terraria, because clearly they were trying to go for something different, which is great, but it still has some work to do.			"

												I have not played this game in about a year, so I decided too re-install it, and look at it, as well as the reviews... and I see nothing has changed. It's still the confusing heap of garbage it was a year ago. The dev's seem to have abandoned this game. The game still feels like it's in an Alpha stage. It's choppy, the sprites are glitchy at times, and the amount of work you need to do to be able to get anything, it's outrageously difficult.I had been an avid Minecraft and Terraria player, having LAN parties with my friends. We had beaten Minecraft, and had beaten all the regular bosses in Terraria. Then, one of them found this game. It looked cool, so we bought the game, and ran it. 5-7 hours in, and we still have the basic tools. None of us could figure out how to upgrade them, or get new tools! All the crafting involved electrical gates the technicians use!! We ended up abandoning the game, and never spoke of it again.So, unless you're a senior technician that knows electrical gates by heart, don't waste the $15 on this game.On another note: Terraria is about 250 mb. Edge of Space of a little over 2 Gb. Terraria has hours upon hours, upon hours of gameplay, with lots of replayability, and an active online community. Edge of Space has very little content, very little to no online presence, and actually very hard to set-up a server for. Hmm, I wonder what the better choice is....If you don't know what Terraria is, and just found this game by surprise, get Terraria.---EDIT---So, another year has passed, and my friends decide to check this game out again. From what I've seen, and remember of this game, it has defintely changed, for the better. The crafting is easier to understand, the leveling up system, albeit a bit demanding and stops gameplay, is pretty interesting. The gunplay is great, the mining system could use a bit of work, and the UI is still pretty bad with my only issue being that every individual thing, such as inventory, crafting, skills, etc., requires a different button to press in order for that specific menu to come up(how hard could it have been for it to just open up with one button, and have different tabs for everything?).Me and my friends played this for about 5 hours straight, and we all said that it is definitely fun. Though there are still issues, the game is in a playable state. But... I don't think mutch will change in the future, unless these developers are secretly working on this without giving updates, as the last form of any game update was last year(April 28th 2015, if I remember correctly), while the last time a dev spoke about the game(on steam at least), was 2 months ago(April 25th). The post said that they were sorry for being silent about the game, and that logistical issues came about, and that they would get back to the playerbase and explain what was happening. Well, it's been 2 months. Where's the explanation?tl;drIn the state this game is in currently, I still wouldn't recommend this to anyone. Unless you have a group of friends to play with, know how to portforward(because Hamachi doesn't work), and have some extra money laying around, then don't buy this game. It still seems like the developers have abandon this game, or don't have a whole lot of motivation for it.I would still rather play Terraria.			"

								What can I say... I bought this with a hope of having a experience similar to Terraria, since they were in parcery with Re-logic and hadding Terraria based content.But I only got disappointement!The menu with your items is confusing! In the start, once you get in the planet It's very difficult to stay alive, mostly cause of weakass weapons, and the mining takes too much time for the same reason! Both tools and weapons are poor in perfomance!But I didn't judge like that cause in the future you would take better stuff... right?Nope! To upgrade anything, It takes amounts of various materials, not to mention:-the time to mine them (is slow)-search for them (too much time)-you have to walk FAR to find more, go into holes and a maze of caverns, making you lost from your outpost.-limited area (that radiation thing that kills you when you go too much down)-enemies stronger than you (and weak weapon)And if you fail for the first time, you will notice you actually got lives!YEAH! LIVES! Who puts lives on a game based of Terraria?!But you can make more ""lives"", but you will have to decide on what to do next! Spend your materials in making lives and search materials so you can upgrade your weapons, armor and tools, but you will end up lost, surrounded by enemies, and you will eventually will die. Then, you must do more ""lives"" so you don't lose your progress!Repeat this times and times! That was my game! A vicious cycle of losing, nerves, and boredom...I don't recommend this game...Play Terraria instead... they never disappointed (at least me) with their updates and content... "

												Edit: There seem to be a lot of positive changes recently but this game is something for people that really want to comitt themselves into learning and finding out everything, readability and introduction are still making it very hard to get into the game. The fact that the setting has all sorts of crazy sci-fi things of which you do not know what they do makes it even harder to understand what is going on. I don't doubt that there is a lot of content and depth (and fun) if you want to comitt to the game,but the usability and general UX / interface (+ missing visual consistency) makes it very hard to get going , and this was not a comittment I personally was willing to make and did not get over the first 15 minutes as of this big initial hurdle.

								So far i cannot reccomend this game. Pros:- controls feel nice- art style is nice- flying fox that holds a lamp. pretty cool.Cons:- Game atmosphere isnt their- music is average- sounds are poor- Little direction to what to do. Yes i know you can explore and mine, but i mined stuff and explored several cave's and only encountered crabs and jelly fish, neither offering any chance of a worthwhile reward for my discovery/victory.As it is, i feel i wasted my money and i should have read my reviews prior to my purchase. Comparing this game to something like terraria or starbound cannot be done because they properly immerse the player into the game and make you feel at home with the great sounds/music. The game however is being updated frequently which is really nice so if any descent patches come out after my review, you may be able to ignore my review all together, as i too hope to see this game become something awesome.

Early Access Review
								As I’m sure you can see I have only played about an hour of Edge of Space before I uninstalled it and asked for a refund. I cannot claim to know almost anything about the game itself in terms of if it has storyline, how good the mechanics are later on in the game or what kind of a sandbox it is. I’m simply writing about my experience with it and what I should have done to avoid this. Personally what I didn’t like about the game which is unfortunate for the developers was the introduction. The thing that really allows you to make your first impressions (excluding the tutorial of course), sum up what your experience with this game is going to be like, how everything works etc. I had no problem with the tutorial. I very much enjoyed the general mechanics of the game. I liked how it works, I also could get used to the overall ‘look’ of the game and how it varies from Terraria’s cute pixels. However as soon as I started the actual game itself it all went down-hill. When I spawned I was confused. “Where was I?”, “What was going on?” I was hoping for some kind of guide (yes, like in Terraria. *sigh) to help me however I was instead met by a distressed, flying, talking shark who after saving politely asked me to make him a toothbrush out of uranium or something. Now, I DO NOT like the addition of quests and things like that on a sandbox. (And again it’s my fault for not watching or reading any reviews) so I was annoyed that I had been restricted already so soon into the game. I like having freedom in a game however a clock timing me down to gather materials to make a toothbrush was very annoying to say the least. However this not what annoyed me, no what annoyed me was the fact that I could not find any Uranium anywhere. So I decided to screw the quest thing and do what I had bought the game for. Explore a new alien world, and have no idea what to expect. However I soon fell off a cliff and almost died. Then I fell off another cliff. And another. And another. It was only then that I realised I must have spawned on the top part of the picture in the Menu of the game where there are many floating islands. I didn’t like this at all as I felt I was restricted to the area island where my spawn was. It didn’t feel like one big map for me to explore, rather different areas I would have to go to as the game progressed. So I decided I would go as far as possible and see if I could find a dungeon or something. After mining things from pretty far away from the spawn point I was told I had a full inventory. So I moved some stuff into the bin last of which was a block of ice which after being deleted I thought nothing off. However when I looked back into my hot-bar, my mining laser had been replaced by this ice. And as there don’t seem to be any instructions beyond the simple things shown in the tutorial I had no idea how to get my mining laser back into my hotbar. The UI was extremely confusing and I was rapidly losing my patience with it. I then killed myself again and spawned back to pod only to realise random things in my inventory were now ice. On top of all of this you cannot move anywhere in the map without being constantly attacked by flying jellyfish and millions of little ‘wolf things’ on the floor that are much faster than you meaning they start to accumulate faster than you can seem to kill them. All this just seemed rather unprofessional and I still had no idea what the hell was going on and why a flying, talking shark needed uranium for his toothbrush. The gameplay was not at all what was displayed in the second trailer and the story so far involved a talking shark. Was he to be my guide??? I just wanted to get to the building, exploring and killing bosses part. I suppose it's maybe just not that sort of game.It’s not that the game was ‘bad’ as such it’s just that I believe the trailers were a bit misleading within the fact that one shows a Terraria like style of gameplay where your character is free to build and explore and the other shows a very interesting backstory that looked pretty prominent and seemed like something you would progressively learn about throughout the game through recruiting NPC’s, slaying bosses etc. None of this was in the introduction.It’s entirely my fault that I neglected to look into the game before I bought it. In all honesty I am basically one of those people who just wanted a ‘Terraria in space’ thing. I should have watched other people play it before I blindly went in and bought it. The main two reasons I bought it Edge of Space over Starbound was A) It was £5 cheaper or so, ( ͡ᵔ ͜ʖ ͡ᵔ ) :D and B) I know the lead developer is a friend of Redigit and had permission to use some Terraria bosses (which makes my Terraria in space fantasy even more realistic) and must mean it will have some Terraria qualities. I know that the game is still in Early Access so is obviously far from perfect, but I just expected better. I suppose the whole point of Early Access is so that people can post their constructive criticism and the developers take it into account. So maybe I will purchase the game again when it’s properly released. I just wish the game had a little more freedom from the start, coincidently just like Terraria does (*another sigh) and not have a random quest to make a toothbrush for a shark out of uranium. Either way, make sure you WATCH GAMEPLAY for Edge of Space before you buy it because it can be different from what it seems. (I'm no proffesional, I just wanted to get my opinions out there!)Thanks for reading!!!*Edit: Just thought I would say that Steam did promtly give me a refund for my purchase within about 2 hours.

												Great game. Stop expecting it to be like starbound. In my opinion, it is way better than starbound. It is not starbound and never will be. So if you want some starbound replica go away. Want reasons?Lazer sharksSkeletron PrimeAwesome styleYou can't just get an endgame item by getting the materials.			"

Early Access Review
								Im giving this game a maybe for playing. Theirs barely any difference from this vs terraria. Oh wait their is, just a radiation exposure bar, and the game seems to be styled around metroid graphics.Onto the real review. Okay basically your use to terraria, starbound, or minecraft. You assume you have the basics of building, thats check.Now you assume you have the basics of base building, that is... barely check. You have a command center, but your given no real idea how it works, or how to use it. 0 Explanation behind it. (HINT) it supplies 2 available slots for structures that require power (Which AGAIN are not defined, nor explained) how to mine or make adjacent to a powered block (and to do that you need to mine the back, currently the mining in the background has been switched to TAB key).Anyway... now assume after base building is scrapped, most of what you seen in the pictures, or the trailer video is either not implemented yet or considered non user useable. Thats... thats just false advertising. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME based on the trailier. You will be SEVERELY disappointed if you do!Anyway, other than this review just remember... with a grain of salt.  Comparing this game to minecraft is laughable at best, as minecraft is one of the most fleshed out, well prepared games out their for survival. Just its block based graphics.With Starbound you get the perks of it having terraria gameplay with a twist, mechs, turrets, space ship home & planetary home combine with world travelining leading to finte adventures.With Terraria you get alota building functionality but... only one world, on the upside in Terraria you also get to transfer items on your character with you to other servers.With this game Edge of Space you... get working building mechanics (barely anything to craft though), good music (when its not tearing horribly or desyncing), horribly slow mining, extremely aggressive enemy npcs that fight you based on how far down you go, and how pre-occupied you are not paying attention to your surroundings, and limited idea of how to really play altogether with out continued communication through the steam forums with other players, and the developer(s)/staff of Edge of Space.If you want this game buy it, i bought 2 copies, but now im beginning to regret my investment considering how much is lacking, how much is currently missing, and what is functional, works, and what isnt combine with all the time lost to just... well... mining, searching, and trying to figure out this game altogether with searching the steam forums, and trial and error in the game itself. Anyway good luck!Oh and so far it runs for me on a Asus Transformer T100 series (1.83ghz quad core, 2gb ram) with 15minutes load time, and on low/normal graphics (on my other laptops/desktops) the game runs at normal/high. Lag doesn't seem to be existant in any gameplay on this game on any of the computers i've tested it with (all being at 1.83ghz, 4.2ghz, or 3.9ghz quad core) computing systems.*Note*Still consider this game and check back on it though! It does show promise assuming alot of the negatives i've listed, not including thousands of other negatives listed in the forums are taken care of.			"

Early Access Review
								Edge of Space needs significant improvement before I would recommend that anyone purchase it. The controls are nonintuitive, the interface feels too small and crowded, and currently the game feels like a bad Terraria clone. Your money would be better spent on Starbound if you're interested in this theme.EDIT: Just went back and played through the tutorial after several months. Everything looks and feels the same. The game is as cumbersome as ever and I did not enjoy trying to get started playing. Once you leave the tutorial level, it is unclear what you're objective within the game is. I had heard mention of UI improvements, but to me, everything looks exactly the same. I don't know if I'm supposed to play this game with a wiki page open, telling me step by step how to play it all the way through or not. I will admit that Terraria and Starbound have you basically playing with the wiki open as well, but Edge of Space seems to offer very little encouragement when you actually get into the game. Upon exiting the tutorial I was beamed down to the surface of what I assume was a planet, and immediately attacked by floating jellyfish who took a frustrating amount of time to kill. I was given no actual objective, only tossed forward into this environment with very little explaination.Bottom line: I would not recommend edge of space to anyone. I bought the 4-pack when it went on sale and after playing the game informed my friends that they should not waste any bandwith or hardrive space on it. This game has EXTREMELY cumbersome controls (double tap 'x' to pick up a torch? Really?), lacks visual pop, and has poorly designed UI. Do not purchase this game. Go get Starbound. Some have said that Starbound is a glitchy, dead project. This is untrue. The game is very entertaining with a few friend and totally worth your time.I understand that this game is still in early access but it needs so much more work before anyone should play it. I've owned it for a long time and am still waiting for any significant progress to take place.			"

												Performance on even modern pcs is horrible, which is odd since the game isnt all that great looking, on top of that there are so many arbitrary resources needed and your inventory is so small.... And moreso irritating useless flying enemies by the dozens constantly aggroing as you miss a few shotsIn short, Unless Big Improvements to the afformentioned happen I couldnt in good concience reccomend itWasnt even worth the $6 I spent, having played it for a couple hours or so I would wait to buy it till its full release, when its hopefully as good as its concept makes me hope it will beUpdate on 4/19/2016With the last update being several months ago and no word (that I can find) about the next it seems to be another case of lure in with Early Access switch to released (when its far from it) when the cash flow slows and then ditch it, Thanks to games like this I no longer trust early Access games, I wish I could get my money back...

Posted: December 17, 2015
												I’ve delved into many sandbox games, both 2D and 3D. I’ve built castles, small huts, underground hideaways, and structures that could only be described as half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥shelter attempts. In most cases you can scrape by and learn the game yourself without needing outside help, but certain games are nearly impossible without some form of guide or wiki. Edge of Space is a 2D sci-fi action sandbox game developed by Handyman Studios and was released on Steam September 17th, 2015. If you’ve played Terraria or Starbound, you’re probably familiar with the gameplay, but don’t think you will understand the entire game based on the experience you’ve gained from other games like Edge of Space.You are an Ark corporation operative, one of many soldiers sent throughout the universe to essentially conquer and terraform other planets to make them more habitable for mankind. After awakening on your ship after a long cryosleep through the universe, you discover that your ship has gone off-course from its original destination and disabled itself near a strange alien planet. Finding few options left, you take the escape pod to the planet below to find a way to survive.When you first touch down, the game gives you a tutorial of sorts. Using a laser-wielding shark as the first quest giver, you are introduced to gathering materials which forces you to explore the surrounding areas to gain resources. The best part of Edge of Space is the use of resources. Almost all resources are useful, even dirt. Edge of Space uses a tier resource system that doesn’t always specify a resource, but rather subcategories such as organic or mineral for crafting. The more I play, the more I wish other games of the same genre would use this style of crafting!The number one issue in any sandbox building game is the unbelievable number of absolutely useless materials that do nothing but waste space, but Edge of Space finally gives the item purpose with subcategory crafting. Crafting is a huge part of the game, but when you start off you only have a handful of recipes you can craft. This is where science comes in! Almost every task you perform gives you science experience such as crafting, mining, and fighting.You start with an experience bar with a max of 5000 experience which will get you pretty far, but you’ll definitely want to do some of the terraforming events around the world to bump up that maximum amount. You can not collect more science experience while it’s maxed, so any action you perform while you have max experience is wasted.You can use science experience to purchase more recipes for any category you wish, and the endless experience you can gain in the world means you can max out each tech list if you put in enough time and effort. Science experience is a more efficient way of leveling that lets the player customize their characters unique item build. Minecraft may have started this trend with the ability to add enchantments to your weapons with experience, but Handyman Studios perfected it with science experience and tech trees.You’ll notice the three bars in the top left of the game which are Health, Shield, and Energy.  Health and Shield should be pretty obvious, with Health being the damage threshold your character can take before death, and Shield, which has a short delay before regenerating, is a secondary bar that negates damage first before Health is affected.Energy can be used for a variety of things, but they will all use the same Energy pool. Energy weapons and your Jetpack both consume energy, which regenerates much like the Shield, when not in use. Health and shield are obviously a staple in any game, but having energy that can be used to power escape and combat is a pretty interesting mechanic.Making players choose how to use a resource in real-time is a great idea, and more games need to put players in clutch situations, because it makes for hilarious results if you don’t master it properly. As you start getting more into the meaty insides of Edge of Space, you’ll learn how to handle a power grid and set up connections between hubs around the planet.Exploration is a huge part of the game, but it is also the most hazardous. Apart from the local enemies that you find around the world, you will also find bases of sorts that count as quests on the right side of your screen, and require you to clear the enemies spawners littered around the area, then either plant or disarm bombs. These bases can be used as a way to get cosmetic resources and science experience, so it’s a great way to rest up and relax after a hardcore digging session.As you travel around, you will discover NPCs that will need your help. Before you can accept their quests, you need to craft their anchor and place it in your base. Most NPCs are useful and will give you rewards or add something to your base, such as Vinny, a plant that provides light in a small radius around him.What really hooks a player onto a sandbox game is the multiplayer. Sadly, the multiplayer is a mess, with an unfathomable amount of bugs. Running a dungeon with other players is unbearable, and not even worth attempting in the current state of the game unless you like getting stuck in random dungeon loops, or getting stuck in a black void and crashing.Edge of space could be one of the best sandbox games I’ve played, but sadly it is bogged down by an enormous amount of bugs. Handyman Studios is constantly throwing out new updates and attempting to fix the bugs, but it is a bit ridiculous that a game that was in early access for so long still has so many. I feel like I would have appreciated Handyman Studios more if they either stayed in early access longer, or went back into early access until the game is functional for more than two hours.I tried hard to love this game. Handyman Studios is still putting a ton of work into so I’m hoping I can start up Edge of Space one day and play it with my friends without something terribly wrong happening. Normally, you could just wait for the Early Access tag to come off before you buy a game, but they took the training wheels off this bike too early. If Edge of Space appeals to you, either keep an eye on the updates before you consider purchasing it or take a leap of faith and roll with the updates.			"

Early Access Review
								This game is so confusingEDIT: Just to reiterate here, I'm going to give some reasoning. When I first got this game, it was in a very early alpha. Mostly everything was broken and buggy. Well, I decided to re-visit it yeterday, and while there are definatly less bugs, it still need a lot of work. First thing the game does is drops you into this very odd tutorial. They start out with the regular, walking, opening doors, etc. But then you get into crafting. The first thing they want you to make is some sort of lazer, so you go through the confusing process of crafting it (I literally cannot explain it beause it is that confusing), only to find out it takes about 6 seconds to mine 1 peice of dirt. One peice. And they make you mine through a whole tunnel of it. After you get out of this tutorial (which takes about 30-40 minutes) you're dropped into your randomly generated world. And that's it, no further instructions. Now in say, Terraria, you have the guide to help you along a bit. In this game, they give you nothing. So I spent maybe 20 (?) minutes just walking around. Going through caves, all of which were empty, falling of islands, that's about it. Once this game has some polish to it, and a reworked tutorial, I might give it a third try, but for now I wouldn't recommend this game at all.			"

								This review will only be a short one becasue I dont have much to say about it and I would only be repeating myself. Edge of Space is a Retro Sci-Fi which is about exploring and seeing diffrent things. This sounds great but it quickly gets dull. After the tutorial it seems that most of the fun is gone. There just isnt much to do. I know people are going to say its an Early Access game but that does not change everything. It improves on what it has. So far I would nit recommend this game so far. If you wanted a better game that is simular get Starbound or Terraria. The only good things I can think of are that the art style looks great and the controls are good, the music fits the world that you play in but thats about it. I am going to rate it a 4 out of 10.  here "

								This game is bad considering that I love Terraria. I haven't played it in a long time becuase I went back because of what the developer told me but, it still wasn't decent. There really isn't a clear thing your supposed to do when you touch down on the planet. It has been better than the last time I checked upon Edge of Space, and has gotten a lot of improvement. It just isn't a very well made game with a confusing overall game play. Even if it gets updated into a good game, I still am not going to come back to this game. I only recommend buying it with caution.               The overall rating I give this game is a 5.			"

								I would not recommend buying this game in its current state. Everything is confusing. You have to do a 5 minute tut after every character you create. It tells you what to do then releases you into the wild with the slight knowledge of the difference between mud and dirt. You make futuristic blocks out of dirt and make laser rifles out of mud.This is all based on the first hour of gameplay. I have no clue of what later gameplay is like. I bought this game with high hopes just to have it crushed by meaningless minutes of nothingness.My rating: 1/5However: Shows potential in future updates.			"

								I'm hoping this game has at least some promise in the future, having bought my copy I find it currently has the same flaws as starbound in that its labouriously slow to start. I was hoping for something with the pace of Terraria which i love. Its early days so i will reserve judgement but for those thinking of buying I'd perhaps get it now while the price is reasonable and don't expect all the bells and whistles just yet. I will say that currently the trailer seems to show things that you will have to be playing for a long time to achieve, so at least it has longevity to it if you have the patience to stick with it, "

Early Access Review
								Alright, so, I was urged to play the game again, in which I agreed to. Before writing this, I was reading other reviews, and I completely disagree with one of them, which said something about the game being a little hard or it being objectiveless, and even it being difficult to progress, and even when you did, you would not feel like there was even any progression at all(Review posted June 11). All of it is sorta BS because how is it hard if you literally have 3-4 minutes of night, when things start spawning?(In the caves) How can you feel objectiveless if you have a kick♥♥♥♥♥NPC right from the beginning, asking you to help it, and even making cute little sounds when you agree to help it or not be mean to it? How can there not be any progression at all if when you even mine a single block, you get 5 exp, but it then adds up? There really can't be any objective if you set one yourself, or you ask the NPC right from the beginning, yet, I believe i remember the game even saying that you can talk to said NPC.Anyways, although I did end up finding fun in the game again, like riding snails, or making pits of hell for passive crabs to jump down, it did a few things that irked me, even though it's in early access. Well, for one, the tutorial. When you spawn in, you get pretty nice videos, dont get me wrong, they were nice, but they took up the entire right bottom corner of your screen. I don't want to go and say that they're bad, but it would probably be better if a message popped up asking if you wanted to watch the videos during the tutorial. Another thing was that when it was 12:00 at night, and you were in a cave,(Especially early game) 1: The monsters that spawn hurt. 2: Why spawn in the middle of the night, only to stay during the day?Personally, I'm very mixed on this game. It really varies from person to person. If I were able to buy it again, but with the current amount of knowledge I have on the game, I would wait until it comes out  with reviews. But you know what? I enjoyed the 34 hours on this game. No regrets. Not that I'm not going to ever play the game again, since i did buy the special edition. However, there are a few aspects that can be so easily exploited, like if you're going to die, you can just exit the game, only to appear at your cryopod, aka spawn point. Even at the tutorial, there's mounds of resources you can get, with no threats, giving a very significant edge in the early game.TL:DR; The game is amazing, even though there are a few parts to it that can be questionable, but the exception is that it's early access, and it is already a game that has so much potential of being an even better game. Best to wait until it is released out of early access, but it can be even better if you choose to buy it during early access. It's always nice to see games grow.			"

Early Access Review
								Update (12/30/2014):Having played a good chunk of Terraria & Starbound, Edge of Space seems like it's coming into its own at this Early Access stage. Definitely recommended alongside those others. Starbound seems to be a bit more stagnant, or moved backwards in some ways (farming/survival is even less important now). EoS has added bunches of new stuff since I last played. EoS is also more futuristic with the ranged weaponry, whereas Starbound seems more reliant on melee, if that matters to you.Original (10/13/2013):""Terraria in space""? It's not a totally fair statement, yet this is also a title that the more famous Re-Logic has endorsed. If you're looking for something like Terraria, Terraria-ish in a new set of biomes, or otherwise wanting something familiar to your Terraria experience (but IN SPACE!), then Edge of Space is a good buy, even at this earlier stage in the game's development.

								It could be very good terraria game type, but stucked on the very 1st planet its just painfull to gather ores and stuff, i really like the experience system, but you need to kill tons of mobs to get data disc or something to level up. I dont say its bad game, i just say i dont feel this need to build, gather, defend and craft, its just weak to be on this ugly planet.I give thump down cus price (13€) is much too big for alpha, lots of work need to be done, (even mining need polishing) And updates are not very often. (I bought this game right after steam show it, and there is a large progress from that point, but its still weak in my opinion) (waiting for terraria 1.5)			"

								A lot like Starbound but with far less polish.  After over an hour of playing I had no idea how to add tech, progress or move forward, even with online resources.Edit for Shaggy:The training was boring but informative... As a game consumer I am looking to maximize my engagment and fun per hour. Those first 20 minutes were low on the fun per hour.  Once I got down to the planet, mining was intuitive, but the super black pixelation of the light underground was kind of a bad experience. From a beauty/comfort stand point a smoother less grainy light pixelation on my mining apparatus would make the game much more fun. Once I figured out torches and my basic gear upgrades... I didn't know where to go. I had no forumlas unlocked and had no clue where to find or make them. There were few online guides or resources that made any sense (many seemed to have been written for previous version) and I got stuck within an hour.   While I think the game has a lot of potential it's not quite playable for me yet.			"

								So I bought this game late last year and have tinkered with it off and on throughout the year.  The game carries a lot of potential but needs a deal of polish imo. There are problems with crafting certain items and mining takes quite a while (even with the higher tier pick). Edge of Space is essentially a slower-paced sci-fi version of Terraria with an exposure system (which limits how far down you can go before dying) and some other aspects.  It's still a relatively barebones game a year down the road and I cannot recommend it currently.  Wait another 6 months or go try 7 days to Die in the meantime.			"

Early Access Review
								After speaking with LadyAijou extensively regarding Edge of Space. I would like to update my review with some further information.The reason advancement isn't working is right before the steam summer sale most of the NPC code was gutted out for revamping, very similar to what Rust is doing. The team at Handyman Studios was not expecting to get featured in the flash sale and ended up receiving more orders during that eight hour period than they had gotten in their previous best week during the 2-1 sale.The development team consists of two people, one of which had a system failure right after the change to the NPC code was implemented, which meant that what should have been fixed either right before or right after the flash sale was unable to be fixed. The chests dropping from nests is related to this issue because the nest/event has to spawn the appropriate creatures and then track that they have been killed, which with the changes to the NPC code is not working properly, so you're ""failing"" every nest/event you start.This means that yes, at this particular moment it is not possible to progress past the first biome. With full aluminum armor you can make it pretty much to the end of the first biome, but beyond that is not possible. I will be leaving my review as ""not recommended"" for the time being due to the non-available features, but will hold my final opinion in reserve until such time as the current mess is cleaned up.

Early Access Review
								We are still in the early access, but so far it seems like the developer is improving the game. I'm hopeful this game will become worthing of being called ""Terraria in space"". At the moment it's closer to being Terraria's younger sibling. A bit more clumsy and less eloquent, but full of potential because of its youth.The controls are a bit fiddly and not as fluid as in Terraria. Jumping from slopes triggers the jetpack instead of a regular jump, for example. The crafting interface is more organized by categorizing everything, but having to manually assign the materials from dropdown menus is clumsy at best. Worse, if you change quantity after you selected the materials, it resets the chosen materials and you have to pick them again. It'd be handy to pre-select the cheapest (or most plentiful) resources in a configuration which could build the item, by default. Changing quantity should preserve the materials already chosen. It might even change materials if that can make a recipe work when the old materials will not make it work.The tutorial has improved. It used to be overly wordy and micro-managed you, and then it dumped you on a planet afterwards without so much of a hint as to what to do next. It's more to the point now, but after the tutorial you're still left in the middle of nowhere on a sky island without any real pointers as to what you're supposed to do.The recent big patch added research levels which you can unlock by reading the research materials dropped by monsters you defeat. Massive improvement over the old system which basically gave you access to everything, but no clue what it did or why you would pick something. Now at least you have less choices so you can get familiar with the starter items and learn more from there.			"

Early Access Review
								EDITtl;dr Was on the way to being a good game, but ran out of fuel before it got there.When I first played this game it had serious potential; there were unique and interesting gameplay ideas, regular updates, and most importantly devs who respond on the forum. I spent a fair amount of time playing the game, eagerly anticipating updates, until I felt I had got this jist of what the game was and where it was going, so decided to wait a couple of months before playing again. When I booted it up again half a year later the only obvious changes were some haloween gimmiks, as far as I could tell updates had ground to a standstill. A year (and a bit) later and no further changes, until I saw a post saying that the devs hadn't abandoned the game, however they could tell us why they weren't working on it at the moment (which was what promted me change my review). For comparison I've left my original review below, showing how excited I was for this game.ORIGINAL REVIEWThis is a really promising game, with dedicated developers who are eager to share their creation with the community. It is not a finished game at the moment, but is what a beta game should be. Updates are designed to test specific features so that they can be polished, submitting tickets is on the main menu and the developers actually respond to posts in the forums. Although it sound like these are obvious aspects for any beta game there are too many early access games that care too much about people playing them, instead of testing them to make a better game in the long run.The gameplay itself will be familiar to anybody who has played terraria, starbound etc, but with enough unique features to make it interesting. One of the best features is the crafting system that classifies materials (eg ice is a chemical, which is a raw material => raw/chemical/ice), therefore some recipes will require any chemical or any raw material etc.Overall, if you are looking for a good beta that will turn into a great game, I would recommend buying it now. If you don't want to be actively involved in improving the game, then wait until it is fully released so that you aren't disappointed and forget about it.			"

												DONT BUY GAME IS ABANDONED AND STILL ALPHA STAGEFinally Early access done right.Regular updates, it already got two different huge biomes !Devs are posting regularly in the steam forums.This game remembers me of an insane mix of metroid and terraria.Your an astronaut and embark on a mission to reclaim and terraform a split up planet. The deeper you get the more radiation you will discover so dont forget your protection !Of course you can setup your outpost and craft all shiny furniture. You can research different armor sets and weapon types like phase and projectile weapons. It got even nice upgrade mechanics like improved health , deploying mini turrets or even a grappling hook !Now you say what ? Only 2 biomes and terraforming isnt implemented yet ? With terraform i mean turn the land into a more livable space with less radiation and hostile creatures. Base building you can do from the start!Dont fool yourself the biomes in EOS work much differently than compared to terraria. Terrarias biomes are rather small and can be traversed quickly. But on the other hand EOS's biomes really feel vast and huge. So those areas really invite you to explore and discover new lifeforms and alien buildings :)Basically the end end goal upon release is to turn the planet back into a livable space with oxygen etc. But terraforming is a future feature.I think in the past 2 months this early access title did do huge steps in the right direction. I was just on a server now and got disconnected. So i was confused, but actually they pushed an update right now ! So those devs are really crazy with the updates. For example the christmas update included 2 new dungeons , 1 new boss, 1 special event and several new items to craft.TL;DRBasically its a blend of 2d metroidvania and terraria. Ranged combat is a huge deal with many rifles and laser guns.  Each crafted weapon can get different stats and clip sizes etc.It maybe starts slow and you need to get used to the crafting and research mechanics, but im sure after 4-5 hours you feel right at home :)But take notice Win Xp is NOT supported !Mac and linux arent supported yet, but get a future implementation! Just check out the forums to get a better picture whats going on.When starting the game first time i strongly recommend doing the tutorial first.Edit2: Not recommended anymore, because its abandoneware. The website shut down and community manager got fired!			"

Early Access Review
								Old Review:Easily the most dull game of the year.I've been playing Edge of Space the past eight hours; with the single thought in my mind of: ""This game must get better eventually, right?""  well; I've been essentially in the same spot with the same equipment for the past five hours.  Killing crabs n' jelly fish, and mining titanium, aluminum, stone, mud, clay, and dirt does get old after a while.  I found a strange white box with a blue arrow on it in a cave and tried to us eit, but that just flashed some screen for half a second and went away; and I was unable to interact with it again.  But let's put things into points for the sake of organization:Good things:*Good movement system.*Good art & music.*Online co-op.*Interesting concept.Bad Things:*Very unpolished.*Bad interface & not very user-friendly.*No explanation for the purpose of alot of things, for example the matter recombiner; the game does not tell you what it does, and the description is simply: ""You can't even wager a guess as to how this crazy machine works."", normally checking a wiki would help an issue like this, but their wiki is ancient and not updated.  And then there are things like the random events that go on in the world like the crab nests, and random things such as the weird white box with blue arrow-  no idea what purpose the box served, didn't realize the crab nest was an event.*Lack of things to do; the only goal you might have in the game is simply go lower.. And there is no reason to go lower as you have all the resources you need in the top areas.*Lack of resources; it may seem like a good thing that alluminum is basically the most awesome freakin' resource in existence, but it really makes the game boring when you're not bothering to actually look for things.*Uninteresting enemies.*Uninteresting areas; why would the devs think it was a good idea to make the entire game take place on some floating rocks ?*The relaxing music and police sirens(?) doesn't lower the boring factor of this game.*Terrible enemy AI.*Poorly made tutorial levels, tutorial more interesting than the actual game.*Extremely useless chests; for this let me explain how chests work, you craft one then place it in the world; then you right click it to open it, you then have to manually drag and drop each item you wish to place in it, into it; and the chest only has three slots.*Lack of creativity; how many times has the space shark and space animals concept been done now?*Very unprofessional dev team.*Just a shoddy game in general; people like to consider it as a terraria and starbound ripoff- but in all honesty that's an insult to both Terraria and Starbound.*I'm fairly certain the preview images which show awesome things happening are all fake.*Dropped items from full inventory disappear within seconds, made 7 chests to put my items somewhere- didn't realize my inventory was full,  chests vanish.  Make a full suit of aluminum armor, don't realize inventory is full,  poof.*Glitchy items:  Made two chests, had two slots free- placed a chest, the other chest vanished into nowhere.  Used an emergency recall, had two in my inventory; the other vanished. If I had any suggestions for this game; I recommend they take a page from Windforge and add player made spaceships to fly around the edge of space.  ps:  Don't use the Omega research unless you have good equipment, it just brings you to a boss whom will murder you if you still are using low level stuff.Well,  all in all I recommend the game; but make sure you don't play it at night or else you're liable to fall asleep from the sheer boredom it causes; and if you're planning on buying the game because of the awesome screenshots you saw of like a desert and mechs and whatnot- those are definitely faked, there are four biomes; you can go to about two of them, a grassy biome and a cold biome.  There's also about 8 or so enemies currently and about six(?) different resources.Edit August 2016:So, it is now the distant future since I last reviewed the game; and honestly it's worse than before.  The game opens to a beautiful 404 page error after the Unity Logo and Splash screen.  And the game starts with you in the middle of nowhere with a shark with lasers and crap attached to it with a high pitch voice that asks you to do pointless tasks such as gathering dirt and clay for it.   Simple actions in the inventory system such as dragging an item to the trash drops the FPS immensely, nests are incredibly annoying to destroy as they infinitely respawn the enemy guards every time you shoot it; and you need to shoot one quite a lot to destroy it. AI is terrible, they wander back and forth not really trying to get to you, in part because their AI is considering the bullets you shoot as ground, so if they're jumping into the air and you shoot them, they will continue to jump as high as they want, or they'll just plain turn around when shot at with a little ? symbol.    The animations and art is weird, the physics is bad, the overall game is mayhaps more boring than it used to be.But all in all, better than No Man's Sky.  So at least there is that.			"

												I did not like the gameplay of this game. I found this game boring after a short bit of time. There are more negaives than positives to this game. One of these positives is that it is a early terraria otherworld. I fiund this game beaten by starbound by far, and I bet a lot of other agre with me who have sen gameplay of Starbound, or have played it. The developers to this game barely patch anything and can easily be glitched. There are far to many glitches to list in this game. Waste of money, unless you like the idea of a game that is straight up boring. That is all i have to say for this game, I know the developes could of done better.			"

												Below you will find my original review of the game while it was still being worked upon and refined. Here I will tell you not to buy it. I have spoken with Lady Aijou the PR assistant for the game and she has left the team upon the ""release of the game"". The devs instead of working the kinks out released way ahead of reasonable time and ultimatly the game has no support at all at the moment and for the forseeable future. Its sad really because i had a lot of hope for this, the devs put time into the game, crafted it and took suggestions and listened to feedback. I cannot recommend the game now and its a shame :/In short the game has become abandonware. Hopefully the devs return to fix the mess they left on a decent game. Dont buy this game. Id honestly recommend Starbound or Terraria over them as both are excellent and still being tweaked.======================================================================Ok, So I have seen some users complain of the developers abandoning their game, this simply is not true. Now whether this is based upon Starbound (the developers are Chucklefish and have no affiliation with Handyman) it really is unfair to everyone working on Edge of Space.So, what am i doing with this post? Im going to show you through my own experience and time with the game what it looked like when i started playing around januraryish up to now. Yes there will be two or three videos going to my youtube channel, No you are not asked to subscribe, like, etc this is purely for those that are looking for things that were added to the game and just general gameplay. First off, were going to talk about where it was when i started. It was a barren game, not too much content. Few enemies and a fair amount of bugs. The intro screen was also completely different to what you see now. The music however is the same. Below is the first comparison video you dont need to watch much to get the gist. A lot of features are not there, The zoom that we have now, All the enemies you currently see, the headhunter dungeons are not there, the trees are stiff and there are not as many armours, weapons, and in general crafting stuffs as there are now.YouTube™ Video: Edge of Space : Part 1 : Not Terraria but Crabs! Views: 5,878This is Edge of Space, a game related to Terraria by some design only, well, and the fact that the guys at Handyman work closely with the Terraria devs because they are awesome!Now take that and look at what is now in the game.YouTube™ Video: Huge Update : Edge of Space : Part 11 Views: 325So Edge of space got a Huge update and there were a lot of things i couldnt get too that were added in the game, i doubt i can show every tiny thing but i shall be showing every possible thing i can.YouTube™ Video: Assault Bears and Leaf Armor : Edge of Space : Part 12 Views: 6Ok, so i finally got to a point to show you guys a bunch of new cool stuff and some stuff i never imagened i could show you! I found an assault bear...a bear with giant guns on it....yea!What i mentioned earlier is in there, though not in this particular video. There are things however i did not count on ever being in the game such as assault bears (big bears with giant ♥♥♥♥ guns that shoot you) Anomalies which are random such as a mob of powerful creatures that will obliterate even the most well trained and armoured ArkCoNaught.The starting zone is now a much tougher place full of stuff to kill and explore rather than an empty almost lifeless planet. That is not abandoning of a game. So please take this into consideration as well as the fact that the Devs are very active here on the forums, and even on the videos that people upload. They are happy to hear your suggestions and reflect on them and if it be deemed incorperate them into the game in some way. They are doing this to make the best game they possibly can and ill be damned if a few people take it away from them. As from what ive seen, the timely patches and fixes and contet additions Handyman is a very good studioKeep in mind the game still needs fixing and updating as it is in early access/beta at this moment. I know people are wary of this, but, coming from experince these guys are working hard to bring us a fun game with tons of content and fun ideas. So before bashing and accusing them of stealing our money, at least look into the developers history and into the game itself as well as videos others do of the game to see if infact your bias is justified.

								Considering every time I load the game the Single Player button nor any other button will respond, and when it does I am subjected to laggy tutorial hell, I am not sure whether it is worth it for most people, unless you detest Terraria, a far more polished, cheaper(?) and innovatve sandbox example, which they have actually based part of their game on.

												Amazing early access game, meaningful updates, few bugs, but thats expected from an early access game. Overall great. 8/8EDIT: well its 1/21/2016 and this game hasnt done all that much to fix the bugs that its had for like ever, plus its added some new ones. The constant freezing gets to me pretty bad, every few seconds its gonna freeze for like 1-5 seconds, gets me pretty triggered. I've played a lot of Terraria, Minecraft and now that I have 130 hours I can say that this game is 5/10, not great. It's ok to play when watching a streat on another screen, other than that its pretty dull, repetetive. I would just rather play it with a friend than by myself all the time.Side note: I'm sure no one is even alowed to stream this game since I almost never see anyone stream it unless the person is companied by a dev or someone. How is this good for a game like this that isnt even that good? Your choking yourselfs devs, by doing this and hurting the potential of your game.It's so grindy and easy I could probably get 100% research with my eyes stapled to my♥♥♥♥♥♥♥nuts.Stay away untill the bugs get fixed and people can stream this ♥♥♥♥♥♥ game for the plebs.

								Its definitely an interesting game, and it is a lot of fun. I only have a few hours logged but im not sure how i really like it.

The FA-Q of SpaceUpdated Review-------------------------------------------------Not so much a review as it is text of sadness. No word since April from the devs. I tried to go to the website today and got a godaddy this page does not exist site. I didn't get to the level that some other players did but had fun while playing. It's sad that this really has been abandoned. Don't give up!Zen of SpaceOriginal Review-------------------------------------------------I have been playing the game since beta. Overall it has been a positive experience for me. Playing version 1 was a big surprise. They added a ton of stuff. Personally I get sick of all the wizzard and warrior stuff so I love the fact that this is in space. Definetely has the Metroid feel you hear others talk about. Sound track is wicked, great art style! Starbound is in space but for some reason that game never keeps my attention like Edge of Space and Terraria. I have a ton of the open-world sandbox build, survive games. Like, A LOT of them. This game is one of my favorites.I really enjoy what you have created here. Great job! I get burned here and there by early access but am super happy that you guys got to version 1. Looking forward to all the great updates to come.			"

I liked it in early access, because it was promising.I know that feeling.but alas, the game failed to do what terraria did in a few months. ok go play starbound if you want space-terraria.EDIT: Oh look!

Early Access Review
								EDITtl;dr Was on the way to being a good game, but ran out of fuel before it got there.When I first played this game it had serious potential; there were unique and interesting gameplay ideas, regular updates, and most importantly devs who respond on the forum. I spent a fair amount of time playing the game, eagerly anticipating updates, until I felt I had got this jist of what the game was and where it was going, so decided to wait a couple of months before playing again. When I booted it up again half a year later the only obvious changes were some haloween gimmiks, as far as I could tell updates had ground to a standstill. A year (and a bit) later and no further changes, until I saw a post saying that the devs hadn't abandoned the game, however they could tell us why they weren't working on it at the moment (which was what promted me change my review). For comparison I've left my original review below, showing how excited I was for this game.ORIGINAL REVIEWThis is a really promising game, with dedicated developers who are eager to share their creation with the community. It is not a finished game at the moment, but is what a beta game should be. Updates are designed to test specific features so that they can be polished, submitting tickets is on the main menu and the developers actually respond to posts in the forums. Although it sound like these are obvious aspects for any beta game there are too many early access games that care too much about people playing them, instead of testing them to make a better game in the long run.The gameplay itself will be familiar to anybody who has played terraria, starbound etc, but with enough unique features to make it interesting. One of the best features is the crafting system that classifies materials (eg ice is a chemical, which is a raw material => raw/chemical/ice), therefore some recipes will require any chemical or any raw material etc.Overall, if you are looking for a good beta that will turn into a great game, I would recommend buying it now. If you don't want to be actively involved in improving the game, then wait until it is fully released so that you aren't disappointed and forget about it.			"

												DONT BUY GAME IS ABANDONED AND STILL ALPHA STAGEFinally Early access done right.Regular updates, it already got two different huge biomes !Devs are posting regularly in the steam forums.This game remembers me of an insane mix of metroid and terraria.Your an astronaut and embark on a mission to reclaim and terraform a split up planet. The deeper you get the more radiation you will discover so dont forget your protection !Of course you can setup your outpost and craft all shiny furniture. You can research different armor sets and weapon types like phase and projectile weapons. It got even nice upgrade mechanics like improved health , deploying mini turrets or even a grappling hook !Now you say what ? Only 2 biomes and terraforming isnt implemented yet ? With terraform i mean turn the land into a more livable space with less radiation and hostile creatures. Base building you can do from the start!Dont fool yourself the biomes in EOS work much differently than compared to terraria. Terrarias biomes are rather small and can be traversed quickly. But on the other hand EOS's biomes really feel vast and huge. So those areas really invite you to explore and discover new lifeforms and alien buildings :)Basically the end end goal upon release is to turn the planet back into a livable space with oxygen etc. But terraforming is a future feature.I think in the past 2 months this early access title did do huge steps in the right direction. I was just on a server now and got disconnected. So i was confused, but actually they pushed an update right now ! So those devs are really crazy with the updates. For example the christmas update included 2 new dungeons , 1 new boss, 1 special event and several new items to craft.TL;DRBasically its a blend of 2d metroidvania and terraria. Ranged combat is a huge deal with many rifles and laser guns.  Each crafted weapon can get different stats and clip sizes etc.It maybe starts slow and you need to get used to the crafting and research mechanics, but im sure after 4-5 hours you feel right at home :)But take notice Win Xp is NOT supported !Mac and linux arent supported yet, but get a future implementation! Just check out the forums to get a better picture whats going on.When starting the game first time i strongly recommend doing the tutorial first.Edit2: Not recommended anymore, because its abandoneware. The website shut down and community manager got fired!			"

												I have updated my review as a developer kindly told be that the game has updated and improved which is the best thing I can say about this game is not the game itself but its the developers who have tried so hard but does it make it a good game?If you enjoy this game good I'm glad but my disappointment turned into anger after playing it again.You can tell its a good game when it lags when you open it up and when you create a level you could make a cup of coffee in the same time (pc master race) and when the screenshots taunt you with an interesting game.But you know its a fantastic game when the first mission of the game with the shark to protect it from the ""evil"" jellies or you could just leave the abomination alone to its demise and still complete the mission and return to it without any consequences.I hope this is in early acess so it can improve but its still a bland game which makes doing chores fun, but dont worry you can unlock this cool item if you grind throughout and then you can battle that cool boss advertised if you didnt quit already.As if something needed to be added at the start of the game buildings are here and have generic repetitive tasks that sometimes dont make sense such as bombs appearing in a jelly base for you to randomly press buttons in order to dissarm it or do what I did and blow it up.There are no biomes in a alien world which after aimlessly wandering around discovering that the hud looks bland if the game is about to be released.Edge of space is a failed attempt into reaching 2d sandbox fame and if its true that this game is out of early access then there is little hope of improvements to this game.But hey dont take my word as this is my opinion and hopefully it will be proven wrong and you will love this game.

												I've been updating this review throughout its development. Tl;dr, it was decent, but now its garbage, and will never get better.First Entry:Terraria is better, but only because its a fully developed game. This one is still in progress, but is incredibly addictive, even more so than Terraria in my opinion. They've implemented a skilling system, where you repurpose dirt and mud etc into experience data which you then use to level your skills up in order to unlock new weapons and armor. Its a little complicated for those who just came from the simplicity of Terraria, but you catch on pretty quick.Its a little unbalanced, but what can you expect from an early access game? I say if you liked Terraria, you'll probably like Edge of Space a lot too, but you'll want it when it comes out fully. The world's a little too big, with not enough to do, and the Arctic Biome is really dangerous, but again, I'm expecting these things will be expanded on eventually.Final verdict: Currently not nearly as deep and immersive as Terraria but has INCREDIBLE potential to become an even better game.9.5/10 cant wait for the released game8/14/15 REVIEW UPDATESooo... im not exactly sure what the devs are doing to make this game better. So far they've managed to slow down the engine, make the controls more buggy, add some unneccessary new looks, increased the loading time, and made NPCs. Instead of trying to add icing, cherries, and candles, they need to finish baking the cake first. It's been a long time, and the game seems to have only gotten worse, and while they appear to be ""finalizing,"" their core game mechanic is horribly broken, and they've fixed things that didnt need to be fixed, and they've broken things that were working just fine six months ago. Not to mention trying to ""balance"" the game by making it slower, harder, and more annoying to get traction; they've increased the learning scope. In general I'm noticing way more bugs than a while ago.On the plus side, they've automated the annoying crafting process, but so far that's the only good thing i can see.Final verdict: I still have hopes for this game, due to my love of Terraria, but frankly it's dwindled quite a bit, and if you're looking for a Terraria clone, you'll find something that throws away everything that made Terraria fun, and added stuff that made it annoying and buggy. DEVS IF YOURE READING THIS, PLEASE FIX THE BASIC STUFF, like MOVEMENT, GUNS, and THE FRICKEN TARGETING OF THE LASER PICK, before moving to things like CREATURE SKINS, MISSIONS, QUESTS, GRAPHICS etc. Make the game playable before you make it pretty.7/1012/7/2016It didn't get any better. Apparently the devs left, so it won't get any better. What a bummer. I've given up hope. Just don't buy it.			"

												Edit 10/31/16: Well too bad they apparently aren't ever going to finish it. Game had a lot of promise, but isn't at a state where I would consider it a finished product worth paying for knowing that this is its final state.I picked up Edge of Space on Desura when it first released, played about 20 minutes and thought WTF DID I JUST WASTE MY MONEY ON. I guess I knew it was early access but... at that point it was REALLY early access. It was the skeletal framework of the game and nothing else.Fast forward to my picking it up on steam, and the game is completely different, more fleshed out and with its own unique personality. It's still very clearly not done yet. But the parts of this genre that make it fun to play, mining, gear and stat upgrading, and base building, are functional and enjoyable. It sounds like the developers have a clear vision in mind for what the game will be, and as it progresses in development that vision becomes more and more clear each patch both in the game's functionality and tone. TL;DR - It's early access done right. Game has regular updates and gets fleshed out more and more with each one. It's also fun to play in its current state of development.			"

YouTube™ Video: Edge of Space Steam Early Access Review - JumpToGamer 

			Views: 5,705		

			""Players suit up as an Operative of the Ark Corporation (ArkCo), deployed into the deepest, darkest, and most dangerous part of the universe.		

Please remember that Edge of Space is not completed, and more features will be added as the game develops. As such, in the future this article may not be a fair representation of the game.Edge of Space, developed by Handyman Studios and published by Reverb Publishing, is a 2D dynamically generated space adventure. Much to the likes of ever popular Terraria and recent debut of Starbound, Edge of Space allows you go venture through alien planets, build a home base, fend off the local wildlife, and most importantly, survive. It may seem like these survival games are a dime-a-dozen, but the fine folks at Handyman Studios have put their own spin on the whole “survivalcraft” genre.I am going to preface this by saying that Edge of Space is in a very early stage of development. It was recently updated and gained some traction through Steam’s Early Access, but the fact of the matter Edge of Space is a bit rough around the edges as of right now. It can be quite a turn off to play a game so early in development, especially if it gives you the wrong impressions due to bugs and other strange anomalies. I will say, though, that in the two weeks that I’ve been playing the game, there has been a staggering amount of bug fixes and patches that have really improved the experience. I wholeheartedly believe that Edge of Space will improve in this respect as the developers iron out bugs, UI issues, and add in more content.In Edge of Space, you play as a lonely operative representing the Ark Corporation. After catching some beauty sleep in a cryo-chamber, you wake up and realize that you’re basically lost. Your only chance of survival is to depend on the amazing technologies that brought you to the, ahem, edge of space. The only problem here is that you’ll have to find the materials you will need to survive amidst a hostile and dangerous planet. Actually, planet right not even be the right word for Edge of Space. It’s more like an asteroid field where you bounce to and from different small land masses.One facet of Edge of Space that’s particularly interesting is how the environment is constantly working to kill you. Make no doubt about it, you’ve arrived in a hell-hole that is out for your blood. There are plenty of enemies wandering around trying to eat you, but more than that, the entire gameworld wants your flesh. As you descend lower and lower in space, you’ll take exposure damage if you’re not fully equipped. This can really be a range of things, including radiation or lack of oxygen. In order to prevent this, you’ll want to fully make sure you’ll have the supplies on you to oxygenate the area, or get rid of the radiation. As an ArkCo Operative, you can also defend your new territory with a series of droids or turrets.As of March 2014, combat in Edge of Space is completely centered around guns. There aren’t any melee weapons as of now. However, there are some interesting ideas with the guns. My favorite example is the Arklight, a gun that shoots out a sticky, glowing canister. This is extremely useful when spelunking through the various caverns you’ll find scattered throughout space, and it sure beats placing a torch down every 10 feet. In fact, torches have such a low-light radius that I tended to stick with the narrow glow of my laser pick and the Arklight.As someone who has never played Edge of Space before, first impressions can kill the experience. I’m not going to lie, Edge of Space is pretty rough around the edges, especially in the first hour or so. Although it has improved dramatically since I’ve recieved the game, the biggest problem is still the UI. There are some peculiarities that really need adjusting to, especially if you compare them to the flexibility of similar games. One such example would be the hotbar, which is a bit complicated because it can take multiple clicks to slot in different items. The crafting menu is categorized into different sections, but you’ll have to individually click each item you want to use in a recipe. I see what it’s trying to do, and I really like the fact that in some recipes you can substitute many different items, but it’s clunky.There are other little things like this that really drag down the experience despite the survival aspects of the game working as intended.Edge of Space has a nonlinear sense of progression, but sometimes it is more complicated than it’s own good. There are plenty of machines that you can use to craft items, but when it comes to weapons and armor, you’ll have to go to an armory. This is really more tedious than it needs to be because you’ll have to drop down various unmarked chutes, and you’ll be given whatever weapon lies at the bottom as well as the recipe for said weapon. The first time I went into the armory, I fell down the chute and got a shotgun. Don’t get me wrong, shotguns are awesome, but I didn’t get to look at the other weapons I could have made.In one of the recent patches, one of the developers of Terraria actually added a few things into Edge of Space. It’s great to see that Edge of Space has the support of a well-known and beloved developer, and it’s even better to see Skeletron inside of Edge of Space. Omegatron, as it’s called in-game, adds some much needed flavor to the typical crabs and floating snails you’ll find outside your base, not to mention he’s very difficult.In the end, Edge of Space is still very much a work in progress. If you go in expecting a full-fledged game with lots of content and polish, you’ll be sorely disappointed. What Edge of Space excels at is creating a unique environment with interesting gunplay and addictive gameplay. It’s tough to quit playing when you’re in the middle of setting up a fortress, or going on an expedition to dangerous zones. Given a few extra months in the oven and I have no doubt that Edge of Space will easily turn into something that will be worth your money.			"

												It's a pretty fun game, and people are sure to compare it to games like Terraria and Starbound. The difference between EoS and those other games is how you play it. EoS has a lot more technology items, like jetpacks and laser guns, and is more futuristic, while Terraria is a mix between a fairy tale world and the deepest pits of Hell. The art style is superb, and the background art is just nice to look at. Though there is somewhat of a story, it's pretty noninvasive and isn't forced on you. The story just tries to give a justification for why you're on these planets. Updates have been coming in a timely fashion, and it's about to come out of Early Access. All in all, it's a fun game to waste your time in.EDIT: They pretty much just called it done and pushed it out, wouldn't recommend buying or supporting their other games. Barely any communication with players and they just let you down.			"

												Have you enjoyed games like Starbound or Terraria in the past? Then there will be a lot for you to like here as well. If not this game won't change your mind about this genre of games. The developers seem to have a real passion and want to make this a great game, only time will tell if they succeed. The game has finally come out of early access with a slew of new features and bug fixes. So if you were on the fence before now might be the time to pick this one up.Updated 12/22/2016Looks like this game has been abandoned by it's development team, which is a really shame this game had a lot of potential. As the game is now I can't recommend it, there are just to many bugs and half baked game mechanics. I would look into picking up Starbound or Terraria if you haven't already.			"

												EDIT: After checking recent news of this game, I had to change the review to not recommend it. The game does have bugs, and it seems it will never be fixed due to the developers abandoning the project. I'm disappointed when I learned about this, and I do wish that by some miracle, the developers will return to the project.Unfortunately, I doubt this will happen, and thus I will leave this as a warning to not play this game.Following below is my original review, to see my experience from when I was active.Now noted, I played Terraria a few months ago, did some multiplayer with a few friends, and got bored of it. It has been a few months since I last touched it.Going into this game, I was launched into the tutorial, and got a far better grasp of the basic mechanics than I did when I first got thrown into Terraria. While both do not require special placement for materials and such, this game gave a different emphasis that yes, even dirt is an important resource.I think that's what really got me into this game. Every resource you mine actually has a use, and you don't have to dump piles of dirt into a chest so it doesn't clutter your inventory. You actually need dirt now.Another thing that gives this game an edge against other games in this genre is the fact that you get decent ranged weapons through the tutorial. Normally you get a junk sword and all ranged weapons run on limited ammunition. Here, there's infinite ammo and it serves you well enough until you can research better schematics later on. I think that's important.Finally, I just like the overall look. The background, the creatures, and your character all have a pleasing look that also saves resources so it doesn't eat up the GPU. It has an art style that branches off just enough where it doesn't look too foreign, but still has its own identity.All in all, good game. If you get it on sale, you got a really good deal.			"

It may seem like these survival games are a dime-a-dozen, but the fine folks at Handyman Studios have put their own spin on the whole “survivalcraft” genre.I am going to preface this by saying that Edge of Space is in a very early stage of development. It was recently updated and gained some traction through Steam’s Early Access, but the fact of the matter Edge of Space is a bit rough around the edges as of right now. It can be quite a turn off to play a game so early in development, especially if it gives you the wrong impressions due to bugs and other strange anomalies. I will say, though, that in the two weeks that I’ve been playing the game, there has been a staggering amount of bug fixes and patches that have really improved the experience. I wholeheartedly believe that Edge of Space will improve in this respect as the developers iron out bugs, UI issues, and add in more content.In Edge of Space, you play as a lonely operative representing the Ark Corporation. After catching some beauty sleep in a cryo-chamber, you wake up and realize that you’re basically lost. Your only chance of survival is to depend on the amazing technologies that brought you to the, ahem, edge of space. The only problem here is that you’ll have to find the materials you will need to survive amidst a hostile and dangerous planet. Actually, planet right not even be the right word for Edge of Space. It’s more like an asteroid field where you bounce to and from different small land masses.One facet of Edge of Space that’s particularly interesting is how the environment is constantly working to kill you. Make no doubt about it, you’ve arrived in a hell-hole that is out for your blood. There are plenty of enemies wandering around trying to eat you, but more than that, the entire gameworld wants your flesh. As you descend lower and lower in space, you’ll take exposure damage if you’re not fully equipped. This can really be a range of things, including radiation or lack of oxygen. In order to prevent this, you’ll want to fully make sure you’ll have the supplies on you to oxygenate the area, or get rid of the radiation. As an ArkCo Operative, you can also defend your new territory with a series of droids or turrets.As of March 2014, combat in Edge of Space is completely centered around guns. There aren’t any melee weapons as of now. However, there are some interesting ideas with the guns. My favorite example is the Arklight, a gun that shoots out a sticky, glowing canister. This is extremely useful when spelunking through the various caverns you’ll find scattered throughout space, and it sure beats placing a torch down every 10 feet. In fact, torches have such a low-light radius that I tended to stick with the narrow glow of my laser pick and the Arklight.As someone who has never played Edge of Space before, first impressions can kill the experience. I’m not going to lie, Edge of Space is pretty rough around the edges, especially in the first hour or so. Although it has improved dramatically since I’ve recieved the game, the biggest problem is still the UI. There are some peculiarities that really need adjusting to, especially if you compare them to the flexibility of similar games. One such example would be the hotbar, which is a bit complicated because it can take multiple clicks to slot in different items. The crafting menu is categorized into different sections, but you’ll have to individually click each item you want to use in a recipe. I see what it’s trying to do, and I really like the fact that in some recipes you can substitute many different items, but it’s clunky.There are other little things like this that really drag down the experience despite the survival aspects of the game working as intended.Edge of Space has a nonlinear sense of progression, but sometimes it is more complicated than it’s own good. There are plenty of machines that you can use to craft items, but when it comes to weapons and armor, you’ll have to go to an armory. This is really more tedious than it needs to be because you’ll have to drop down various unmarked chutes, and you’ll be given whatever weapon lies at the bottom as well as the recipe for said weapon. The first time I went into the armory, I fell down the chute and got a shotgun. Don’t get me wrong, shotguns are awesome, but I didn’t get to look at the other weapons I could have made.In one of the recent patches, one of the developers of Terraria actually added a few things into Edge of Space. It’s great to see that Edge of Space has the support of a well-known and beloved developer, and it’s even better to see Skeletron inside of Edge of Space. Omegatron, as it’s called in-game, adds some much needed flavor to the typical crabs and floating snails you’ll find outside your base, not to mention he’s very difficult.In the end, Edge of Space is still very much a work in progress. If you go in expecting a full-fledged game with lots of content and polish, you’ll be sorely disappointed. What Edge of Space excels at is creating a unique environment with interesting gunplay and addictive gameplay. It’s tough to quit playing when you’re in the middle of setting up a fortress, or going on an expedition to dangerous zones. Given a few extra months in the oven and I have no doubt that Edge of Space will easily turn into something that will be worth your money.			"

												EDIT: After checking recent news of this game, I had to change the review to not recommend it. The game does have bugs, and it seems it will never be fixed due to the developers abandoning the project. I'm disappointed when I learned about this, and I do wish that by some miracle, the developers will return to the project.Unfortunately, I doubt this will happen, and thus I will leave this as a warning to not play this game.Following below is my original review, to see my experience from when I was active.Now noted, I played Terraria a few months ago, did some multiplayer with a few friends, and got bored of it. It has been a few months since I last touched it.Going into this game, I was launched into the tutorial, and got a far better grasp of the basic mechanics than I did when I first got thrown into Terraria. While both do not require special placement for materials and such, this game gave a different emphasis that yes, even dirt is an important resource.I think that's what really got me into this game. Every resource you mine actually has a use, and you don't have to dump piles of dirt into a chest so it doesn't clutter your inventory. You actually need dirt now.Another thing that gives this game an edge against other games in this genre is the fact that you get decent ranged weapons through the tutorial. Normally you get a junk sword and all ranged weapons run on limited ammunition. Here, there's infinite ammo and it serves you well enough until you can research better schematics later on. I think that's important.Finally, I just like the overall look. The background, the creatures, and your character all have a pleasing look that also saves resources so it doesn't eat up the GPU. It has an art style that branches off just enough where it doesn't look too foreign, but still has its own identity.All in all, good game. If you get it on sale, you got a really good deal.			"

												Have you enjoyed games like Starbound or Terraria in the past? Then there will be a lot for you to like here as well. If not this game won't change your mind about this genre of games. The developers seem to have a real passion and want to make this a great game, only time will tell if they succeed. The game has finally come out of early access with a slew of new features and bug fixes. So if you were on the fence before now might be the time to pick this one up.Updated 12/22/2016Looks like this game has been abandoned by it's development team, which is a really shame this game had a lot of potential. As the game is now I can't recommend it, there are just to many bugs and half baked game mechanics. I would look into picking up Starbound or Terraria if you haven't already.			"

												It's a pretty fun game, and people are sure to compare it to games like Terraria and Starbound. The difference between EoS and those other games is how you play it. EoS has a lot more technology items, like jetpacks and laser guns, and is more futuristic, while Terraria is a mix between a fairy tale world and the deepest pits of Hell. The art style is superb, and the background art is just nice to look at. Though there is somewhat of a story, it's pretty noninvasive and isn't forced on you. The story just tries to give a justification for why you're on these planets. Updates have been coming in a timely fashion, and it's about to come out of Early Access. All in all, it's a fun game to waste your time in.EDIT: They pretty much just called it done and pushed it out, wouldn't recommend buying or supporting their other games. Barely any communication with players and they just let you down.			"

												Sadly, had to stop recommending the game. Here's why: The developers abandoned it. It's a shame, I was starting enjoying this game.I suggest you to try Terraria or Starbound instead, at this point.Previous review I did (and still the Pros of this game):At first I didn't know what to do on this game. I didn't care much about talking with that shark with a funny voice and thought there wasn't much to do. Found this is such a fun game and learned a lot of things on the second hour of my gameplay. The environment colors are amazing, great background music, a bunch of achievements... - Crafting system, which allows you to craft any kind of items - building, armor, weapons, tools...- Claim great rewards for XP earned and achievements completed- Evolve your character- Have a pet and a house- Destroy or create terrain of any kind- Travel on a snail- Zombie aliens- Friendly shark			"
