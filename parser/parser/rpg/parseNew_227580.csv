												To preface this review, I have beat the game. This review is not out of frustration for not being able to accomplish that, but it is out of frustration from the game in general.For a match 3 game the concept is novel, adding a requirement of matching specific tiles to progress.Unfortunately once the novelty wears off, it becomes a chore. And the novelty will wear off, because the game is stacked against you in multiple ways, and requires you to lose repeatedly to complete tasks and buy upgrades (which soon become an artificial barrier to gameplay) before winning it even becomes possible.The main barrier to fun in the game is the manner of losing - not the inevitability, as with Tetris, but the speed at which it can happen. Every obstacle requires a specific type of match - attacks or keys - and the game can at whim decide to deprive you of these, leaving you helpless to do anything but wait until defeat.Other problems with the control system compound this. For instance, sliding the tiles is not well designed. If you click a tile, it can only slide by the first direction the mouse moves. So if you want to drag a tile upwards but your mouse moves a LITTLE to the left first, your tiles will try moving left and right instead. You can try again while the mouse button is held down, but you've lost that time.The matching detection is not great either. When you line or nearly line up a match, their tiles illuminate, however when you let go the tile you're moving can fit to an adjacent space, meaning the match does not occur and you have to start again. Once more, this costs time.The game needs resource management - trying to keep a healthy number of attack tiles and keys on the board at all times to be ready for any obstacles that arrive, but a couple of things ruin this as a concept and make the game even less fun.The monsters - particularly boss class monsters - require a LOT of matches and items to defeat, during which time you're losing time AND they hit you which also costs a nasty chunk of time. It goes without saying that despite the whole upgrade system, matching attack tiles is just not effective enough to keep the game balanced.The game can and does throw numerous amounts of the same obstacles at you consecutively, such as two chests, a door and then another chest. Even if you kept a healthy number of keys available at the start of this, you probably won't have enough to get through it all which leads to a lot of lost time and defeat. The same applies to multiple tough monsters.Matching tiles or using an item JUST before you arrive at an obstacle will cause it to be wasted. There's no tolerance whatsoever. This can lead to situations where you're not blocked by an obstacle, and too afraid to do anything because you don't want to lose the matches you can see available to you. This is contrary to the game's advertised element.Finally, when you match tiles, more appear which can result in combos. Normally in this kind of game these are desirable, but in this game they can and will punish you by decimating a resource you can see yourself needing soon - for instance, if you're fighting a monster with a chest behind it, a few keys may fall in during the fight, matching with the ones already on the board and severely depleting the keys. Then when you win the fight you won't be able to deal with the chest.Furthermore, when newly-fallen tiles create combos, this takes time during which you are unable to slide any tiles to make more matches. This results in awkward situations where you can see multiple matches you want to make but are unable to do so because a useless combo is ongoing and killing you in the process.You do get a very limited number of items, but most of the time an item does not even clear one of its respective obstacles. After a few hours of play to finally be able to challenge for the game's namesake 10,000,000 points (yes, you need to play for a few hours before winning a game even becomes a possibility), key items will not be enough to open a three-lock chest or door, and you will need at least three damage items to defeat a single monster.This game had promise, but its execution is disastrous. Its visuals and music are very fun for a few hours, but they do not last the extended periods of time demanded of you when the game becomes an unfair and repetitive grind.			"

												10000000 is a game that mixes the match-3 genre with an RPG angle. Now, it's not as enjoyable as the Puzzle Quest games but the game is not a complete trainwreck either. Despite the horrible controls (or morel like 'control' - it's mouse only and 'slide'-based, naturally intended for a smartphone device), it can serve you a bit of fun for a couple of hours. However, if you're out to get all of the achievements then you might be in for a long and painful grind. This is due to the very annoying RNG.All the negativity aside, let's get more into how the game works. You start out with a simple character, trapped in a place with barred up doors. You want to break free from this prison, but to do so, you must get a 10 000 000 score. Simple, right? Well, not really. Your toon is weak and in order to become stronger and advance then you need to gather supplies and gold. How do you do that? Well, that's where the core of the game comes in! You will need to arm yourself and venture into the dungeons! At first, you'll see the familiar match 3 board and you'll start to match tiles as you would in any type of game like this. Soon you will notice that you're not only meant to match them, you're meant to match certain tiles at certain times. Your toon will encounter foes with different abilities and weaknesses, knowing when to match the sword or the staff tiles might save you a lot of trouble here! There are also locks on chests and doors that you need to open by matching keys. Sometimes you will gain an item or a consumable by opening chests, but also if you match the chests on the tile board. These you can use to help you progress in the dungeons. Then there are the wood and stones that you need to upgrade the different shops.I had a lot of fun with the game in the beginning, especially when it felt like you made progress. Each new rank you unlock is a higher difficulty, and with each ranks there are several challenges to complete that grants you various bonuses. However, when you've reached the highest rank and completed all of the bonuses then the game kind of loses its potential. It takes a lot of luck and patience to even reach a score of 10 million, in any rank. I managed to 100% the game after nearly 13 hours of playtime. I've read about people who still hasn't been able to even after 30 hours, so keep this in mind if you're looking for an easy game to get perfect.Despite all the flaws and lack of fun end game I enjoyed it when I didn't feel too stressed out. The further you get, the quicker you need to be to match the tiles. You need to be able to notice when the border of your board turns red (encounters/events) or green (when your toon is mainly walking) and adapt to this in the best way possible. It takes time getting used to how the game functions, especially when it comes to matching the tiles by sliding the columns and rows. It can be extremely frustrating at times and I wish the developer had thought about this when porting the game to PC. It's already a challenging game and believe me, being defeated just because you weren't able to align the tiles perfectly due to whatever or any reason is just flat out aggrivating.I can recommend it if you like casual games that are a bit of a challenge. 10000000 is a challenge, both physically and mentally. In a good or bad way? Well, a bit of both to be honest.			"

												When I saw screenshots from this game, my first thought was: this is not a game for me. But I run it just to make cards and started playing and I realised it's not a bad game. In true it's quite qood. Only because of great design. It combine puzzle and RPG elements in perfect way. All elements fit to each other so well, then when you will die (and you will die a lot) you want just to try again, maybe next time will be better. It's quite addicting for some time.VERDICT:If you like puzzle games, try this one.If you think, you don't like such games, buy it on sale and give it a chance. You may be surprised.Like this review?

												If you like match 3 style games like Bejewled this is an interesting take on the genre. Your matching skills control the time limit which is represented by a character above the puzzle who runs through a dungeon hacking away at enemies, opening chests and doors. Eventually you really need to keep your eyes peeled and make well thought out decisions to make it through. What helps make this game so addictive is the ability to upgrade your stats and weapons as the dungeons will progressively get more difficult. the goal is to score 10,000,000 points in one dungeon run, which seems almost impossible. For what it is, a match 3 game, this game rocks I'd say 8/10			"

												A surprisingly fun game, 10,000,000 gave me more far more enjoyment than I had expected when I initially purchased it for a few dollars.  Though the game is primarily a Match-Three, every single type that you match provides an effect that drastically alters your current encounter.  Match three (or more for an increased effect) swords, for example, and you'll unleash a physical attack; match three magic wands, you'll cast a magical attack; match three keys, you'll unlock a treasure chest or door, etc.The game is quite challenging, though each time you run through a dungeon path you'll acquire gold, experience, and items that will aid you in future runs.  Gold can be used to upgrade your equipment (swords, staves, shields, armor, etc.) by choosing a specific trait such as the sharpness of your sword (critical chance) or the material that it is made out of (base damage).  Experience can be used to purchase training upgrades which enhance abilities such as your lockpicking skills and increasing damage against certain enemy types.All in all, it's a cheap game with a good amount of fun to be had as long as you keep that in mind.

												I was quite drawn to 10,000,000 because of the promise it showed in mixing RPG and puzzle elements. While the game delivered less depth than the concept seemed to allow for, I still got a very fast-paced, addictive, and satisfying puzzler. It was cumbersome using a mouse to play a game that was clearly designed with touch screens in mind, but the gameplay was enjoyable enough at its core to ease that pain most of the time. The music was catchy, and the variety of things to level up provided enough incentive to make it through most of the game. What I most appreciated was the fact that you're unlikely to brute force your way to the 10,000,000 point goal by simply grinding enough to level everything. Success is ultimately the result of strategy, speed, and good fortune, which was refreshing after the way so many other smartphone ports that have made it to this platform just hand victory to the player after a significant enough investment of time and virtual currency. It's unlikely that you'll want to revisit this one after beating it, but the asking price is very reasonable for a game of 10,000,000's overall quality.			"

												10 Million is, simply put, a match 3 game. While it boasts ""rpg elements,"" they are extremely minimal and 99% of the game is spent on the puzzle board. If that's your kind of game, then look no further. This title is best suited for casual gamers.ProsCozy pixel graphicsEntirely mouse controlled, fast response""RPG lite"" element that allows you to spend resources to upgrade damage, defense, and other perksObjectives, or in-game tasks, are used to gate progression, giving you a sense of achievement.The alchemy lab potions allow you to customize your gameplay further to help you reach your goalsConsOnly 2 or 3 tracks of music become quickly repetitive, chiptunes can be distracting for concentrationThe pixel graphics practically hid upgrade button at the top of the room window, making me work a lot harder halfway through the game. I wish it had been more visible.Item use is finicky, meaning, if you are racing through and click an item before the character stops in front of the enemy, the item is wasted. This was a source of much frustration in speed runs.The last two achievements require you to hit 10 million on lower difficulties, and Jose especially becomes somewhat luck based to spawn a ""clear path"" to goal.Low replayability after game completion outside of achievementsShort game overall, only a couple hours to clearA word of advice to achievement hunters: You must exit the game for the achievements to register. Hopefully this saves you extra runs thinking you didn't hit the score achievements.Happy matching! "

												10,000,000 is an arcade match-3 RPG with base management mechanics. Now, that may sound schizophrenic, but all the features actually mold together quite well to create a strange but fun experience. The gameplay consists mostly of dragging rows of cubes in order to match 3 of a certain type of cube, thereby helping you pass whatever obstacle you are currently faced with. Unfortunately, the game often gives you tons of whatever you need the least of at a certain time, leading to quite a lot of frustration. I remember one run in which I started out with a ton of keys.“Yeah!” I thought. “I’ll be totally set for this run!”I was then presented with about  10 or 15 obstacles in a row that required keys, and I ran out about halfway through and had to simply bide my time until the one match that I needed came along, using up all of my special items and powerups in the process. Now, whether that was built into the engine or I just have the worst luck in the world remains to be seen, but that kind of thing happens extremely frequently.The gameplay sometimes gets as annoying as the music (an extremely loud 8-bit tune in an endless loop), with the aforementioned situation of having everything except the one thing that you need providing nearly endless frustration. The goal of the game is to get 10,000,000 points in a single run, because apparently that will help you somehow escape the prison you are in. While in a run, you can collect special items for use in a pinch, as well as building materials, gold, and experience. You can use the building materials to fix and upgrade your base. What benefit do base upgrades give? They help you waste all your gold and XP getting upgrades for your equipment.Later on in the game, the price of training skills and getting upgrades becomes completely outrageous, whilst you are left sitting on a huge pile of wood and stone with nothing to spend it on. One thing I did like about the game was the difficulty curve. As you gather more points and complete objectives, you rank up and are forced to face harder and harder monsters. Thankfully, this gives the game a natural flow. Every time you rank up, the super-hard boss monsters that used to always kill you before you could get any matches in become commonplace grunts.Overall, 10,000,000 is a fun game, and it is definitely worth 5 bucks for the hours of gameplay you will undoubtedly get from it. While many players like me will ragequit often, you’ll always be coming back for more. I hope we can see a more polished and less frustrating sequel sometime in the future.			"

												+ Great ""match 3"" mechanics+ Pretty good chip-tunes and pixel art (if you're into that sort of art)+ Delivers the ""just one more turn"" mindset+ Equipment upgrading mechanics- Very repetitive and has little to offer- Relies on pure luck for extremely high scores- Obviously a mobile port, even though it is ported well for PC10,000,000 is a ""match 3"" type puzzler with a ""retro"" art style with chip-tune music and pixel graphics by EightyEightGames. As with most games of this type, you don't need many words to describe how you play.The core gameplay consists of sliding rows and columns of various icons so that three or more align, making the aligned icons disappear and making new ones fall out of the top to replace them. The spin that 10,000,000 has to offer is that you're a prisoner of a dungeon, and you must score, well, 10 million points to get out. You earn points by killing monsters and opening doors and chests, by matching staffs and swords, or keys, respectively. Matching backpacks gives a chance of earning items, which you can then use to kill monsters, to give you more time in the dungeon or to open chests and doors. There are also wood and stone icons, which give you those as a resource that stays the same between playthroughs. There are two other, similarly working resources: experience and gold, which are earned by killing monsters and opening chests. Once you run out of time in the dungeon, you return to the main hub where you can use the resources you've amassed to upgrade your statistics in rooms that can be upgraded. To progress through the dungeon you must complete quests such as ""match x amount of y tiles"", or ""make x amount of triple matches"". Eventually, a quest involving scoring a set amount of points during a round appears, and upon completing the quest, you gain a new rank and may now start the next run further in the dungeon.Now, that looks like a ton of words, but that is literally all the game has to offer. There is nothing else in this game (apart from the ending, which I won't spoil, but trust me when I say that I wouldn't need many more words to describe what happens after getting 10,000,000 points).The game sports a ""retro"" feel to complement the mechanics, which works fine. The pixel graphics are good, but not amazing. The music is also pretty nice, but there aren't many tracks. After a few runs, it gets very repetitive, to the point where I, a person who usually sticks through with a games music until the end, had to use my music library instead.Unfortunately, all of these facts point toward the game being an obvious mobile port, designed to be played in short bursts of playtime. As a result, the interface is a bit huge when playing in full screen, and the options menu is very lackluster (not that it needs to not be, given the simple graphics of the game).The RPG-ish equipment upgrading mechanics aren't bad (I love it when the name of your armor changes based on the aspects you choose to upgrade, possibly giving names such as ""immovable cloth ring mail"" or ""soft diamond shirt""), but what's the point of having a visual representation of your character if he looks like a pixelated Indiana Jones regardless of whether he has mythril plate-mail or a cloth shirt? It's not like there's thousands of equipment possibilities.Overall, 10,000,000 feels very repetitive. It's good at what it does, and presents a spin on the ""match 3"" puzzler mechanics, but this doesn't remove the repetitiveness problem completely. The equipment upgrades seem like an after-thought because of how they do not affect the character visually. This game hangs in the balance between ""I recommend it"" and ""I don't recommend it"", but equipment non-visualization forces me to say that I don't recommend 10,000,000.This does not mean it is a bad game at all, but I just wouldn't recommend it to anyone but the most hardcore ""match 3"" fans. The developers still update the game though, so I promise to change the recommendation if they do visualize the equipment upgrades. In my opinion, a good ""match 3"" has to have a good core system and a great spin on the formula. Visualizing the upgrades would make the spin in this one great, instead of ""just"" good.EDIT 2015/05/28 - Noticed I misspelt the title of the game every single time by forgetting the commas. Whoops...			"

Luck based but still good. - As all the luck based games it's hard to beat because you need skill and luck for it. - This game is an interesting mix from two very diferent kind of games but it's well made. - Kind of addicting.- Hard to get a perfect game from it. - You have to beat it multiples times for all the achievements but you can do it in the same saved game. -  there's a bugged achievement, you have to kill all the different dragons in the game, but sometimes you beat the game and the achievement doesn't show up, just go back and run dungeon again in the other levels, defeat the dragon and it's done.

												A fantastic puzzle game, 10,000,000 thrives on the ability to hop right back in after a crushing defeat. Your ultimate goal is to secure a score of 10,000,000, finally being able to escape from the clutches of a castle that you've been locked away in. Various upgrades are also available, in which you can boost your various attacks, as well as creating special potions with fantastic, and maybe some not so fantastic perks.My only complaint is that it still is, at its heart, a mobile game. Nevertheless, the $5 dollar price tag still provides hours of fun, especially if you're aiming at earning all of the achievements the game has to offer, even if some of them are a bit tedious.If you're a die-hard puzzle game lover, buy this game immediately. If not, check the game out on a sale. 8.7/10			"

												10,000,000 is one of those great little casual time wasters that you can pick every once in a while to grind for 5 more minutes then put back down again until the next time. The core gameplay mechanic is the basic tile matching we've seen in so many games by now, 10,000,000's own little unique aspect to this rather tired mechanic is that instead of moving individual tiles you move entire columns. This however does not change the concept significantly and if you have played a tile matching game in the past you'll figure this one out in no time at all.The interesting aspect of 10,000,000. And what separates it from so many other similar games, is the way it approaches the timing mechanic. on top of your screen you have a little guy running along in a dungeon, as he progresses he will encounter various obstacles such as doors and monsters each pushing him slowly out of the screen if you do not match the right tiles on the board below. This creates quite a bit more purpose than your usual tile matcher where you just match what you can, as quickly as you can. Here you might wanna save those keys in case you run into a chest, or be careful not to spend too many swords and staffs if you think you're getting close to a tough monster.The game also feature a small metagame, as you match tiles and progress through the dungeon you earn wood, stone, gold and experience which can be used to open up shops and improve your various abilities.All in all 10,000,000 is a fun little game, nothing spectacular, nothing really exciting but a solid time waster. Unfortunately while the time waster genre as such is perfect for mobile games it does not fit quite as well on the PC and although this one of the best examples I've seen in a long time it still doesn't quite measure up to the standards that you would expect from a game that costs money.

												10.000.000 is a match 3 game with a twist. As you run through a dungeon you need to match the proper tiles to escape: swords for your enemies, keys for locked doors etc. There is also an upgrading system that lets you get stronger so you can progress further into the dungeon after each failure. Graphics are as minimal as they can be and so is the music, though the game's appeal seems to remain intact regardless, making it a fun casual game for short sessions.			"

												I thoroughly enjoyed this fine little time waster.So, yes. It's kind of like Bejeweled. The matches you make down below push your character through combat and exploration above. Each ""run"" through the dungeon takes a minute or two. But as you run, you achieve a series of objectives which the game gradually presents to you, which leads to improved skills.The game's genius is the way it rewards you not for a lifetime score, but instead for pushing your single-run high score higher and higher, until you can reach 10,000,000 in a single run. As your character improves a bit with each run, cresting your previous high score becomes theoretically easier each time you run the dungeon. Die, and you can either quit the game, or try one more run almost instantly.It's not a deep game, but I can't think of many games that made ""just one more turn"" so compelling. Like, ""Civilization""-style compelling. It's so easy to try again, over and over. A minute here, a minute there, next thing you know, 2 hours have gone by.			"

												I originally started playing 10,000,000 to get the trading cards (yes I do it the old fashioned way). As I began playing I became more and more attached to it. I realy enjoy matching puzzle type games for calming down or just relaxing anyways. But the RPG elements added into 10,000,000 make it just different enough to keep it interesting. The upgrades and RPG elements aren't very deep or anything but I believe it is just enough of a twist to set it apart from other tile matching games. I would say if you like matching games it is worth $5. If your interests lie more in the RPG aspect of it you will probably want to pass on this one.			"

												This is a highly addictive game. A very fast paced match-three puzzle/action/rpg.  Match three swords/staves to deal damage to enemies as you run along to your exit, collect gold, wood and experiance to build better equipment and learn new skills. It will have you rage quitting and then moments late, you find yourself oddly compelled to open it up again and continue where you finished off. The graphics style is pretty neat, you don't really play this sort of game for the graphics though, the fast paced music keeps the momentom going as well. There is next to zero replayability however, once you escape, you won't want to carry on playing, as you will have already full upgraded your castle, armour and abilities anyway. Yes you can keep trying to beat your highscore, but that's just not my thing. Most people will probably have this in their library from a bundle or maybe just for farming trading cards, but if you want a pick up and play game will keep you playing for hours on hours, 10,000,000 is really worth a shot.

												Frantic and addictive match 3 game with a retro dungeon crawler theme. Good length (about five hours) and balance of goals and upgrades, The difficulty curve scales well to your improved equipment, so you feel like you're getting more powerful, but the game doesn't get so easy it's boring, and by the time I hit 10,000,000 points, I had just finished all the goals and bought most of the upgrades. Highly recommended if you like fast-paced puzzle games.			"

												Interesting little tile match game with RPG elements. Unlike some games with additional RPG elements this game makes them necissary, your weapon and armor upgrades allow you to get further in the game and without the RPG elements it would be nearly impossible to get to the victory condition of 10,000,000 points in a single run. The graphics are visually uninteresting but that is not that big of an issue as you can allways tell the difference between the different tiles and enemies. It bearly takes up any space on your hard drive so it is definately good for weaker PCs. my only real issue with it is the controlls. The laptop i am using utilizes a nub mouse so i have a bit of trouble quickly moving it around the board. This game almost needs a touchscreen to be able to reach it's fullest potential. On a basic PC 5/10, on a Touchscreen 7/10			"

												10,000,000 is a primitive gauntlet running match 3 puzzle game. Your mission is to ultimately score 10,000,000 points to free yourself from the dungeon, but you have to purchase a bunch of upgrades using gold and experience points before you will be able to achieve that goal. Upgrades are available for your sword, staff, armor, and shield. Plus you can buy additional training attributes through earned experience points. Then there are the potions which have both positive and negative effects that you must weigh to determine whether to activate them or not.The gameplay consists of frantically matching gems to attack or unlock doors and chests in an effort to keep your character from hitting the left edge of the screen. Your character continues running to the right as long as you match the right gems to vanquish your enemies or open doors and chests. There is no polish on this game whatsoever. The concept is nice, but the game itself is pretty cheesy. However, for a buck, is does provide reasonable entertainment value.			"

												I knew of this game when it was released on Itunes/App Store for Iphone but I don't really do much of gaming on my mobile, so was pleased to see it on Steam at last. I'm really glad I decided to buy it now rather than clearing out my backlog, it's pretty fun time-wasting game that's easy to play, hard to 'master' so to speak. Really loving the puzzle system with fast reaction timing required, makes it more exiciting :) For £4 I can highly recommend it - it may take you about 6 to 10 hours to get simple ending or more if you plan to get all achievements (which didn't work for me, but it didn't bother me as I'm not fussed on them at the moment - it might be something to do with my sister's laptop, will test on my actual PC)It is also pretty playable on slower computers - my sister's laptop is horrible, yet I can play 10,000,000 real smooth. Worth a purchase for those with even just basic laptops.			"

You basically attack if there's monster with the sword or wand, open doors/chest for keys, woods and stones are for resources that you need to unlock the storerooms in order to upgrade your stats.

												10,000,000 is a hybrid puzzle-role-playing game set in a fantasy dungeon. Your goal is to achieve 10,000,000 points in a single run, to earn your freedom.LikedGraphics. 8-bit, nothing extraordinary, but, neither bad.Content. You can upgrade your gear, just like an RPG, you can even earn stats trough experience and activate double edge potions.Gameplay. Match of three, but, you move tiles instead of swapping individual items and you have to make a match depending on your situation inside the dungeon.DislikedGraphics. Enemies get repetitive and animations feel stiff.Music. A song for the menu and a song for the dungeon. Both felt too modern and artificial, out of place with the game's setting.Content. Arcade, that means, you pretty much get all the content after a single run, the rest is just, more of the same with higher numbers.Controls. Made for touchscreen, you can miss matches if you're too fast or too slow.Gameplay. Heavily RNG based, you can get stuck in runs without any chance of winning. No clear indication on when you're about to lose (HP, time limit, screen end).Overall, a good game for short, casual sessions, nothing too hard, but neither, too easy. The way you must make a specific match to advance or survive in real time is pretty original.★★★☆☆ | It was OK "

												10,000,000Puzzlez Monsters Upgrades Bejewled on acidThose four words were the first words that came into my mind when I first bought this game.The Gameplay:10 mil is about a pixelated guy in a cool hat who wants to escape a castle he lives in. The only obvious ways is to run through a dungeon while playing a pixelated more dungeon-ey version of Bejewled. While on those runs, you have to match sword blocks to attack, staff blocks to do a magic attack, match wood and stone to get the materials to upgrade your castle, unlock doors and chests with key blocks, and upgrade your armor with shield blocks. You try to last as long as you can while matching these blocks to stay alive and make it to ""10,000,000"" points. Once you get 10,000,000 points you are freed from you castle.Using the money and purple stuff and gold and wood and stone that you aquire over your grinds of dungeons, you can fix rooms. These rooms are good for things such as upgrades, potions, etc. Some of the upgraes may be things like ""Pay 200 purple stuff and 300 gold and you will have 10% more luck"" etc. This is a vital part of 10 mil since you need to upgrade your dude to last longer and ultimately get freed!Pros and Cons!Pros:1.Loads of upgrades!2.Bejeweled style Gameplay!3.Puzzles!4.Missions!5.Hours of fun gameplay!6.Grinding! since i have nothing better to do :(7.Retro style!8.Pixels!9.The guys got a hat!10.Deep gameplay!Cons:1.When playing theres this one group of  ♥♥♥♥ing pixels that is black on the left side of the screen.

												Terrible name aside, this is a semi-decent time-waster in the classic ""match 3"" puzzle genre. The twist in this one is that the matching mechanic works in conjunction with the actions your character takes at the top of the screen. The character's goal is to keep moving to the right, clearing obstacles such as monsters, treasure chests and locked doors. In order to clear those obstacles, you need to match specific types of tiles (swords to kill monsters, keys to open chests, etc). Getting hit or not matching tiles causes you to slow down and creep towards the left side of the screen. If you get pushed all the way back, the run is over. After each run, you return to a dungeon where upgrades can be purchased using the resources collected during the run (wood, stone, gold and experience). And that's pretty much all there is to it. Basically, you just keep running through the dungeon and buying upgrades when you die. Reaching certain score milestones causes you to rank up, which allows you to achieve higher scores and travel further into the dungeon. The ultimate goal is to score the titular 10,000,000 points and escape. On the technical front, the graphics are extremely simple, done in a low-res pixel style. It works for what it is, but the visuals are really nothing to write home about. I did really like the music, though. It's pretty catchy and very NES-esque. In summary, if you are a fan of ""match 3"" games and don't mind spending a few hours on the mindless grind it takes to complete (I would estimate around 5-6 hours or so), then by all means, give this a shot. However, I really must reiterate that the gameplay is the very definition of a grind - the whole experience from start to finish is extremely repetitive. If you have a short attention span or really don't like doing the same thing over and over for hours, do NOT buy this game. Additionally, I have to say I also think the price is a little too high. For some reason, it's double what it costs on iOS, which doesn't make a whole lot of sense. I'm not saying it's a rip-off, but this might be one of those cases where you may want to wait and see if it goes on sale at some point.			"

												10,000,000. An RPGish, Bejeweled-like game. Well... ok...While the game does have an interesting concept it annoyingly relies on luck and what tiles the game decides to generate more than anything else, much like Bejeweled or similar puzzle games. If a monster is in your path, you'll have to quickly match sword or staff tiles to do damage. A locked chest requires matching key tiles. And as tiles are random, one might find oneself stuck, matching any tiles at all, hoping to match enough of what is needed before time is up.At the start of the game, be prepared to lose, quite often, until enough materials are gathered to unlock upgrades. While initially the upgrades that can be purchased come in handy and allow one to make quick work of monsters, the upgrades have a max level which in my opinion is too low. Especially during the latter ranks, and especially when fighting bosses. Even completely maxed out requires, more often than not, way too many tile matches and wastes way too much time. However, there are items to find thru out the dungeon run which can help somewhat. Scrolls that will change wood or stone tiles to keys, swords, or staves. Various weapons and orbs to hurl at monsters. Skeleton keys to easily unlock chests or locks. And food items that will give you a time boost. With that said, the weapons, orbs and skeleton keys must be used rather precisely; if used a split second too early when arriving upon a chest or monster the item does nothing and disappears. The same can be said for tiles too. It would have been nice if there was some leeway as making sure the dungeon runner is close enough to an obstacle before using items can waste valuable time, even if just a split second.And possibly the biggest time waster in the game, combos. Match some tiles, more fall down and they match. Combo! They are sometimes handy like during a boss fight. Except when the tiles continue to fall and continue to match it becomes a potential death trap. Yes, I've lost more than once awaiting tiles to stop falling and matching others because during this time nothing else can be done. And if the reason I lost wasn't because I ran out of time, it was shortly after because the combo completely used up tiles that would have came in handy just a few seconds later.Replay value? Prepare to spend several hours upgrading everything before even attempting a run for 10,000,000. But after one does achieve freedom by getting to a score of 10,000,000, the only reason I can think of to come back to this game would be to try for a higher personal score (no Steam leaderboards), or to earn all achievements. Personally, once I complete all the achievements I doubt I will ever play this again.Is 10,000,000 fun? Sure, it can be. Would I recommend it? Hmm. Not at the full price of $4.99. I picked it up on sale for less than a dollar. At that price it was worth it. While I don't really want to vote thumbs down, I'm going to have to since Steam has no neutral option.			"

A nice fusion of match 3 and runner gamesThanks to the popularity of Bejeweled, and the over abundance of the easy to make endless runner game, both genres on their own are fairly stale at this point. Some developers will try to mix them up, usually by adding RPG elements or otherwise an artificial sense of progression. 10,000,000 is one of the first I've seen to combine both genres together. The result is quite refreshing. Running for high score in and of itself is not the goal. Along the way you fight monsters, at which point you're stopped and brought to a match 3 game for battle. Said match 3 game is what you've come to expect in the kind with RPG elements; attack, magic, defend, money, and so on. What separates this from usual runners and match 3 is the sense of progression. Every battle gives you gold and XP, which you can use to upgrade your various battle pieces and stats. You're encouraged to keep at it, as the more you play and the farther you get, you can build and get that much farther the next time. Though the game can get a bit grindy towards the end, where you need a lot of XP to get the final upgrades, on the whole it's solidly paced and rarely feels cheap. And like runners and match 3s, it's designed to be done in short bursts, so you can stop when it gets annoying and come back later without missing a beat. All towards an actual goal beyond ""getting a high score""If you're a fan of endless runners or match 3s, and enjoy games with 8 bit aesthetics and sounds, give this one a shot. It's great fun if you know what to expect.			"

												10,000,000 is a phone/tablet match 3 game that was ported to PC in which your character is running across the screen at the top above the board, and needs to bypass different obstacles based off of whatever it is that you match with. As you succeed, you can upgrade your character and repair various rooms which allow you to buy upgrades which allows you to gain more money or progress more successfully.It's a pleasant twist on the typical match 3 formula, and for folks who are looking for a bit of mindless distraction it'll definitely scratch that itch. Probably better suited to a more mobile platform like those it's originally from, but it still works as a PC game.			"

												Match 3 style games are mostly about 'randomness' and 'luck' with only a pinch of 'skill'. As such these games will take you on an emotional roller coaster; when things don't go your way you will feel deep low's of frustration. But when things are going your way you feel elation from the accomplishment of beating the odds. This game can be very hard, you need to be extremely quick in matching tiles. There is a sort of 'continual countdown timer' where if you do not match tiles quickly enough then your 'session' will come to an end. You can increase your session 'time' by creating a match 4 or 5 of certain tiles or by eating food. On the other hand, if enemies hit you then your 'time' will decrease. The style of 'matching tiles' in this game is similar to 'Puzzle Kingdoms' except in this game you can slide as far as you like along the entire row or column. You will fail alot in this game especially at the harder difficulties as the odds are stacked against you. But 'winning' every play session is not how this game works. You just take each 'play session' as far as you can; you will earn resources and experience every play session which you keep regardless. You spend this upgrading your dwellings, weapon, armor, spells, equipment, etc. So the idea is that you are playing the game for the match 3 puzzle/challenge and just let the progression happen in the background naturally.I feel this game is more for an advanced or veteran match 3 puzzle player and will not be friendly to new comers of the genre.

												As a puzzle and strategy enthusiast, I've played my fair share of games and it's always a treat when a game brings something new to the table.  Deviating from the typical 'Match 3' formula, you may find snapshots of the game misleading--the tiled board looks just like any other matching game--but 10000000 has a surprise for you:  You're not going to move the tiles.  You're going to move the BOARD.'Hah!', I hear you scoff.  'That doesn't seem like much of a difference.'  That's what I thought, too, until I played it.  Manipulating the board this way bends your brain in a completely different direction, as you cannot simply adjust one tile at a time.  Every move you make will affect the entire playing field in ways you may not be able to predict at first and it adds new complexity as you struggle to speed through each encounter, which brings me to the other half of the gameplay:You will encounter various monsters with different resistances and weaknesses, locks to pick, chests to open, and all the while the clock is working against you to clear the precise tiles you need to beat each challenge in a matter of seconds.  It comes with an RPG element that rewards your accomplishments and encourages you even after a defeat and, on the whole, it makes for a very engaging experience.  As for flaws, the music can become a bit droning after awhile and it's likely to become stuck in your head very quickly, and a few cracks show in the few scattered misspellings (you're going to be 'poisioned' quite a bit), but on the whole, it's a good game.I feel like the developers missed an opportunity by not including more for the player to do.  Sure, you can keep playing it as long as you like, trying to raise your high score, but since the game revolves around meeting certain score or endurance goals, once you have completed all of said goals and related achievements, it feels like there's no further challenge.  It's just about right for the price and should provide several hours of entertainment.			"

												It's a Match-3 game, with a simple objective: Get 10,000,000 points. The narrative throws in something about escaping a dungeon, but really that's a lame excuse for the mechanics.Fortunately, the mechanics are where the game shines. The gameplay reminds me of a more strategic version of Chuzzle, which is pretty high praise. You automatically gain points as your avatar keeps moving through the dungeon, but that doesn't continue for long before an obstacle stops your progress and starts whittling away the time you have remaining on your run.Your matches are used to overcome obstacles and collect resources in order to boost your score. The resources that you collect can be expended at your home base (like, say, a less complicated version of Rogue Legacy) to provide upgrades and bonuses to plow through obstacles more easily, defend yourself against said obstacles, or on the rare occasion just provide a percentage boost to your overall score.The graphics are deliberately retro, even excessively so, but it definitely has a unified aesthetic. The music and sounds are sufficient, but I found after about 30 minutes of playing and hearing all the tracks, I enjoyed it more with the music off and a different soundtrack in the background.			"

												I'm a fan of puzzle games and RPGs, so a fusion of the two should go over well right? In this case, it did to great effect. As soon as I figured out the way that the puzzle tiles and patterns operated, I was hooked! I've long since beat the game and still find myself going back into the dungeons of 10,000,000 trying to slay dragons and break records. Even if you aren't a fan of the genres, this game makes an excellent time dump that you will be glad you bought.			"

												Very fun game, played it 9 hours on the PC and around 2 hours on my phone and I still haven't finished it. It's one of those casual games you can play while waiting for your order to get to your home. I very much enjoyed the RPG parts of it and the novelty of having to match the tiles so your character can progress through the dungeon. I wouldn't reccomend it to people that won't have the patience or want to finish the game. I think it's just a fun, casual, time spender that's worth checking out.			"

												After about 11 hours and all achievements, I can say this:10,000,000 brings together elements of RPG, Dungeon Crawl and Match 3 to make for a unique experience all around. The system of improving your character as you go through the various difficulty levels of the dungeon is quite well-made, I would claim, and the challenge is high. And to get all of the achievements is a really tough job. But in the end, when you crack that magical number for the first time, it's a victory well-earned.An overall well-rounded game for some casual fun. The 8-Bit graphics give it a nice touch as well. And seriously, it doesn't need any more elaborate graphics. Would definitely play again.			"

Destroy Keys to open chests and doors, swords and staff to attack monsters, etc...But your character did'nt have any health bar, strange huh ?All the system run about the Time, when you get attacked or blocked by a door, you will lose time until you solve the problem.Each monsters and meters that you got, the more point you will earn and, you probably guest it, you win by makin' 10.000.000 points.Easy to play, hard to finish, this game is really fun and will offer you some serious challenge to finish it at 100% (talkin' about the achievements)The Musics in this game looks as old as the Graphics, 8bit all over, and this rock ! multiples music is set in the game and you will not be tired to hear them. for the graphics, it's amazing, everything is correctly done to understand what monsters or thing will block your way.For the Gameplay, this is where everyone can't be all good with it.This game is fully usable with the mouse and to move the blocks, you need to click on the line and move it. It is simple on the paper but can be a pain when you ran out of time and get stressed, but still, this is part of the game and make the difficulty, and that's why you will love this game !I recommend highly to play it !

												OVER 10,000,000!  Yes, that is the goal of this game.  Even though the concept of match-3 puzzle have been use hundreds of time, the addition of RPG and action element make this game stand above all.  The gameplay is very simple because is a match-3 puzzle, but unlike other, you have to focus more on your charactor and the next objective that you have to clear, if a monster stand before you, you need to match attack tiles, if a door or chest you need to match keys.  There is also material tiles, after every run end, you gain the materials and experience points to help strengthen your charactor, which help you on the next run.Unlike the mobile counterpart, the PC port does not feel like endless at all.  Once you upgrade everything to the max, which is fairly easy grind, and reach 10,000,000, the game feel finish because of lack of a leaderboard.  I must note that the achievement does add extra challenge but once you get use to the control, you shouldn't have problem clearing them.Overall, I must say this game is a good buy for the listing price, can even be a must buy when it on sale.  You may want to play this game on your phone though, is it a phone game afterall.			"

An Awesome Bejeweled-Like Game [KAMGUSTA's REVIEW]Wow... just wow! Too bad it only has a limited playtime (5 hours). It is a sort of tech-demo: the gameplay is solid, but the game is not so refined (for example, upon completing a quest you are forced to exit the dungeon for refreshing the others) and lacks some customization (no resolution settings), quality (bitmaps everywhere!) and variety (maybe different classes, hero's stats, different levels, and so on).What's about the gameplay? You advance the dungeon by combining items of the same type in your lower part of the screen: wands for magical attack, swords for physical attack, chests for loot and so on... enemies can attack you and slow you down (or kill!).Advice: you can upgrade your buildings by clicking ""upgrade"" in the upper portion of the windows... It took me 3 hours to notice it.I am looking forward to 20,000,000! With a little more dedication it could be the next Puzzle Quest (at the moment, the pinnacle of the genre)!Best played with Keyboard and MouseRecommended Buy Price < 2$Score 8/10 "

												Frustrating RPG Puzzle Freedom Simulator, which while wrecks your very soul into a slobbering pathetic of lifeless drool (and will leave you contemplating your very being) offers one of the most (strangely) rewarding completions ever. It's a simple game that on the surface should be completed within a matter of minutes - the goal is simple: Achieve 10,000,000 points in 1 one and you're free to leave. If you die your score is reset. Yet, it's not that simple. Not only do you face a string of increasingly difficult monsters on your run to freedom, you also have to overcome your own inability to match 3 or more tiles together. So simple.Yet so freaking difficult.And thus addicition is born. The feeling you can beat this game, with the secretly scoffing bellows of laughter from whatever twisted mind designed this game spur you on to play it. There's not much more to say than that. It would probably be best enjoyed as an iOS/Android game, certainly one where you could pick and play in small time windows, rather than long drawn out PC sessions (and a quick look shows that it is available for less than £2 most of the time). If you like puzzle games, and games that tease you with their simplicity (yet burn you with their difficulty) than this game is for you. If, however, you cannot stand iOS/Android apps, and despise their existance on Steam... avoid it.			"

												Short version: 7/10; only buy it at around $0.99 or a bundle, imo.I didn't expect much from 10,000,000 coming in, but I was pleasantly surprised; I saw $0.99, and saw a game described as a puzzle / RPG, so I was sold. At the heart of the game is a ""connect 3"" game (I think that's the term...?); you have a board of tiles, and must match three or more to do something. While you're playing the game, you'll be faced with either enemies, a locked door, or a locked chest, and must match the correct corresponding tiles to advance. To combat the enemies, you must connect either the melee tiles (which can crit), or the magic tiles (which can have special effects, ranging from freezing them solid, to poisoning them). To combat the doors and/or chests, you must match the keys. Once you open the chest, you either get gold (one of three currencies used in the game to unlock / upgrade things), or a one-time use item that helps you in fighting. Other tiles that are used are: wood (currency), stone (currency), item (gives you an item to use in combat), and wildcard, which acts as anything, tile-wise. There are a couple of things I don't like about the game, namely the fact that there are situations where it's virtually impossible to win. If the board gives you a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ hand, you can't do anything about it (well, you can use an item to randomly change like, five of 25 tiles once...), and will lose. If you don't have any keys on the board, and you run into a chest, well, good luck. While I appreciate that the game has ""stronger"" and ""weaker"" monsters, they're not tuned very well; the dragons will make short work of you, unless you have items saved up for them specifically. The graphics might be a turn-off to some players. There's only one song, that's endlessly looped (didn't bother me, but I wanted to mention it). Another annoyance is that if you use your items early, before the enemy is properly aligned with you, you've wasted the item, and it does nothing. Really...? Finally, the hit-detection can be weird, since you *only* use the mouse for this game...most times it was okay, but I did notice it from time to time.With all that said, I enjoy this type of game, and with light RPG elements, and the fact that certain tiles really only work with certain situations, I enjoyed the strategy... when I wasn't raging. As mentioned at the top, I would rate this a 7/10, but would only recommend it at around $1.00 or so (or if it's in a bundle).[I've played the game offline; I've got about four hours played start to finish.]			"

												Bejewel meets, Indiana Jones meets, RPG in this odd mix. Fight your way through hordes of monsters, while using your puzzle skill to kill them off. Who knew one day that puzzles would be the bane of dragons.Game play: 7The game play is solid. You start off in a stone room with broken down doors everywhere, that leads into other rooms. With these rooms, you are able to increase your static, from better armor, to better spells, to better score multipliers, to more damage. To be able to unlock each door you must run the ongoing dungeon to earn experience to gain levels and to gain gold. While running the dungeon you are given a Bejewel style puzzle game. On the top of the screen you have the character running, He’ll run into monsters, doors, and chest. That you need to match up the squares to progress further into the dungeon. You are given a time limit. You will slowly be pushed backwards to the left edge of the screen. The faster you kill monsters or unlock things the closer you get to the right side of the screen. Once you pass a certain threshold on the screen you will gain a bonus to your score as long as you keep moving ahead. Each Square has an icon that you need to match up to be able to kill monsters or unlock chest or doors. Each icon has special ability to help you progress deeper. The icons you see are, Wood, Boulder, Wand, Sword, backpack, key and shield. Wood and boulder give you materials to use to build the rooms you see at the start. Wand and sword are attacks depending on the monster they can be either be weaker or stronger vs the type you are using. The backpack can give you items to use in your inventory on the right side of the screen. The key is used to open chest and doors, the shield gives you better armor to take hits better.On the side, you have you’re inventory where you get power ups, From faster moment, to magic attacks, to keys and weapons. They can be very useful. After you die you are able to use the gold and materials you gained from the previous run to build the rooms, or you may hold on to them until next time. The overall object of the game is to get your score to 10,000,000 (Ten million). To be able to escape.Story: 2There isn’t really a story going on here. You are a guy who looks like Indiana Jones who has become trapped in this dungeon that is now trying to escape. Having to fight zombies, demons, dragons and such. That’s pretty much it. This game doesn’t really need much of a story to really enjoy it.Graphics: 6This game takes on the retro 8-bit style. Like many other indie games that uses 8-bit. They are pretty simple as it is. The mix of colors being used range from grays, to lighter colors like reds and blues. It’s a simple pallet of colors over all. The graphics don’t pop out as anything to flashy to it. they are Kinda of flat graphics. In its own right the graphics are decent.Music: 5Like the graphics it takes on an 8-bit sound track. The music is decent sounding but not amazing but yet not horrible either. It does keep in decent pace with the game play. Other than that there isn’t really much else to the music.Final Though:Overall I enjoyed this game a lot. It was fun, and challenging. I found the game play being the best part of this game. However this game kinda of lacks any real re playability. It’s a game that is great for a one time play and not touch it for a while. This game doesn’t stand out to other puzzle games. However the unique thing about this game is the RPG element which gives it a nice touch. Having the Bejewel style puzzle being what you use to fight monsters and unlock stuff with does give this game the bit of edge it needs to push it higher than your average puzzle game. With the mix of gaining gold and materials and being able leveling up to unlock more powers to make you stronger does make this game fun.If you are a puzzle person or someone who simply loves Bejewel like myself you may want to try this game out. If anything this game is cheap so for a few bucks you can’t go wrong with this game.Final Score: 6Check out my Tumblr for more! www.rogue32807.tumblr.com "

Match 3 as Action RPG...What sounds like a weird idea actually plays quite nice. You have to reach 10,000,000 Points in score to escape the dungeon.To reach this you have to skill up and gain enough resources to upgrade your character and beat up attacking monsters, instead of hitpoints you have a timeout, which is reached when your character touches the left border of the area. Pros: - Very easy to learn game, the match 3 genre does not need to be explained.- Fast and intuitive gameplay.- Solid programmed, No crash encountered during gameplay.Cons: - Soundtrack can get fast enervating... either switch it off or keep it on low volumeRecomended:If you don't have a match 3 game in your library you might wish to try this one. It's about five bucks for this game, which might look like a bit high. But if you have a chance to get this game during a sell out or otherwise cheap. Take your chance. I am not saying it's too expensive, since the programmers have made it a good experience to play. Addiction Incoming!			"

This game doesn’t really need much of a story to really enjoy it.Graphics: 6This game takes on the retro 8-bit style. Like many other indie games that uses 8-bit. They are pretty simple as it is. The mix of colors being used range from grays, to lighter colors like reds and blues. It’s a simple pallet of colors over all. The graphics don’t pop out as anything to flashy to it. they are Kinda of flat graphics. In its own right the graphics are decent.Music: 5Like the graphics it takes on an 8-bit sound track. The music is decent sounding but not amazing but yet not horrible either. It does keep in decent pace with the game play. Other than that there isn’t really much else to the music.Final Though:Overall I enjoyed this game a lot. It was fun, and challenging. I found the game play being the best part of this game. However this game kinda of lacks any real re playability. It’s a game that is great for a one time play and not touch it for a while. This game doesn’t stand out to other puzzle games. However the unique thing about this game is the RPG element which gives it a nice touch. Having the Bejewel style puzzle being what you use to fight monsters and unlock stuff with does give this game the bit of edge it needs to push it higher than your average puzzle game. With the mix of gaining gold and materials and being able leveling up to unlock more powers to make you stronger does make this game fun.If you are a puzzle person or someone who simply loves Bejewel like myself you may want to try this game out. If anything this game is cheap so for a few bucks you can’t go wrong with this game.Final Score: 6Check out my Tumblr for more! www.rogue32807.tumblr.com "

Introduction10,000,000 is an hybrid RPG/Action/Puzzle game. Steady progress in the game allows you to gain the tools to break out of your prison.Title: 10,000,000Genre: Action, Casual, Indie, RPGDeveloper: EightyEightGames Publisher: EightyEightGames Release Date: 15 Jan, 2013Main ReviewIt's not an easy game, but it's addictive in how it works. Your character progresses in a dungeon and you match blocks together in order to keep on moving, matching keys to open a door or chest, swords or shields to fight. The game is a race against time. It's quite fast paced and easy to get into, though hard to keep going and finish it. The RNG can sometimes really screw you up - and you may need to reset a level just because you didn't get what you needed for a long time. It's satisfying to see the big numbers appear, and each shake of the screen when you match blocks is pretty cool.You need to reach the score 10,000,000 in order to complete the game, and all the runs beforehand allow you to buy upgrades such as potions, weapons, gear, score accumulators in order to improve your score further, get better upgrades - until you're good enough to hit the top score to beat the game. You can collect four items that stay with you even when a run fails, to make future runs easier. It can get really fraustrating, since even if you have every single upgrade, getting the final score is still difficult. However that also makes it fun! The music also helps a lot to get you more stressed.Visually the game at times make it hard to see what's going on, especially when managing your position in the game. The character screen is small. On the left of the main ""running"" screen is a skull, on the right is a finish line and a smily face. If your character is at the right of the screen, it's harder to counter a threat since you don't see it until it's already on you. If your character is on the left of the screen, you'll die a lot faster if you don't get the block combination you need to open a door, since your run ends if the skull catches up with you.Pros and ConsPro'sAddictiveChallenging/Fast pacedGood musicFun system to work withConsAddictiveChallenging/Fast PacedMUSIC MAKES YOU STRESSEDRNG hates youThe screen doesn't moveTL'DROverall VerdictI recommend this game to other people. I think it's worth a playthrough, and at this price, it's nothing to complain about. Be prepared to get very addicted ... and possibly shout a bit at the screen.Want moar?

												Don't get me wrong, love the game.I beat it on Android, grabbed it on Steam... cannot stand the PC version.If I were to have a touchscreen, I would still play on PC, but with a mouse???  I just do not find the mouse to be an intuitive device for this application.Great game, but pretty reliant on a touchscreen.  It is too bad they did not add a cursor like Yoshi's Cookie...  In fact, that would be the perfect resolution to the PC port's only real flaw.I hate to say it, but go buy it on mobile...eww... that left a dirty taste in my mouth... "

												Always be matching.10,000,000 is a damn fun match 3 game. If you like those, I see no reason why you should not like this one. It adds certain ""conditions"" to get bonuses and you can allter element of the game with modifiers.Basically, if you like  grinding for grinding's sake,  and like match 3, this is a very good acquisition.That being said, it plays better on tablets. So if you have a tablet of some sort, I recommend it THERE instead of steam.			"

												I've seen a lot of hating on the game for it being a grind-fest, repetitive, having barriers that force loss and such...yes, the game makes you play repeated sessions of increasingly difficult 'dungeons' for challenges that unlock gold and materials and experience to make your matches do more and to upgrade your character and such. That's the gameplay beyond the tile-matching based upon what you need to get you through the obstacle you're currently encountering at the top of the screen whether it be a monster, chest, or door. I feel like too much is expected of this title for absolutely no reason. It's a game worth the about $0.99 you'll likely pay for it and can be a quick way to pass a bit of time while your buddy walks the dog and takes out the garbage before you get back to DotA 2, TF2, etc. It's got a somewhat satisfyingly simple play that, while sometimes awkward with the mouse, doesn't frustrate simply because you aren't playing because you're 'so into it,' you're playing because you need a time sink that you can put down and pick up. For what the game's worth I'd give it a 6/10.			"

												What is 10,000,000?  It sounds like the beginning to a terrible essay but I've had friends constantly ask me while I play.  Enjoy Bejeweled but are terribly bored of rolling in riches and crushed gem shards?  Puzzle Quest quests just not instantly gratifying enough?  Well welcome to 10,000,000!You are an explorer trapped in a dungeon and you must fight your way through hordes of monsters and dragons.  STORY.  Not really, that's pretty much all you get.  You match tiles to use magic or melee attacks.  Match keys to open chests and doors.  Oh, but that's not all.  You need to match lumber and stone to gather resources for your home base.  Home base, well that's where you get all beefed up for your next expedition.  But what happens when you finally reach 10,000,000 points?Farther you get in the dungeon, the more points you get along with experience and other such wonders to help you in future journeys.It's a nice time killer when you are waiting for friends for other such online gaming shenanigans or just when you really don't want to think and maintain some level of sanity.

												I never would have though a match-3 game could be so entertaining. It shines in its simplicity. Just match squares to defeat your enemies and earn the 10,000,000 points you need to earn your freedom. You get gold you can use to updgrade your items to deal further damage, or improve your defences. You have to be fast, though, as the screen is scrolling sideways, inching you closer to your death every second.It's fun, it's cheap, and slightly addictive. Get it :3			"

												Fun at first, but extremely grindy. It's nearly impossible to beat, even with full upgrades. What's really annoying is the random nature of what tiles the game gives you makes it impossible to ""get better"" without the upgrades. There are a lot of points where the game simply decides to be unwinnable by refusing to give any useful tiles or drop items. If it were a bit shorter, or the upgrades did a bit more good, I might recommend it. In any case, it's a fun time-waster. But that's all it is.			"

												10,000,000 is a tile-matching game with a sliding mechanic unlike bejeweled. It features RPG elements, item managements and potion selections at the start of your game. This game is as good for casual players as it is for gamers, because of the scaling difficulty and the possibility to farm for upgrades in the earlier difficulties.While the game has it's fair share of ""Get lucky to finish certain missions"" I found the game to be really enjoyable! The soundtracks are simply amazing, after playing for 2 hours I had at least 2 soundtracks stuck in my head. The graphics are ok low budget graphics, but again the game is only $4.99 USD.I've completed this game in around 5-6 hours with an additional 2 hours to complete the hardest achievements. As for the replay value, it's probably gonna be fun for an additional 5+ hours after you finish the game.Overall, I strongly recommend to buy this game if you like tile-matching games!			"

But it is so addicting I dont get it. I never thought that a puzzle game could have such a special place in my steam library. Basically you start off with nothing you have to do dungeon runs until you can afford to get a shop and upgrade your things. And then after that its dungeon after dungeon to upgrade your stuff and work your way to the final dungeon and get 10,000,000 points.The only problem with this game is it gets boring after a while, but if you get into it its great fun.

												One of the best match-3 (Bejeweled) puzzle games out there. As you match tiles your character on top runs through the dungeon fighting monsters, opening chests and doors, and slaying bosses. To melee you match the sword blocks, to use magic you match the staves. Simple in concept, but quite challenging.As you continue to harder floors, you gain gold that you can use to upgrade your character making him stronger, and giving yourself various abilities to gain an edge.I also failed to mention you are on a time limit, each time your character is hit you get moved furthor off the screen, so it's best to stay agile and move as quickly as possible between obstacles. It's extremely addicting and definitely worth a playthrough, I only wish there was a sequel..			"

												It's a nice game, and the proposal is interesting. You need to drag the rows or collumns to match the 3 (or more) tiles. The RPG part is the grinding that we need to make to increase the level. Puzzle is the core of the match-3, and the action is everywhere.You can beat it in less than 10 hours. Some people might think it boring after the first 3 hours, but I liked it.Keep matching the tiles even when you don't need them. Eventually something useful will drop.			"

The mechanics are pretty easy to learn but you need a bit of tact if you want to progress as smooth and best as possible. Persistence goes a long way and if all else fails, pray to RNGsus because as with most 'match puzzle' games - luck can carry you through the game.With the downsides in mind, it may be arguable whether it's worth the full price.. but on a sale, it most definitely is.

												If you're fond of Bejewelled (or similar games) and games with RPG elements, this may be for you. The video gives a basic rundown of the gameplay - slide rows and columns to make matches of 3 or more of the same item, and your character will use it to attack with sword and staff, open locked chests and doors, etc.I finished this in a little over 6 hours, but it was thoroughly enjoyable. (Then again, I have played quite a bit of Bejewelled Blitz so I was already fond of the control system - the hardest part was adapting to sliding rows/columns rather than swapping individual adjacent tiles.)If you're looking for a casual game with an RPG feel, I certainly recommend '10,000,000'.

												Great Game but can be a little short. The puzzles are fun since you need to be making combinations based on what is in front of you, keys to unlock doors, weapons/magic to kill enemies and wood/stone tiles so you can level up your character between runs. I like the idea and additional complexity vs other more simple FB type games, I didn't want something simple like Blitz. The short; Great game puzzle game with XP system and leveling. Down side; can be a little short, after you have fully leveled your character the stone/wood tiles don't really matter any longer and it is just you trying to get your 10,000,000. Me: runs well on my laptop, game can be quickly picked up and put down. can feel short due to fully leveling character but I still play the game on and off.			"

												Beware, this game is REALITY! It grabs you out of your life, traps you in a dungeon in which you must earn 10,000,000 points to escape. You will NEVER be in contact with your friends, family, lovers, and anyone else important to you. You will not play any other games, and when you are school or work, your thoughts will be of the quest. The only way you can escape. You will fight hard for points, points you will spend on weaons, armor, and spells. You will do all you can to build yourself up, while realizing every point you spent on yourself is points not making your way to the goal of 10,000,000...... you will enter the dungeon , fight your way and only upon acheiving the goal will you be FREE from it.

												10,000,000 is a very fun game where your objective is to get a score of 10,000,000. The game is basically a fusion of a bejeweled and item based rpg game, but slightly different mechanics than bejeweled as it moves the whole column instead of swapping the two.This game is not easy by any means as it is more complex than it seems. The matching matters because there are melee and magic attacks based on your matches. There are also matches that give you wood and stone which you can use to upgrade your ""home"" outside. By upgrading your ""home"" you can get upgrades that help you in your next run. You also get experience points which you can buy certain upgrades for different things with. Lastly you get gold which you can upgrade your armor, weapons, and shield with. There are a lot of things to upgrade, but the game gets harder and harder. Basically if the left side of the screen catches up with you, you are forced to leave the run with whatever score you obtained. I really enjoyed the concept and especially the execution a lot. Furthermore, the music fit really well with the graphics and vice versa. This was just a rather complete game.The only thing I would say isn't as good with this is the purple treasure matching thingies or whatever they are. They really didn't do too much help. Also the tutorial was rather short and I had to learn some things again the hard way later on.But those are just minor compared to the positives. I would recommend this game to anybody who likes a roguelike genre, BeJeweled related matching (but different), or anyone who just wants to have some challenging fun.Rating: 8.2/10Recommend Price: $2 or under "

												10,000,000 is a simple straightforward match3 /rpg  action game with one goal in mind: score 10,000,000 points in one run to escape the dungeon. It may seem impossible initially within the first ten minutes of the game, however as the game progresses and as your rank increases, you'll find yourself having your goal become tantalizingly closer and closer. Of course, it is a bit of a grind fest; you'll need to earn points and materials for upgrades  and to pass certain ranks.   I would say this though, if you hate match 3 games or if you aren't that good at them, this game is not for you.  Nevertheless, it's a great little addicting game that isn't pretentious  and provides lots of hours of fun.			"

You can upgrade your characters staff and sword which is really neat. The bosses are kinda hard. There are different levels and the bosses get more and more op.

												10,000,000!  The name you should never call your game because it makes it difficult to find in search engines.The game combines classic match-3 gameplay with an RPG in a way that you wouldn't think would work well, but it does.  The game is quite simple: Venture into the dungeon and match the applicable tiles on the board to fight monsters, charge up your shield, collect resources, and unlock doors and chests.  The run ends when you run out of time (HP and time are the same) and you use the resources gained to upgrade your equipment and train new bonuses.  The ultimate goal is to make a dungeon run ending in a score of 10,000,000 points.The gameplay is quite fast paced so you will need a quick eye and hand to succeed.  There is some strategy involved with your upgrade path as well as enemy damage resistance but also the inherent factor of luck in relying on a board of random tiles.  Sometimes you will fail because you just can't get the tiles you need.  Fortunately it doesn't really matter much in the long run because you still gain resources to use for upgrades to improve your next run.It's a nice little game, give it a try!			"

												It's a skinner box. Just keep playing to get more gold to buy more upgrades to have a better chance at matching three to keep going deeper into the dungeons to get to the arbitrary goal of 10,000,000 points. I can see how a normal person playing this in short bursts of 5 minutes over the course of a month or more while on some public transit might think this is fine. On my personal computer that's not a thing. Maybe I'd be fine if this game was shorter and didn't feel like a slog, but it can take almost 10 hours to finish. That's pretty insane for a puzzle game that you see all of in the first 5 minutes you play. This game exists so you have something mindless to play while listening to podcasts.   Please, just go buy literally any other indie game that interests you. There's a good chance it's probably better than this.			"

												Note: I like this game much better on Android. The touchscreen interface makes it significantly more responsive. I think Windows 8 with touchscreen would also be fine. It just plays smoother.This game is basically Bejeweled with RPG elements. I love Bejeweled with over 60 hours clocked in on Bejeweled 3. If you're familiar with those types of block matching games, it's pretty easy to pick this up and play.The game can be frustrating. You need to make appropriate matches to meet the needs of your character who is running a dungeon at the top of the screen. If there's a locked door or chest, you need to match keys. If it's a monster, you need to match swords or staves. When you're not doing that, you want to match wood and stone to upgrade various shops. Sometimes you just don't get the types of blocks you need and the game delivers a brutal beating if you stop to consider your options. You have to keep matching non-stop to advance. If you hesitate, it's over. Some of the dungeon objectives are survival-based like ""stay alive for 90 seconds."" It's not as easy as that sounds. As you upgrade your armor, weapons, and abilities, however, the game's difficulty decreases. One ability, for example, reduces the number of keys to open locks to just one key.10000000 is a fun game. It took me about 2.5 hours to level up all my items and rooms and beat the game. It's still fun to replay.			"

												this is a ok game,  it fun to start off with upgrading all your stuff working to the next goal and it feels like a real rpg that they did a good gob with, however close to the end once you have all your stuff its problems shine,once your on your final task of getting the 10 million your start to see how the game works againt the player as EVERYTHING IS RANDOM,in a game like isaac or nuclear throne there are random elements but your skill makes up for that and technically every run can be won if your good enough, with 10 million this is not the case as everything that is going on is random,such as your might  need a sword to kill a monster, but all your getting are keys,chests,rocks,wood and you have no scrolls to turn tiles into swords, you can match and match till the cows come home but by the time you get a sword your have wasted to much time and your to far to the left side of the screen to make it back and you die.or in each level there is a boss monster like a dragon, they are hard to kill and take a lot of time off you from them dealing dammage and how long it takes to kill one, sometimes they can randomized close together so you can get done fighting one dragon and barly suviving and then 3 monsters later there is another dragon and you have spent everything on the 1st so you die.however seen your score get so close to 10 million but not quite reaching it, douse give this addicting feel of just one more run, just one more run till you beat it.my final verdict for the game is a average 3/5its simple and sweet,the visuals, game play and music are funand the game starts of greatits just let down at the end as you can no longer increece you stats to beat the monsters is pure luck, hopping that the right tiles will show up on your run, hopping that the monsters have randomized right so you get lost of weak ones to give a a fighting chance.if you are a fan of match 3 games and you can deal with all elemets not in the players control(what tiles you get, what order the monsters are going to be in, what items you get from chests)then give it a try, but if your are a player that likes skill or requires some level of control then i cant recommend this game and would tell you to pass on it.

												This is the most insanely addictive game I've played for a long time. It makes you think laterally unlike any other tile match game that I have played. I feel like my brain is getting stronger with each frustratingly awesome run. It has RPG elements too!A RPG tile match game! Win!The music is fantastic as well. Bouncy and happy, eases the frustration when you just miss that sword match, or have too many stone tiles. "

												This is a match 3 (or more) kind of game.With the whole point to get 10 000 000 score to finish it.Easier said than done.You match swords & staves to attack.Shields to prevents damage. Keys to unlock gates and chests, etc etc.Which is what you'll be doing all the time for the rest of the game.You also can get items and scrolls while playing (and they carry over if not used to the next round).To use on enemies, chests, lose less time (and yes, the game is time based so if you're too slow you lose.)In your home base you can unlock rooms.Each room has different upgrades.Some for skills which you use xp for.Others have potions aka modifers.Then you have all weapons, armor, shields to upgrade.Pretty straight forwards. It's a gold sink, a time sink..It keeps you grinding. And grinding is all it's about.The music is great, just one song though I think. Very catchy however.Graphics are pixels. I like pixels. Maybe you don't? But, if you do, this is a really nice game to look at in my opinion.Lots of different enemies that LOOK different and aren't just reskins.That's pretty much it. I enjoyed it alot.Amount of time to beat the game: 10 hours.>>>WORTH IT<<<			"

												tl;dr - It's pretty fun and worth a play through.I'm not a huge fan of match 3 games, but I generally enjoy them every now and then. If you're not a fan, I doubt this game will change your mind. Your success in this game often comes down to luck, but each run is quick enough that it can keep your attention and make you want to try again, especially if you've just unlocked something good. The pixel graphics are a bit annoying, but not enough to make you want to stop playing. This is one of those games that can look like garbage, but still be satisfying to play.Overall, 7/10 for me. Good enough to finish, but I doubt I'd ever come back to it.			"

												I wanted to like this, but in the end found it to be rather boring.Conceptually, what led me to want to get this game:Match-3 with a slightly different mechanism for moving the pieces on the board.RPG elements.What I didn't like:It's basically an endless runner in Match-3 form. You play until you die, in a way like Tetris. Some people will like this. I was expecting Puzzle Quest-like matches against opponents.That manner of moving the pieces on the board was different, which is commendable in terms of differentiation, but I found I didn't like it. For whatever reason, it just doesn't click in my head, so any combos I get are by chance.Playing this game with a mouse. It would definitely be better on a touch screen.Unfortunately I haven't finished this. I'm not enjoying it enough to continue. To beat the game, you need to get 10,000,000 points. I've maxed out my character but am topping out at about 7,300,000. And as stated before, I'm not ""getting"" the game, so there's no improvement. For me, 10,000,000 points is a dream, so I might as delete the game now.4/10			"

												If Puzzle Quest is like Bejeweled on Classic mode, 10000000 is like Bejeweled on Lightning mode, with Progress Quest hooked up to it. Each dive into the dungeon is a frenzy of matching three to buy you more time to match more three. Then at the end of the run you take the gold, exp, stone, and wood you get and make numbers go up so you can do more matching against enemies who themselves have slightly bigger numbers.It's probably the emptiest gaming experience I've yet bought on Steam.

												This would get a thumbs up if we were talking about the Android version of the game.  Unfortunately, the control scheme on the Windows version ruins the game.  This is a game meant for quick swipes of the fingertip, which doesn't translate well when done via mouse.  Also, the game style is meant for quick 5 or 10 minute sessions, more likely when you are away from your gaming rig on a mobile device.  It's not worth the 5 dollar entry price, but worth a buck during a sale.  Still, if you buy this game, get it on Android.

												Just not good...I used to be sort of addicted to match-3 games, and I have played a couple of combat variants, like this one, but 10M, is addictive without being good.Let's pretend for a moment that the graphic is cool pixel art stuff, and it just doesn't plain sucks, or that the music is chimpunk tune, and not just a single boring short melody: the gameplay is just a repetitive mess, and there are a number of design flaws that make it really annoying.Point is: graphic and sound doesn't matter, if you have some really really cool idea (nope: nothing new here...) or if the gameplay is fun (nope), but what should save a boring, bad looking, bad sounding repetitive game? Simphaty for indie development? :/Let's take the upgrade system, for instance: while matching and killing enemies, you get experience, wood, stone and gold. The problem is, that the experience pratically ceases to be useful very early in the game, while wood and stone become essentially useless after you have upgraded all your stores (quite early on). So you keep getting it, you watch them increase, but you cannot do anything with it. How frustrating is that?!Sure, you can grind to upgrade your stuff and, eventually, you get better, but the problem is that the game never feels very satisfying. It's just not fun.So instead of reaching 10000000 points, I think I will concentrate on the 10000000 things I will get to do *instead* of playing this game. "

												10,000,000 has the spirit of a roguelike... randomized encounters that will certainly defeat you after some time; leaving you to start again.  This works best when there are a wealth of mechanics and things to explore, but that is sadly lacking here.  Two basic types of obstacles (enemies and locks) are re-skinned with minor tweaks to gameplay for the entire game, which all takes place in the same grey hallway.  Match three mechanics have been done better elsewhere.  Skip this one.			"

												This game is good and for the asking price of a buck its a great deal as you get a lot of gameplay for a low price. I did enjoy the graphics. They are not super nice looking but they set the mode and are colorful. The sound is retro as well and is nice. The game is a little bit Bejewled and little like Puzzle quest with a super short timer. The gameplay is a match 3 type game so its easy to pick up and play. Thats also probably its greatest failing is its got one trick and it plays it over and over again. Now like I said the gameplay is fun but thats all you do in this game is go the dungeon that generally lasts around 2 minutes or less and then once you have finished inside the dungeon then get better gear and head towards the dungeon. Thats it. I do have advice for what I love to see in a sequel if there is one. Skill levels for the clock as its super fast and games are super short. Make the dungeon a little bit more different the further down you go besides the different bad guys. Add torches or rocks or make it a different background color so you realize your in a different dungeon. I would like this expanded to include more unique gameplay other then going in and coming out. 7/10 for the price and the gameplayWhen the sale goes off I would rate it about a 6/10 this game is gonna drive some people nuts and some will love it.

												Must have.This is a brilliant combination of... hmm... Yoshi Cookie, Bit.Trip.Runner, and... <name your favourite JRPG grindfest>? The Yoshi Cookie reference is sound, and this is certainly a stat grinder, but perhaps there is a better analogy that Bit.Trip.Runner. In any case, the core 'Yoshi Cookie' gameplay aesthetic is wonderfully integrated with the dungeon running / leveling system that will keep you saying ""Just one more run... OK, just one more after this run. Just one more. Screw it, who needs sleep?"". No regrets.The game isn't long, perhaps, but it is such a sweet distillation of fun that you won't mind. In fact, you will probably just hit 'reset' and start from the beginning again, to try to beat it faster the second time through. Recommended for any RPG/Puzzle fusion fans. Quick reflexes a prerequisite.			"

												10,000,000 is a solid if unspectacular match-3/RPG variant where you face off against a series of obstacles and enemies, gradually obtaining the cash and resources you need to get upgrades, which in turn allow you to progress further, until eventually you score the titular number of points and win/escape/etc.The game is generally good at what it does, but there isn't all that much to it - my playtime reflects a completed game with all but one achievement, and people who are actually good at match-3 games could probably get through it significantly faster. The game board consists of swords, staves, shields, keys, stone, and wood (and purple blocks that give items) - swords and staves deal damage to monsters, shields protect you from monsters, keys unlock chests and doors, and stone and wood can be used to unlock and upgrade shops. Defeating monsters and opening chests also provide you with gold and experience to upgrade your damage and armor or train abilities. You also have several quests to pursue at any given time (generally either 'do X thing Y times in one run' or 'do some cool thing once') which give bonus resources and unlock new tiers to face.The core gameplay revolves around matching the right pieces to defeat the threat you're currently up against - your location on the dungeon screen essentially represents your health, and while blocked by a monster or locked chest/door, you'll be pushed to the left. If you make the proper matches or find restorative items, you can recover and progress to the right. You also get three (four once you upgrade) inventory slots to hold items, generally to help deal with a specific threat (magic orbs for monsters, skeleton keys for chests). However, since these randomly-obtained items are the only way to interact with the board other than making matches, this can lead to some frustrating moments - if you wind up facing a dragon with a board full of keys, you're probably out of luck even if you waste the keys by clearing them to no use. This is compounded by that four of the seven piece types provide no immediate help against either a chest or a monster, meaning you're often left frantically trying to clear them in the brief moments between encounters.The hub between dungeon runs is fairly minimalistic - you can upgrade weapons and armor, but the upgrades are 'boring' and there are no real choices to be made except for the minor decisions of where to upgrade first. The experience-bought upgrades have a bit more variety, but still boil down to 'make your dungeon runs slightly more effective' - the gameplay doesn't change. Finally, there's an alchemist - you can activate any combination of potions for a given run - most of them enact tradeoffs between certain resources and others but some are more unique.In short, while it's a bit clunky at moments and can be fairly luck-dependent, 10,000,000 features enjoyable gameplay and is a fun diversion.

												Not ambitious, nor very pretty or polished, this puzzle game is still a surprisingly addictiv experience for the genre lovers.The puzzle time attack kind of game isn't generally what I like, but I must say it got me in the ressources collection, the unlockables and the challenge of missions and overall progression.The game is simple to understand and has a satisfying difficulty curve without being hardcore or time eater.Which gets me to the negative point : it's short!And while i did a lot of grind on purpose, finished the game in 10hrs, I'd not be surprised if one could beat it faster.I hoped for a system of several floors and many more unlockables but nope.So despites its shortness, the game is good, you can still try to break the record after beating the ""story"". I would take it only on sales (which I did) considering the game depth. The concept is nice anyway and could benefit a huge developpement imo.			"

												Absolutely. Get it while it's still a dollar! After that I would say you shouldn't get it for five if you're saving up. But if you have just one buck you're itchin to spend, put it into 10mil. This game has provided me plenty of entertainment, and it will give me more as I continue to play. It can get frustrating at times, but you don't really lose anything permanently, which means you can only move forward. QUICK GO GET IT			"

												A fun puzzler with a decent difficulty but nothing which couldn't be beaten with a little bit of practice. The RPG element is well implemented but still nothing more than a rudimentary feature. The graphics are bland which is also my only real critique point, a bit more effort in that departement would have been nice. For fans of the genre worth a look but not a must have for every collection.			"

												I wouldn't buy it again.This game can best be described as Tetris-like.  Your object is to arrange the tiles in groups of three or more in order to eliminate the tiles, gain a bonus, and have more tiles drop into the field of play.In my opinion, You Must Build A Boat (YMBAB) -- which is by the same developer -- is exactly like this game and is much better.  If I had bought this game before YMBAB I might have liked it more.  But, unfortunatley, it suffers from the fact that the two games are essentially alike.I have read other reviews that describe this game (and its other incarnation) as adventures in grinding.  This is true.  To be honest, I had enough of grinding when I played WoW for seven years.  I'm tired of grinding.  It's pointless and those moments of my life are more valuable then to keep edging toward some arbitrary goal -- in this case, ten million points.I always have a questionable amount of fun playing games that are laregly influenced by luck.  Perhaps I am not good at thinking visually in three dimensions and, therefore, I'm not able to plan and strategize well in this type of game.Even YMBAB suffers from this influence of luck.  Ultimately, you can move tiles as quickly as you want or need to, but if you don't get the right tiles dropped into place then it you're eventually doomed.  Therefore, it really doesn't matter how well you make decisions, how fast you operate, or what your strategy is.  Eventually, you will succeed just because of the forces and fates of luck.I did enjoy this game -- but to be clear I don't think you need to own both this and YMBAB and YMBAB offers more compelling interest.  There just wasn't enough positive happening here when I succeeded to compel me to continue.Buy either this or YMBAB but not both.			"

												First real review, because the game really impressed me with how fast the game became mundane.Pro:- Easy control of the board/Responds well to input.- Some chiptune tracks are pretty good (but obviously not made for the game).Cons:- Time restriction on both gameplay segments (restriction on the amount of time you can play on a save is bad, it makes it necessary to complete the game multiple times to get the achievements).- Completely random board (it's not in herently bad, but in the case of a game with specific goals to advance on a time restriction, it goes against fun).- Seemingly random/blind upgrades (you often spend a huge portion of your gold to get 0.1% crit chance, which ultimately makes you feel like the game is working against you, other times, you spend less and you get +10 damage. It makes no sense.).- Little to no variety. (there isn't much else other than what is shown in the tutorial with stats increases).- Very lazy pixel art. (yes, I'm going there).Overall, even though it isn't expensive, I do not recommend as the whole basis of the game is completely random and won't make you feel good for doing good and needs to complete an exponential amount of runs (multiple runs (overall game saves) of multiple runs (individual game runs for ressources)) to do the achievements, which seems to be the only real goal this game has other than it's utterly repetitive ""get to 10,000,000 score to escape"" that will need you to do the same thing for 10 hours with little to no variety. (upgrades aren't variety in this case, as they add no complexity to the actual runs' gameplay) It's a time waster you have to pay for, and an unsatisfying one at that.			"

												10,000,000 is a classic slide match-3 with some minor RPG/progression elements. Add in additional ""ace levels"" for serious players and you have a very long lasting game to play when you are super bored and just need something to do. Yes, that may not be the most glowing statement I could make about the game- it isn't heavily story based... nor is it the kind of game which you can get invested in too heavily. But it does what it does and it does it well. It is a casual bit of fun for when you don't feel like launching into something more substantial- and there is absolutely nothing wrong with that. "

												Yes, I played it several hours. In cause of achievements and until I finished it. The game is very repetitive, You run and try to eliminate tiles 3, 4 or 5 in a row. With this you raise you shield strength, your life points, collect wood, iron and random items which you can use if you want. At the beginning it makes fun, and you try to get further and further until you get 10.000.000 points to get out of your prison! But the point is, you can’t if you are not fully upgraded. So you have to play until it is nearly impossible to kill a boss and upgrade your stuff. Play again, collect gold, wood, iron. Run again, until the enemies stop you. Upgrade again. And it takes a long time until you upgraded your weapons, shield , magic… But you will very often run, collect, fail, upgrade, run, collect, fail, upgrade until you beat this game. Funny for the first hour, but then so repetitive. Fair thing: You will get the sequel for free when it is finished. Hopefully this will be better.			"

												Seemed like it could be a fun casual game with an interesting idea - match the tiles you need to do stuff (attack, open doors, get loot, get resources) - but it didn't seem to work. The entire game feels like a grind just to level up your gear so you can reach the 10,000,000 points in a single run without you actually getting any better at it.How well you do in a run is completely dependent on how lucky you are with getting the right tiles at the right time, and levelling up just means doing the same thing every single time.Played for a couple of hours in the hope that it would improve, but once you've done one run you've done them all.

												It's a toss up. Fun in small doses; the mash of match three and endless runner works really well even when executed with some flaws. The game is grindy but gives you plenty to reach for and accomplish. However, the further you get toward the finish, the harder it is to get there - as much as I enjoyed the gameplay along the way, I was honestly relieved when I beat the game because it took several sessions of aggressive play to really hit the scores I needed. Not the kind of game I want to go back and finish lingering Steam achievements on. Also some definite issue with controls for PC, no Steam cloud?, and the lack of a ranged attack for the player is illogical. End vote: thumbs down, because the game's fun factor and unique approach just doesn't quite outweigh the grind and weak design.			"

Ultimately nothing more than a grindRather than asking players to simply match icons on a board, the game is centered around a minimalistic dungeon-crawl shown at the top of the screen. Players aim to match sword and wand icons to attack monsters and keys to clear locked chests and doors. The variable value of tiles makes board management incredibly important. Players must constantly clear the shield, pack, wood, and stone icons that are of lesser use during the run in order to seed the board with useful tiles-- especially weapons as monsters can attack the player, costing more precious time. Defeating monsters quickly is both necessary and frustrating as it adds a layer of luck to the game: it is possible to happen upon a long string of monsters without the compartively easier chests and doors, effectively dooming a run since the player doesn't have time to manage the board.Between dungeon runs, the game gives gold, stone, wood, and experience, all of which are used to level-up your strength and defenses. However, none of the upgrades ultimately change the way the game is played, neither increasing the complexity or even effecting the difficulty due to the increasing strength of monsters. Instead, upgrades are a brick wall that serve to force a particular rate of progression upon the player. Players cannot progress into the deeper levels of the dungeon until they grind out enough resources to upgrade their stats. Instead of barring players based upon skill, players are barred based upon time investment.The way the value of tiles changes based upon the scenario presented in the dungeon makes the game decent, but the title ultimately turns out to be more of a grind than anything else due to its simple gameplay and leveling system.

												10,000,000 is one of those rare games that tries to mix RPGs, autorunners, and puzzles.It's one of the many that completely fails to be any good at all 3.First, the RPG elements are clunky. They explain it once, but then give you little to no way to actually improve. You'll always fight monsters the same way with the same spells. And considering the barebones graphics, music, and the looming end, it adds virtually nothing to the gameplay other than an annoying distraction and an indicator of what you now need to match.Secondly, the autorunning nature feels more like an arbitrary way to make it difficult without ever having to change anything on the field or in the game. A vague ""end"" keeps chasing you. When it reaches you or passes you or some other vague idea of ""you reach it"" that seems to change from game to game, you lose. Except you can keep matching for a few seconds.And then there's the puzzle elements. They're, at best, clumsy. The game will not simply suggest a certain chain, it all but enforces it. See a skeleton? Get those staff and sword blocks. None of those? Fine, I GUESS get some resources. Oh there's a sword. Ignore that double/chained set, just get that sword or the looming end will get you! But that's not the worst of it. Oh no. The WORST of it, my friends, is that when you scroll it around the screen...it makes no difference if there are 3 blocks. They must be blocks that were initially placed in a way to complete a chain. If you scroll it around and there's 4 swords and you need four swords? Sorry, only the wood resource that had a 3 piece chain will count. Nothing else. This seems like a drastic oversight. Even the likes of Tetris Attack on the SNES would let you change blocks with no outcome, thus allowing a deeper gameplay. This offers no depth in that sense. It has to be already on screen, already apparent, and already set up.All of this combines to create a tedious but inoffensive puzzle experience. But what makes it truly heinous is how many times you repeat a level to complete challenges to get resources to unlock do-Hold on, champ! You flawlessly performed all those tasks, but you need 500 wood and 500 stone for the next door! You only have 300 wood and 120 stones! Nope, get back to the time sink.All in all, I cannot recommend 10,000,000. It is a clunky, rushed, and overall ugly game that seems to hope to garner more love off the Atari-era graphics than any actual quality or effort.			"

It also does have elements that would make one want to lay the ""RPG"" label on it, such as leveling, upgradeable buildings and weapons, and so forth. But those are really more appropriate for another version of the term ""RPG"" that has started popping up to mean ""Leveling and upgrades"".There is1) The ""RPG"" that refers to tabletop games.2) The RPG that refers to video games like The Elder Scrolls series.3) The RPG that refers to these games.If you like quick and fun puzzle games I would recommend this.

												--- 10,000,000 ---* Don't mind my time played here, I have logged 100+ hours of the iOS version because this game is perfect when on the move.* I really don't recommend the Steam version of this game because of the awkward controls.What is this....10,000,000 is a match-3 endless runner with a twist. There is no story to speak of, the goal is to escape the dungeon/castle you find yourself locked into. You do this by getting a high-score of 10,000,000 or above. Sounds easy? It kind of is, the first times. This game get tough as nails when you try and beat it the forth time and beyond tho. This is something the game calls ""ace levels"" which basically is a NewGame+ mode that ramp up the difficulty progressively. The question is who is even going to want to play this game for that long with these awkward mouse controls? Anyway...The games single biggest problem is it's useless control scheme. I understand that there really are no good alternatives for games like this. (SO DON'T ♥♥♥♥ING RELEASE THEM ON STEAM!) The Steam version of 10,000,000 is not nearly as good as it's iOS counterpart. 10,000,000 is a touch screen handheld device game - and should not be anything else. It's atrocious to play this with a mouse. It's like night and day. This is a game that relies on quick inputs and mild planning how to arrange the table, and with this clumsy mouse ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t that's just not satisfactory.This is one of those games that are perfect in bite sized chunks - for when you are on the train or having a break at the job. If I play for more then 10-20mins in one go I quickly get bored. It's ""one of those games"".The good music (2 songs...) is still awesome and the gameplay is smooth and dandy on this version. It's just that you cannot get around the deal-breaker here. This should be operated with touch controls. Nothing else. I have not tried, but if I would guess I'd say this game probably is as good as it can be on a iPad.Mechanics....Match 3 or more of the same symbol from the board and you ""get"" that symbol as a attack on your enemies. A sword for instance is a physical attack. A staff is magical etc. There are symbols you can match and collect too like wood, gold and experience which is used to buy new skills and upgrade your castle/dungeon to improve physical/magical/skill damage output. Oh, and all of this has to go fast because the more you earn the faster the game wants you dead by throwing even more monsters at you. It gets pretty frantic later on. There is more to it but this is the basics.Final verdict....The iOS version 8/10. The Steam version 3/10			"

												July 23, 2014 with  1 hour of game play. *        10,000,000 is a match 3, where your are in prison and you need to get a score of 10,000,000 to get free.  I hesitate to call it a story, there is a intro bit that informs on the plot and that’s all you get. You have to level up your character and prison to get multipliers to even think you’ll get that score. There is lot of rpg elements like extra objectives, leveling characters, leveling weapons, and leveling up your prison. Also there is some action elements to go along with the match 3 game play.	The rpg aspects are very minimalist. You don’t level your character automatically as you play. You have to fix up the rooms with stone and wood you have accumulated through matching. Then buy your upgrade with the ingame gold or xp. There is extra objectives, such as ‘use an ax against a monster’ or ‘match 70 in one run’ which adds a bit of twist to the otherwise very grindy gameplay.	It could be considered an action side scroller. Your 2d pixel guy runs at the top of the screen, when you get up to something then you have to match three to get past that obstacle.  There is not anyway of saving up the match. If you get a run of drops it could be bad, first it slows you down as you can not match other stuf while it is falling, and it can clear the board of items you might need later. The match 3 is also a full slider style game play, instead of a single slide, flip, or twist style match 3. The control of the slide is iffy at times, forcing you to waste more time to get past the obstacle because you weren't right over the match.  	10,000,000 is a fast pace hectic match 3 with action-rpg elements. At $4.99 USD it's not a bad price if you like fast pace slide style match 3.  However if you're on the fence I would definitely wait and pick it up when its a buck or as part of a packaged deal. I would give 10,000,000 a 2 out of 5.* I’d have more time on the game but I personally dislike slide style match 3. However I am aware that others do.Also be aware this game is apparently a port of the IOS version. neutral:extra objectives2d side scrolling aspectslider style match 3 game. Pro:rpg elements to level up your character Con:no speed contral, it is a fast pace hectic game. control is irritating (it's a port and it shows at times). there is a lot of grindingmust level up to unlock the ability to buy the rooms. you don’t know what the room is till after you unlock it.

												This game just isn't that fun. I bought it on sale for 2.49 a while back, and its been a disapointment to me. The game mechanics isn't fun, it's to hard to complete quests to get money, and there is no way I'm playing that... that.. that... that thing just to get 10,000,000 points so I can escape!			"

												I liked it in the beginning but then it plays like a pay-to-win. Just too much effort needed to get something new. You have to replay the minigame again and again and that's boring if you can't afford new stuff on the go... I bought this to use as a little game but turned out to be very time consuming.			"

												10,000,000 is a pixelated puzzlegame for Achievementhunters. At first I was intrigued by it, and bought the game. After playing it for a while now I must say I should've heared on my instincts. A PUZZLEGAME, with PIXELGRAPHICS. Come on. The Game would even look better if it was made in Flash. The mechanic is interesting at first, but gets boring and repetetive just as fast.The so called ""retrolook"" is in this game a very cheap excuse for pure lazyness.Normally I don't bash on games, I don't even care for the graphcs that much, in fact bad gameplay + gorgeous gameplay sucks considerably more than good gameplay and bad graphics. But this title is just bad and bad. It's like one of those puzzlegames on gameboy noone wanted to play because they sucked. So does this title. Don't buy for the Sake of the Game.To Achievementhunters, especially the Achievementstats.com ones: The gameachievements don't score very high, if you can avoid the game, do so. Although you can get the achievements fast. (My guess It could be done in about 4-6hours, but I will probably need longer though I will try my best to rush them through as fast as I can.)			"

												This game is weirdly addictive, and unique in it's mash up of RPG elements with your ""Bejewelled-style"" match up the similar icons for points game.Unfortunatly, that is not enough to save it.After the novely wears off, the game becomes static and repetative - the only thing that kept me playing was my OCD ""theres-only-x-to-go-until-next-unlock"" thought process.The difficulty levels almost on a par with the unlocks, so you never seem to benifit from anything that you grind to get and you're just ploughing through the same combos over and over.

												10,000,000 is a jaunty little puzzle/RPG game that is easy to play and addictively enjoyable. The plot is simple, you wake up in a dungeon cell and as the title of the game implies, you escape the dungeon for good when you score 10 million points in a single run. The game plays like bejeweled in that the player shuffles tiles on a grid by dragging a row or column in order to make 3 symbols match. Successful matches yields attacks, magic, keys, items, gold and materials that you can use to improve your cell, converting it into a base of operations which provides better gear, perks and special potions. The gameplay is easily accessable and there is a method to process of running dungeons that might feel hectic and challenging but never really feels frustrating. An average dungeon run takes only a few minutes but you can run the dungeon as many times as you like before returning to your base. The graphics are simple and have a Commodore 64 quality to them and the chiptune music is nicely composed.10,000,000 is simple, fun, and addictive. Easy to pick up and play, yet challenging when you want it to be. The price is very reasonable and the game is not graphically heavy so you can play it on an older machine. I really enjoyed this game and I think you might too.			"

												If you're into puzzle and tycoon games, this is great for you. Put aside my amount of hours played, I've played LOTS of this in offline mode.This game is about solving puzzles in 'the dungeon' and upgrading buildings to achieve the ultimate score, 10,000,000.

												A fun variation on the Bejewled-style ""match 3"" puzzle game, you attack and defend against enemies as you play. The pace is quicker than most other games of this type which turned me off at first, and I was just about ready to quit but I couldn't get this unique premise out of my mind. I went on to play for 7 hours and finished the game while watching TV shows. If you can get this one on sale you'll have a great time with it. I'm glad I stuck with it.			"

												Although I haven't completed the game to the full extent, I have started this review. This is one of those simple games that gradually gets harder as your progress through the dungeons, and the game is set in a way where you ""bejeweled"" your actions. There are many different actions and completeing a dungeon is just carry out 3 challenges in one run. You are able to upgrade your tiles, by that I'm refering to your weaponry, magic, and armor and other perks that you can unlock with the experience you build, and use them to your advantages. Completeing a full dungeon, even after you clear later dungeons, is rather difficult, especially when the boss tends to be a dragon. I wouldn't completely recommend playing it, but if you're willing to spend the money for a game you'll enjoy for a short period of time.., You're welcomed to this game.			"

												This game is one of those that suprises you by how fun it actually is. On the cover it looks like just another match three game, but once you actually get into action you'll notice it's just so hectic that it's super fun and addictive. And then you notice that  you can actually upgrade your character. To do this you must combine some specific blocks like wood. The upgrades generally provide you more time. So in the beginning a round might take just 15 seconds, but once you're upgraded to the max you'll be in the dungeons for minutes.There's actuallyl not that much grinding if you know what you're doing. Just use the right potions and you'll get an extra amount of wood and stone. Complete the required objectives and you get more skill points. The game never gets frustratingly hard, nor is it too easy. It's just more down to luck of which blocks the game gives you. But once you learn to manage the field properly, even that shouldn't be a big problem.But in the end, the game is just a match 3 game, so if you don't like them, this might not be for you. Although I'm one of those people who doesn't like them, and this was just a blast from the beginning to the end.			"

The game is really short, lasting about 4 hours until completion, but I've been able to come back to this game and start from the beginning many times. I even purchased the Android version to play on my tablet, and the portibility and touch screen mechanics work better than PC. Nonetheless, this was a great game and I highly recommend you support these indie devs. I await the sequel!			"

												6/10This game earns an ""A"" for being a clever blend of genres, but a ""D"" by poorly balancing them it makes the game repetitive, unrewarding, and leaving the player wanting for more.It is a really great concept and fun to play at first. If it was play tested to adjust the poor ""grinding"" curves, it could be an addictive smash hit.Problems and improvements:1. Resorces... The game has a great concept with harvesting materials to unlock new ""shops"" to upgrade your character, but wood/stone become obsolete as soon as these shops are all open (which can be done in the first couple hours of game play). Even worse are ""Experience Points"", which are only spendable at one store. You quickly buy all these upgrades in the first couple hours of gameplay, leaving you a lot of game play earning useless points with nothing to spend them on. Gold is the last to go. After you spend gold upgrading everything to its max, you find that you can't upgrade any farther, and you're still only in the first half of the game.- To fix this, the game needs more options for upgrades with a better price curve to make sure there is always something more to buy or upgrade. The game should be complete or close to completion before you run out of upgrade options in any rpg.2. Effectiveness... Upgrades, even when all are purchased in the first half of the game, do not do enough to make your character feel more powerful or effective. Grinding for upgrades is hard enough, but these upgrades should make even the worst player more effective at the game.Items, if used too early, will be wasted (The same goes for matches that are lined up too early). This is counter-intuitive, since every second counts. When approaching an enemy or chest, it would be great if your continuing multi-combo or clicked item was aimed at them instead of simply lost. Also, while just 4 keys in a row will take care of 2 locks, 4, 5, or more staff/sword tiles do little more than 3 against enemies.3. The Clock... The clock is also your health bar, which is fine and the shield idea makes it work well enough. However, there is far too much working against the clock and not enough helping it. You only gain a small amount of time back after defeating an enemy or unlocking a door/chest (or matching wood/stone with an upgrade), there is a lot that wastes time like combos, which continue to fire off leaving you helpless to act until they are done. These combos, while sometimes helpful, usually just eat time and give little back outside score (which is really only helpful in reaching the overall 10,000,000 to beat the game. Keep in mind, score is NOT cumulative, and is only there to let you know how close you are to getting to the end of the game). Chain combos and 4+ matches should offer a small time bonus as well.4. Luck factor. I have no problem with the Critical hit probability, but the luck of having the right combination of tiles in anything close to the right order to get what you need to match up in time is very random. I've had great runs where I've just had great luck, and blaze through every obstacle, and I've had luck where I lose on the first enemy due to this.5. Gear... There are unlockable potions you an use to trade one thing for another (i.e. 20% of wood/stone earned becomes gold but you earn 0 wood/stone ). These can be turned on and off. The rest of the gear, although upgradable, has no options like many RPGs do. It would be nice if you could buy upgrades for gear, but also swap them out for different effects (i.e. a staff that uses Freeze when it crits, or armor that has a lower effects against close range enemies but blocks ranged attacks, etc.).6. Curve... It could use a difficulty setting. Even if that meant just adjusting time limit, damage effects, etc.Not just that, the overall ""Grinding"" takes the fun out of the game.Final Verdict:- It's not worth $5. I got my copy on sale for $1 and had cash in my steam wallet from selling trading cards, so... it was basically ""free"". I wouldn't suggest it for retail price.- If it had the above adjustments made, It would be worth the $5, maybe even $10.- While it has great roots, and is technically a finished game, it really lacks the polish to make it feel like more than a ""free to play"" you'd find on NewGrounds.6/10			"

												Very rarely do I ""want"" to like a game more than I do this one. The style's fun, matching games in general are addictive, and I really do want to keep progressing. But the balance feels wrong and much more often than not the game really frustrates someone just looking for a good time. It's a matching game but if you're not matching the blocks you're supposed to be matching to defeat a monster or unlock a chest or whatever the game is throwing at you, then you die. And you die pretty quickly at that. You can go from full health on a great run to dead in just a few seconds if you haven't matched the tiles that you need. Most of the time you can't find the blocks you need at any given moment, without having cleared other tiles first. The game simply has one block type too many obstructing combo flow. Two of the seven block types have no function in the dungeon crawl except to impede your progress, at any given enemy encounter only two of the blocks might be useful to you. With less than half of the screen being useful and enemies eating your time you'll frequently die in less time it takes to read this review.It wouldn't be so bad if it gave you more time to plan combo chains. Or maybe you could stockpile matched blocks so that items like keys would stay in your invetory for unlocking doors and chests. Instead you can only match blocks at the moment you need them with previous matches disappearing uselessly. Mind you, it has to be at the very moment you need them, if you make the match too fast before the character runs up to the encounter, it also doesn't count wasting valuable blocks.If you somehow ended up becoming a master genius at the game, or if you've grinded enough hours to buy enough perks, it could be great. But the early stages are just no fun and only succeeded in frustrating me. After a while I lose interest in mastery. The game just feels too unfair.			"

												The game 10,000,000 is really quite fun. If you hate grinding though, STAY SO BLOODY FAR AWAY FROM THIS. This game is a weird mix of bejewelled puzzle action while your character is running through the dungeon slaughtering baddies and opening doors/chests. You match swords to attack, keys to unlock things etc. and that's how your character progresses through this endless dungeon. The entire game is a big'ol grind to the top, running dungeons over and over till you accumulate enough stone/wood/gold/experience to unlock abilities, better gear and better shops. I've only spent a little over an hour when writing this review but if you're looking for a great way to spend your time without breaking the bank here it is!			"

												10,000,000 is just another matching game, but it is far superior to many of these types of games. For one, there is a story: You are trying to reach a score of 10,000,000 so you can get out of the dungeon/prison environment in which you are in. Simple enough, but this directly affects the gameplay, as at the top of the screen, your character goes through the hallways of the dungeon and has to fight or open doors/chests when you match these tiles. You also match wood and other materials to upgrade things after each quick play-through and armor to protect yourself against your foes.You must complete achievements as well to get higher levels and more of special crystals, which also help you upgrade things (swords, armor, wands, ect.). It gives a very nice variety when you get bored of things like Candy Crush because of no in-app purchases, no limited number of plays, and an actual objective besides beating all the levels (even though there is no levels). The level itself is randomly generated, so you can play as many times as you want and it will almost always be different.In all, it is a very unique puzzle game, and although it is suited best to only 1-3 play-throughs at a time, it is fun for the time you play it. If I had to give a rating, I'd say 8 or 8.5 out of 10.			"

The combat consists of matching tiles of 3 or more. The effect is dependant on the tiles you matched. i.e. Sword tiles do damage			"

But, I have a low tolerance for grinding or frustration, and I thought that this was a neat spin on the classic match 3 formula.  The timer mechanic meshed with the need to match certain tiles to make play very lively, and I always felt like I was progressing.Well worth five bucks, imo.			"

												Let me just say that I only BARELY recommend this game, and that you would really do yourself a service getting this game while it's on sale or something.Main premise:The point of this game is to reach a score of 10,000,000. This is done by playing a Chuzzle-esque tile match game wherein the tiles you match has an outcome on a dungeon battle. If you by example matches 3 tiles of a sword the guy attacks, 3 keys and you can open chests and doors, 3 wood or stone and you get resources to upgrade later in the game. The game include upgrades, shops, potions, bosses, and a suprisingly big number of valuables (experience, wood, stone, points, and money).Graphics/Sound:The game originated on phones and tablets and you can definitely tell that by a lot of factors. First of all the graphics are in a very heavy and sometimes grating 8-bit style and the sounds and music are entirely in chiptunes. The chiptunes are not bad by any means, but they're put on a short loop and they can get rather repetitive and annoying. It's not a game that needs to be great looking or sound amazing. It does its job, with average success.Gameplay:This is a grinding puzzle game. The main point is to get as far as possible and then retry again and again, until you can buy more upgrades and get a little further into the game until you reach the target score. This is a slow moving process. There really isn't much progress in terms of mechanics. All mechanics of the game is presented in the first 30-45 minutes and then the question is if you actually want to continue doing the same thing for a few hours.The main problem here, is that the game does a very poor job at spacing apart and adding game mechanics as you go along so everything feels fresh. This makes the game stagnate pretty quickly, and you get bored by it easily. You can only play this game in short bursts. This game has two parts to it; the action-puzzle part, and the management/upgrade/RPG-ish part. The first part, is mostly pretty well executed. The tiles do what they do, and you can most of the time tell that a bad run was mostly because that you didn't do well. The game can be a bit unfair in the distribution of different tiles, giving you 3 key tiles in total, when you really need it, but other than that, the nature of the game makes it difficult enough to be challenging, but forgiving enough to not be frustrated.The problems with the game originates from the second part, which is poorly executed. It has the growing of character RPG elements. You know, you start out as a weakling, but then you become stronger and stronger the more you play. Except that this game makes you not feel like progressing at all. It's hard to describe, but I got the same feeling out of playing Defiance. Despite constantly leveling up and progressing to the next level, and fighting tougher enemies and buying more upgrades and improving your various weaponry, it doesn't really feel like you're making a difference. Well, maybe a little, but 2 hours in the game, you don't feel that your character has gotten that much stronger since last. I speculate, that this is because that the core game (the tile game) does not become easier or harder, only the outcome becomes greater.This, together with repetitious gameplay, makes the game stale after longer amounts of play.Story:This game does not really have a story, and for a game like this, it's fine without.Replayability/Concept:I really like the concept, and I feel that with a bit more tweaking and tuning this game could have been a lot more fun and a lot more addictive, which it isn't now, because of the repetitive nature of the game. There is also a bit of originality by this concept, mixing two genres together only really done well in PuzzleQuest.Other than achievements, there is no real reason to start over and try again.Length and fun factor:To be honest, I haven't beaten it yet, but judging by where I am at right now, I estimate a total play time of 3-6 hours.I find the core game (the tile puzzle game) to be very entertaining. It's hectic and it's stimulating, however it's hard finding joy in having to do this, let's be honest here, primitive game over and over again just to feel a bit of evolution and progress.Final Thoughts and judgement:If you are a big puzzle fan, especially of things like Chuzzle, PuzzleQuest, Bejeweled or even Candy Crush, and looking for a simple tile game with even simpler RPG elements over it, then this is recommendable. The puzzle aspect is fun, and if you're into that, the RPG part will not totally ruin it for you. For anyone else this is hard to recommend. For what it's worth I have found entertainment in this game, but some of the core aspects are flawed.If you like puzzle games and you see this on a sale it couldn't hurt to get this (and therefore earning my thumbs up). There are just much better alternatives.			"

												Interesting game. Reminds me of many web based games where you match for a result, but this one is a bit different where you can drag the tiles around for combos, but you need to change what you are matching for based off of what is going on in the senario above you. Get to a door, you need to match 3 or more keys to move forward. Meet an enemy, you need to match the swords.Combined with a base building background game where you spend the money you have gained in game to increase bonuses you receive during the senario. Feel like it would be better as a mobile game, but a good time waster.			"

												So, 10,000,000. It's hard to make a decision.First, this game is good. It's ported from mobile devices. And it's ported well. It's more easier to control with your mouse. Also it has Steam Achievements. It's good. And it's bad, but I'll tell you about it later. But besides it, this game is awesome puzzle adventure. I thought that playing puzzle games is very boring. I think some Pokemon casted Confusion on me. Puzzle can be interesting. If you'll bring RPG elements to it. It's cool to repair and upgrade your castle, it's cool to learn perks and to upgrade your skills. It's cool to play puzzle game. So I can recommend this game for you. But if you're not ""100% Achievement Hunter""...Second, this game is making me nuts. I'll never play it again. I'm tired of puzzle games after one little thing. The Jose. That's it. I HATE THIS THING. Achievements in this game are cool and funny, BUT THIS ONE WAS MADE IN HELL. YOU WILL JOIN THE EVIL DEAD. YOU WILL BE RUNNING AND SCREAMING ""JOIN US"" WHEN YOU'LL FINALLY GET THIS ACHIEVEMENT. I'VE SPENT ABOUT 15 HOURS FOR THIS. 15 HOURS FOR PUZZLE. I HAD NIGHTMARES... STAFF, SWORD, KEY, WOOD, STONE. Damn, if you're fond of 100% things, don't buy it. GO AWAY. YOU SHALL NOT PASS.BTW, they're making the sequel. You Must Build A Boat. They said, it will be bigger and better. You can even put your saves from 10,000,000 to it. You'll get it for free, if you own 10,000,000. I'll get it, but if they'll make something like The Jose, I'll never play it. That's it. My review. You have a choice.			"

												Lots of fun, I like it when games take a simple mechanic like match-3 puzzle and actually do something interesting with it rather than just playing it for its own sake. At the end of the day it's still not a particularly complex game, and getting the alignment close enough takes some getting used to (when dragging a row or column it doesn't automatically snap alignment, but overall I still found it worth a few bucks.

												Let me just say that I only BARELY recommend this game, and that you would really do yourself a service getting this game while it's on sale or something.Main premise:The point of this game is to reach a score of 10,000,000. This is done by playing a Chuzzle-esque tile match game wherein the tiles you match has an outcome on a dungeon battle. If you by example matches 3 tiles of a sword the guy attacks, 3 keys and you can open chests and doors, 3 wood or stone and you get resources to upgrade later in the game. The game include upgrades, shops, potions, bosses, and a suprisingly big number of valuables (experience, wood, stone, points, and money).Graphics/Sound:The game originated on phones and tablets and you can definitely tell that by a lot of factors. First of all the graphics are in a very heavy and sometimes grating 8-bit style and the sounds and music are entirely in chiptunes. The chiptunes are not bad by any means, but they're put on a short loop and they can get rather repetitive and annoying. It's not a game that needs to be great looking or sound amazing. It does its job, with average success.Gameplay:This is a grinding puzzle game. The main point is to get as far as possible and then retry again and again, until you can buy more upgrades and get a little further into the game until you reach the target score. This is a slow moving process. There really isn't much progress in terms of mechanics. All mechanics of the game is presented in the first 30-45 minutes and then the question is if you actually want to continue doing the same thing for a few hours.The main problem here, is that the game does a very poor job at spacing apart and adding game mechanics as you go along so everything feels fresh. This makes the game stagnate pretty quickly, and you get bored by it easily. You can only play this game in short bursts. This game has two parts to it; the action-puzzle part, and the management/upgrade/RPG-ish part. The first part, is mostly pretty well executed. The tiles do what they do, and you can most of the time tell that a bad run was mostly because that you didn't do well. The game can be a bit unfair in the distribution of different tiles, giving you 3 key tiles in total, when you really need it, but other than that, the nature of the game makes it difficult enough to be challenging, but forgiving enough to not be frustrated.The problems with the game originates from the second part, which is poorly executed.

This could be confusing to seasoned bejewel players--better get used to it.  Once you start, you can't stop. :)  Love the retro graphics, and the even more retro music and sound effects!At first I was skeptical, but a sale came around and reduced the price to $0.99, so I gave it a fair chance.

I've stayed up until at least 5am for the past few days playing this game just to level my character's items a few times and I still haven't come close to beating it. All the potions have great buffs but large drawbacks which is rare to find, too. Damn hard game for it's simplicity and highly recommended.

												This game is more or less Puzzle Quest: Challenge of the Warlords on every platform, including iOS, Nintendo DS, PSP, Android.Mind you, Puzzle Quest had more rewards for playing the game to customize your experience with level ups but this is more like the same battle concept but with quick micro achievements or set goals to gain rewards.Its okay, but not on the same level as Puzzle Quest. Catchy music. Gotta give that credit.TL:DR. It's an okay game that feels kinda like a mobile game. But it was still entertaining.			"

												If you like puzzle matching and adventuring with a little bit of weapon and armor upgrading then this game is perfect.  The simplicity of the game paired with the pixelated graphics makes this a great casual game perfect for killing time, theres virtually no load time to get into the game, no splash screen or title screen, its just insta-play.The only downside to this game, which isnt really a downside if you're the only one who plays, is the lack of multiple save slots.All in all I personally think its well worth the money, its a surprisingly addictive game and you can definitely kill a few hours here and there.

 10,000,000 10,000,000 was a very fun game to play, however I couldn't be bothered to play it for too long. Visual: 7/10 I did enjoy the visuals of 10,000,000 however I'm quite sick of the flood of games trying to be retro with pixel-art, so I scored it a 7 because it was neatly done, even if I don't like the art style all that much. Sound: 6/10 The sound is very similar to the art, meaning that there is a retro vibe to it, however I thought the music wasn't produced as well as the visuals were. Most of the time I found myself muting the sound on the game because it became so repetitive. Gameplay: 8/10 The gameplay is like bejeweled but has a twist. The twist is that there is an RPG element to it. The game uses different kinds of attacks and defence stances instead of diamonds and rubies. These attacks and defence stances make the adventurer you control attack or defend enemy attacks, which can be seen in the top corner of the screen. This is very fun, however the game gets very repetitive at a rapid pace. There are some items that you can unlock between dungeons, but there is nothing that switches the gameplay up besides the unlocks. Time/Money: 6/10	I didn't spend as much time as I had anticipated for the money, which is a result of the repetitive gameplay. I usually spend more time than that for a game that cost 5 euros (10,000,000 gave me an hour of gameplay per euro.). I recommend buying this game, but you should probably wait until it goes on sale (assuming you're not a die-hard bejweled fan.).			"

												6/10This game earns an ""A"" for being a clever blend of genres, but a ""D"" by poorly balancing them it makes the game repetitive, unrewarding, and leaving the player wanting for more.It is a really great concept and fun to play at first. If it was play tested to adjust the poor ""grinding"" curves, it could be an addictive smash hit.Problems and improvements:1. Resorces... The game has a great concept with harvesting materials to unlock new ""shops"" to upgrade your character, but wood/stone become obsolete as soon as these shops are all open (which can be done in the first couple hours of game play). Even worse are ""Experience Points"", which are only spendable at one store. You quickly buy all these upgrades in the first couple hours of gameplay, leaving you a lot of game play earning useless points with nothing to spend them on. Gold is the last to go. After you spend gold upgrading everything to its max, you find that you can't upgrade any farther, and you're still only in the first half of the game.- To fix this, the game needs more options for upgrades with a better price curve to make sure there is always something more to buy or upgrade. The game should be complete or close to completion before you run out of upgrade options in any rpg.2. Effectiveness... Upgrades, even when all are purchased in the first half of the game, do not do enough to make your character feel more powerful or effective. Grinding for upgrades is hard enough, but these upgrades should make even the worst player more effective at the game.Items, if used too early, will be wasted (The same goes for matches that are lined up too early). This is counter-intuitive, since every second counts. When approaching an enemy or chest, it would be great if your continuing multi-combo or clicked item was aimed at them instead of simply lost. Also, while just 4 keys in a row will take care of 2 locks, 4, 5, or more staff/sword tiles do little more than 3 against enemies.3. The Clock... The clock is also your health bar, which is fine and the shield idea makes it work well enough. However, there is far too much working against the clock and not enough helping it. You only gain a small amount of time back after defeating an enemy or unlocking a door/chest (or matching wood/stone with an upgrade), there is a lot that wastes time like combos, which continue to fire off leaving you helpless to act until they are done. These combos, while sometimes helpful, usually just eat time and give little back outside score (which is really only helpful in reaching the overall 10,000,000 to beat the game. Keep in mind, score is NOT cumulative, and is only there to let you know how close you are to getting to the end of the game). Chain combos and 4+ matches should offer a small time bonus as well.4. Luck factor. I have no problem with the Critical hit probability, but the luck of having the right combination of tiles in anything close to the right order to get what you need to match up in time is very random. I've had great runs where I've just had great luck, and blaze through every obstacle, and I've had luck where I lose on the first enemy due to this.5. Gear... There are unlockable potions you an use to trade one thing for another (i.e. 20% of wood/stone earned becomes gold but you earn 0 wood/stone ). These can be turned on and off. The rest of the gear, although upgradable, has no options like many RPGs do. It would be nice if you could buy upgrades for gear, but also swap them out for different effects (i.e. a staff that uses Freeze when it crits, or armor that has a lower effects against close range enemies but blocks ranged attacks, etc.).6. Curve... It could use a difficulty setting. Even if that meant just adjusting time limit, damage effects, etc.Not just that, the overall ""Grinding"" takes the fun out of the game.Final Verdict:- It's not worth $5. I got my copy on sale for $1 and had cash in my steam wallet from selling trading cards, so... it was basically ""free"". I wouldn't suggest it for retail price.- If it had the above adjustments made, It would be worth the $5, maybe even $10.- While it has great roots, and is technically a finished game, it really lacks the polish to make it feel like more than a ""free to play"" you'd find on NewGrounds.6/10			"

												Very rarely do I ""want"" to like a game more than I do this one. The style's fun, matching games in general are addictive, and I really do want to keep progressing. But the balance feels wrong and much more often than not the game really frustrates someone just looking for a good time. It's a matching game but if you're not matching the blocks you're supposed to be matching to defeat a monster or unlock a chest or whatever the game is throwing at you, then you die. And you die pretty quickly at that. You can go from full health on a great run to dead in just a few seconds if you haven't matched the tiles that you need. Most of the time you can't find the blocks you need at any given moment, without having cleared other tiles first. The game simply has one block type too many obstructing combo flow. Two of the seven block types have no function in the dungeon crawl except to impede your progress, at any given enemy encounter only two of the blocks might be useful to you. With less than half of the screen being useful and enemies eating your time you'll frequently die in less time it takes to read this review.It wouldn't be so bad if it gave you more time to plan combo chains. Or maybe you could stockpile matched blocks so that items like keys would stay in your invetory for unlocking doors and chests. Instead you can only match blocks at the moment you need them with previous matches disappearing uselessly. Mind you, it has to be at the very moment you need them, if you make the match too fast before the character runs up to the encounter, it also doesn't count wasting valuable blocks.If you somehow ended up becoming a master genius at the game, or if you've grinded enough hours to buy enough perks, it could be great. But the early stages are just no fun and only succeeded in frustrating me. After a while I lose interest in mastery. The game just feels too unfair.			"

												Although I haven't completed the game to the full extent, I have started this review. This is one of those simple games that gradually gets harder as your progress through the dungeons, and the game is set in a way where you ""bejeweled"" your actions. There are many different actions and completeing a dungeon is just carry out 3 challenges in one run. You are able to upgrade your tiles, by that I'm refering to your weaponry, magic, and armor and other perks that you can unlock with the experience you build, and use them to your advantages. Completeing a full dungeon, even after you clear later dungeons, is rather difficult, especially when the boss tends to be a dragon. I wouldn't completely recommend playing it, but if you're willing to spend the money for a game you'll enjoy for a short period of time.., You're welcomed to this game.			"

It is a match 3 game where you either slide a row or a column to make matches for whatever is needed at the time. Locked Doors and Chests require keys, Monsters require Swords and Staves, Shields are used for defense, Stars for items to help, and Stone and Wood for building your home base afterwards.The objective is to go as far as you can in a dungeon, and upon failure you take all the resources you gathered to upgrade your home base to allow even further runs. The main goal is to have a total score of over 10,000,000 in one run of a dungeon.It's fun for a few hours, though the game is pretty short. If you can get it cheap, it'll be good value.			"

												Nice little game with extra charm. Three hours in this game is actually ok since I play it when I'm about to go somewhere or something. Pros:-Cheap-Rewarding-Fun-Has a goal-Nice throwback touch to itCons:-Takes a while to get to goal-Few to no customization.			"

												This games leaves me with two pressingquestions:1) Is this the best Match-3 ever made?2) Are you comfortable being a person that wants to know the answer to question #1?Pure minimalism: buff, crawl, lose, and repeat. No soporific dialogue & side-quest tedium (ahem Puzzle Quest); nothing extraneous in its Atari 7800-chic presentation. Recommended perhaps primarily for its brevity, pace of play, and lack of self-seriousness.			"

												Linux Review.This game is fun.  It is intense.  For a example one of the early quests is to ""last 90 seconds"".  However it is one button push to start the next run so the action keeps flowing.I could not find a certain feature to upgrade my castle.  This left me believing that I has hit a wall and would have to grind forever before I could make progress, and so I gave a bad review.  In spite of this I could not stop playing, a testament to the game's ""one more run"" effect.  Then I realized my daft self completely missed a button to upgrade the castle further and even more fun kicked in.Works on my ubuntu, AMD graphics laptop plugged into widescreen TV.  No problems works great.The graphics aren't pretty.  The chiptunes are pretty good.  The gameplay is solid. Worth the asking price.			"

												10,000,000 takes the simple puzzle concept that you'd find in classics such as bejeweled, and blends it well with RPG elements. Upgrading your damage, magic, armor, and shields as well as the rooms gives you something to look forward too after each run.All of this, coupled with quests, potions, usable items, and a clear motive to GTFO of the dungeon. You'll find yourself losing track of time easily with this puzzler RPG. Fun game. Gameplay: 7/10~The mechanics to the game were done right. A good combination of Puzzler and RPGArt Style: 4/10~Older than classic pixel art. I'm a fan, but there is opportunity here.Music: 5/10~Again an ode to the old days of gaming. But nothing too noteworthy. Good, but not amazing. Difficulty: 3/10~It's a timed puzzler at the core. The RPG elements just make the game easier. Grind out your EXP and Gold and you win.			"

												What if they made Puzzle Quest with the sliding-row match-3 puzzle instead of the swap-pieces kind? Also, what if they took out all the story, and most of the grind? Well, you'd get this crazy-addicting, fast-paced, hard-to-search-for game. The overall game pacing meant that when I finished the game (in about 6 hours over two sessions), I had had enough fill to still think pleasant of the game. Note that towards the end it can get grind-y, but the sense of progression is still nice enough to push you along.			"

10,000,000 - in 100 words:It's a tile-matching game. It's a lonely dungeon crawler, never-ending looter. The skill is irrelevant since it is infinite. The more you play...well, the more you play, period. Eventually you'll get out, almost surely. It's just a matter of when, not how and if. Pixels are all over the place, and they are extremely big. You have upgrades, upgrades, and even more upgrades. It's a game you play for five minutes until you realize there are dozens of titles that lie dormant in your library, waiting to be discovered while you waste your time running after ten million points.10,000,000 is......very appropriate if you don't know what to do at work....ugly, extremely ugly, even by retro-pixel-indie standards...mixing two genres, for better or for worse.10,000,000 is not......challenging. It's quite the opposite....leaving your mind for some time, thanks to the music that keeps on repeating forever....a game about numbers, big numbers and scores.			"

												It's fine as long as you aren't expecting too much. You frantically match-3 until you die, trying to complete the tasks you're faced with by matching specific tiles (e.g. unlocking chests with key tiles). You also collect resources tiles while you play and use them to upgrade everything after each game. It's a little annoying that you simply can't progress very far until you get enough upgrades no matter how well you play, but it adds to the addictiveness of the game, to complete everything.			"

With that said, the game play isn't exactly earth shattering because its mostly a grind. However, the sliding puzzle challenges make it a lot of fun to play. It's one of those games where you sit down and you can't stop playing until you've beat it. Definitely worth the couple of dollars by itself and a bonus to support an indie development project.

												So, 10,000,000. It's hard to make a decision.First, this game is good. It's ported from mobile devices. And it's ported well. It's more easier to control with your mouse. Also it has Steam Achievements. It's good. And it's bad, but I'll tell you about it later. But besides it, this game is awesome puzzle adventure. I thought that playing puzzle games is very boring. I think some Pokemon casted Confusion on me. Puzzle can be interesting. If you'll bring RPG elements to it. It's cool to repair and upgrade your castle, it's cool to learn perks and to upgrade your skills. It's cool to play puzzle game. So I can recommend this game for you. But if you're not ""100% Achievement Hunter""...Second, this game is making me nuts. I'll never play it again. I'm tired of puzzle games after one little thing. The Jose. That's it. I HATE THIS THING. Achievements in this game are cool and funny, BUT THIS ONE WAS MADE IN HELL. YOU WILL JOIN THE EVIL DEAD. YOU WILL BE RUNNING AND SCREAMING ""JOIN US"" WHEN YOU'LL FINALLY GET THIS ACHIEVEMENT. I'VE SPENT ABOUT 15 HOURS FOR THIS. 15 HOURS FOR PUZZLE. I HAD NIGHTMARES... STAFF, SWORD, KEY, WOOD, STONE. Damn, if you're fond of 100% things, don't buy it. GO AWAY. YOU SHALL NOT PASS.BTW, they're making the sequel. You Must Build A Boat. They said, it will be bigger and better. You can even put your saves from 10,000,000 to it. You'll get it for free, if you own 10,000,000. I'll get it, but if they'll make something like The Jose, I'll never play it. That's it. My review. You have a choice.			"

												Lots of fun, I like it when games take a simple mechanic like match-3 puzzle and actually do something interesting with it rather than just playing it for its own sake. At the end of the day it's still not a particularly complex game, and getting the alignment close enough takes some getting used to (when dragging a row or column it doesn't automatically snap alignment, but overall I still found it worth a few bucks.

												The game 10,000,000 is really quite fun. If you hate grinding though, STAY SO BLOODY FAR AWAY FROM THIS. This game is a weird mix of bejewelled puzzle action while your character is running through the dungeon slaughtering baddies and opening doors/chests. You match swords to attack, keys to unlock things etc. and that's how your character progresses through this endless dungeon. The entire game is a big'ol grind to the top, running dungeons over and over till you accumulate enough stone/wood/gold/experience to unlock abilities, better gear and better shops. I've only spent a little over an hour when writing this review but if you're looking for a great way to spend your time without breaking the bank here it is!			"

												Linux Review.This game is fun.  It is intense.  For a example one of the early quests is to ""last 90 seconds"".  However it is one button push to start the next run so the action keeps flowing.I could not find a certain feature to upgrade my castle.  This left me believing that I has hit a wall and would have to grind forever before I could make progress, and so I gave a bad review.  In spite of this I could not stop playing, a testament to the game's ""one more run"" effect.  Then I realized my daft self completely missed a button to upgrade the castle further and even more fun kicked in.Works on my ubuntu, AMD graphics laptop plugged into widescreen TV.  No problems works great.The graphics aren't pretty.  The chiptunes are pretty good.  The gameplay is solid. Worth the asking price.			"

												It's fine as long as you aren't expecting too much. You frantically match-3 until you die, trying to complete the tasks you're faced with by matching specific tiles (e.g. unlocking chests with key tiles). You also collect resources tiles while you play and use them to upgrade everything after each game. It's a little annoying that you simply can't progress very far until you get enough upgrades no matter how well you play, but it adds to the addictiveness of the game, to complete everything.			"

The game is really short, lasting about 4 hours until completion, but I've been able to come back to this game and start from the beginning many times. I even purchased the Android version to play on my tablet, and the portibility and touch screen mechanics work better than PC.

												10,000,00010,000,000. An odd name for a game, yes. But it is also the purpose of the game. To reach 10,000,000 points and escape the dungeon is your ultimate goal. So is the run worth it, or should you just pass this one up and find a new number to satisfy you? Let’s find out.This one will be short and sweet, like the game itself turns out to be. Well, maybe not so sweet as it does tend to end with you dying. Quite a lot in fact. The gameplay is the tried and true match-3 formula we all know and love. With some minor combat elements tossed in, of course. Match three or more swords or staves and you will do damage to your enemies. Beat them and you continue along your merry way and earn more points. Along the way, you will collect gold and various resources, which can be used to upgrade your weapons, magic, and armor. Upgrading these will in turn allow you to get further in your run, collect more gold, upgrade more, and so on. The end goal is to reach 10,000,000 points and earn your freedom.If you’re a fan of addictive match-3 games and enjoy some RPG-lite gameplay, you won’t go wrong with this one. The game clocks in at around 5-10 hours, and is well worth the small price tag. "

												10,000,000 (or 10M for short) is a game about matching things! What makes it unique, though, is that as you match things you build up resources for use in between rounds. The progression system is fun, and the goal is to become stronger with better weapons and armor until you are finally powerful enough to score 10,000,000 points in one session. The game is not especially deep, but that makes it very easy to pick up and play. You will grind the same dungeon multiple times until you have the resources to make yourself stronger, sometimes, but it never stops being fun.This game is available on Android (and maybe iOS?) as well, which is where I typically play it. That is why my play time is very low here on Steam!			"

												10,000,000 is a fun little casual match three type puzzle game with an RPG theme. In the main part of the screen you have are trying to match 3 or more of a symbol, getting cascades and so on for bonuses. The key twist is that your character needs specific types of matches at certain times - match keys to get through doors or open chests, match swords or staves when you are fighting a monster, and avoid spoiling/using such matches in between while the character is just running along. Meanwhile the other item types you can match give you resources to build up your base, or get bonus items.You also have special subquests to do while running each dungeon, like getting a 5 match, or using only items to kill a monster, etc. It all adds up to give a bit of a strategic element to the basic match three gameplay, and a bit of a fun metagame building up your characters skills and equipments to get more powerful, fighting more dangerous monsters, and eventually achieve the titular 10,000,000 points to win your freedom.

												It really need touch screen capablities, using a mouse is awkward and slows you down just that must enough to make speed matching harder.  I'm slow since its a long time since I played a matching puzzle game, in fact I don't usually play these games.  But there is no learning curb within the game to ""train"" you.  With only a few ""levels"" supplied in the game it wasn't on sale at 80% I wouldn't have bought it since it rendered the game less then £1.  All in all, this it is, a game thats good for wasting a few hours, that you'd be mad to buy at full price.  Overall its enjoyable, but to ranked up some of the conditions to move onot the next dungeon means you at points must ignore what you dungeoneer is doing to execute a 3 or 4 match combo.  This means your game is risked being cut short suddenly mid-combo.  So while your fumbling around to find a 3 match keys, the clock is ticking and you might have to throw a 3 part combo to clear enough to hope some keys pop up. Ont he other hand, I will note when the game DOEs through the right combos and pacing out for you, suddenly you breeeze through it without challenge... Rendering it the same as any match puzzle game.... Only 10x more fustrating. Top it off, things like XP are WORTHLESS, you train everything so quickly within half an hour you can have bought the entire lot.  I've got 4,000+ XP by the time I reached Dungeon Crawlere and theres no use for it?  Might as well not be there. Ironically, the resource you need the most, money/gold/whatever is often harder to find. To the point finding it sometimes actually breaks the flow of the game. If the issues were fixed, I'd buy a sequell, yes, but based on first impression of this game... It would take a steam sale before I'd buy that too.			"

												I got this game on a whim during it's 0.99 cent sale. At the time, I was suffering from a very painful toothache, which was almost dehibilitating. I wanted something I could do that didn't require focus, so I figured I'd try this game. Two things of note; one, my estimate for not requiring focus was completely off-base. Two, I played it from install to near completion in one 5 hour sitting. My toothache was an afterthought. I have no more praiseworthy sentence than that.The concept is simple; it's a match-3 game. Even worse, it's my least favorite kind of match-3 game; a move has to end with 3 or more matching. Nothing akin to, say, Tetris Attack, where you could meticulously plot out an amazing chain, one block move at a time. So why would I recommend this game, even when the first two paragraphs of this review are faintly condemning it?Because it's amazing, that's why. It takes cue from other match-3 games with the simple but addictive gameplay, and then adds it's own finess to the mix. You're exploring a dungeon, and your actions are based on matching tiles. Clear 3 Key tiles to open a lock on a treasure chest, match 3 Sword tiles to swing a sword at an enemy, you get the idea. Run the dungeon as long as you can, slaying enemies, collecting loot, and get as far as you can. Strive for that 10,000,000-point mark.What makes this work so well is it's so frantic. At any given time, you're matching in the grid, while watching your inventory of special, one-shot items, while at the same time plotting for the next encounter. Fighting a dragon? Forget those keys, those wood, you need lots and lots of attacks. At a chest? Those swords do you no good, you're waisting them as only keys will open the locks. The most stressful moments for me were the time between encounters; ""I have a five-chain of attacks lined up, I hope it's not a chest or door next...""The game rewards you for each attempt, too. Clearing wood tiles and stone tiles give you those in currency form, you collect gold and EXP from felled monsters and opened chests, and you can refurbish and upgrade your impromptu-home with facilities. Not got enough 'umph' behind your swings? Upgrade your sword at the smithy. It's a repetitive cycle to be sure, but there's no greater joy than building up a horde of gold from your failed runs, pumping up your sword's destructive might, and then laying waste to enemy after enemy with your newfound strength. However, the cycle doesn't continue forever, and once you hit max, that's it. The game will get no easier from there, and all that's left is you and your 10m goal.It's certainly not without it's own flaws though. Early on, the runs are frantic and short. Very, very short. Even in the tutorial run, you won't completely grasp what's going on or even how to plan things out because it's ALREADY OVER. It takes running after running to finally get a feel for the game, and then it goes out of it's way to make you attempt sometimes rediculous maneuvers to advance. These goals include simple things (get a certain score, get a certain amount of EXP), to difficult without planning things (defeat a ranged mob in less than 5 seconds) to downright infuriating (use a scroll to get a triple clear in one shot, seriously? No amount of planning will get you that). These shortcomings I don't nessicarily say are the game's fault, rather, the intencely random nature of this brand of match-3 makes them far harder than need be.When all is said and done, it's welcoming enough for beginners (given some time to adjust), and has enough depth and breadth for hardcore gamers to get a good kick out of it. At 0.99 cents, this was a steal of a game. The full-fledged pricetag of 4.99 is still low for the enjoyment you'll get out of this game. Expect to clock in at least 5 hours of good, solid gameplay before completing, and based on how much the random number god loves (or hates) you, another 3 hours until 100% completion. Even then, it's just fun to do a quick dungeon tromp to burn some time and some dragons.			"

												After buying this game on sale and playing I quickly decided I would have bought it for its full price, graphically simple and complete. A good, catchy soundtrack and fun gameplay. The upgrade system makes playing a building challenge though with all you face it is your own skill that will drive you.			"

												Bought this game for iOS way back when I had my iPhone. Was an amazing time killer. One of the best times I've had in a puzzle game period. The RPG elements are solid and the endless running and fighting aspects are executed solidly. The only complaint I have with this game is it is short lived, wish there was some type of endgame or replayability. I never wanted it to end. But it did and I enjoyed every second of it.			"

												A new twist on the clique of a ""match 3 same colored tiles"" game. Take this method, and turn it into a runner- and an RPG. Very rewarding, always fun to pick up and play when you're bored. The only downside is the lack of resources at some times. With easier methods to getting supplies, I'd give it a higher score. I'll settle for 8.6/10.			"

												This game is just sliding tiles. It tries to seem like more with the RPG elements but that is little more than a skin. The game rewards you for making as many matches as possible, as fast as possible, regardless of what is happening in the top section. Sure, you have to match the right tiles to proceed past each obstacle, but that happens naturally through frantic matching. If you try to play the board strategically you'll find things simply don't happen fast enough and you'll fail the level because time is always ticking down and you HP usually is too. The whole experience feels like it was designed by a gambling cartel trying to get me addicted to slots.The upgrade system was compelling at first but quite quickly became a chore and no longer enhances the experience after a few hours. There is a little strategic freedom in how you spend your resources on upgrades and perks but it really doesn't affect gameplay, it just shifts difficulty from one element to another. There is also an arbitrary wait while upgrades are occurring in which you can't do anything but watch the progress bar. This wait increases with each upgrade for no reason. It isn't long but it is completely unnecessary. The investment type perks are pointless because they effectively just adjust how much grinding is necessary and players won't know how much grinding they want to do until they've missed the opportunity for the investment to be economically viable. I honestly think they game would be better served by automating or removing the entire upgrade system and just implementing a few sliders so players can adjust how good they have to be at tile matching to not lose.The only thing which is still interesting after a few hours is the challenges. There are at most 3 challenges active at any time and new challenges aren't made available until space is made for them by completing an existing challenge. They are things like 'Kill an armored monster with only staves' and 'Open a chest within 5 seconds'. Challenges provide a reason to adjust strategy which helps stop the game becoming stale, however I'm fairly frequently stuck on (a) challenge(s) and the game stops being fun at all. Completing an overly difficult challenge is a relief, not a reward, because a combination of grinding and luck is what gets me there. An option to skip challenges would fix this but might reduce the worth of the challenge system.To put it simply, if you're expecting anything more from the game than a pretty good tile matching time-waster you might be disappointed. I think there is potential in the format but a lot more weight needs to be given to the RPG elements for me to enjoy this as a hybrid puzzle RPG and not just a puzzle game with a guy running at the top of the screen.

												This has to be the most addictive game in my library right now, which is odd for how straight-forward it is. It's just a simple point and drag puzzle game but how it can be this obsessive I'll never know. I've stayed up until at least 5am for the past few days playing this game just to level my character's items a few times and I still haven't come close to beating it. All the potions have great buffs but large drawbacks which is rare to find, too. Damn hard game for it's simplicity and highly recommended. Bought this for 99 cents on sale but it's definitely woth the 4.99 price as well.			"

												10,000,00010,000,000. An odd name for a game, yes. But it is also the purpose of the game. To reach 10,000,000 points and escape the dungeon is your ultimate goal. So is the run worth it, or should you just pass this one up and find a new number to satisfy you? Let’s find out.This one will be short and sweet, like the game itself turns out to be. Well, maybe not so sweet as it does tend to end with you dying. Quite a lot in fact. The gameplay is the tried and true match-3 formula we all know and love. With some minor combat elements tossed in, of course. Match three or more swords or staves and you will do damage to your enemies. Beat them and you continue along your merry way and earn more points. Along the way, you will collect gold and various resources, which can be used to upgrade your weapons, magic, and armor. Upgrading these will in turn allow you to get further in your run, collect more gold, upgrade more, and so on. The end goal is to reach 10,000,000 points and earn your freedom.If you’re a fan of addictive match-3 games and enjoy some RPG-lite gameplay, you won’t go wrong with this one. The game clocks in at around 5-10 hours, and is well worth the small price tag. "

												A match-3 game combined with a gauntlet platformer/action, with some light RPG/strategy elements to it - it actually turns out surprisingly good! The game mechanics are simple yet solid enough to get you hooked if you're in to any of the above mentioned. The pixel-y art style and chiptune music also work surprisingly (to an even larger extent, as the entire ""retro""-theme has become quite overused and washed-out as of lately) well.Overall, this is a great buy if you want a casual (make no mistake, it's a real casual game) match-3 with some more depth to it, and if you like the ""retro"" aesthetics. It's a fun, cheap, quick to get into little game.			"

Sometimes you die and you have no clue why. You can run and fight for minutes, sometimes you just die after 15sec. This game tells you nothing at all, no healthbar, no timer, nothing. You just die over and over again for no reason.What the upgrades do, no clue. Again it's trial and error - mostly error.The soundtrack is pretty decent. "

												Harder than it looks.  It's like bejeweled, but not really, as lining up blocks moves the whole row or column, rather than switching two blocks.  This could be confusing to seasoned bejewel players--better get used to it.  Once you start, you can't stop. :)  Love the retro graphics, and the even more retro music and sound effects!At first I was skeptical, but a sale came around and reduced the price to $0.99, so I gave it a fair chance.  Glad I did, as I love this game.  Hmm, maybe I shouldn't be glad... gonna take longer to get those baseboards painted now... oh well. :PI'll beat one of those dragons sooner or later.

												Well, for a dollar it was kind of ok, even if I didn't finish it. I think I'd be more disappointed if I'd spent more than that. It's an ok way to kill time, but unless you're really into the core mechanic of matching tiles, it's really just matching lots of tiles while numbers get bigger. You can buy stuff along the way to make the numbers get bigger more quickly, and there are sub-goals and achievements for getting your numbers big enough along the way, but there's not much substance to it. It does do what it says it does for the most part though, so there's that, aside from the mouse occasionally hitching when sliding tiles around, which I've heard works better in the mobile version (which is easier as a result). I got tired of how repetitive/grindy/luck-based it gets toward the end, which is a poor combination with my life-long inability to read ahead beyond the current move in match-three games.			"

												Very addictive game. It combines puzzle matching with a series of obstacles. Matching identical pieces (at least 3 in a row) at a swift speed allows you to surpass these obstacles whether it is an enemy or a lock. It seems very simple, but for the achievement hunters out there, the most difficult achievement, The Jose, requires a lot of persistency. You'll be putting in a lot of time and training your eyes to find matches better. Also, this game is a bit of luck as well. Don't even look at your score. Just focus on the game/obstacles.

												This game is one of those that suprises you by how fun it actually is. On the cover it looks like just another match three game, but once you actually get into action you'll notice it's just so hectic that it's super fun and addictive. And then you notice that  you can actually upgrade your character. To do this you must combine some specific blocks like wood. The upgrades generally provide you more time. So in the beginning a round might take just 15 seconds, but once you're upgraded to the max you'll be in the dungeons for minutes.There's actuallyl not that much grinding if you know what you're doing. Just use the right potions and you'll get an extra amount of wood and stone. Complete the required objectives and you get more skill points. The game never gets frustratingly hard, nor is it too easy. It's just more down to luck of which blocks the game gives you. But once you learn to manage the field properly, even that shouldn't be a big problem.But in the end, the game is just a match 3 game, so if you don't like them, this might not be for you. Although I'm one of those people who doesn't like them, and this was just a blast from the beginning to the end.			"

Game is the basic matching game with the rpg above the puzzle where you can see your hero fighting. You have items on the side to use to help out your hero and yourself if you ever need it. Each of the puzzle pieces when matched up correctly provide an action for your hero or resources. As the game is called the goal is to get 10,000,000 points.

												This game is very simple, it's your average 3 tiles match game but with some more depth. You got ressources tiles, Woods and Stones, which let's you gain ressources for upgrading your shops. You got keys which let's you open chests and doors. You got bags which will give you a item from time to time. You got attack tiles, Sword and Staff, which make you attack the enemies in front of you and depending of the enemies you're fighting it might be better to use physical attacks (Sword) or magical one (Staff). Shield tiles let you absorb a damage from the enemies. There's also a star tiles which basically can match with any other tiles. With the shop you can upgrade your gears, like your swords so you do more physical damage with sword tiles. You can upgrade your armor so enemies take more time to attack you. You gain experiences so you can unlock skills, like more chances for your magical attacks to make a abnormal status to the enemies. There's also potions that will handicap you so you can gain more points for exemple.The graphics are simple but got charms, the really big selling point to me is the music which is fantastic in this game. So if you like 3 match tiles like I do, this is definetly worth a buy.			"

It could have been so good but...- Most of your combos are either useless or wind up hurting you later.- The alchemy ""upgrades"" are largely useless.- The multiplier system ensures that you'll have to grind for hours to win.- The achievements have you continue grinding even after beating the game.The core mechanics are good, the music is catchy, but these numerous flaws just bring the game down. If only you could ""bank"" your bonuses so that they aren't wasted so much, that would be a good first step. As it stands, this is a short diversion and nothing more.			"

How a fairly simple match3+ game can be presented with a fun 'dungeon crawling' twist is brought together well, though I wish there were more sound tracks (as the 'vintage' style is greaT).Quick Bullet Points;•Good buy, especially if during a sale.•Simple, but not dumb. There's challenge at looking at the array of tiles and knowing how to slide to anticipate a chain of matches.•Instructions are poor for fairly important skill\stat progression. Do not forget to -upgrade- your skills menu, or else you may hit a wall of being crappy-weak early on. Its a little button at the top of the upgrade popup (every 'upgrade' menu has this)			"

												This game is both a satisfying arcade ditty to play in short bursts and a tormentingly addictive puzzle game of madness. The 8-bit aesthetic looks great in full screen and the music is catchy enough to keep you calm and focused during each dungeon visit. The gameplay itself is easy with a simple click and drag mechanic to line up blocks. It's the unpredictable nature of what blocks you are given that makes each run a fresh and ever-entertaining experience [of damn intense concerntration and panic].			"

												Apparently it's cheaper on iOS. Had I known that, I would have got it on my ipod instead. Regardless, it's quite the run 3-match puzzle with a blend of RPG to it. Quite the simple game and yet it keeps me playing from time to time. Music matches the game well too.			"

												This is a fun game somewhat in the vein of puzzle-quest. The difficulty scales very well throughout, which makes you feel a sense of achievement when you start taking down things like minotaurs and dragons with relative ease late game. The graphics aren't exactly easy to look at, but I beleive this was an ios port so you really can't expect them to be. The sounds and music sound straight out of a nes era game, and leaves you with a nostalgic feel to it. The game is very short, with very little replayability, but its a fun game to spend a couple afternoons with.			"

												I highly recommend this to people who like match-3 games.  It's more fun than any other match-3 game I've ever played, and since I grew up with my mom always playing match-3 or Tetris games, that's saying a lot!  I really enjoy the added need to match certain tiles at certain times--to unlock a door or chest, or kill an enemy quickly--in order to progress, the upgrades, and the objectives.  I was surprised that the RPG/Action portion of the game actually added to the experience and meshed pretty well with the match-3 style, since I normally find added components to be poorly done, distracting, and just there to try to get attention...  I've never scored 10,000,000 points, though :(			"

												10 ♥♥♥♥ing million. That's the score you need to get to beat the game. And that's all you gotta do......I might be oversimplifying things a little bit, since it will take you a good couple of hours to beat it (around 7-8h).The game is very easy to understand, you have a guy running on your screen and once you get an obstacle, you have to take care of it. If you have a door, you will have to combine 4 keys, if you have an enemy you can either combine swords or staves. The idea is to never fall behind or you lose.Once you reach preset milestones, you will have the option to play harder levels, that rewards you with higher score multipliers. The higher the level, the higher the score you will get, and the harder the monsters are.This is a game where you will fail 99.9% of the time, and once you get that 10,000,000 score you are likely not to touch this game again, but it's so extremely addictive and at the same time frustrating. After each attempt you can spend your resources (wood, stone and experience) on power ups that will help you get through the levels...Pros:- Very addictive- Decent RPG elementsCons: - Music- Story... or lack of.- Price, the mobile version of this game is much cheaper...7/10			"

												The game 10,000,000 is really quite fun. If you hate grinding though, STAY SO BLOODY FAR AWAY FROM THIS. This game is a weird mix of bejewelled puzzle action while your character is running through the dungeon slaughtering baddies and opening doors/chests. You match swords to attack, keys to unlock things etc. and that's how your character progresses through this endless dungeon. The entire game is a big'ol grind to the top, running dungeons over and over till you accumulate enough stone/wood/gold/experience to unlock abilities, better gear and better shops. I've only spent a little over an hour when writing this review but if you're looking for a great way to spend your time without breaking the bank here it is!			"

												Absolutely recommend this game. This is very simple puzzle game which is connected to the battle system between monsters. For each tiles of puzzle have a role of offence (sword and staff), defence (shield), lockpick (key), item (chest), and resources (wood and stone) which make you concern about little strategy. Getting gold and resources to upgrade your weapons, armors and so on. You may feel bored feeling but when you notice this, the game is almose done, I guess. Comparing with the price of this game (during sales), it is fully worthy.			"

												Honestly bought this game because one of the reviews said it was like Huniepop without the babes. It's not really the same other than the matching moves side to side, but it's the entire row or column instead of a single piece. Nonetheless the game is pretty challenging to get all the achievements, especially ""The Jose."" I was able to do it twice, but the first time did not register (others have had this issue as well), so it took me another 12hours to get it again. The game can be easily completed in seven hours to get all of the achievements. A drawback is that one does not realise they get their achievements unless they log off the game and then receive them on Steam. The game gets repetitive and leveling the weapon, staff, shield, and skills gets tedious. But it gets challenging when monsters get stronger along with you. Chance of getting good drops is also a large factor in success for this game. I would recommend this game if you like to get achievements and enjoy matching puzzle games. Definitely just get it when it is on sale.  "

The concept is great, the approach is a fresh treatment on the classic match-3 genre, and the progression feels near perfect, it's just the controls.  While I haven't had the chance to try it on a touch compatible PC, unless you're using a tablet like form factor, I'd have to say skip this and get the iOS or Android version.			"

												It is a unique game. Though I would definately like to see varieties of this style of game. Game is the basic matching game with the rpg above the puzzle where you can see your hero fighting. You have items on the side to use to help out your hero and yourself if you ever need it. Each of the puzzle pieces when matched up correctly provide an action for your hero or resources. As the game is called the goal is to get 10,000,000 points. At the end of each run in the game you control the character and are able to go into rooms that allow you to shop for upgrades with the in game gold. The game was pretty short depending on how lucky you are with the blocks and was pretty short.			"

												10,000,000? Odd name to say the least, but I'm sure this game will suprise you like it did me. This game is in short a bejeweled spin-off with more action. The way the game work is simple you need to get 10,000,000 score to beat the game and that's the jist of the games core. The game may sound a bit boring with such a simplistic victory condition, but there is more to it than that.The difference of bejeweled and 10,000,000 is the fact you have a hero at the top of the screen you control. Based on the blocks you break you change the outcome of the heros fate by unlocking doors, killing monsters, or just collecting supplies for when you go back to home to spend them on upgrades.There are multiple ways to change the flow of the game. Whether it be with Armor upgrades to reduce damage, Sword upgrades to increase the damage and critical chance on your sword breaks, wand upgrades to increase the damage of your spells and increase the RNG of freezes and poison, and even potions to change the multiplier.I believe that any fan of the puzzle genre should consider picking up this epic and amazing tale of a hero trapped and his only goal is.... 10,000,0009/10			"

												I'm new to this match-3 game genre and I found the puzzle/rpg hybridness of 10,000,000 very addictive, even too much since I invested so much time on it to reach the 10 million points goal. But at last, freedom!A blocking point for me was that it wasn't very obvious that rooms in addition of being unlocked could also be upgraded, so I got stuck at middle game wondering why I couldn't easily advance anymore as most monsters were kicking my back. Once I figured that out, completing the rest was rather easy. I guess that other people who complained the amount of grinding needed to win the game also incurred in the same problem.This game isn't meant to be finished in a single sitting. It can get a bit repetitive after several tries, but if you limit it to a few ones a time, it will remain a fun game for quite a while.Note that I played it on my PC with a Wacom graphics pen tablet, I guess it isn't as fun and easy to play with a mouse. Actually I imagine it would be a bit frustrating, given the few painful quirks the tile control system has. So, I would not recommend playing this with a mouse unless you seek masochistic challenge.			"

												High-speed match 3 game, with progression elements but little in the way of customization due to its you-can-have-it-all perk system. All the same, for a cheap diversion it's quite engaging. Hopefully the future holds a more in-depth sequel with meaningful choices to be made when it comes to equipment and skills.			"

												Great casual game when you are stuck with a few minutes on your hand.  It is a matching game with RPG elements thrown in and meshes well.  Learning curve is mild and no need to spend countless hours to unlock the next upgrade as it can be done in time.  Lots of people are passing this game in less than 7 hours and for the price, those are 7 hours well spent and breaks down to less than .72 cents an hour at full price.  You can survive with 7 less candy bars in your life, 10m is worth those candy bars.			"

												This is a puzzle game at heart. If you line up 3 or more coloured tiles they disappear from the grid, they disappear. In much the same fashion as Bejeweled, new tiles then fall down from the top of the grid to fill in the now empty space. The only way this differs from Bejeweled is that instead of swapping two tiles, you instead can drag any row left or right, or any column up or down in its entirety to make a match.However, this is only half of the game, and is frankly the boring bit. Each set of tiles you clear does something different, with the aim of keeping your man running through the dungeon above the board as long as possible. So sword and staff attack monsters, shield defends you, keys open locks, backpack provides items, and wood and stone help you upgrade your base. So this balance of keeping the right tiles on the screen, especially when different monsters are weaker to different attacks, is what keeps this game enthralling.That said, it does have some problems with artificial difficulty. Your health/stamina is represented by how far along the top of the screen your man is. Once this runs out, you have to restart the level for another try at the high score. However, as your man runs through the dungeon, the time it takes to slide backwards along the track  gets shorter and shorter, decreasing your max health no matter how well you are playing. As a result, you often need to start at a later checkpoint to have any chance of progressing to a higher score. I'd have much preferred just a straight run through increasing power/health monsters than a backwards slide down my character's own abilities.So overall:Negatives:The match game is Bejeweled and requires little strategy.Decreasing power through out a run gets on my nerves.Positives:The dungeon combat system is inspired and brings the strategy that Bejeweled lacks.The power increase due to upgrades between runs is well thought through and well paced.If this game had an endless mode, that is a mode where monster health/attack power went up constantly until you die, I'd recommend this in an instant.But without this it lacks replay value as you feel like you're hitting a hard-coded wall instead of the limits of your own ability.So a reasonable game for 3$, is enjoyable, just don't expect too much playtime from it.  7/10			"

												A true combination of the puzzle, RPG, and action genres. The tile sliding and matching aspect of the game somewhat reminds me of bejeweled, of course with its own unique twist. Have an enemy in front of you? You have to quickly match sword or magic staff tiles to battle it. Want to unlock a chest or a door? Match the key tiles to unlock them. All of this is done while racing against the clock, providing a sense of urgency to it all. When your not busy trying to reach a score of 10,000,000 you can upgrade your armor, sword, wand, clothes, and train to gain new abilities and level up. While combining the puzzle, RPG, and action genres may not seem like fun, this game is definitely a good time waster thats actually fun! 7/10			"

Essentially, it takes the grinding found in many RPG games with the incentive of leveling up different abilities and weapons that will make your journey throughout the many caves of 10,000,000 easier. The harder difficulties can be quite challenging. Although not a very extensive game, the puzzle sections keep me coming back to this addictive game.			"

												LOVE IT!So the game it self is very basic. The main thing to do in the game is to fit different slots showing different items, and in the  top of the screen you see the monster or whatever you are fighting or trying to unlock. If you for example come across a zombie, than you can make a row of 3+ of the same item, in this maybe a sword or a wand and then you hurt it, if you do this a coupple of times it dies, then comes the next obstacle, maybe there is a chest infront of you, then you have to put 3+ keyes in a row to unlock the chest and maybe find something, then you just go on, when you don't do any acctions, your character will slowly move backwords when you try to find a combination to maybe slay a dragon. When he goes to far back you lose that round and you come back to your cave, there you can unlock different rooms like the gym to make your character stronger or more efficant. I personaly like it alot, it makes the time fly away. It's like that kind of game you play when you are offline or have nothing else to play. The music is awesome and the graphics are really cool. So what are you waiting for, go download the game before I slap you in the face!			"

You match tiles for attack and defense as well as resources which can be used in the ""overworld"" to purchase upgrades during the dungeon scrolling. So thats the game but here's the bad news. It's dull. While it has it's moments of entertainment, in the end it's dull and rather difficult to actually acheive a score of 10,000,000 due to it being completely randomized. This is even more evident when attempting to get all the achievements.Overall, unless you have time to kill and it's cheap don't get this.			"

												Imagine if Bejewled had RPG elements and you'll understand 10,000,000 immediately. Essentially, it takes the grinding found in many RPG games with the incentive of leveling up different abilities and weapons that will make your journey throughout the many caves of 10,000,000 easier. The harder difficulties can be quite challenging. Although not a very extensive game, the puzzle sections keep me coming back to this addictive game.			"

												10,000,000 essentially takes the core gameplay concept of Chuzzle (dragging whole rows and columns to make  a match) and adds classic RPG elements. It's easy to pick up, and it's not TOO hard to put down. If you like slow-paced contemplative tile-matching that make take you an hour to complete a run, this is gonna be a little much for you.It is expected that each run will only last a short time (a minute or two in the early stages), because you are working against the clock. Your hero runs through a long dungeon (displayed at the top of the screen) and meets various obstacles. The type of obstacle will determine what type of match will allow you to advance. The hero runs fast enough to regain time, but the screen keeps scrolling slowly while you are working on an obstacle.Doors and treasure chests require that you match Key tiles. Enemies can be attacked with Sword or Staff tiles. Most enemies will need to be attacked multiple times; they have health bars to let you know how you're doing. You must also endure enemies' attacks, which will reduce your timer (there is no HP, only the timer). Shield tiles can give you damage reduction, and Item tiles can generate useful consumable items for your inventory (one-use weapons and magic spells, keys, food to add time to the clock, etc).You also match Wood and Stone tiles, which accumulate resources that are used back in your hub area in between dungeon runs. You build item shops which allow you to upgrade the effectiveness of each type of tile matches. You'll accumulate Gold and EXP with each dungeon run. Gold can be spent on your various tiered equpiment upgrades, and EXP can be spent on a variety of one-off permanent bonuses (like decreasing the cost of weapon upgrades, or granting bonus time for long combos).You'll also be given up to three objectives to try to complete at the start of each run. These range from ""match [X number] of Stone tiles over the course of your run"" to ""defeat an enemy by only using Items""""Beating"" the game requires getting a cumulative 10,000,000 points across all your runs, though you can keep playing after that.I've played through the game before, and I'm on my second playthrough now that some new content has been added. It's a nice way to kill a few minutes before I go to work, or a few hours when I get home.			"

												It's not everyday you see a game named after a number, let alone one hitting 8 digits, so of course my eye was attracted to this pitiular title right off the bat. I've always been a passive fan of board matching games such as Pop Cap's cashcow Bejewled, but 10,000,000 does one of the wierdest genre crossover games I've ever soon - they somehow crammed in a Fantasy-RPG dungeon cralling game into my puzzle game. The tiles you match on the board causes your character to perform an action - locked door in your way? Match key tiles to unlock it! Generic bad guy attacking you? Sword his♥♥♥♥♥or magic his face in by matching sword or rod tiles! It goes deeper than that, but just that alone make it totally worth the low price it is selling for right now. If you're into really fast paced action, get this thing!			"

												Although it has a lot of things going against it (Match 3 puzzle game, iOS port, etc) this game is loads of fun. Don't be fooled by the store page, this isn't actually an RPG, but simply a match-3 puzzler with RPG elements. While most M3 games have you moving one symbol around in one of 4 directions, this one has you rotating columns/rows to match 3. It takes a bit of getting used to, but well worth it. Most gameplay is spent on the dungeon crawling. You look up on the screen, and match the symbol needed above. eg: If theres a chest, match 3 key symbols.You cannot pass until you match the correct symbol, and theres an advancing wall that kills you (Keep ahead of it!). There are also monsters that you must kill using either Magic or Physical matches (Different monsters have different weaknesses). There are different items you can use too. Overall, a great timewaster/puzzler, but not really a puzzler. 17/20			"

												This is a puzzle game at heart. If you line up 3 or more coloured tiles they disappear from the grid, they disappear. In much the same fashion as Bejeweled, new tiles then fall down from the top of the grid to fill in the now empty space. The only way this differs from Bejeweled is that instead of swapping two tiles, you instead can drag any row left or right, or any column up or down in its entirety to make a match.However, this is only half of the game, and is frankly the boring bit. Each set of tiles you clear does something different, with the aim of keeping your man running through the dungeon above the board as long as possible. So sword and staff attack monsters, shield defends you, keys open locks, backpack provides items, and wood and stone help you upgrade your base. So this balance of keeping the right tiles on the screen, especially when different monsters are weaker to different attacks, is what keeps this game enthralling.That said, it does have some problems with artificial difficulty. Your health/stamina is represented by how far along the top of the screen your man is. Once this runs out, you have to restart the level for another try at the high score. However, as your man runs through the dungeon, the time it takes to slide backwards along the track  gets shorter and shorter, decreasing your max health no matter how well you are playing. As a result, you often need to start at a later checkpoint to have any chance of progressing to a higher score. I'd have much preferred just a straight run through increasing power/health monsters than a backwards slide down my character's own abilities.So overall:Negatives:The match game is Bejeweled and requires little strategy.Decreasing power through out a run gets on my nerves.Positives:The dungeon combat system is inspired and brings the strategy that Bejeweled lacks.The power increase due to upgrades between runs is well thought through and well paced.If this game had an endless mode, that is a mode where monster health/attack power went up constantly until you die, I'd recommend this in an instant.But without this it lacks replay value as you feel like you're hitting a hard-coded wall instead of the limits of your own ability.So a reasonable game for 3$, is enjoyable, just don't expect too much playtime from it.  7/10			"

For each tiles of puzzle have a role of offence (sword and staff), defence (shield), lockpick (key), item (chest), and resources (wood and stone) which make you concern about little strategy. Getting gold and resources to upgrade your weapons, armors and so on. You may feel bored feeling but when you notice this, the game is almose done, I guess.

The game follows a runner format type of game, up top is your dude running from left to right, he'll run until he hits a obstacle (Monster or a lock) and you match what you need from the bottom puzzle board.Sword & staves do damage while the keys unlock locks, also in the board are armor tiles, item tiles and resource tiles. You keep this up until you lose by the screen catching up with you, which then causes you to awake back in the stone chamber.You can spend the resources you find to open and upgrade the rooms which in turn boost your abillity to play the game,rinse & repeat until you get 10,000,000 score and you win the game, simple.There are milestones and challenges to complete that give you some resources and multipliers adding your end goal.All in all it's a short but addicting match-3, nothing amazing but simply solid in its execution.

												Well, this game was a damn pleasant surprise. It had been on my radar for a few years but every time I looked it up I left mostly unimpressed. Mostly, it was because I preferred swap match 3 games to sliding match 3 games, and I assumed the RPG elements would be gimmicky or hard to keep track of.I recently picked up the game in a Humble Bundle (along with its sequel, You Must Build a Boat) and this was an unexpected pleasure. The RPG and match-3 gameplay melds together brilliantly, with situationally important icons adding a simplistic complexity to the old genre. The soundtrack is catchy, and the progression feels natural and well-paced. I'm glad I own this!			"

If Candy Crush was an RPG it would be thisInitially when I started this game I instantly thought ""oh look another match 3 game, this will be fun like 10 minutes"" but then I started to realize it was kinda fun. The challenges or ""quests"" for each level kept me playing beyond the first 10 minutes and as I went up through the first few levels it got harder and I started to get stuck till I realized the boarded doors were not different levels but upgrade stations which is where the RPG elements come into it. Progression is the big thing that will keep you playing the game, upgrading your sword, staff and armor helps you get through later levels as they get harder.While it does play just like a matching game similar to games like candy crush the RPG elements set it apart enough to almost not resemble games of the same genre. In this game your goal is to get to 10,000,000 points but points are not achieved making matches but by moving forward in the dungeon. This is where different types of matches are important for facing different types of challenges like opening doors, chests or killing enemies. Standing still will push you back so preparing and understanding your board is important to success which means you can't just match everything in sight and do well.The game relies on quick reaction in both eye and mind between the board and the RPG going on above as well as a little luck and random dragging when your board starts to get filled with the things you don't want.7.3/10- Addictive and challenging RPG inspired match-three puzzle game "

												Tiny Review by AlderonIt's a good game. It is... Just not as enjoying as i hoped.The good parts:- Retro pixel graphics.- Dive right in.- Casual gameplay for lunchbreaks but fun enough to avoid getting stale.The bad parts:- Grinding, oh how i hate grinding.- Shallow gameplay.- RNG based puzzles and rewards.- Challenges.The conclusion:Casual players will enjoy this title a lot and i'd recommend it to them. Gamers wishing for more depth in their game should look elsewhere. 6/10			"

												This game would be better as a mobile app, quite honestly. I really like it, but the angle gets really old. I'd recommend this to people who want something to do while their code is compiling or their stuff is rendering or their paint is drying. Fun and somewhat engaging, but it's built on repetition. I would recommend this to a casual gamer with a little time on the side occasionally. It'll last them a few months.			"

And ever since man moved out of caves, they've been fantasizing about going back in and beating up all those lizards and skeletons that made fun of them when they were younger.If you want to play Bejeweled, but don't want to sponge too heavily off your neighbor's unprotected wifi or suffer the wrath of disapproving librarians, then this is your game!If you have low graphical allowances but still want to play a dungeon crawler, this is your game!If every key had broken off your keyboard and you only have a mouse or trackpad, etc etc see above.10/10 would match again.

												If it wasn't for the fact that the game screws you over by not buffering your moves while your character is moving, this would be a perfect game. But the frustration of wasting moves because it takes too long for your character to move away from a completed task is enough for you to make one or two wasted moves.			"

												Shatter tiles and walk thru long corridors in Ten Million! 10,000,000 is a match 3 puzzle game dressed up with RPG elements. The tiles you match correspond to your characters actions as he travels the games ""dungeon"", i.e. match keys to unlock doors. There are also stone and wood tiles which allow you to upgrade your home base, which allows you to upgrade your character between runs; and a couple of different attacks to help with monsters. It's very subject to the whims of the RNG so some runs can end very quickly whilst others will have everything fall into place with little effort. Pun not intended. The graphics are a little rough around the edges but do their job and the same could be said of the audio, all in all this is a cheap time waster that is sometimes fun, sometimes frustrating. I give it 4/10 and wouldn’t want to pay more than $2 for it but it has its charm and a nice RPG gimmick to separate it from other match 3's. Good - Lots of gameplay - Fun, when you get on a good runBad - Graphics are simple and unpolished. They do the job, but thats about all they do - A little too luck dependent for me - GrindyRecommended only if you are a huge fan of this type of game 3/5			"

												There aren’t too many puzzle games that do what this one does. While it at first might seem like a simple match-4 game with some fantasy elements thrown in, there is so much more below the surface. 10,000,000 is a puzzle game that focuses on upgradeable equipment, dungeon running, resource collecting, and finishing quests. Now, I don’t know about you, but there aren’t too many puzzle games that come to mind that can check off those same boxes. This game does something very special: it makes you want to solve puzzles, not just to get to the next level, but to progress in every sense of the term. Your character will gain access to better weapons, shields, and even potions which help all help customize the experience. 10,000,000 does all of this while being wrapped in a very basic pixel-art shell with music that is guaranteed to be stuck in your head for days.

												It was 9 hours of grinding for me to (almost) 100% this game, and I really mean grinding ― actually quite unpleasant in the middle, when you're too far into the game to deal with cheap upgrades, but still too weak to be able to farm resources easily. My impression is that 10,000,000 relies too much on luck, and is a little too fast; you don't have enough time to think and are just relying on intuition and quick matching. Sometimes it just made me want to play Puzzle Quest instead. Still, I guess it's alright to kill some time, although it's probably better on a mobile device.PS. If you want my advice for this game, never don't be matching.			"

												10,000,000 is a match-three style adventure game with RPG elements. The gameplay is very simple and tactics are similarly uncomplicated. Your character runs along a dungeon hall and encounters various monsters, locked doors or locked chests. It's up to you to slide either columns or rows of symbols on a grid to match at least three of the same symbol to perform an action. The more symbols you match, the more effective the action. Where this differs from the classic match 3 experience is that you must defeat whatever obstacle is in your path with the appropriate matched items. You have to match keys to unlock locks and defeat monsters with swords or wands. Meanwhile you also try to manage your board, gather resources for improvements to equipment and ultimately hit the magic score.All in all, gameplay is smooth, game is fun. Get it.I have 10,000,000 on both PC and Android platforms and while I definitely can recommend picking it up either way, my prefered platform is actually Android.			"

												Well, this game was a damn pleasant surprise. It had been on my radar for a few years but every time I looked it up I left mostly unimpressed. Mostly, it was because I preferred swap match 3 games to sliding match 3 games, and I assumed the RPG elements would be gimmicky or hard to keep track of.I recently picked up the game in a Humble Bundle (along with its sequel, You Must Build a Boat) and this was an unexpected pleasure. The RPG and match-3 gameplay melds together brilliantly, with situationally important icons adding a simplistic complexity to the old genre. The soundtrack is catchy, and the progression feels natural and well-paced. I'm glad I own this!			"

Takes a while, and you'll just be grinding for a while in each area until you earn enough resources/gold to unlock and upgrade your way to the end.If you want a fun puzzle game, dungeon crawler-esque, with terribly-awesome 8-bit-esque graphics, look no further.7/10 Would play to the end, but not much replay value.

												This is a pretty fun in tiny shots puzzle game. It has a similar puzzle game to puzzles & dragons series or good old bejeweled. Except in this you slide the columns or rows into 3 or more of a kind. Different puzzle pieces are how you attack or raise money and resources.        I believe this was a mobile game at first, or at least I remember playing it long ago on the mobile. Ended up with this in a humble bundle pack and didn't realize it was this game so I had the added flavor of nostalgia with my experience.        So, if you like casual puzzlers of the matching type and it's at a reasonable price, go for it!			"

												Truth be told, I got this game as part of the Humble PC & Android Bundle 14. Now that I actually look at the games included, I am pretty sure I had just bought it to make the donation and maybe play the games included one day. I think it took the fact that I had some 200 odd keys to redeem (many, many duplicates dating back to 2013) to get me to play this game. I just decided to start from the top of the list and work my way down. My list was sorted alphabetically so 10,000,000 was the logical starting point.At the onset, 10,000,000 seems like just another match-3 games. Add in RPG elements of upgrading your gear and abilities and you have the perfect puzzle game. I normally hate match-3 games. Beat a level only to unlock a new level just gets boring after a while. What sets 10,000,000 apart is that you are not actually beating levels. You play until you either die or run out of time. My wife happened to walk by while I was playing and so eloquently put it ""it's one of those match games"" and after I told her there was a time limit, ""so, like tetris.""  The first time I played through the game, I did so on my phone. On top of everything I mentioned, I think I enjoyed the quick games you can play. I then decided to play on Steam because, you know, achievements (such a dumb reason to play a game by the way - says the guy who got two platinum trophies for My Name is Mayo...). 10,000,000 is almost as enjoyable but I get the feeling that the game was designed for mobile. I usually do not sit at my computer to play a quick game that lasts anywhere from 20 seconds to a few minutes. I hate referring to a game I genuinely like as something to kill time but ultimately, it is one of the factors I look for in mobile games.I highly recommend this for anyone looking for a different take on the match-3 game. From its pixelated graphics and retro-style soundtrack, this is a perfect game when you need a quick break. I recommend the mobile version and not only because it costs two bucks cheaper. I loved playing a few rounds and then taking a break. The game has the tendency of being a grind and I feel this is more likely to occur on the Steam version when you are sitting down and playing longer than 5-10 minutes. The game only takes about 3-4 hours to complete. Why not make it last? As more daughter would say, ""one more time!"" Hopefully, you feel that way too when trying to put the game down.www.whereisthepausebutton.wordpress.com "

 Two thumbs up 10,000,000 is a great game, and a fresh twist on match-3 games.Most significant upside: The game feels like a role-playing game, although you use match-3 to fight monsters. This gives goals to the match-3 strategy, which is a sweet, unique feel.Most significant downside: The game is still a match-3 game at heart, so it hits a strange middle-ground between casual games and more advanced role-playing games.

												The gameplay premise sounds odd: an action-RPG with puzzle-based combat. The combat/puzzle takes a little while getting used to, however, the surprisingly inventive gameplay is a satisfying experience!Simple on the surface, when you start the dungeon crawl, you'll have three objectives you can attempt to fulfill, earn resources and gold, upgrade your character, and in the end try to obtain a total score of 10,000,000 points.I never made the final objective, but I still recommend this game!

												This game isn't bad. Why is the review negative then you say? Because it's not good either, it's below average actually. The concept is great, and it could make an action-packed roguelike game, but the execution is quite bad. The game would be fine if it wouldn't be for one detail. The time doesn't pause when damage is dealt and when chains are countered (and you can't do anything at that time). This might seem like a detail, it might seem weird from a stranger's perspective but it ruins the game. How many times have I lost because the timer kept on running and combos of items I didn't need kept on coming? Way too many.In conclusion - buy the game in a bundle or when on sale, but not for anything above 2 dollars. It keeps you entertained for a while but is quite annoying.5/10			"

By moving a single row, either horizontally or verticcally, line 3 of the same things in a row to use them. You have your character running along a straight line being confronted the either vicious creatures and monsters or chest. Fight your way along to get points and gold.

I only put one hour into the game on steam, but that's because I bought the game on my phone as well (available on Android and iOS) and then primarily played it there.			"

												Addictive match 3 game with a unique twist where matching the right tiles will get you further in the dungeon.There's not too much of a storyline - the goal of the game is to score 10 million points which will allow you to exit the castle.  The gameplay itself is a lot of fun though.  You run dungeons to get loot and with loot, you can upgrade your castle, your character and weapons and add challenges using the potions.Each dungeon has a set of challenges and when you completely these, you can move onto harder dungeons to get better loot.You can also pick up items along the way which will allow you to last longer in the dungeon if used wisely.It's a quick game to finish and definitely worth the money!

												This game isn't bad. Why is the review negative then you say? Because it's not good either, it's below average actually. The concept is great, and it could make an action-packed roguelike game, but the execution is quite bad. The game would be fine if it wouldn't be for one detail. The time doesn't pause when damage is dealt and when chains are countered (and you can't do anything at that time). This might seem like a detail, it might seem weird from a stranger's perspective but it ruins the game. How many times have I lost because the timer kept on running and combos of items I didn't need kept on coming? Way too many.In conclusion - buy the game in a bundle or when on sale, but not for anything above 2 dollars. It keeps you entertained for a while but is quite annoying.5/10			"

												The gameplay premise sounds odd: an action-RPG with puzzle-based combat. The combat/puzzle takes a little while getting used to, however, the surprisingly inventive gameplay is a satisfying experience!Simple on the surface, when you start the dungeon crawl, you'll have three objectives you can attempt to fulfill, earn resources and gold, upgrade your character, and in the end try to obtain a total score of 10,000,000 points.I never made the final objective, but I still recommend this game!

 Two thumbs up 10,000,000 is a great game, and a fresh twist on match-3 games.Most significant upside: The game feels like a role-playing game, although you use match-3 to fight monsters. This gives goals to the match-3 strategy, which is a sweet, unique feel.Most significant downside: The game is still a match-3 game at heart, so it hits a strange middle-ground between casual games and more advanced role-playing games.

												Truth be told, I got this game as part of the Humble PC & Android Bundle 14. Now that I actually look at the games included, I am pretty sure I had just bought it to make the donation and maybe play the games included one day. I think it took the fact that I had some 200 odd keys to redeem (many, many duplicates dating back to 2013) to get me to play this game. I just decided to start from the top of the list and work my way down. My list was sorted alphabetically so 10,000,000 was the logical starting point.At the onset, 10,000,000 seems like just another match-3 games. Add in RPG elements of upgrading your gear and abilities and you have the perfect puzzle game. I normally hate match-3 games. Beat a level only to unlock a new level just gets boring after a while. What sets 10,000,000 apart is that you are not actually beating levels. You play until you either die or run out of time. My wife happened to walk by while I was playing and so eloquently put it ""it's one of those match games"" and after I told her there was a time limit, ""so, like tetris.""  The first time I played through the game, I did so on my phone. On top of everything I mentioned, I think I enjoyed the quick games you can play. I then decided to play on Steam because, you know, achievements (such a dumb reason to play a game by the way - says the guy who got two platinum trophies for My Name is Mayo...). 10,000,000 is almost as enjoyable but I get the feeling that the game was designed for mobile. I usually do not sit at my computer to play a quick game that lasts anywhere from 20 seconds to a few minutes. I hate referring to a game I genuinely like as something to kill time but ultimately, it is one of the factors I look for in mobile games.I highly recommend this for anyone looking for a different take on the match-3 game. From its pixelated graphics and retro-style soundtrack, this is a perfect game when you need a quick break. I recommend the mobile version and not only because it costs two bucks cheaper. I loved playing a few rounds and then taking a break. The game has the tendency of being a grind and I feel this is more likely to occur on the Steam version when you are sitting down and playing longer than 5-10 minutes. The game only takes about 3-4 hours to complete. Why not make it last? As more daughter would say, ""one more time!"" Hopefully, you feel that way too when trying to put the game down.www.whereisthepausebutton.wordpress.com "

												Hey everyone and this is my review about the game!This is a Fast paced Puzzle game.Interface/Menu/SettingsThere is NO Menu.But there is a music slidebar available.There is also a sound slidebar available.There fullscreen and windowed mode available.No resolution sizes available.You are able to delete your save file and start from the bottom again.About the game.During the puzzle you have to swap the tile things and make a match together. 3x or more of the same tile at least. Each matching tile is having a different outcome. Sword and staves will damage the enemy. Keys are unlocking chests and doors. Wood and ores are needed to unlock new things at the hub. Shield is needed to reduce damage and make the run longer and the chest has a chance of giving you an item. Your end goal is to reach 10M in one RUN. You do have to upgrade yourself to make a run last longer. Once you have read the left side, your game will be over!Unlocking new things.Very easy game to understand.Repetitive but addictive.You can upgrade yourself by making your runs a little bit easier.Very interesting game!Could be short if you are doing really well.The 8 bit music is very well done! Including in Combat puzzle mode!There are challenges that you should be able to complete for rewards.Other things.If you are familiar with the game ""tetris attack"" on the Snes or ""Pokemon puzzle league"" on the N64. This game plays almost the same. -------------------I Give this game a 9/10			"

												Simple good fun. Around 4-5 hours to complete. A nice puzzler with basic RPG elements. For the price you cannot go wrong. Can you get to 10,000,000 and escape the dungeon ?!?!?			"

												A fun little match em' up game. A bit challenging but it's usually just up to luck on what tiles or items you get. It's basically a more advanced version of bejeweled with some RPG elements.Only took me 4 hours of gametime to 100% the game.I wouldn't see anyone playing this for over 10hrs since it would probably start to feel repetitive.  I'd check it out since you can pick it up on sale for around a dollar.			"

												Name of the game? 10,000,000. Your goal? 10,000,000. Yep, it's interesting.Even though we have a strangely-named (or numbered) game title, it does seem to fit within the main game itself as you simply need to score 10,000,000 points in order to win the game. How do you score that, you may ask? Well, the game is rather simple in a way that it mixes match-3, endless runner and RPG-like elements all in one game. You match tiles in order to either gain resources, build up your shield, unlock loot, or even just kill some monsters that'll simply attack you in order to push you to the left side of the screen, which will make you lose. As you gain resources such as XP, gold, wood and stone, you use them to improve your dungeon that'll bring in many status upgrades ranging from dealing more damage when matching swords and staffs to gaining certain buffs such as gaining time bonuses when matching wood and stone.Throw in some objectives, ranks, and some score and resource multipliers, you'll be well on your way to reaching 10,000,000! It's a fun game for those who like match-3 RPGs.			"
