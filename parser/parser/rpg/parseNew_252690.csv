												OK, so please read the full review instead of just taking note of my thumb down vote for this game. That was a tough choice to make. This program is a very mixed bag, some wonderful things in here that are blended together with some horrible design decisions.Context: I use this program as a face-to-face tool for my gaming group, no outside connections. So this review will ignore any feature dealing with that. Also, will not be comparing this to any competitors. My setup is a dual screen PC, with two instances of the program open. One (GM) on my monitor and the  second (Player) on a TV laying flat. Players are using miniatures and real dice, while I am using tokens and the program's dice.   I'll start with the good. This program is POWERFUL! I can sit down and create almost everything I need with this. If I want to add a weapon type to my game, I can. If I want to change the way a spell works, I can. Edit text in a purchased adventure, create custom classes or races, add a grid to a random overhead map pulled off of google, build an adventure from scratch... all doable. It takes time, but from what I've experienced not much more time than if I were doing everything using a notebook and pencils. One thing I am especially grateful for, is that I can enter any dice roll manually, I don't have to use the program to do it.Combat is easy. As GM, I simply drag attack dice onto the player I wish to target and release. The program rolls the dice, checks the result against the appropriate defense (including saves), and calculates the result. Damage works the same way, including automatically changing to crit damage on a natural 20. As players, we do it the old fashioned way - they roll, I tell them if they hit or not. For their damage, I just add their damage to a ""wound"" field in the NPC's sheet, and the program adjusts the current HP for me. HP can be displayed in several ways, ""xx/xx"", colored circles, etc. There is a ""Combat Tracker"" that lets me do most of the work from just that one window. It handles attacks, iniative order,  HP, etc.I am using one of the prebuilt adventures, Lost Mine of Phandelver. We've only had a couple sessions, and are still very much in the ""OK,  wait a moment while I figure out how to do this"" stage of the game. There is a lot of clicking, and a lot of windows open at any one time. I haven't decided if this is a good thing or a bad thing, but mostly I think it will be good once I get used to it. The story is subdivided into very small parcels, which sometimes overlap. I've learned the reading several pages ahead is vital. Each page will contain any combination of description, shareable maps (both GM and Player), preloaded encounters (both roster and map placement), pictures, GM Text, and (likely) more that I haven't seen yet. The adventure appears to be word for word, picture for picture, exactly what is being sold for traditional gameplay. And so far, it works very well for taking an inexperienced group and immersing them into the adventure.Now, for the things that I don't like. Let's start with the very, VERY obvious issue. Price. This program is expensive, there is no way to sugar coat it. For starters, you need to pay $40 for the program. This gets you the basic license, and the core framework that makes the program run. For MY needs, the basic license is all I need - you can host, and connect a second instance using the same computer. For any groups where each player has their own computer, they also need to spend $40. Alternately, the GM can buy an ultimate license, for $150, and then other players can connect to his game for free. They cannot GM, only play. Now, this includes everything needed to play... technically. If you want to DO anything, like create a character, you have two options. You can spend hours at the kayboard doing data entry, copying everything from your Players Handbook into the program. Or, you can buy a players handbook addon... for another $50. Want the DM Guide? $50. Want the Monster Manual? $50. These will add themselves to your base install, but they do not come with a physical copy or a PDF. Physical copies, ironically, are about half this price on Amazon. Premade adventures cost $20-35, which is about the same as buying the physical book.The next thing bad about this program is the support. If I have a question, I know I will need 20-60 minutes to search through forums posts (or write my own), an outdated / semi-broken wiki, or YouTube tutorials (MANY of which are made by their customers). By and large, that is what the community expects new customers to do. There is no handholding here. In fact, while many forum members welcome newcomers with open arms, many more view Fantasy Grounds as their only child... anyone saying anything less that praise will be immediately attacked. Missing features, bugs, quirks... Fantasy Grounds has them. This program was not developed with Industry Standards in mind. Fantastic examples: Alt F4 does not exit the program. There is no way to print a character sheet from the program. Adding a weapon to inventory automatically adds attack data, but adding armor does nothing for defense - must manually edit the AC data. Adding a character's background during creation will add everything associated with it, languages, proficiencies, etc --- but changing/removing the background doesn't remove anything it added. It is actually quicker to delete the character and start over than it is to manually search through and fix it. Finally, there is the talk of revamping the program to run on Unity. Talk that has been going on in the forums since at least September 2014. This has been used as a reason that features/bugs are not being addressed, since their focus is on the new system. As a new customer, I fear that this is like chasing after a Duke Nukem game or Guns'n'Roses album... where there is a very real chance that if it DOES happen, it'll happen far too late to be of any relevance to most of us.Bottom line, this purchase is a gamble. This is not a single person game, you're relying on your group to be able to play it. At the bare minimum, you are shelling out $110 (base program, character classes, 1 premade adventure) or $40 plus days of programming the races, classes, monsters, equipment, etc into it. What makes it worse, is that you must research exactly what you do / do not need. The DLC total was well over $2,000 last time I looked, which is intimidating. The learning curve is very steep, with a lot of frustrations along the way.That being said, I'm glad I bought it. I'm confident that in time, I'll become proficient enough with it that it will an amazing benefit to my gaming group. Remember, this thing is POWERFUL. Despite the very valid downsides I've pointed out, this program does 95% of what I want it to do, and it does that well. I don't regret buying it. On the flip side, your mileage will vary, so I cannot in good conscience recommend it blindly.			"

												Fantasy Grounds is quite honestly the best virtutal tabletop software. I've tried several, but I run campaigns exclusively on this now. This software has a massive learning curve. You can get the basics quickly, but to master it takes a while. It is so feature rich that you can automate 90% of the DMing with enough planning and set up. My players love the system - other DMs that play in my campaigns want to switch over. Combined with other software (map designing, photoshop, ect) you can create excellent and wonderful campaigns loaded with graphics built upon a fantastic under-the-hood ruleset system which takes the technical (mathematical) aspects comepletely from the game so you can have lightning quick combat encounters and focus on roleplaying. Of course the combat traker is wonderful if you want to have a combat heavy hack-n-slash campaign and only makes combat more enjoyable. The story design part of the game is great. You can pin combat encounters, NPCs, story elements, loot, exp, and more directly to the map. Experience can be awarded on command. Loot can be dumped into the party inventory automatically and the players can divide it themselves. Character creation is simple and easy. All of the math is again automated here. Just drag items to your inventory. Same with spells, but things get more complex if you multiclass, but its just part of the learning curve. Some will complain about connectivity issues. Port-forwarding is a simple thing to do, but VPN software can get around it. Mac -> PC does have some issues. I only have one Mac user in my games, but he has the majority of the technical issues. Tech support is very fast as well, but I've only had to use it once.Overall, I can't recommend this software enough. I have had hours of use with it. "

												I did alot of research before investing in this software. I must admit I had some hard times figuring everything out in the beginning, mostly with parsing my homebrew. The good news is that as long as you play a supported system you need no parsing. The software does what it promisses and I like that there's no full automation as it allows me to change values and add my own houserules. I recomend ppl intrested in this software to not look at the guides at first (atleast for me it was confusing in the beginning) but instead look up ppl on twitch/youtube who use Fantasy Grounds, I would recomend looking at 5e or Savage Worlds campaigns.Also take full advantage of the forum and meet the great community, there's alot of help, mods, extensions, tips and fun over there.For me this software is simply the best software investment I've made in recent years and have become a necessity that I play around with even when I do not play a game. Just letting my fantasy flow and creating adventures or having a parsing session.			"

												I have both played and DM-ed using this FG2 interface, and this is a great gaming interface. I like it so much, I actually use it during table-top D&D to show the maps, images, take notes and track hit points. As always, it's a huge amount of work for the Dungeon Master. I leared to use their PARSE tool so that I create my own add-on modules for the adventures with it's own creatures, items, token, and images. The game lets us focus on role playing and talking smack while it takes care of most of the tedius tracking stuff.It's not the same as when I played with pen and paper in the same room with my friends 20 years ago, but now that we moved all over the country and all have families, this is the next best thing. I payed for the full DM license so that my friends all just need the free version.Now that AD&D 5E is available, this has gotten even better, since that's the rule set we're using.It does not come with voice, so you do need a seperte voice server (like Mumble) to talk to each other.

												As a life-long D&D player (I am 42 and have played since I was 10, from the Basic Blue Book and Chain Mail to 5th edition) I was REALLY excited about Fantasy Grounds. And when it works, it works very well.Unfortunately, ""when it works"" = not nearly consistently enough. My friends and I have been playing a 5th edition campaign using Fantasy Grounds and recently its been nothing but crashes to desktop CONSTANTLY. It seems to be a memory problem, where if Fantasy Grounds approaches using 4 GB of memory it shuts down.First, this program has NO business using that much memory - its just sloppy code. I can play Witcher 3 and NOT use that much memory.The networking code is also atrocious. Absurdly long load times on connection to a campaign, lag rolling dice, etc. Its just not well done.I can't recommend this product to anyone. Our previous campaign, a 4th edition one, was run in Roll20, and we didn't have nearly the problems we do now using Fantasy Grounds. Fantasy Grounds is DEFINITELY more robust than R20, but that doesn't help when you can't use it due to stability and lag issues. Pity. Stay away.			"

Posted: January 24, 2016
												My comments are strictly from the perspective of a D&D 5e DM.Prior to getting Fantasy Grounds, I reviewed other options primarily because FG is fairly expensive - or so it seemed.  As I started pricing it, it became obvious that the D&D components were priced the same as full priced retail manuals - since they come with the full text and in-game functional tables, this makes sense.Once I saw it as a licensing issue and understood that this really was an electronically functional version of the game manuals, I was on-board - I wanted the real rules and the full text to be available to me.  Since none of my players had an FG license, I also elected to carry the burden and nabbed an ultimate license.One thing that you will hear is that Fantasy Grounds has a learning curve.  This is true.  I was 12 hours in before I felt comfortable with it and it was another 12 hours before I realized that I could have done a better job on some things.  As time has gone on, I have realized that I want things structured a little differently to better facilitate online gaming - things that don't become clear until you are actually hosting a game.To learn Fantasy Grounds, I recommend finding a PDF module that you want to use and then 'port' it as a module.  Create a campaign just for the module and start moving the text, creating encounters, and building parcels as needed.  There is a lot to learn, so use youtube and ask questions in forums when you get frustrated.At the time of this writing, I've DMed a pair of 4 hour sessions via Fantasy Grounds and have had a blast.  My players are satisfied with the visual and rules assistance provided by FG and I am thrilled to be DMing my first campaign since 1989.  I anticipate putting over 1000 hours into this software and appreciate what it allows me to do.			"

												oh boy!!! a $40 2 MB program that does nothing that any free program like it does not, which also strangles your ability to homebrew unless you have extensive knowledge of XML files, and otherwise forces you to do every ounce of the legwork when it could easily do it itself if only the developers put a trivial amount of extra effort into it?! WOW WHAT A STEAL! HHKKKKKhhhkkkjfjgggg :fmad: $$$$$$ remember to buy our special ruleset DLC, unless you want to invest significantly more time and effort than it would take to just homebrew something with actual pen and paper! boy do we love your nerd money!!! $$$$$$EDIT: since some people have, justifiably, called this a nerd rage review, allow me to expand, particularly upon 'well what ELSE does this and that?' and the greivances i have (this comes from my response to Smiteworks in the comments to this review). Roll20 does all of the things FG does, and does not come with a forty dollar pricetag. Roll20 does not ask for a pile of cash because Roll20 did not acquire meaningless licenses to things that players could have and would have created and distributed for absolutely free, and Roll20 did not slap a massive pricetag on it based on that. what if i don't want to just change spells and monsters? what if i want to have the All Flesh Must Be Eaten's Unisystem rules in place? i will have to MAKE it myself using the world's least user friendly formats- XML, LUA, as Smiteworks has stated- or wait for someone ELSE to do it- or for Smiteworks to release it as a fifteen dollar DLC. Roll20 instead hands all the tools and most importantly FLEXIBILITY i need to customize my campaign's rules right off the bat- i could have a standard 3.5 high fantasy game or AFMBE campaign on my own terms at my own whims. forgive me if this comes off as a cashgrab to me and i can't give it a serious review.

												This is a really good program.  We've been using FG for over three years now to run Paizo's Kingmaker Campaign Path.  Several of us are in China with the rest of our players in North America, and combined with Hamachi (to get around the Great Firewall) and Skype (for the live talking part), it's as close to a face to face game as people who live on opposite sides of the planet can get.Fantasy Grounds isn't always the easiest program to use, admittedly, but once you get over the learning curve it's an amazingly robust program.  As the GM, the ability to create (or in my case, input from the Campaign Book) the stories and fill them with handy links to maps, npcs, encounters, treasures, and everything else imaginable is incredible.  Even if I was running a face to face game I'd use FG just to organize my notes.  No more need to have reams of paper around or to flip through books.  Just click a link and the thing you need is right there, right away.  It also allows you to keep track of xp earned, separated into story rewards and combat rewards.  You can see what the players have received with just a quick glance.Insofar as Pathfinder is involved, it has loads of free modules to increase this functionality, with everything from a complete list of spells to abilities, magic items, and the entire collected bestiary (including monsters and NPC's from the adventure paths!), all one click away.  This means I'm free to use my planning time to improve on my campaign instead of flip through stuff looking for informaton.  Not only is this a great virtual tabletop, it's a splendid GM tool.  My campaign would be worse if I didn't have all the organizational tools FG provides.There might be other free programs out there, but nothing I've seen has the depth and robustness of FG.  Along with tremendous dev support, I can't recommend FG high enough.TL, DR; Great program, something of a learning curve.  Great for GM's, which is great for players.			"

												You need a deep wallet to play this game. I downloaded this game in hopes I could use this to DM a local group. Since we are just getting started I thought it would be nice to have a program that would show us the rules and do some of the math for us. I purchased a liscense thinking 40 bucks is a lot, but since its a one time fee it would be fine. I got into the game and found that all the features that seemed useful were behind a second paywall. I've requested a refund and would not suggest this product especially if you are just getting started like us.			"

												I received this game as part of a four-pack. Initially, I was excited by the concept and impressed by the interface. I thought Fantasy Grounds was everything I'd need not only to keep track of my characters, but to play campaigns online with friends. Then, I discovered the trap. Fantasy Grounds comes at a high cost of ~$40- but the character creation feature is severely limited. You don't even get all of the options in the 5e PHB, for example. To get everything in the PHB, you need to spend an ADDITIONAL high cost. While I was excited about the product, I would not recommend this to anyone at all. $40 for a fraction of what you need to get started isn't worth it.			"

												To DM this you have to learn some things but once you learn it.  You can make games so very easily.  5th Edition D and D is very easily done up here.  Absolutely one of the best programs I have ever seen for playing pen and paper roleplaying games over the internet. The demo version is fine if your DM has the Ultimate version of the software, which many I know do (myself included). The price-tag is a bit steep, and the learning curve does exist, but once you get rolling it becomes a train of fun with no end.Think about it this way: A new video game comes out, you nab it for 60USD or whatever. You can pay for FG and any suppliments you require, and have unlimited fun, barred only by your own imagination.			"

												I have had this for about a month now, it is a bit of a learning curve but otherwise easy to pickup and a great tool for DMs. Those of you who just want to play go to the Fantasy Grounds forums before buying and get into a game with an Ultimate DM and you can play using the free trial version. Full License is really only need for those who want to Make their own Games and play with anyone not a free trial member. The only difference from Ultimate is Ultimate can host a game for Free trial people. Keep in mind you have to schedule games on a forum somewhere to actually play this.There are a couple really active and it is really easy to join a game so do not let that discourage you.			"

												I own the full version of FG since shortly before the Steam Launch. I think it is very important to realize that Fantasy Grounds by itself is not a full game - it is a tool and might be better fitting for the Software Section of Steam rather than the Games section.There is a high learning curve to the game for a Game Master. It takes a few hours to get used to the rules sets, the various tools provided and all the little things you need to consider. Once you do spend these hours to familiarize yourself you have a powerful tool to handle campaigns, battle maps and characters.We started playing Savage Worlds in Fantasy Grounds and are having a blast. As an experienced pen & paper player, I have to say that gameplay is actually sped up by the tools provided, allowing us more time to actually roleplay and less time discussing rules, piece positioning or anything else.If you are willing to tackle the initial learning curve and understand that FG is more a tool than it is a game, I can highly recommend it to you. If you are expecting a highly interactive video game however, you might want to direct your attention towards Divinity: Original Sin or something similiar.			"

												No question at all if you play any kind of Fantasy or other Pen and Paper game and you find that you can't get a group together round the table then you have to have this product. It allows you to set up combat encounters, treasure parcels, handouts and everything else that you could want. You can automate combat, spells and many other aspects of whatever game you play and build up your characters by drag and dropping.It doesn't completely automate everything and the character sheets are not fully fledged character builders such as HeroLab but what it does do it does exceedingly well. A huge feather in Smiteworks cap is it's collaboration with Wizard of the Coast which means that 5th Edition D&D is fully available through the program.It's brilliant stuff and has allowed me to revive my playing group which became geographically scattered and we're back playing Fantasy RPG's again, and it's even better than playing on a real table.

												Negatives: The interface does have a bit of a learning curve.The network functions take some setting up if you want to GM a game, and you'll probably have to open a port on your router - this will require a little bit of technical knowledge, but if you are into GMing RPGs via the Internet, you probably can handle this.No built-in voice chat or video.Costs money.On all these counts its main competitor (Roll20) is vastly superior.Howver, if you want to play tabletop RPGs via the Internet, and you're prepared to pay for it, this is still definitely the way to go. Why?Positives:Built-in (free) rulesets for several popular games, including D&D 3.5, Pathfinder, Numenera, etc.Official support for D&D 5 Edition, and all its suplements and adventures.Loads more rulesets, adventures, and community modules available - in particular I would highly recommend the Savage Worlds ruleset, it works amazingly well if you want something that's not standard D&D.Drag & drop between rulesets, character sheets etc. Drag a skill from the rulebook to your character sheet - bingo, it is automatically set up for you. Drag your character's weapon on to an enemy token - combat modifiers are all automatically applied and damage calculated. This feature alone is worth the price of admission. I can't emphasise too highly just how great this feature is. Once you've tried it, there's no going back.Roll20 and other competitors are free(ish) so why would you pay for this instead? I was originally GMing using Roll20, but I quickly found that to do anything interesting with it I needed to subscribe. And a year's sub ended up costing me more than buying Fantasy Grounds would. So in the end I dropped my Roll20 sub and switched to this, and it actually works out to be much better value for money.This is definitely far and away the best solution if you want to get the true pen & paper expereince over the Internet. I can't recommend it highly enough.Note for Mac users: DO buy the Steam version of the main game, it's by far the easiest way to get it working on a Mac. However do NOT buy the DLC on Steam, none of them will work on Mac. Buy the DLC using the Store button in Fantasy Grounds itself, that WILL work.			"

												There's two common threads in many (not all -some have legit gripes) of the negative reviews of Fantasy Grounds: First, the user doesn't bother learning how to use the software, then complains that it doesn't do much for the cost.Second, the buyer doesn't understand the licensing (specifically, WotC stuff), and is somehow surprised when they don't gain access to the entire PHB, DMG, MM, and published adventures with all of their art, rules, statblocks, etc. for a pittence of what the actual books cost. Part of this is also not understanding just what porting that content to FG does for them. You'd be paying for the rulebooks or adventure books if you weren't playing a VTT or if you were playing on any other VTT. I don't understand why people think they should for some reason be free when in digital form. If you already own the physical books, you can manually enter all that information into FG. You don't need to re-buy it. And you'd be doing this for every other VTT anyway, WITHOUT Fantasy Ground's automated functionality. So you don't need to buy the WotC FG versions if you already own the books. You'll just need to manually enter the stuff -just like playing on paper. If you want the automated functionality for an official licensed product, you're going to pay for it. And WotC has decided that the cost for those are the same as the books (they set the prices, not SmiteWorks). I put the entire Pathfinder Beginner Box into FG using nothing but OGL libraries and the official PDF from Paizo.Fantasy Grounds is a TOOL. It's not a published game. It's not a published adventure. It's very much like Roll20 or MapTools. You are not getting a complete, ready-to-play Tabletop RPG when you get Fantasy Grounds. Several reviewers also seem to not understant this. It's Virtual Tabletop Software designed to facilitate playing P&P RPGs. You must still know the rules of the game and have many of the resources you'd need to play the game face-to-face (like the battlemaps, player handouts, etc.). Where Fantasy Grounds shines is incorporating that information into the program itself. You want to add a monster to the battle? Drag it from the MM to the combat tracker -now your monster with all its stats, attacks, and everything else is available right in front of you. Want to add a spell to your wizard? Drag it from the integrated rulebook onto your character sheet, and FG automatically sets the proper dice/bonuses for casting/attack, saves, DR, etc. based on the information in the spell stat block. You can click on the spell and have instant access to all of the spells relevant stats and description -all within the program. THAT is the functionality you pay for when you buy an official WotC rulebook. You have the entire MM at your fingertips with everything you need. Character sheets are updated automatically and re-calculated on the fly (great for things like ability damage).  FG automates many die rolls, so an attack roll boils down to selecting your target and rolling for your attack. Modifiers for size, ability scores, cover, and other conditions and effects are automatically applied. If you hit, simply roll damage and the likewise the correct modifiers are applied and damage the target. This even compensates for different weapon types and resistences. If you roll a threat, it will automatically roll to confirm a crit, then automatically double your damage roll if you get a crit. Stuff like that. In other VTT tools, it's ALL on the GM and players to do that.There's tons of different ways Fantasy Grounds makes life easier for both the GM and players. From automating common functions to cross-linking notes, maps and images. With the proper libraries a GM can convert a published adventure from paper to FG in an afternoon, and never have to reference anything outside the program while playing.It's that kind of automated functionality you pay for with Fantasy Grounds, and that kind of functionality does not exist in Roll20 or Maptools (my current favorite is the Barbarian Rage ability from PF -you can re-calculate the character stats, or just add the ""Rage"" condition, specify the duration, and FG does all the work for you). And the GM can still override everything, so you can easily houserule your own stuff into supported rulesets (or fix things when your players click the wrong thing or forget to add a modifier or something).And if you play 3.5 or PF, you're in luck -the entire rulesets are OGL so you don't have to buy anything else. 5e can get a little pricey, since WotC sets the costs for VTT content and they've decided to make it the same as the published books. But, the advantage being, all the content in the books is available and ready to use in FG.FG is a massive, massive time saver. Both in preparation and playing. Using all of that functionality does require one to LEARN how to use the software. This is a very complex program hidden under a fairly decent UI. Don't expect to DL the software, spend 30 minutes clicking around, and expect to use it perfectly for your session with friends later that night. Going back to my very first point in the review, quite a few of the negative reviews state the program doesn't do things it CLEARLY does -simply because the reviewer never bothered to take the time to learn how to use the software. Now, TBF, if you're NOT using a supported ruleset (Rolemaster, D&D 3.5/4/5, PF, Savage Worlds, etc). the argument for using FG over some other solutions is harder to make. The program is older (the codebase goes back to 2004), and it's starting to show its age in some areas. The UI is clean pretty good once you get used to it (I really love the radial menu, personally), but without proper dual moniter support you really need a lot of single-screen real-estate, otherwise things start to feel crammed a bit. The program is a bit of a resource hog, particularily on memory. Those with slower or older computers -especially ones without a dedicated GPU- may notice performance issues. There's some neat features in Roll20 that don't exist in FG, like dynamic lighting. This will be added to FG when SmiteWorks finishes the Unity re-write -set sometime for release next year (it's worth noting that the full re-write of FG is being designed to be fully backward compatible with existing FG content).There are occaisonal disconnects from players when playing. Usually the program reconnects on its own without issue. Considering Roll20 requires a 3rd part service to use that does go down on occaision and FG does not, I don't see that as a big problem.I've noticed a few other little quirks in the different rulesets, but nothing that causes problems when gaming.TL;DR: If you're using a supported ruleset FG is the best VTT out there. Bar none.EDIT: Oops'd a word or three.Also thought I'd clear up some of the cost stuff, since many people are confused:FREE License - Allows players to manage characters for various rulesets, as well as connect to games hosted by Ultimate License.Standard License ($40 USD) - Allows you to create and manage characters and campaigns, host games for Standard and Ultimate license holders, and connect to games hosted by Standard or Ultimate license holders, INCLUDED RULESETS: 3.5E, 4E, 5E SRD Content, FATECore, PFRPG, Numenera. Ultimate License ($150 USD) - As per Standard, but can also host games for FREE license holders. So you can easily play D&D 5E games with the Standard or Ultimate License, so long as it's SRD content. This is basic ruleset functionality -if you want all of the automated functions (like being able to drag a fully-functional monster from the MM onto the combat tracker) you'll need to enter the statblock yourself, or buy the associated FG rulebook. Likewise with the adventure modules.3.5 and PF are fully functional, and there are many community made modules that include the content of the official PRD and d20fsprd.			"

												I've been playing tabletop RPGs online since 2006. I have gone through nearly every pay product and user creation that's hit the internet in that time. I would like to think that if there’s anyone that could compare the products available right now, it would be me. That being said, Fantasy Grounds is my client of choice. Let me give you a few reasons…Rules Automation:In other Virtual Tabletops (hereafter VTTs) when you roll the dice that’s the end of it. You have to go look up the AC of the target, check it vs. the roll, make sure if there is cover, or if the target is prone you add those in to see if you hit. There’s room for error and everyone is waiting on you to give them the result of the roll.In Fantasy Grounds when you roll to hit, the program tells you immediately. You’re not waiting, there are no math errors, it’s immediate, it’s correct, and you’re on to the next turn. Faster rolls to hit, means more gaming, and more fun.System Libraries:Again, in other VTTs you’re face down in your books or PDFs looking for what Burning Hands does. Did they save? How much damage does it do? Does your character even have it.In Fantasy Grounds you know your character has it because it’s right there in the game on your in-game character sheet. You know its range because the in-game library you dragged it from included that information. It also included how much damage it does, what the save DC is, and how many times your character can cast it. In fact, if you include what I said above about Rules Automation, you can just click on it and it casts it on the enemy, tells you if they saved and then you can roll damage with again, just a click. Easy, Fast, and Accurate to the rules you are playing.Professional DevelopersSome VTTs are community projects. Amateurs banding together to make a program. The energy is great when it's new and everyone has input and it feels great to be a part of it. But once things are done and it's out, someone needs to do the boring part and support it, answer nagging questions and be the guy that all the newbies turn to. This isn't nearly as fun as making the game, so some groups just don't do it, or turn it over to other users. It's also at this point that all those little bugs those users are telling you about need to be fixed. This is maintenance and its not fun either. People tend to let that go, and just run it with the problems and work around them. Worse yet, many VTTs are based on another platform they don't control, Java, or a web browser means some other software could be causing the problem with your game. Java, and The Browser makers don't care about your game problem, and the VTT makers will just say it's Java's fault... or it's your browsers fault, and shrug when you have a problem.Fantasy Grounds is a professional team that stands by their product. They have an excellent bug testing procedure and plenty of people willing to run the betas before a patch comes out. The developers are given enough time to test thoroughly and they are good at debugging. Even the other pay to play VTTs have companies that just patch, patch, patch and end up with bug forums filled with customers with problems after every buggy patch. Fantasy Ground's patches are clean and professional. Also, Fantasy Grounds is stand-alone. Everything Fantasy Grounds needs to run is made and maintained by Smiteworks. There is no passing of the buck when you have a problem.My Work is Mine:When I make map in some VTTs it becomes theirs. I have to keep paying subscription fees to keep that map… I MADE. This is unacceptable. It is my work, I should always have that available. If I make my own adventure. I should always be able to run it for my friends. It’s my creation, you can’t keep it from me just because I didn’t want to pay my subscription, again… (and again, and again)The art, story text, tokens, and everything else in Fantasy Grounds is YOURS. It’s your creation, it’s your Intellectual Property (I.P.) and every law in most lands respects that. Did you know if you create a story you automatically have it copyrighted? It’s yours it came from your imaginative brain. You own it. Fantasy Grounds respects that, other VTTs don’t and hold your creations ransom for more subscription payments. With Fantasy Grounds you’ll ALWAYS have access to your creations.I Control My Wallet!:You should decide when you want a new feature, you should decide when you want a new ruleset, or adventure, or art pack, YOU! There should be no subscription. You shouldn't have some company reaching into your wallet every month controlling your finances. You shouldn't have to tell your group that the game is on hold this month because you got a new credit card and there was a problem with moving your subscription over to the new card. Don’t you have enough subscriptions as it is? TV, Internet? Phone? MMOs? Now even single-player computer games are getting in on this? Enough is enough with the subscriptions!With Fantasy Grounds whatever you buy, you can use in perpetuity. There will be no recurring fees to continue to use what you already paid for. Nobody will be reaching into your wallet deciding when you need to pay them money. That is entirely up to you. For example, if I had bought another web-based VTT that charges subscriptions back when I bought Fantasy Grounds in 2006, I would currently be $960 in the hole with them, and if I ever stopped paying them, all my work would be gone.Conclusion$40 (on sale now for $30) for a lifetime of gaming fun isn’t such a bad deal after all, is it? Free yourself from fees, pick Fantasy Grounds run the fastest, most professionally made game and say no to VTT companies digging around in your bank account every month.			"

												After months of teetering between Roll20 and Fantasy Grounds, I caught a video of a comparison between the two and the host actually worked at creating a this is what one has this is what the other has compared to this is better than that type.   Let's Compare Roll20 & Fantasy Grounds ""What Do Both Of These Virtual TableTops Have To Offer?"" and it convinced me to select FG as my Virtual Tabletop.  FG has a lot of tutorial videos out there to help in figuring out how to use it and I'm watching those to get a better understanding.  While yes, there are things lacking with FG, like integrated video and audio, there are ways around that.  People have used alternatives over what various game developers have created.  The community is great, a lot better than I got with Roll20.  Tried to PM a Roll20Dev about an email issue I had and never got a response back.  Plus, FG has Hero Lab integration, which is another RP tool that I use.  Normally I teeter after my choice, but the video planted firmly in my mind about the decision.  Sure I still like Roll20, but FG is my VTT of choice.--------So it's been almost a year since I wrote the above review, and I still recommend the platform, and I've invested heavily into it.			"

												I'll spare everyone the long and articulate review. If you play D&D, chances are you're a capable and proficient reader and/or writer. There are a plethora of informative reviews that you can peruse if you want highly detailed and microscopic introspections into whether or not SmiteWorks deserve your money.To be extremely brief:1. This program is extremely intuitive and convenient (more so than other programs of its type). If it seems too complicated, don't worry. Just stick with it. Almost all good things in life require *some* degree of time investment and energy. Does it seem too simplistic? Don't worry, its not.2. Yes, its a bit on the pricy side. Was it worth it? My playtime should give you the answer.Most importantly...3. My closest friends and I are now scattered thousands of miles away from one another. Fantasy Grounds lets us meet up every Saturday morning to slay overpowered homebrewed fiends using overpowered homebrewed abilities, debate the ethics of murdering Chaotic Evil demihuman adolescents and partake in solving simple problems with incredibly over-complex (and usually foolhardy) solutions.Fantasy Grounds has given my friends and I hundreds of hours of laughs and enjoyment. SmiteWorks deserves every single yen that I've thrown at them.			"

												I bought the Ultimate Edition and I am very pleased that I can host a session for my friends, who can enjoy the fun for free, just installing the demo version of fantasy grounds. That is a really cool license policy, thumbs up!At the moment we play deadlands:reloaded and this tool works like a charm. It really helps me as gm to keep control and overview of many little things you have to do as gm. Fights are easily handled with all the little things that can occur like health changes, ammo usage, initiative changes, recover rolls and, and, and. I could go on but I think I made myself clear.The ability to share some information for the players and keep others for myself is wonderful. You can load easily own images and maps, so you are not forced to buy them from the company. But you know what I did it with some maps already because I want to support this cool license policy and the openess of this tool. Maps can be revealed step by step, fantastic.You can also write your own module, which is not an easy task, but the fact that the makers gives us the oppertunity is nice.If you like roleplaying and you have friends that cannot come together in real, because life has shattered them around the globe or country (or other reasons), this tool is really a must have in my view.

												Well this is a waste of money. Read very carefully. You are only getting a little bit for the base program. If you want to actually have access to the full system, you are paying double what you see. It is not what I was expecting. Look through all the DLC and add it up before you buy it. For me, it would cost 80$ for each person that wanted in, and as the GM, more for me. The base program offers little that I cannot get elsewhere for free.			"

												Fantasy Grounds is honestly too complex and unautomated like a computer program should be. The developers of this game placed a 40 dollar price tag on a game that's worth easily 15 dollars max. There is a website called Roll20 and it is pretty much Fantasy Grounds with much more customization, but here's the kicker, IT'S FREE! The DLC price is outrages, with a 40 dollar game i expect much more content rule set wise. Some of the DLC is nearly half the price of the game, i could find a PDF of a rule set online for free. Overall i do not suggest it.			"

												Pros:Fantasy Grounds contains the basic portion of everything you want this type of product to have.  Cons:The core/basic version is very limited.  You get the core.  Just enough to make basic functions workThe system is extremely clunky and frustrating.  If I could make that any more bold, I would.  Simply navigating the maps is counter intuitive to how modern technology works.  It feels as if someone took a Windows 95 program and tried to polish it up to make it ""Working."" Any additional content upgrades are extremely expensive:The ""Ultimate"" or ""Ultimate Upgrade"" (if you already have Core) starts at $115 for few additional featuresEach module is nearly, if not more expensive than the official productHonestly, if this was reasonably priced, I would probably recommend it, just because, in theory, it has everything right there.  But considering that there are online websites that provide almost all of these features for free, it's absurd.  I sincerely want to like this product, but get angry every time I use it.  It just barely works.  Once you get started, it's usually alright, but again, navigating the maps, zooming, moving tokens, using tools, drawing, erasing,  all  of those features are clunky, at best.  I hate saying it, because I love supporting those who try to make a living doing what they love, stuff like this.  I just can't support this.  I use it, because I already purchased it, but I'd not recommend it to anyone else.@damned (since I can't make a post this long, and the information might be helpful to others, I'm posting it up here)Hey there!  I'm sure there are a few tips or tricks to help a couple different things out, but honestly, I have two main complaints.  And maybe I should elaborate a little bit on them.1) The price gouging is extreme.  Why does this bother me so much?  Maybe these devs put their lives into this and this is how they make money, why should they be denied their income?  These are very valid questions.  I feel that for certain communities, such as D&D, Pathfinder, Tabletop games, board games, things like that, things that are centered around gathering your friends together and enjoying an experience that is completely unique, things that I hold dear, good publishing work, or good development material is rare.  I feel that it's extremely important to support these devs and publishers because without our support, how can they dedicate the time required to truly polish something that we're going to spend hours with our friends?  They can't, so we have to support them in some way or other.If you look at Paizo's model, most of their stuff is flat out free.  Obviously, they have stuff that you can add on, but the game itself is absolutely free.  All the information is available on Paizo.com or on d20.  But, because of this, it draws people in, and they see it's (generally) a kind community, full of helpful people and devs.  This is the kind of people I will support, and frankly, enjoy supporting.  Fantasy Ground's model is price gouging.  They get you started on a ""Core"" version, which is exactly what it says it is.  It's the core.  Completely playable, but with few bonuses or perks.  $115 for an upgrade, or $149 for the ultimate without the core, is absurd.  Okay, so maybe it's not the worst thing in the world to have expensive pieces.  But, before I consede that, there's a caveat to this, which leads me to my second main complaint.2) It would be one thing if the game and all of it's addons were inexpensive.  Given they're not, I absolutely expect (if not demand?) a polished, complete, modern software system.  It is far from it.  Every time myself, or my wife go to play, we find something else annoying about this program.  Yes, there are ""Tips and Tricks.""  Good software does not require either of those.  It's free from it because it works extremely well from the start.  Take PCGen.  It's great software, it has a lot of minor issues.  It's also 100% free.  For everything.  Is the fact that it's built from Java annoying?  A tiny bit.  But I absolutely can't complain much because it's free. And, it offers quite a lot.To elaborate on what I don't like about this software:It has *almost everything* I actually want in this system.  But it's done so poorly, that time is taken from sessions just to get the stupid thing to work.  Want to move the map around?  You have a tiny piece in the bottom right corner, and holding that is the only way to move the visible map.  Want to zoom in and out?  Use the scroll wheel, at least until it starts moving the map for you, unwantedly.  Want to move a token?  Better hope that some of the tokens aren't overlapping, or you're going to have to move the top one out of the way, grab the second, then move the first back into place again.  Also frustrating is *how* the options for drawing, erasing, adding effects (cones and such), and removing those work.  It's just slow, painful and not for the faint of heart.  the program is full of stuff like this, where it just feels like, ""Yes, this idea, pure brilliance.  Execution?  Absolutely terrible.""  I honestly feel like it's worse than a poorly done Square Enix port of a playstation game onto Windows.  They can brighten up the graphics, they can polish here and there (because fantasy grounds is by no means ugly at all.  It has quite a nice look to it).  But the *mechanics* are so terrible.A side complaint I personally experienced, but to know, I may have been going about it incorrectly, was a situation where I had two computers trying to connect to a third host inside my own house.  Not all modems have the capability of setting more than one Port Forwarding to the same IP address.  Now, I know most of you will just say, ""That's your fault for having such a crappy modem!""  This is only partially true.  While I absolutely agree and often pay more for better internet and equipment (I'm in Networking, so I like this kind of stuff), if my ISP only has one option, and this ISP is the ONLY option in my current area, and is in a foreign country temporarily, there's just a limit to what one can do sometimes.  I tried adding a router, and setting it up.  I tried going through another computer, which distributed it's IP as the host, to no avail.  Could only get one to work, and not the other.  Like I said, I could have done something wrong, and probably was, but I only have so much time to research and troubleshoot before my guests have wasted a couple hours waiting for a session to start.  ""You only had to do this and this!""  Yeah, I get it, but you know what?  I didn't know it, and I don't always have an hour or two to find that resource to tell me exactly what it is.All in all,I really, *really* want to like this product.  Every time I go to use it, I'm conflicted.  It has great options, and great content, even in Core.  But, it's just done so poorly that I can barely stand it. "

												I've been using Fantasy Grounds to run games for five years now.  During that time I've played with dozens of people from all over the world and even managed to reunite with my old group from the 90's. It does have a learning curve especially if you're the GM but over the years a large amount of tutorial videos and manuals have been released by the community so you will become a pro in no time. This software never ceases to amaze me! You get everything you need that you would use in real life except voice chat and SFX of soda bottles opening and snack bags crumpling. And that without the need to toggle back and forth between windows. Some rulesets will offer the books in the library. You get free beautiful tokens/miniatures too! As for maps, you can use any jpeg/png image you want, character sheet are automated so no need to create custom macros (even though the option is there for you to create macros and conveniently drop them in your hotkey bars). Prep time for the GM is cut down by using reference modules, just drag and drop what you need on the map and combat tracker! You can organize your campaign however way you want. Everybody on the official forum is very helpful and if you have a problem someone will rise up to help you fix it. People are creating free custom content every week, they work hard at it because they are passionate and we are so grateful for their work.Whether you're new to the hobby or an old timer like me looking to rekindle your passion for the hobby you will find what you need with this software. What's $40/$150 for a game you will play for years and pour countless hours into? Some of you probably spend $60-$80 on a game you'll play for less than 60 hours.			"

												Context for myself:Been using FG for four years (maybe 5).Am a ultimate license holder, and I GM multiple games using it.Also experienced the player side and have played in multiple games.Have used other vtt's; battlegrounds (shudder) and roll20.Fantasy Grounds is by far the best virtual tabletop program on the market.Sadly, that statement means very little. If I was to ask someone who was semi-aware of their options, they'd probably name Roll20, and not realize that Fantasy Grounds even existed.That is the extent of the competition sadly, while the others are not worth mentioning if you are serious about getting into a online game either as a player or a GM.While this review is about FG, I will give mention to Roll20 only so I can accurately compare the two.FG Pros:Cleaner Interface - This is the most important aspect, second only to online functionality. Having a nice clean attractive interface is a massive bonus. FG achieves this and is highly regarded as the vtt with the best interface. I've got players who have experienced the roll20 side of things (including myself) and it is just far superior and easier to manage your characters, dice rolls and other essentials.Functionality - FG has nice and easy placement of hotkey management via a hotbar at the bottom for quick and easy dice rolls. It's dice mechanics are realistic and impressive. Character sheets are clean with easy to navigate tabs, compared to the horrendous sheets of roll20.Automation - FG's official rulesets, namely DnD ones, are mostly automated. There will always be a need for manual input in some from the GM so do not go into FG expecting a sophisticated automated ruleset. It can't function without a GM after all! Whole point of the automation here however is to act as an aid and for ease of use, and I have personally found it very helpful.Chat function - Chatbar is nice and usually lagfree. It also features (in some rulesets, not all) a language function. Can your character speak draconic? Well if he can, and if someone spoke in draconic using the language extension in chat, only he will be able to understand it. Very nifty!Ruleset Selection - FG has a nice selection of rulesets ranging from the official ones to the free community ones that don't cost a cent. The official ones also have extensions (mods basically) that add further features. Cons:Memory - FG uses a lot of memory if you plan on using some of the big rulesets like DnD. It's memory footprint will be around 4gb (my average) which is no big deal, right? If you start adding tokens and lots of handouts/images, expect the footprint to increase tenfold. I had it reaching 8gb at one stage, and not because I had 8gb worth of stuff in FG, I didn't. But FG's memory management isn't great. A work-around to this is to simply have your tokens outside of FG and only import a few that are essential, and keep the rest out until you need them. But this is not a solution I personally like cause I run multiple games, and you can imagine the headache in having to insert and remove tokens from time to time.Program Crashing/Masking - FG thankfully doesn't experience much lag. And comparing it to roll20, its far less troublesome. But using the inbuilt Masking feature could be asking for trouble. It is usually fine on small maps (I mean like, really tiny maps) but FG has trouble handling big map files, even ones that meet the recommended sizes for FG. Masking isn't done well in FG, and FG does not have a dynamic fog of war/lighting system like Roll20 has. From to time, using the masking feature can crash your program. A bloody pain in the middle of a session!Networking.Mapping - This ties into the above. FG should never limit the ambition of a GM through the limits of its program. Unfortuntely it does, rarely but it happens. Want a nice big dungeon map? Well, you might want to tone it down a bit. Coupled with FG's bad memory management and ability to handle large image files, it can get very crash-happy. Fortuntely for myself I have found the sweet spot to stop this from happening (most of the time) but it does happen now and aagain.Price Point - This is something that nearly every review points out as a con/negative. It's nice that FG is free if you can bag a game with an ultimate licensed GM (if he doesn't ask you to pay/sub!) but if you plan to GM yourself, having an ultimate license is more or less required. The other licenses are in a sense, a waste of time. The standard license is basic and simply requires that all those who are going to play, pay the same cost. Far as I'm aware, you don't get any of the dnd rulesets as you do with the ultimate, and I don't think there is any limitation on players (could be wrong). I've often heard it stated both officially and non-officially that the price of the FG Ultimate License is good value. Most common arguement for this is that you save a lot of money in terms of the books or PDF's you'd fork out otherwise.  I disagree.Lets use DnD as an example; Nearly all the core set (players handbook, monsters guide, core rules, etc) can be gotten around 30 dollars (quick check on amazon showed some at 24 etc). Lets not rule out buying second hand books in good condition, plenty can be found on Ebay and such and great deals can be found. In total, could end up forking out around 60-80 for a complete core set. If you don't shop around and just impulse buy, lets increase that to around 110, there abouts. FG costs 149, for the ultimate edition and I'm not even going to bring in the subscription options cause you'll only end up wasting money on that in the long run, so lets keep it practical. With the ultimate edition, you might think your getting a good deal with it including all the dnd rulesets and pathfinder. That's what I thought, originally. However let me point out that they only include the SRD content. Not ideal, not at all if you plan to be serious about running a long-term game. That means you'll have to digitally buy the Core Class pack which is 49,99, the complete core monster pack which is the same price, and the other modules are priced around the same. Your paying a higher mark-up for them than book format, which makes sense; after all these modules contain a lot of handy VTT features to make your life easier. Add all that on TOP of your ultimate license fee, and your well over the 200 mark already. Get me?I would argue that the price point is good value only if the dnd rulesets didn't contain limited content such as the SRD, which is not practical as I said for gming a long game. I do understand why the price point is what it is, I just don't agree with it, nor do I see it as good value.Competition is sadly lacking however. Roll20 is certainly more mainstream (cause its free) and FG is only just starting to break the market. But it's high price point is a deterent for many who prefer to go to Roll20. Hopefully in time more VTT's will come available and that might put extra pressure on FG to change its ways. I'd even argue that the upcoming future unity update could see changes in this regard.Another issue I want to mention before I call it on this review is the very confusing marketing of FG. I've lost count of how many times I've heard a new player not familiar with FG get confuse over their license functionality and purpose. I've had more than one player who I was in the process of recruiting for my game say to me they are not interested cause they have to pay for FG. Then I have to point out in detail why they do not, and that having an ultimate license negates their need to pay. Not to mention FG's 'demo' version is highly confusing, labeled wrong and I've often had to explain the function of FG's free version. Their other licenses don't do a great job at explaining their differences either and can be somewhat misleading.All-in-all I do recommend FG, believe it or not! It's not perfect, it has a long way to go, but its the best VTT around.			"

												I'm an Ultimate license holder and I've run a couple of adventures using D&D 3.5 and PF with a group of 4 players talking with Skype for over 2 years, long before this product was available on Steam.  I absolutely love working with Fantasy Grounds.  Having looked at other competing products, nothing came close to packaging everything for the particular ruleset I was using all in one PLUS still allowed me full free form editing when needed.  Being able to add in library modules of rules, including spells and equipment, that you can simply drag onto your character sheet and have it automatically populate the stats is so convenient!  A player doesn't have to remember how things work or worry about making sure the right saves / resists are applied, etc.  It's all automatic!There have been continual improvements to the product since I began using it which greater and greater features added each time.  Full table support for designing random search and loot tables or anything else you want to roll randomly is such a help.  One of the best things is the combat tracker which can link to your ""map"" image that you are using for moving tokens around.  It keeps track of current initiative order, heath and conditions affecting each entity, quick look at weapons being used or saving throw values, and can be used for quick targetting for players wanting to drag attack dice directly onto the monster entry.  You can show/hide entries on the combat tracker which when linked to their token on the ""map"" image lets the DM setup surprise encounters that players can't see until you spring it.There are so many things that make using Fantasy Grounds the closest thing to being around the physical table in my mind that it makes gaming feel like ""the old days"" again.  With the official D&D license from WotC, it has allowed Smiteworks to enhance their product by releasing official 5E products for use directly within Fantasy Grounds.  While none of these are needed to play a 5E game, you are always free to add data in by hand from your hard cover books, it does help streamline game play by saving you the time of entry letting you just drag and drop and the products are very well done.Thank you Smiteworks for letting me recapture the passion for fantasy gaming that I grew up with!

												Fantasy Grounds is a great tool for role playing online.When I first tried it, I have to admit, I was a bit overwhelmed.  It has a lot of bells and whistles, a lot of things you can do with it, a lot of automation you can use.  It was a bit of a learning curve, but once I got used to it and played around with it, I was impressed with what you could do with it.Note:  I found Digital Dungeon Master on YouTube to be extremely helpful when learning how to use it.  He has a lot of tutorials available on his channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCzRjU07iEZga5dxZOEpE1dQWhile it may be considered a bit on the pricy side, it's price is very comperable to the cost of the books you would normally be buying to play the games, it gets updated quite often, and if you simply don't want to pay for it - download the trial, and play with a game master that has an Ultimate License.  That gives you a fully functioning client and you play for free.  The amount of built in tools and automation for games like D&D 5e is amazing as well.  You can use as much or as little as you like.  The conversions I have purchased have been very well done and worth the money I paid for it.  Having everything ready for me in the program, but fully modifyable is very much worth it.If you decide to give it a try, do yourself a favor and go to the forums and get involved.  There are a lot of great people that play, there are events like FG Con, and lots going on that you can be a part of.As someone that doesn't have the ability to sit down around a gaming table with a group irl much anymore, this has allowed me to enjoy one of my favorite pasttimes again.  If you are a tabletop rpg enthusiast, I highly recommend it.			"

												Last night we began our first session using Fantasy Grounds. I have previously been using another VTT to GM our Kingmaker campaign however I advised my players we would be migrating to FG at the beginning of chapter 2 to see how FG compares to the other VTT.So - How did it go?As a GM I have been impacted by the learning curve somewhat, but not to the point of giving up. The issues I have had learning FG were similar in scope to the learning curve for the previous VTT.I did not have the chance to test out combat before our session kicked off, so it was fairly slow to start. Again, the time taken for our first combat was comparable to our first combat in the old VTT.There were a couple of hiccups at my end due to inexperience. At one point i selected monsters from the bestiary and dropped them on the map, but could not work out how to then get them to the combat tracker. Ended up deleting the tokens, adding the monsters to the combat tracker first, THEN dragging the icons from the combat tracker on to the map. This was for an encounter  I had not prepared earlier, so I am keen to see how the pre-loaded encounters I have input work in actual play.Spells work very differently to our old VTT. In the old VTT we did not trust the spell system at all and most of the spell stuff was handled manually. What a pleasure it was to have FG manage all the heavy lifting for us with regards to the spells and associated effects.Speaking of effects - I think i need more help here. Perhaps I was doing it wrong, but things like Barkskin (Copy pasted from the FG forums here[www.fantasygrounds.com]) did not appear to affect the characters AC. Some of the included effects did appear to work as intended.Maps worked well except for 3 issues:1) Could not work out how to have FG measure player movement during combat (IE - manage how far characters are allowed to move each round). Not sure if there is a way to do this.  2) At one point the map zoomed right in to one area for the PLAYERS only and they could not zoom out. Tried to sync view, re-share etc. In the end I closed the map and re-opened it and that seemed to fix the issue. 3) Seemed that any player could move anyone else's tokens. Is there a way to restrict movement of tokens only to the player who 'owns' the character and the GM? (edit - apparently there is - according to the forums)Libraries took a few minutes to sync (the first time), but hopefully this wont happen every session.So - the bottom line:(TL;DR)My players LOVED IT. Absolutely no question we will be sticking with FG from now on. I took a big chance buying the ultimate licence, but after last night I have NO REGRETS.Thankyou Smiteworks for this great product. Keep up the good work!			"

Posted: February 5
												I have been using FG as a GM for 4 years now - at the table! I know FG is designed largely for online play, but I prefer face-to-face-roleplay and toe-to-toe-combat! My review is in that context and no other.First: My requirements were to have a system that worked off-line.Next I wanted to stop having to carrying around massive books as the game sessions were at a player's houseIt would be cool if it  gave me maps and character placements on themIt needed to allow for story elements and descriptions, I wanted as much as possible of the game mechanic to be automated I desperately needed cross-referencing so I could easily access spell descriptions, item stats, monster stats, etcFinally: If any player was unable to make the session I wanted a means of them joining in fro ma distance.A tall order. So how did FG2 stand up under such pressure?Off-line: FG2 runs perfectly fine off-line. I have found that starting it up at home where I have web access, then driving to the session helps if there's no internet available there. In the past I've had problems - this is most probably because I use the MAC version in Steam.No Books: t allows me to leave most of the books at home. I say 'most' because a lot of the modules I'm running are non-SRD and not yet available as DLC. But with the community (currently) providing loads of extra modules and extensions for my preferred RPG (Pathfinder) and FG's inbuilt module creation facility I can overcome much of that. I still take a rulebook in case a player needs one to refer to but hasn't brought their own. I sometimes bring the Adventure Path with me for just-in-case backup.Maps and Characters: Others have said that FG struggles in the maps area. This is a shame, as this is such a cool feature. However, other than a non-intuitive way of handling images, I've had little ofr no issues with maps. As I'm using them for reference purpose I suppose I'm using low-quality versions. (See later.) I could import maps, place a grid, and place characers on the grid. I still haven't used this feature to it's fullest for a number of reasons. Mainly because I play at the table, I'm forever drawing the map and then the players control their figure. At the end of the session, if the encounter is still active and the positions of pieces is important then I'll take a photo of the table. (Ore even a video!) I'd like to be able to transfer the pieces  to the map in FG and then I wouldn't need the photo! But this means extra work for me - especially as I sometimes change the map as I GM....Characters: FG has a sweet set of Chaarcter sheets that are nicely laid out. I get my players to use PCGEN exports of their characters after they level up and then import them into FG. As we play at the table, I let them use paper copies of tablets. In fact I get them t maintain their own sheets all thetime. If they forget something and suffer for it, they'll learn for next time. If they 'cheat' then they have fun, but will get found out soon enough when I get their elecrronic version. My main point for having characters in FG is to keep tabs on initiative order in the combat tracker - which is superb.Tokens: Placing characters and npc/monsters on the map is simple enough in FG. However, the issue of token images is still a bother for me. I balk at having to pay for these as DLC - but getting my own set up is fine. Caveat: As I play at the table we use mini's or markers so tokens on a map are not such a great deal at the moment. And with FG not providing Line-of-Site or Fog-of-War this part of FG isn't so important.Story: FG has a superb system for story elements allowing for descriptive parts, encounter groupings, and more. It takes a while to get used to, but it's great once you work within its quirkiness. Setting up story elements can be time consuming - DLC saves a tonne of that tedium - but you can add your own encounters, locations, and more. This is one part of FG I rely heavily on. Automation: This is an area of FG that is fantastic and frustrating at the same time. Cross linking to spells, counting wand usage, rolling hit and damage, etc - all is great. But sometimes I want the character sheets and stats to update automatically and FG doesn't always do it. I want to be able to speed through the tedium of combat and skill rolls - sometimes I can, sometimes not. I get frustrated by it at times, but only say 15%. Mostly the players are unaware of what I struggle with. And my GM stye is laid back - sometimes if it's cool and fun I'll allow it. Sometimes if a player is pressing my buttons the wrong way I want a system to put the brakes on.Cross-Referencing: This is great - as long as the info is in the system. You can set up a load of modules that can contain all you want. You have to load the module up before you get to see the info. I sometimes forget, and FG will just sit looking at me and do nothing until I remeber - then it's quick and easy to overcome. Creating your own items, spells, feats, etc is a bit awkward and I'd like to be able to easily insert cross references. As I said earlier, FG has its own system of hyperlinking that could do with some work - but it works. I just want more flexibility.Remote Player: This is an area I haven't had success with. We have one player who is miles away and plays by Skype. Fortunately he's honest enough to own up to his fumles and crits! The major sticking point in FG for me here is connectivity. As I have no access to the modems at the player's house where we meet I cannot set up the connectivity FG wants. Also, the price point for multiple players using FG is prohibitive. Yes, I should get the ultimate version, but I can't justify the expense for one remote player (everyone else is at the table!)Other comments: FG has a great interface but gets cluttered real quick. I want to be able to turn the chat box off altogether, as well as the dice, as they're not used at the table (I roll real dice - the players get jittery if I say I rolled a hit and either they don't see it or even hear the dice clattering!) Map movement and scrolling is awkward. Using a Mac trackpad is a pain as FG will open 'windows' when all I want to do is scroll. Showing players images and handouts is awkward, so I have to prepare those pefore hand. One day I'll get a flat screen set up and lay it out instead of my chessex mat, but then we'll loose the fun of saying 'the white counter with the feather is the undead-orc, remember?!' (And I like the spectacle of the table.)So there we have it. I'm very pleased with FG at the moment and would rate it 9/10. There's room for imrpovement. There's loads I use it for. (If it doesn't run at the table - one week it failed to launch on my MAC notebook - then I'm lost. That's how much I've come to depend on it.) I'm watching the future of FG development closely, especially with the Unity version and their recent partnering with Paizo. Will the price of modules increase? will the community generated material be banned? will we finally get line-of-sight and a decent fog-of-war? will there be a TPK button? (mwa-ha-ha!)FG is highly recommended by me, for use at the table, with your mates, prezels, pizzas and cola's!			"

												I have the ultimate license, so that anyone can play in my games without having to pay a dime (they can use the beta version). It took me over a year to get the courage to try out the program, as it seemed very intimidating, but after I looked at tutorials online and tried it out for myself with some friends, I found that it is very easy and fun to use.I have used this and Roll20, and I must say that Fantasy Grounds is far superior for a number of reasons. First is the price. With Roll20, the free version is okay if you're just a player, but as a DM, you need to upgrade. With Roll20, you don't buy the program and it's yours. Instead, you must ""rent"" it by the month or year with a subscription. With Fantasy Grounds, once you buy it (at once, or through monthly payments), it's yours to keep. One thing I will say about Roll20 is that as it uses Google Hangouts, you can see and hear each other in chat, where Fantasy Grounds does not have a chat function yet. My group uses Razer Comms, a free team voice chat program by the company who makes gaming peripherals. One of the many cool functions is the ability to speak in a racial tongue, and the words will be seem by others who speak the same language. Those who don't will only see strange glyphs which match the language. For example, Dwarvish and Elvish match the runes that were on the code wheel from the original SSI Gold Box game, Pool of Radiance(!). It's got a very nice combat system, where players can simply drop their attack die onto an enemy, and the program will automatically add modifiers, know if they hit, and even deal damage and conditions. It can even do the critical hits and fumbles for you.Something else to keep in mind is that if you want to be the DM, you will have to have at least the $39 version of the game. With that one, you can play in games with others who have paid for the $39 version, as well. If you get the Ultimate license for $149, then you can play in anyone's games, and you can host the game for people with the free demo version. Also, you'll need to purchase the rulesets for the games you want. For example, You can get the D&D 5E basic rules for cheap (or maybe free), but you're better off getting the full core books to get all the races and classes. At about $40 - $50 apiece, it isn't cheap. Also, the official modules cost around $35 each. I will say, as I own all the offical books and modules, that it's worth it in the end. Sure, it's easy to make your own adventures with PDFs and understanding the format, but all the work is done for you with the purchases.All-in-all, it may seem a little costly and intimidating at first, but me and my group who live thousands of miles away are having a blast every Monday night. Your best bet is to get the free trial, watch some of the videos online, and jump in someone's game as an observer. You'll be hooked. Just remember that it isn't a ""video game"" of D&D. It helps keep track of rules, and it's still just a tabletop for playing with friends. Definitely recommended, if you have the extra money.			"

												If you are old like me, pen and paper games were your mmorpgs. You got together with your friends, some pizza, soda, snacks, and a saturday night in a basement. Staying up all night, throwing dice, stepping on miniatures and arguing over rules of the game. As time goes on,  you grow apart from your friends and move to different parts of the world, still missing those Saturday nights rescueing the princess and slaying the dragon. But it's hard to get together. Miles might separate you and family tends to get in the way of such things. Also, where did your wife put the dice? There is a 5th edition now, what happened to 2nd?With Fantasy Grounds, you can have all of your rules, even play the ones you are familiar with and once you find a few hours with your friends, play in the comfort of your own home. My friends and I could never get together to play, but with Fantasy Grounds, we set aside half a day everyother week and recapture our youth. And the program keeps everything so organized and user friendly, not to mention Smiteworks has some of the most efficient and nicest costumer service I have ever seen. I highly recommend this program, even if you have never played table top games before. This would get you playing right away, so if you are curious to how we did mmorpg in the 80's, this is the program for you. Modern tools for the best game world out there... the world of your imagination.			"

												Fantasy Grounds feels old, but it certainly has done well in making running D&D5E games much easier. Certainly not friendly to new users, there are certain quirks that you simply must pay attention to. Some ""order of operations"" are vital in getting the most out of this utility, and while it is expensive if you want ""everything 5E"", you're really only paying $40 for the program, and the prices for the WotC books are pretty much the same as you'd get retail.After running a campaign using Fantasy Grounds, I found that the number of tools useable certainly lets the game move forward.  As a DM, the only real complaint I found myself fighting with was the lack of real-estate on a lower resolution. The tablet I am running this program on runs at 1280x800. While usable, I intend to use a secondary monitor for more space to hold things so I'm not having to shuffle stuff around as if I were playing ""Papers Please"".With an Ultimate License, my players only had to grab the demo version and connect. It was pretty simple on a local network, and most were very positive about it as it let us focus on what was being done and not the actual math behind it all (though at times we did do manual calculations for giggles when manual rolls were desired.)In the end, it let us progress quickly through the game, and I'll happily use it again.

												Steep learning curve, but the community is strong and there are plenty of how-to videos on working with the system. The 5th Ed support is really good, the drag and drop qualities for character sheets speeds up the process quite a bit while enforcing some integrity during character generation. As a DM you can spend quite a lot on this software so that your players, and you, have access to all the monsters, maps, and PHB in-game but for the DM on a budget: you can add in your own NPCs and such manually without having to make the purchases...it'll just cost you time.While it did take time to learn how to use all the tools at my disposal, with a positive group it doesn't make it too rough. I never really had a point where we had to stop the game (for an extended period) to figure out how to accomplish something mechanical, and adding new loot, encounters, and challenges works well on the grid overlay for your maps. Overall it does a good job of giving you the tools and letting you decide how to use them.			"

												If you're not used to playing table top RPGS, the price tag on the base license may seem indimidating at first. It is about what you would pay when purchasing one or two books in any given rule set.Here is what you get with the base license:The ability to connect to any paid license able to host a game.The ability to host any paid license.3.5E rule set with enough open game content to host.4E character sheet and one game module.5E character sheet and basic rules.The core of the d20 rules (CoreRPG).Fate Core SRD ""book"" and character sheetNumenera character sheetPathfinder rule set with enough open game content to host.A default selection of tokensA default selection of portraitsThis does not mean you cannot connect to someone hosting one of the other supported rule sets--or a custom one for that matter. The game masters can and will share the game-specific player content. Thus, only the game masters may actually need to purchase additional content, depending on what they choose to host.Overall, my opinion is that the utility far outweighs the price.			"

I've picked up an additional ruleset and it's great for using offline to get used to the gaming system if you aren't going to be the GM.

												Don't buy this unless you already have a group of friends/people that are willing to buy/play it and/or want to play 3.5/pathfinder.  Those are the only, ok maybe not only, that is pretty much all you will find that are looking for players besides demo/one shots.This game is technically misleading it says it has the rulesets for 3.5/pathfinder and 4E.  That is BULL-SH!T!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Most people see the ""rulesets"" as modules/library, for 4E you have to go to a 3rd party pay a $10 a month for a parser and put the file into the FG or do it by hand.I have been looking for a group for awhile ended up having a dumb♥♥♥♥♥give me a link to pathfinder when I stated I wanted to join only 2 different games and that I didnt want to play pathfinder and/or 3.5.  Ended up that the same guy posted the same god damn thing word for word to maybe a dozen other people looking for a group.  I recommend finding a free program or search online for people to do this over webcam on skype.			"

												I was under the impression that it had D&D 5th edition attached to it already --which is why I bought it for myself and one for a friend...if you look at the first video, you'll see my confusion. Suffice it to say that this is a very modular program, which comes with nothing of real use...until you buy MORE AND MORE AND MORE packs of addons, I don't even think it came with any useful attachments. I think the consumer value of this program would be increased if the customer could select one pack for free...the program costs @$30 and it just sits there. I purchased some of the 5th Edition addons...doubling the price of my investment in this program. I am sorely disappointed in this, and at this time I cannot recommend this program.			"

												The interface is great and well laid out, with the ability to apply a custom skin to enhance the mood. The functionality also matches the interface and is robust and very polished. The way that the adventure planning pieces feed encounter data into the map/tokens and combat tracking is great. I was able to flow seamlessly between narrative time and combat encounters, and as a DM, I had everything I needed where and when I needed it.The combat tracker is basically a one-stop shop for DMs. I can see all the relative stats and statuses for each creature in the encounter, including monster stat blocks. There’s no need for virtual “page flipping” to use multiple creatures, and when presented within the initiative tracker, this makes it very easy to play multiple monsters without slowing down the pace of play. Combined with the easy maps and tokens, FG enables a very smooth encounter management experience, which results in faster, more immersive combats.			"

												For table top simulation, I have found Fantasy Grounds to be the very best. The automation makes combat flow more quickly, modules can be created and shared, features for maps, pooled resources, movement, area of effect, etc., all work quite well.There are free options such as the RPTools suite, but such tools are clumsy, kludgy, prone to breaking, and lack a lot of features. Fantasy Grounds has everything you need in one single application.There's only a few drawbacks:1. The learning curve. You need to spend time with the software to understand how it works. For most people familiar with pen and paper RPGs, spending some time learning isn't a big deal.2. No automated fog of war or light sources. Areas of the map must be revealed manually by the game master. MapTool from RPTools does this, and it would be a great additional feature for FG in the future.3. The built-in rule sets (3.5, PathFinder, 4.0, etc.) work very well, but if you want to customize the rule set or, god forbid, build your own, expect to spend days and weeks mucking about undocumented blobs of XML and Lua. It's a MESS, and even trivial changes can be difficult to implement. I say this as a professional software developer! FG's documentation in this area is appalingly bad.4. Like ANY computer software for running RPGs, GMs with a spontaneous style may feel a bit stifled and limited by the tools.Overall though, Fantasy Grounds is the best of breed for this type of software. If your gaming group is spread far and wide you should definitely give this a try!A hint: Buy your licenses in bulk from the official website. If Steam is ever down or dies or whatever, you can still download and run the software.			"

												I've been a FG user for over 4 years.(I see a lot of misconceptions in the reviews below)This software allows you to play as a player or GM/DM a session over the Internet.Session: An adventure created by the DM/GM that players connect to.The DM/GM puts together his adventure by inserting images/descriptions/ideas into the interface.The Interface can automate a lot of the math involved in hit/miss and damage totals.The concept is to allow a group to enjoy playing a Pen & Paper style Roleplaying game over the Internet.You will need your books or PDF's, although the rulesets in the interface includes a lot of this info.The GM/DM will need to invest some time making an adventure, like he would with a real Pen & Paper Tabletop RPG session.He will then need to insert all the images/maps notes into the session prior to hosting the game.(You can also download/buy ready made adventures as well)(You can pre-make adventures and save them... then activate them in the session as you need)This is not a video game, it needs a GM/DM to set things up first, so the players can play.Now that you have a better idea of what this software is...Fantasy Grounds does an excellent job at automating a lot of your session, Once you watch some videos on how people put together their adventures, you will have the tools to recreate anything you made with Pen & Paper within FG.I think we need to have more videos to explain this a bit more, but what it does, it does GREAT.I've invested more time as both player and DM/GM than any video game I have. I personly use Skype or Teamspeak so we can voice what our character actions are in the game.It allows social interactivity and brain stimulation we so much miss in our computerized world.I recommend trying the free DEMO and hooking up with a DM/GM with an ""Ultimate"" license (because they can let you connect to their game like the paid version).I have tried ALL the tabletop emmulators out there...THIS one is the best.

												A lot of people complain about the price of this game, which I somewhat agree, but in reality if you bought all the books that this game included in the base game for rulesets, it would be way more expensive than this game at full price.Furthermore, no other online pen+paper game captures the ""feel"" of in real life pen+paper to the degree that Fantasy Grounds does, on this account alone it is worth the price if you plan on playing a lot of pen+paper. I've tried all the other free and paid options, and only Fantasy Grounds makes it feel like you playing pen+paper as if doing it IRL with friends.			"

												By far the best VTT software out there and I've used most of them.Fantasy Grounds is the best because it offers the best semi-automatization systems to run some systems that are heavy on mechanics and makes games even easier than as if it was a live game.It does have a high initial cost, but hey you'd pay much more if you had to pay monthly. Would you rather pay $15 monthly to play World of Warcraft or $150 one single time and you can play it forever? I've been using FG since 2009 and every cent I invested on it was worth.			"

												Well I found this neat utility...and I have to say it makes Playing many role playing games alot easier with a computer and at long distances.  I admit I am not used to using such a program....so for me its still a work in progress.  But its potential is limitless for table top gaming.  There are many DLC things available.  The only drawback someone might have might be the costs.Now here is how this program works....you can get it free.....but to utilize alto of features you need to get what is called a gaming liscense.  There are two available...on and beyond just the free version.  One is the standard one....whihc lets you play with allthe stuff and join games online etc....but unless your friends have a standard version they cannot connect to you and let you be a GM.The other liscense is a GM liscense.....this is pretty cool...as it lets anyone even people with the free one join your game and play...they can even get the rules and books you are using....The second one is expensive....but if you like gaming its worth it.Steam has alto of stuff available....and you can get more form their website.One failing is that even though this software supports alot of games....not all games have things available for this utility.....so...you end up having to make your own things....thats if the game is not something you have modules for. I recoomend this program for any gamers who like doing table top role play.....its a useful item. "

My worries were unfounded, it is a story telling game like a RPG should be. My players reside in multiple states and time zones and we play every week vs find new players and start over. I recomend this for any adult who games and finds the travel time and time away from the house/family creates issues, this app will reduce that. 10 of 10			"

												If you enjoyed playing pen&paper, you are gonna LOVE Fantasy Grounds.I\'ve been playing both D&D and Warhammer for about 15 years, i\'ve got every book ever made about the game, and dice in an almost infinite amount of colors. - im a huge fan, and i have strong feelings about this game, since i grew up with it more or less.Pros:-Super efficient.-Removes the need for actual paper and/or books.-Has a nice UI.-Everything is customizable. (atleast to my knowledge)-You make the rules.-Trackers for so many things, like combat, HP, wounds, and loads of other stuff.-Very easy to get into (you might need some port forwarding)-Easy to join/leave lobbys. -After each session you type in \""/save\"" in the chat, and it saves everything everytime.-Never experienced crashes of any kind.Cons:- Fantasy Grounds simply does not work with the steam overlay. (Shift+Tab) and should be deactivated.- If you dont know your way around D&D or similar games, this might be tricky to get into.- Many features and ingame options seems to be somewhat difficult to actually get to, without digging.(by that i mean, some features are kinda hidden within other features and options. - Everything is in the game, you do not lose out on content, but some of the things, to me, was a bit weird to find.- Too expensive. The retail copy sells for €36.99, which is way more than this application is actually worth. Dont get me wrong, i absolutely love it, but no matter how awesome you make books look on a screen, its not worth €37.- As mentioned above, the port forwarding CAN be an issue. Not everyone is experiencing it. What this means, is that your router and/or internet provider does not support certain ports, in this case \""1802\"" in Fantasy Grounds, and you need to manually make an exception for fantasy grounds. This can be done pretty easily. google it.CONCLUSION:This game is so much fun, and despite it having a few things here and there i\'d like changed, its easy to live with.I have grown to love this game, and using my imagination with this game is absolutely amazing.I would 100% 10/10 recommend this to ANYONE who have the slightest interest in D&D and the like.

												I have been using FGII for years now, and I am very excited that it is now on steam. The program, is worth every cent, if you are a true gamer and like RPGs done the way they are meant, then this is the program for you.   Our old gaming group all decided to purchace the program years ago and now every week, we have one game night and we are all scattered across the country. Not bad for a bunch of old guys. And Yes, if you want to make your own rule sets, then you need to learn a little bit of XML and LUA. I know hardly any, and so far I have been able to adapt what rules sets that are out there to what I need! But that this is something you only need to deal with if you really want to make your own. Other then that you are all set to GM or play.  The program is solid, and it really does enchance and capture that around the table roleplay feeling. I love it..   Another thing, that maybe some people may not think about. Is FGII is a program that you can use to even run actuall table top games, and it works like an GM Screen. Great when you run demos of games at events and stuff.But again, the hundreds of hours I have spent on this program doing what I love the most.. its well worth it!! The program is solid, and it really does enchance and capture that around the table roleplay feeling. I love it..   Some of the games and system we run.. Savage Worlds, Dead Lands, Dark Heresy, Black Crusade, Death Watch, GURPS, Star Wars (West End and FFG versions) and Advanced Fighting Fantasy. And that does not even include all the D&D and Pathfinder stuff.  Hope to see around the table.			"

												Absolutely worth the money if you and your gaming group have moved away from each other. I didn't think I was going to play D&D with my old group ever again until we decided to give Fantasy Grounds a try. Despite some of the quirks and the difficult learning curve for more advanced features, anyone familiar with D&D should be able to quickly get a game going. I love being able to create my own campaign and adventure modules. Fantasy Grounds keeps track of things way better than I ever did previously as a DM. There are some great tutorials online covering play and content creation.			"

												Fantasy grounds is pretty darn awesome. It has a couple hiccups, such as needing to make sure you have your permissions set up properly to save your games (which really should just happen but I digress.) The systems are very easy to use. It comes with a very basic layout for many of the most popular RPGs out there. If you have all the info yourself you can put it in either by typing it or using PDF copy/paste jobs. Otherwise you can purchase a lot of stuff here on steam or from their store. They also have a very friendly and helpful community on their forums full of people to help with issues, giving out rules sets for games that aren't officially supported, tips, ideas, and most importantly players and DMs looking for people to game with!I'm very happy with this program. I plan on running a great many games with it (Once I get them written up of course.)			"

Recently some friends have asked whether or not to buy the game and let me host as gm, at first i thought ""Great! ill just go get some DLC so itll be a little easier for them to get into the software and maybe get a campaign too."" but to my surprise when i got to the store i found that the players hand book, the most essential part part of D&D, not only was included in the base 40$ software, but was 50$! more than double the hard copy! and its the same with the DMs guide and monster manual, not to mention the campaigns are extremly over priced at 36$. They are ripping people off and it is so infuriating that they can get away with this.			"

												I reccomend this if you are wiling to be patient, if you are willing to be calm, and most importantly are you willing to accept the fact that you are buying something that will last a lifetime. This is basically your tiles, dice, character sheets, table systems and more for whatever price that it has listed. Granted for the casual player it may seem like a lot, and for people on steam used to 40 prices only on big AAA games it will seem expensive. For those of us who have spent hundreds of dollars on dice, books, tables, tiles, compendium ect. This is very very cheap. It takes some getting used to and it I'm not saying they couldn't be nice and add some sort of tutorial game that adds popups every 5 seconds to tell you how to do things what I am saying is that this software will make your gaming experience much easier if you can't actually play in person. Nothing will every replace playing in person but this does come extremely close to doing just that. So I recommend buying it if you're seriously going to get a few friends together and try to play an adventure together. If you are looking for the free route that restricts you to what you can do Roll20 is for you I personally didn't like how it crashed every other hour but to each his or her own. IF you look and see that I haven't played this much thats because I was using it long before it came to steam and just recently found that it had come here. I'm looking forward to many years of fun and hopefully a steam workshop for people to use with this game "

												I have used Fantasy Grounds to run games for more than 7 years now. For me, this product is the best on the market. Why? Because it gives me my two most fundamental requirements in a Virtual Tabletop. It allows me to create a campaign quickly, and it concentrates on the character sheet. The focus on the story and the characters (PC & NPC) is what makes this such a great tool for roleplaying games. All too often, in the VTT market, the focus is on the map - to the detriment of everything else. If you're lucky, the tool will offer a few token attributes to put your most common skills in to. With Fantasy Grounds, a new blank character sheet awaits a couple of mouse clicks. I have tried most, if not all, of the competition but Ikeep coming back to Fantasy Grounds. Not one has beaten it yet.Other reviewers have commented in the UI experience. To me, this is one of the great things about Fantasy Grounds. The UI gives quick access to the features without being intrusive. It's not a standard windows interface, and there is therefore a learning curve. The combination of click to select and the right-click radial menu means that you have the funtionality at your fingertips, literally. No having to go to menus, toolbars or ribbons stuck on one edge of the screen. The UI works the same whether you are using a PC or a Mac - another rarity. To new players and GMs I say this, if in doubt right-click. The radial menu adjusts to the context of where you are clicking.On the cost. The product is a mature commercial product, with one full time developer and one part time. They support and enhance the software with regular updates - not one of which have I been charged for in seven years. In that time, I've moved from their full license to an ultimate license. Not because I needed to, but because I wanted to support the developers and bring new people in to the games I was running - through demo games and also offering slots in my regular games. The cost is reasonable, $24 for a player license and $40 for a GM lcense. Compare these one-off costs to game books. The GM license is the cost to a single corebook, the player license the cost of a sourcebook. There are free offerings, and those that seem free to start with but aren't. Some do the maps thing better. None do the campaign management and characters better - they don't even come close. If those free or subscription services offerings work for you, all well and good. For me, this is the product people have to beat for me to move. Give me everything Fantasy Grounds does and I might consider them as a product. Cover those two basic fundamentals of story and character before I will even consider that product as a rival.On the community. The Fantasy Grounds community is the best online community I have had the pleasure to be a part of. They are friendly, supportive of new guys, and they offer advice freely. They have developed community rulesets to support a wide range of games. They have produced tutorials and videos to help new players and GMs get started. All in all, a bunch of really good people.

												Best program ever when it comes to running a tabletop game. So much so that i don't think i will ever play a pen and paper game with people at a real table ever again. The tools at your disposal for running are amazing, really help with the immersion of the world, and there is still more to come out of this program with future updates. Not only can you play DnD rule sets of different editions with this software, but you can play a number of other types of rulesets using  the same program.The greatest thing about this program, besides how everything inside it works, is that you arent just limited to friends that you know. The online community is amazing on the forums, with just one post you could be playing a game in minutes, hours, or a couple of days depending on what type you are looking for, and timeframe. You can play with anyone in the world that has the program. You dont even have to buy it if your DM has the DM edition, all you have to do then is download the free demo and you can play with everyone else just like you own the program.			"

												An unbelievably awesome program! I have waited years to find something like this. It is a VTT (Virtual Table Top) system for playing any RPG you can imagine. Many of the most popular systems (and their various editions) are either pre-loaded or available for a competitve price. All VTTs have that capability but only Fantasy Grounds has the rulesets LICENSED from publishers like WotC and others. So it is the OFFICIAL stuff and not what some greasy dude half put together and loaded to a forum as on other VTTs.Plus the presentation is epic! Some VTTs have a few bonus gimicks, but once you play FG you will see that the maximum fun and playability is applied with ALL the features you need and more!However, be aware that the learning curve is sharp for the first two hours. You will open it and be WTF do I click, as it isn't setup like someone's VB app dice roller. Watch a few youtube videos and read a bit of the manual. Once you get a few of the icons down, it's fine after that. Any new sections you come to will be easy because you understand the formating and layout of FG. So hard at first, easy forever.And the forum on their website is awesome! So many great people looking to help and looking to run games.100 hour update: Still going strong and the games have been AMAZING! Top tip: watching a couple tutorial videos helped many get over that early learning curve.			"

												Very good Virtual Table Top.Pros:- Highly moddable. But you don't have to.- Automation is powerful, but optional! Makes house rules very compatible.- Actually, it's just plain powerful all around.- Does everything you can do on a real tabletop, and then some (fog of war, for example!)Cons:- Confusing DLC structure.- It needs to be more clear that you don't get anything beyond bare basic DnD rules and a few other generic things, and you have to buy the rest.- Only host can be GM. Even with ultimate... this was nearly the dealbreaker for me, but I do like DM :D- Steep learning curve, but this is to be expected.Additonal notes:A new edition is coming this year, providing line of sight, dynamic lighting, 3D maps (and maybe tokens). They said they will charge for the upgrade, but they intend it to be only a few dollars for those that bought it recently. Might change of course, but if the new version kicks as much♥♥♥♥♥as FG in its current state, it will be worth!			"

												So I bought FG just a few days ago (Saturday and it is now just Wednesday).  I have never used a VTT before and the only other similar program I have ever heard of was d20 (but not sure that is a VTT) which I know almost nothing about.  Anyway, I am loving this software.  I am excited to get my first module complete so I can play my first session with my children.  They are already excited about it as well.  This is so much better than playing at the actual table.  Just the automated Character bookkeeping was enough for my kids to be interested in playing D&D again. I did a lot of research about the software before purchase.  So I had seen all the comments about a steep learning curve.  Trust me it is steep.  Also unless you intend to buy modules it will take a long time to set up your own in order to play your first session.  However, if you are aware of this going in and stick to it, I believe this software is well worth the cost.  I jumped in and went full monty with my initial purchase.  I bought the ultimate license (as this allows my kids to use the demo version when I DM; and I have at least 4 children who will play and more might join after watching our first session).  I also bought the 5e DM Guide, PHB, and Monster Manual.  I had been using 2/2.5e until now so this also has increased my learning curve as the D&D rules have changed significantly.  So $300 later I am all in and happy with it.  I haven't even played my first session yet.  Only one small test session. I am still creating my first module.  Also another big plus for me was the FG community.   If you buy this, make sure to sign into the forums and ask questions.  The help there is almost immediate.  They also have a dedicated TS server but unfortunately not a single person has spoken to me in it.  Everyone seems to be in dedicated sessions, so is probably too busy playing to bother with someone sitting in tech support channel.  LOL After playing my first session I will add to this review.  But I love it so far and doubt that will change.  The more I learn the more I like it.   So my recommendation is a resounding ""Hell, yes""....LOL			"

It also makes all my d&d books available at the click of a mouse. Creating a character is a lot of fun with the drag and drop from the rules. I'm looking forward to running my own campaign with one of the adventure modules I picked up on special.The base module comes with the free basic rules which will allow you to play D&D with your mates.

Unless you play 3.5 or PFThe only thing this program is good for is if you are willing to sink tons of time precreating everything you want through a frustrating and non user friendly UI.I would only reccommend this game if you were really into preparing and teaching a clunky program to your players to do something that could probably be done more easily over skype.

												After having spent around a hundred bucks into this program for the ""full"" license and the 5E PHB for the new DnD system, I have yet to play the new DnD game in around a month after having bought this stuff.  Other reviewers are correct in that if you do not have a group of people to play games with online prior to purchasing this tool, buyer beware.  The learning curve seems to be pretty steep.  I say ""seems to be"" because I have yet to actually play the game that I bought the software for.  What the ""promos"" don't tell you is that you have to go on the fantasy grounds forums, game calendars, and schedules, and ""sell"" yourself as a player to the groups that may or may not have a spot for you in their group.  There is a lack of DMs, and hundreds of players looking to game.  If you can't get into a game, the official ""response"" on the forums is ""have patience, keep trying, play another game besides 5E, or 'what's keeping you from being a DM yourself?'""  When a person has seen this response a number of times all over the forums it is highly discouraging.  I am new to 5E as well, and don't have the confidence to DM myself.  A typical example of the ""game calendar"" would be a 5E group that has 4 players currently, looking for 2 more, with 20 or more ""applicants"" vying for position to play in this group.  Sounds like applying for a job to me, and this is what I dumped 2 ""A-list"" games worth of cash into to ""not"" play.			"

I will first list the pros and cons.Pros:-planning encounters with automatic xp and challenge level calculations-tracking of players, levels, HP and initiative all in one place (no more running 6 apps at the same time)-Campaign sessions saved so you can remember what you did last time and what you planned forward-library, with ability to create and change monsters, items, and rules in general.-Running encounters in mapsCons:-Expensive-Have to buy separate libraries to have full experience-Setting up a server is a hassleI have used Fantasy grounds for one quick one player session (to try it out) i made a one shot adventure for my GF and she loved it, she said although the program takes a bit to get used to. After about 30 minutes she got the hang of it and it run quite smoothly. Encounters are a bliss running monsters is a lot more intuitive than keeping track on a playmat since when they hit one you dont mix up who got hit on a piece of paper. Also she told me that not having to remember all the rules by heart, and having her character auto roll for damage with all modifiers was awesome.When using it in a physical session, it is also great help, you can plan fast encounters, keep track of all player hp and monsters at the same time without hassle. Also for me keepong all my sessions and story written parts saved is awesome, also you can keep maps interactive and use them as a dm to keep track of traps, mosnter locations etc.All in all awesome program, if you can afford it definitely get it, it will make your life as a dm easier.

												Fantasy Grounds is a very high-learning curve virtual tabletop with a ton of versatility and the ability to really play just about any tabletop RPG you can think of with a little effort.  Some rulesets are built-in for free, such as D&D 3.5/Pathfinder, D&D 4th Edition, and of course D&D 5th Edition.  Other rulesets (such as Call of Cthulhu; Savage Worlds; or Castles & Crusades) are available for separate purchase.  Anything you can think of can really be created manually, if you don't want to spend the money or if it hasn't already been created & distributed for free on the community forums over at fantasygrounds.com.The interface for the program is very friendly if you've got a mouse attached to your PC, not quite as intuitive if you are trying to use a touchpad or something.  So while I usually don't have a mouse attached to my laptop, I definitely go out of my way to attach one when using Fantasy Grounds.  There are lots of functions in the software that will take some tutorials to understand and get used to, but once you've devoted a couple of hours play-time to the software you'll be able to control it second-nature and it's all pretty intuitive once you get used to it.The ability to buy official add-ons from publishers seems like a bad thing to some people, because they see the add-on content adds up to over $2000 worth of stuff if you buy it all, but don't be dismayed, it's really an illusion.  None of it is necessary!  If you buy just the base software, you get access to the full Pathfinder & D&D 5e rulesets, which are the two most commonly played roleplaying systems today.  Both include official SRD content so with no additional purchase you will have access to a decent variety of character race & class options with lots of spells available for the spellcasting classes, and tons of monsters available for you to build an encounter if you're a GM.  You can then build your campaign, your story, your encounters, etc. and import any maps you might download for free on the internet or even that you may have created yourself .  So you can really play a full campaign without buying a single add-on.Add-on modules just take all the work out of it for the GM.  It basically eliminates prep-time.  You get encounters pre-built, non-SRD monsters & NPCs are included already, maps are included, treasure parcels, story-items, it's all built into the module and very easy and fast for the GM to run.  If you want to spend the money on this functionality, you can do so and save yourself some time & effort.  If you want to save the money and you already have that same module in PDF form or in printed form, you can still run it in Fantasy Grounds without buying the Fantasy Grounds module.  Of course this must be possible, because Fantasy Grounds is set up to allow you to play any homebrew campaign you can dream up, with any characters you can imagine, any NPCs, monsters, items, etc.  You can customize it completely to allow you to do things that no pre-built or sold package can accomodate!  It just takes a little knowledge of the system.  The Fantasy Grounds community forums are great for helping people learn how to do this stuff.  They are very helpful over there and respond quickly (usually).Other add-ons like the $50 Core Class Pack for D&D 5e are also no TRULY necessary.  If you have the PHB in print, you can create those characters in Fantasy Grounds without having the Core Class Pack, it just takes some extra effort, some extra typing on your part, and a little extra in-depth knowledge of how to set up spell effects &things like that, but it's a very powerful & versatile program that lets you do it if you just invest the time.  For those more interested in paying some money instead of time and effort, then you can buy the class pack to save time, letting you create non-SRD character options by dragging & dropping.That's the key to Fantasy Grounds.  You can do anything with it with a little time and effort, or with a little cash to buy somebody else's efforts and import it into your game rather than you doing it all yourself.So with Fantasy Grounds, you get a very robust, powerful, versatile virtual tabletop that is expandable and customizable depending on your time/effort/cash preferences.  It is stable and fast.  And it automates a great deal of running the game.  It's very easy for new players to learn to play with Fantasy Grounds.  The GM has a lot more to learn, but players can just basically follow the lead as they click through the mostly intuitive interface to play the game.  Depending on the rule system you're playing, there could be more or less automation and drag & drop ability for running the game and managing characters.  D&D 5e is currently, in my opinion and with my limited experience with other rulesets, by far the best ruleset to play in Fantasy Grounds, it is the most automated and has the most drag & droppability.  It's very easy for new players to learn Fantasy Grounds and to learn D&D 5e in general when using Fantasy Grounds with the 5e ruleset.The best part is that you can use this software either to manage your in-person roleplaying sessions and keep track of campaign & characters.  Or you can use it to play with distant friends that you don't get to see in person enough to play.  Or if you don't even know anybody who wants to play RPGs, but you yourself are interested, well of course you can go over to the Fantasy Grounds forums and find a group to play with online!			"

												I absolutely love Fantasy Grounds!I've played D&D off an on since I was a kid (about 20 years ago now). I skipped 4E altogether but have played 2E, 3.5 and now getting into 5E.The group I DM for is a group of folks I've met through MMOs, and we all play lots of other games together. Someone asked if D&D would be fun to try, and I got to divulge to them my lifelong passion of D&D. First, we started playing a campaign I homebrewed for them in Roll20. It was fine, but we found Roll20 to be cumbersome for our online-only group.I did some research and decided to drop the cash on FG Ultimate License. The players I DM for, also pitched in, so that was how it worked for our group.I will never ever ever go back to Roll20. Fantasy Ground does everything we wanted it to, and more. Attack a monster and the damage is done to it automatically! Get new gear, your AC is automatically fixed up! Assigning loot, XP etc to players is a walk in the park. Creating encounters, linking things on the maps, story entries, handouts, literally everything is so easy to do in FG, its amazing, and I wish I had gotten it even sooner.The best part is being able to edit, copy, customize just about everything with the click of a mouse (or a drag of the mouse in most cases :P). Our homebrew campaign world is constantly evolving and its so easy for me to reflect that or reference stuff from past adventures inside Fantasy Grounds. Something I couldn't really do, or at least do well, in Roll20.The icing on the cake? The community. The Fantasy Grounds community forums are amazing. A wealth of information can be found there, and if you can't find what you're looking for, you can ask, and someone will point you where you need to go. There's boatloads of extensions for you to add to your games to make them even better.I absolutely recommend this to folks looking for a way to play D&D online with friends. If you're like me and had a group of folks ready to play with, you could easily just get the Ultimate license, split the cost among your friends, and be ready to go.10/10 will accidentally kill Droop in LMOP over and over again just to hear my friends call me the worst DM ever.

												You'll notice there's a trend in the reviews - people who've had the program way before it was offered on Steam reviewing positively, and people who got the program through Steam reviewing negatively. I did get the program before it was offered on Steam and I can say that it's a solid program, filled with delightful surprises that do make running a game on the internet fairly easy. It's also a fairly old program, and yes, Roll20 and others of it's kind that have come out since do, as of this writing, have a few features that this does not, as well as an obvious price advantage. However there are still many features in FG2 which are superior (it's vast cache of OGL content and manipulation of same are second to none), and more importantly, Smiteworks has a great reputation for continually updating this product and offering those updates free to charge to current owners. There's also a community of fellow gamers eager to take you into the fold - how many other programs out there have a matchmaking system that can get you into new games and make you new friends?Anyway, my point is, this program is one of the staples of the online tabletop world, so I strongly recommend at least getting the demo and learning the basics with someone. See where it takes you. You know, kinda like you did with whatever RPGs you'd be playing on it in the first place. ;) "

												It's not intuitive, it runs like a very old cobbled-together program. You can't simply create a D&D character and print it, for example. The system expects you to purchase content and ONLY use that content in FG. If you're really willing to learn the FG system and pay a premium and you never expect to do any gaming outside of FG, you might like it. For me, it was a waste of money. A large waste of money since I purchased 5e D&D content expecting to be able to flip through it and print out characters using an elegant chargen system like WoTC used to offer on its website during the 4E era; but nope. Only buy Fantasy Grounds if you expect to do all your gaming in FG and never want to print, export, or use any of the information offline. Even for online play I'm not sure at all why WoTC went with FG as it's ""main system"" because products exist out there that seem to offer a better online tabletop experience. I now have an expensive dud of a program in a format I'll probably never use.			"

												I have been running various groups with Fantasygrounds for the past 5 years and can only say, that it is one of the best tools with a lot of flexibility.THe integrated rulesets are really good (especially PFRPG and D&D) and the documentation and forums make it possible to bring in all kinds of other RPGs. Altough, I have to admit that it is a lot of work to customize and requires LUA and XML knowledge.Overall, the tool provides a couple of really good features like local character stores and the possibility to quickly bring content to your players. Basically to bring a picture or a map to your players, you just need to filecopy it into your campaign and can share it within seconds).The underrated system of synonyms for your chat sessions make it easy for your players even you have a changing IP address.Frequent updates and ever new rulesets do the rest to make this tool well rounded and worth the money.The additional DLC needs to be looked at carefully. There is some good packages available, when it comes to tokens for your campaign e.g. but some of the other packages are a bit overpriced and you should be waiting for a sale to get those.			"

												I started using Roll20 about 2 months ago and DMed a game for a subscribing player. After 1.5 months, we got thru most of the Lost Mines of Phandelver. Every night the game would lag and stall and all of the players would have to refresh multliple times an hour. As the DM, I used two monitors and just alternating reloading them to try to keep the game going. I dont know how much of this was due to the API scripts that the Sub was using, but he assured me that it was typical. I tried all 3 major browsers (chrome and foxfire worked the ""best""). This really put me off Roll20.So I looked elsewhere and found Fantasy Grounds, we have used it several times now and it has worked very smoothly. Just like Roll20, the learning curve is the steep, but I highly recommended this software as a gaming platform. Once you enter your weapons it auto applys damage, keeps track of effects, and provides a stable platform to game on. You also have the option of spending a little cash and getting the entire module preentered and ready to go.The one big drawback is it doesnt support dynamic lightning like Roll20. Personally, I dont like dynamic lightning. I think it makes the game feel claustrophobic. Others like it though so that might be a deal breaker for you.			"

Love this application! creating a character has never been easier in the RPG world, though not every thing is a positive experience. for one the cost is a bit pricy. for those who have already bought the physical books be ready to drop some more cash, and for new players this is the average price for the books (don't listen to the people saying it cost to much, table top RPG have never been cheap.) the interface is very simple without loosing control. a new user will have to sit down and understand the ins and outs but that’s no different then reading the books from start to finish. If you want a good campaign you will need to sit down and understand how things work.all in all, I can't recommend this enough be it for local play so things go smoothly or global play so you can see friends across the globe this program does it right! Pro  works well  easy to use   covers various rulesets Cons  expensive   learning curve   no voice chat use skype, teamspeak, discord "

												While the price tag might put some off, it's a solid product and I think worth it. There are alternatives but I enjoy the way Fantasy Grounds has everything set up. I'm pretty much only using it for Pathfinder (D&D) and I've enjoyed the layout of the character sheets, the option to automate almost everything and even the nifty built in language filtering for those times when your Elves want to talk to eachother but fear that dreaded meta.As far as pricing goes, it can be a little tedious to get a casual group to drop the money on it but if you're dedicated enough, or your GM is REALLY dedicated and picks up the ultimate edition, then it's without a doubt worth it. As I've seen around in other reviews, it's a great blend of pen and paper and digital that lends itself well to speeding up the slower aspects of tabletop gaming.			"

												Great Concept Poor Execution...Unless your game system is coded by and licensed for FG  then this is a wonderful system!Otherwise, if you like learning how to code XML - this is a BS product that should have never been touted as being flexible enough for customization; and if /when questioned on their forums about that - you'll get some snarky remark about how easy or that you should learn how to code (like your dumb or subpar). Honestly I think the owner need to sell this IP off to a more robust entity that can bring it to full realization without the consumer having to learn programming.It smacks of greed and contempt for those who can't code - its really too bad no one out there can bring it to Smiteworks and show them a system that's fully realized - thus raising the bar on all from Roll 20 to Fantasy Grounds itself. I implore you to go to their website - create a login; then go through the Houserules ""Ruleset"" section to see the frustration not only I have experienced by many many others - heck just look at the reviews herein its about 60/40 split - generally if something is as good as touted then I'd expect to see a 80/20 split in favor of the product therein ~ go figure & good luck!

												Absolutely one of the best programs I have ever seen for playing pen and paper roleplaying games over the internet. The demo version is fine if your DM has the Ultimate version of the software, which many I know do (myself included). The price-tag is a bit steep, and the learning curve does exist, but once you get rolling it becomes a train of fun with no end.Think about it this way: A new video game comes out, you nab it for 60USD or whatever. You play the campaign, beat it in 20 hours. 20 hours of what is hopefully fun, for 60USD. OR, you can pay for FG and any suppliments you require, and have unlimited fun, barred only by your own imagination.			"

 A steep learning curve, but one well worth making the effort for.  Makes DM'ing and playing much more organized and easy to navigate. I'm playing this online, but plan to use it in our in person game as well, to take a lot of the book work and record keeping of running a campaign, off of my plate so I can focus on the story and moving the adventure along.I'm using a Mac, and when I got the El Capitan update from Apple, it kicked something loose in the wineskin wrapper that prevented me from accessing it. When I commented to the developers about it, they offered a couple of work-arounds that I in my tech-ignorance, felt uncomfortable attempting on my own, but they assured me they were working on an update with an official fix and would get that up and running asap. This took only a few days, and I feel as though the developers were earnestly working to fix the problem my OS update broke in a program that was working fine previous to the update, and feel comfortable strongly recommending this excellent tool.Oh, and did I mention they got the official 5e D&D liscence, and that the official campaigns are AMAZING? I didn't? Well they are, and extreamly easy to use once you have familiarized yourself with how to do everything. I strongly encourage new users to go to the official YouTube page and watch the videos on how to run it.The official adventures and campaigns available at the Fantasy Grounds store are stunning in how easy they make DM'ing, as well as providing a wealth of background information on the people, monsters and places of the area involved, and additional races, equipment, spells, maps, tokens, pictures and on, and on, and on, and when if you run out of officiall adventures and campaigns, there are numerous 5e compatable, 3rd party adventures, and all of that is before you even touch the pleathora of fan made stuff!Not as impressed with 5e D&D as I am, but just got done reading the latest adventures of Harry Dresdin and dying to visit his Chicago office? Or perhaps you want to track down the cultists of the Aincient Ones and discover the things that man was never meant to know? Fantasy Grounds comes with the Fate Core rules...and Call of Cthulhu...and 3.5...and Pathfinder...and their own core RPG system...and so much more, and they just keep working to improve it!But don't take my word for it, check out some of the videos at their official YouTube page, or watch any of the numerous videos of groups playing, using fantasy grounds and various voice/video chat programs.I give it 8 out of 10 stars, and might bump that up to a 9 of 10 if the interface were a bit more polished and the curser cleaned up to be a bit more accurate at clicking the items I'm trying to choose. I don't know if this is specific to the winskin wrapped mac version, or if this is cross platform, and after a bit of frustration getting used to it, this minor glitch is easily overlooked.It works mac-to-pc and vice versa without a hitch, to boot!

												From a players perspective it's excellent and everything you could want/need/desire from a Table Top simulator. From a GM perspective it's excellent and allows you to control everything you need to. The interface could definitly use some work and polish, the learning curve can be staggering and initially a little overwhelming. But if you spend a few hours tinkering and watching the tutorials available you overcome it quickly. Also, as with everything nowadays, check youtube, and watch some of the content and how-tos there. They're an excellent step by step resource. Also the developers on Steam are quick to respond and really take the time to answer every question and lend a hand. Probably best support team for a game I've run across. While I use it for playing Pathfinder it supports a variety of RPG's and allows for homebrew rules in all of them. I haven't decided if I like that the rulesets aren't binding. If a level 1 Fighter is only supposed to have 1D10 + con for hitpoints he can still write 50 in the block and the program allows for it. Really all that means is that the GM needs to look over every character to make sure there aren't any mistakes. Which is the same thing you have to do sitting around the table. Also, as far as I can tell there is no way for casters to memorize their spells. So they need to be tracked manually, which is a huge pain in the♥♥♥♥♥for the GM, but also no different then if you were sitting around the table and started wondering why your level 5 wizard says he's going to cast his 4th fireball of the night.Something I love from both a Player and GM standpoint is the language options. If you're characters speak Orc or Giant and they have to negotiate with these creatures the GM can set his language settings to the appropriate language and type in the game and it will come out in that language. The player(s) that speak that language will also see it in their program language (ie English, or French) finally making them useful. It adds a lot of depth to negoitations and allows the player to really feel the knowledge means something. It is interesting (and often amusing) to see how one player or another diseminates information to the rest of the party. OR in one case totally screws his companion, doing him a favour and haggling the price of a suit of amour from a Dwarven blacksmith my bard decided to pay back the fighter for a precieved slight buy not dropping the price as far as he could have. Fantasy Grounds is an excellent resource for those looking for a virtual Table Top. Again, there is a very steep inital learning curve, but by watching the tutorials and (even more important) some of the youtube content and how-tos available you can overcome it fairly quickly. Once you get the feel for it everything really flows. I haven't found another program that does everything Fantasy Grounds does as well as it does. There are tons of things you can do once you figure out the nuances. Granted, that does take some time on the part of the user. But I don't know any GM's that do homebrew campaigns that aren't willing to put in the time. Ultimately the the major drawback to Fantasy Grounds is the cost. While you can get your games created manually imputting everything this takes an exorbiant amount of time on the part of the GM. To have access to everything for your particular RPG it is very expensive. Granted it's not as expensive as buying the hardcopies, but it not cheap either. Especially when you consider that the content your given doesn't give you the same as what you'd see in the books. I don't see any reason why the program couldn't come with an assortment of tile sets already available in the program. There are ways around buying tilesets but like finding them and imputing them takes a lot of time. Pros:Outstanding SupportAmazing customization optionsImport all sorts of content, PDF's, JPEGs, Word DocsLanguage optionsCons: CostInterfaceNot particularly user friendly or intuitive			"

You don't need to buy the add-ons if you are going to be playing popular games such as D&D 3.5, D&D 5e, or Pathfinder if you have the physical books or pdf's you can import the information directly. The community is also very helpful if you have any issues inputting effects or spells, just go to the forums and they will answer your questions and help you out. It is a very good system and works fluently. I highly suggest watching the videos that Fantasy Grounds has released as well as videos released by youtuber Jason Hibdon to get a feel of what Fantasy Grounds is truly like.			"

												Fantasy Grounds has been a great addition to my library. It takes some getting used and I look forward to the unity update. As is, Fantasy Grounds has allowed me to re-live the gold ol' days of table top D&D sessions by bringing family and friends together who used to together but are seperated by geography.Take sometime to watcch the Youtube videos and check out the forums if you have questions. I enjoy being able to to create custom content and using pre-existing materials as templates. There is a learning curve for sure but after a session or two you will have a feel for all you need to know,			"

												I've used many of the online tabletop programs.  They all seem to have their advantages.  Fantasy Grounds isn't perfect, but when coupled with the official D&D5E content, it really adds a powerful toolset with an ease of use that the others just can't offer.			"

												I thought Fantasy Grounds, from a player perspective was rather easy to get used to with it's current interface. And once you get some assistance, it makes it all the better. The entire process of creating characters and such things, depending on the ruleset you are using, is the harder part.Can't recommend FG enough for tabletop gaming from home, I can't get out and it still brings the same feelings, environment and enjoyment to the games.(I haven't tried to GM anything at this stage, so I cannot comment on the GM system)			"

												I am a long time DM and after purchasing the full license I was extremely pleased with the ease of use and functionality of this piece of software. It is such a massive time saver in terms of the interfacing with the rulebooks with drag and drop features. However, be aware you must purchase the ultimate edition to play with people using the demo version. If I had the money it would be a no-brainer as my choice of DMing software.			"

												Great format.  The learning curve is a bit steep, but once you become familiar with the tools, it is not that difficult.  There are a lot of really great features that when used correctly, can bring a lot of reality to your gaming sessions.  Being able to view maps that are revealed as you explore, pictures, notes, story lines, player and monster tokens on map with grid spacing, ability to link NPC script or even scene descriptions right into the chat box for everyone to view, are just a few.

												Excellent tool, very stable, really allows you to enjoy face-to-face RPG over the Net. It offers lots of very helpful automatization with certain (non free) addons (the D&D ones for 5E are really great). My only gripe is the UI which has its own ""way"" of operating and its own set of conventions to interact with the windows, menus, icons, etc. It would be an even better software with a more modern / traditional UI, but it is still very good as-is.

												This is not so much a review as an explanation of how Fantasy Grounds has enabled me to play RPGs for the last 12 years...I have used this product since 2005 and it has been well worth the money!Twelve years of updates and no charges is value to me.I bought this product when out group could no longer play face-to-face and at the time there was less choice than than is now, and this was the only one where GM and players had to pay for it! I have to be honest I bought it because you could actually roll the dice. I convinced the players to buy a license each and our d20 campaign continued.I had to make the ruleset with people I ""met"" on the forums but we learnt the xml (not as hard as some people make out), we did the grahics and we had a blast. I won a copy of the Ultimate edition when I posted my first Youtube video (now I have a 151 subscribers which is not alot in Youtube turns but still amazing to me).Over the years I have run or player D20 Modern, Savage Worlds and Pathfinder games. I have run games with completer strangers in the many FG Cons and FG Daze we have. I have made DLC for many Savage Worlds products.I have used this product for thousands of hours regardless of what Steam states (that is just how long I have clocked up using my macbook at hotels when I am working away from home, player only not GMing).I have spent hours asking questions and answering them on the forums (well worth a visit)If you want to use this product download the demo and play with it, look out for the GMs who run sessions (like myself with Ultimate Licenses so you can join us and play without need to have bought the sofware), ask questions on the forums, and enjoy this product.

												I've just started using this to run D&D 5e and Fate Core games online, and as a Dungeon Master, it's Fantastic.  The interface is a bit unintuitive, and in some cases could really benefit from a redesign, but the core functionality is excellent.  Fantasy Grounds takes a bit of work to get comfortable with, but is well worth it.  And when the DM knows how to interact with the system, it becomes easy to direct new players through. The community on the Fantasy Grounds forum is incredibly helpful.			"

												This is a fantastic tool for running game sessions with PnP RPG (Tabletop) digitally.Before I found this software we always ran into issues where there was always someone who had a hard time making it to the sessions and so we either delayed the sessions or went on without that person. Now if they can't make it to the locations they can always join in through Discord or Skype, and we can still run the game as if the person was here.I've been running some Call of Cthulhu (6th Edition) sessions, and while we've had some hiccups in the start - I'm fairly certain we've found the issues thanks to the FG forum. All in all it's been some rather enjoyable sessions for me as a GM, but also for the players. Sure the CoC ruleset might not be as fancy as the D&D one, but it works very well nevertheless.All in all I couldn't be happier with it. It's a steep learning curve though, but it helps to visit their Wiki page and read up on some things. They've also made a lot of tutorial videos and such which are quite nice.I'd definitely recommend this to anyone interested in tabletop RPG.			"

												If you play Tabletop RPGs, and want a great way to do it online with friends in other places, Fantasy Grounds is ideal.  You can use it to do as much or as little as you want... if you just want maps, tokens, and a dice roller, you can do that.  If you want it to keep track of monster attack rolls, saves, hit points, spell trees, and more, it can do that as well.  It's a fantastic program to allow you to play, add free.  Roll20 is good, but to play add free you would need the $5 a month subscription.  So in 8 months, you'd have paid for Fantasy Grounds.  I bought Fantasy Grounds 15 years ago, and love it.  I only wish I could play more!			"

												Fantasy Grounds is not for everyone. If you are one of the pathetic flesh bags that require everything a game is capable of be handed to you on a silver platter, then do not acquire this game, or even Elder Scrolls (let's face it, Steam Workshop is nice, but if you want the good stuff, you have to go elsewhere).The Good:If you get this Virtual Table Top program (henceforth VTT), then be sure to use it with rules sets, as that is where you'll get the most photon blast for your buck. The built in character sheets, the rules sets with drag and drop features, one-click-and-you're-done functionality, it can turn a game session that might drag on in a normal VTT, into a rapid paced session with combats flying by faster than they might in a face to face game. Savage Worlds is an RPG system that banks on being Fast, Furious, and Fun, but in VTT it can drag on if you don't have a working knowlege of macros, or just don't have the time. With Fantasy Grounds, it can be all right there, and a little game prep goes a long way.There are also a number of free rules sets. Do you play Pathfinder? Well, they weren't able to strike a deal to allow FG to sell paizo products through its store, but they were able to take advantage of the game license to provide the Pathfinder Rules Sets for free. If you dig around the forums, you can even find updates that include books beyond the core rules, such as Ultimate Combat, or Advanced Players Guide. What about AD&D fans out there? Well, OSRIC is free as well. There are a number of sets you can pick up that give you a fan made theme, as well as a character sheet and appropriate NPC/Vehicle sheets, which, while not an entire rules set, goes a long way in making FG work for you. So if you get it, do yourself a favor, look over the website and see what you can scavange.I currently use this program for Pathfinder, Mutants and Masterminds, and Savage Worlds. I would use no other if I had the choice. However, if you want to get the most out of it, a trip to their website to look at tutorials is almost required.The Meh:Connecting to a game can be a pain in the power core. I've opened their magic port and had nothing work, more times than I care to, and there are few things more frustrating than finally having a session start on time, only to be stalled as two of your players cannot connect. If you have a head for networking on these primitive Earth systems, then I imagine it's less of a pain. Without the use of rulessets, this program becomes little more than an over priced virtual dice roller with incredibly limited mapping capabilities, and some organizational elements. In short, you're better off with Map Tool or Roll20. The Ugly:Virtal Tabletops are usually designed for their functions, not for their Intuitive UI, some things just don't make sense, thankfully, they have quite a few video tutorials on their website that can get you running a game fairly quickly. The price counters a lot of the good qualities of this program. I paid for the ultimate license, which cost me the soul of my first born. Considering I didn't want the little brat growing up to challenge my power, it was fine for me, but those of you burdened and weakened by 'morals' might consider otherwise. Micro Transactions galore! If you hate that, you'll hate this program, as you'll purchase it and then realize you need to fork over more money for your favorite rules set. It's not required, sure, but if you want to use the program the way it is advertised, then it certainly is. I spent over $60 just so I could run Sundered Skies, despite owning all of their books in the first place. Like house rules? Well screw you! Adding or modifying rules is not for the feint of heart, or those who disdain working with the computational equivalent of simple machines. The financial weight of this game is on the GM. Period. In my case, this is fine, I run the games, none of my players have to pay a dime to participate, and they get access to all of my rules sets when they join the game. However, unlike a face to face game, a player can't show up, hand the GM a rule book for a system he may not own yet, and have it applied to the game. Conclusion: I recommend it, if you have the money for it, and if you plan on using it a lot. Otherwise, stick to the free or the cheaper VTT's. Though I will say, when you have the rules set for your favorite system, then there is no better VTT out there.			"

												Playing around with it, it's time consuming. Keep in mind that this is a simulator for Tabletop games so this isn't for everyone. There's a comprehensive wiki and once all the information is set up, joing a game is easy. It's just going to take time and a trial run to really get the ball rolling. But if its something we will actually use more than once, it's worth the automation and controls it provides. For someone who has, wants, or loves to play a Tabletop RPG like 3.5 or PathFinder and you don't have friends nearby to join you, Fantasy Grounds is the simulator for you!			"

												I've been attempting to find a way to play Star Wars: Edge of the Empire online for a while now, and after trying MapTool and looking into Roll20, both of those apps confuse me to no end & make my head hurt.  I'd basically resigned myself to going without playing online.Fantasy Grounds caught my attention since it was just uploaded to Steam here, and it has succeeded in turning things around for me.  Edge of the Empire support is enabled through a custom, user-created ruleset (free!) that continues to be updated and is rather well-organised.  Its creator is also in the process of making a video tutorial series for it.  Through a combination of his first tutorial video, a read-through of the ruleset's functions on its forum page, and an afternoon of playing around and experimenting by myself, I was able to learn the entire system & host a short session today (bought it yesterday night after learning on the demo version).Overall, it's VERY fun, very pretty, and the extensive amount of features designed to keep everything organised is exactly what I was looking for in a virtual tabletop for Star Wars.  I don't have much of an opinion on Fantasy Ground's support for other games, though I'd love to give their Vampire: The Masquerade functionality a shot sometime as well.  I'm absolutely satisfied with my personal copy~!			"

												The software itself is fine; relatively flexible, easy to use if you're already computer literate, and fairly reliable. Aside from a few issues regarding required connectivity for use of aliases or licenses, I have few complaints about the program itself.Unfortunately, I cannot recommend investing in Fantasy Grounds to anyone who doesn't already have a group in mind to play with. The community is largely insular, consisting of groups who already know and play with each other. As either a GM or player, I've seen very little interest or discussion on the official forums and here for most people looking for games.If you're looking for a virtual tabletop for a current group, FG is worth a try. If you're looking to get into a group for an online game, Fantasy Grounds may take some work getting involved with.That being said, many games are run using an Ultimate License, meaning players can often join games and try it out using the demo version of FG. So there is a very solid option for ""try before you buy.""			"

												Most ImmersiveHaving used most virtual tabletops out there, I always found Fantasy Grounds to be the most immersive of them all. I'm not really sure why is that: perhaps a combination of elements, like the graphic user interface, the feeling of a real table, the dice, the character portraits, character sheets, visual handouts, it not being ""map-centric"" . . . The text chat capabilities of this VTT are awesome, which is a plus for my game mastering style.It's very easy to use actually from the player's side, and that is true as well for the DM side if you are covered by a specific ruleset for your role playing game system. Currently it comes with a good bunch of them, from GURPS to D&D 5E, just included in the installation. This virtual tabletop, being constantly updated, has a great range of features while keeping itself faithful to its basic framework. The learning curve is soft unless you want degrees of customization, but the community is very helpful and there is some official documentation and tutorials.			"

												In this review I would like to first clarify what Fantasy Grounds is, and is not.Fantasy Grounds isn't a traditional game. In fact, it isn't a game at all. It is a virtual tabletop that allows you to play traditional role playing games over the Internet.By default it supports a variety of tabletop games. By supports it means that if you buy the prewritten modules (highly recommended) or type in the rules yourself (time consuming and not recommended) you can play these games online, with other people.It is certainly functional without buying a single module, but I think you'll agree that buying a premade module for your game is a better use of your time. Unfortunately due to licensing costs, modules from some publishers such as Wizards of the Coast (Dungeons and Dragons) are rather expensive.One of Fantasy Grounds great strengths is that it can automate many of the tedious tasks that bog down traditional games, things like automatic experience point calculations, applying combat effects and so on. Once you get over the initial learning curve, it becomes quite easy for the Game Master to design and run an encounter.There are 2 options with Fantasy Grounds, a regular or ultimate license. If you have the same Game Master for every game, buy the ultimate license. It is a site license that allows unlimited free (Demo) license to connnect and play. Players never have to spend any money.It is very important to realise that only modules owned by the Game Master (who is hosting the game) can be used. Players CAN NOT share modules with their Game Master.If you are looking at this as a player, I would suggest having the Game Master buy the Ultimate license, and the players gifting the needed game modules to the Game Master. Players should then use the free Demo license to connect.Happy Gaming.			"

												If you're reading this and have played a TableTop RPG at some point in your life and want to return to that, then buy it. There doesn't need to be any more questions you ask, just go ahead and spend whatever Steam's charging for it, or go get a $3.99 subscription from the Fantasy Grounds Website. We could get into if it's better for ""this"" or ""that"" versus some other Virtual Table Top, but that's boring, and since most of the other ones are garbage or free, you really get your largest bang from FG.Here's a flow chart:Do you like tabletop RPGS?  ---> Yes  ---> Buy it---> No  ---> Don't buy it			"

												Simple enough to give a character to a child - strong enough for a pro to make a strong character with ease; and all while looking good. The mod/addon community is very lively and produces many useful tools, also. Can't wait to run my own game off of it and not just play.			"

												I played in a campain for about 3 years.  We started out using maps and mini's, but after a few months we moved to all using Fantasy grounds.  Each person used their own laptop, but we still met at the GM's house and gathered around a table.As time went on we used more and more of Fantasy Grounds.  As we learned what it could do, how we could modify it and how it would work for us, the PC's used it more and more, and the GM got to use more an more of the tools.  Saved map progress, saved statuses, and range indicators are just a few of the many great features of this software.I mainly played as a PC using this app, but I did a little bit as a GM and also created a campain.  Sometimes we had remote people connect with us, while we tried to keep an in person game going.I enjoyed this software in its earlier days (2007) and it has only gotten beter sense.  I bought it before it was on steam, but I also purchased in on steam when it was added.  This helps get some DLC and to keep it all squared away with download accessablility.  I highly recomend this software for in person as well as remote gaming sessions.			"

												I was very skeptical of this game and waited a long time to buy it.  I fifnally bought it on steam sale for a large discount and decided to try it.  Initially I thought it was crap.  The GUI is very counterintuitive and they used very few known good interface techniques.  After using it long enough and getting over the absurd learning curve of the horribly documented and poorly thought out UI, I was able to delve deep enough into the pit of usability and find some really great gems.Now that I can utilize the software well enough, it has greatly improved my ability to DM a game efficiently and focus more on roleplaying.  The time I spent on here is misleading, as I don't invoke the .exe ffrom Steam.  I have been using it weekly for a couple months now and I am very glad I spent the money on the D&D 5e kits.  If you play regularly with a technologically savy group this is a gret tool.Of course, like most overly complicated and unecessarily complex tools designed with the ""You gotta earn it to use it"" attitude, I am not confident that this product will be around in a few years.  Also, It doesn't have any tablet or mobile device support, so if you wanna use it in person bring lots of laptops.  I guess the Devs never heard of internet of things....   Internet Of Things devs!!!!  We want the things!!! We want all the things!!!			"

												If you're looking for a solid VTT which allows you to roleplay with your friends online, this is it.If you're a DM, you'll need to spend time learning how Fantasy Grounds (FG) works in regards to your chosen RPG. But that's nothing new, since a DM is required to know the RPG almost back to front in a traditional setting anyway. Once you learn how to use FG (with the support of a great community) then it will streamline your gameplay much more than at an actual table. You'll be surprised.As a player, you only need to know the basics of FG, which takes next to no time at all. With your DM's prep work done, being a player is simple.With the support of a great community at Fantasy Grounds Community Link [www.fantasygrounds.com], and developers who care about their product, using Fantasy Grounds to run your VTT experience is the best choice around, and that choice is only getting better.

												5e player here. Great virtual tabletop that lets me play with friends far apart. This is a more ""advanced"" offering with lots of features. Learning curve was a bit steep, but I'm loving it now. It offers many tools to help a DM run and manage an online campaign. Speed of play went through the roof, faster than actual table play, so I'm having a blast. I don't think I can online DM anything more than a one shot without it anymore. "

It does require a bit of ""getting the hang of the interface"" but once you do, it all feels quite intuitive and easy to get in and out of a gaming session. If you're looking to rekindle some of that old-school D&D magic, but have friends who cannot get together physically on a regular basis, this is a GREAT option.			"

												I have been happily using Fantasy Grounds to run multiple campaigns for the past three years.  It is well worth your purchase price.  Automation for most things is built in, depending on the rule set you are using and SmiteWorks are always releasing new patches/improvements in core functionality and are very interactive with their community.  There is a significant amount of additional content available, but you don't need to buy them unless you want to; think of buying a pen & paper module or class book in the ""good old days"" by comparison - if you chose not to, your core game would still go ahead fine.There are a lot of people looking to stir up trouble complaining this isn't free.  Ask yourself if you'd be willing to put hours and hours of your time into a project and not expect to make something back from it.  Also, be sure you know what ""free"" is... because it isn't ""free"" like you think.I've used FG to run D&D 3.5e, Pathfinder, Rolemaster Classic and Castles & Crusades campaigns.  All of these are well worth getting time into the software... you should not regret it if you take the plunge and join the FG community.  As a last point, anyone who likes Rolemaster but shudders at memories of flipping constantly through books and attack charts... take heart - FG makes your RM game a dream to run.			"

												Astonishingly bad user interface.  I closed the program after 20 minutes, feeling ripped off, because I didn't think it had the functionality that I had just paid $80 for.  I watched some videos, and eventually figured out how to create a character for 5E.For example, given a space for ""Class"", I should be able to click in that space, maybe get a drop down menu, or type something?  And select Sorcerer?  No, not even remotely that simple.  You have to open the ""Library"", making sure you've selected the right ""Modules"", then drill down to classes, and finally drag and drop something that looks like a graphic decoration but is actually an essential part of the UI.  Amazing.It's just bad.  Back to form-fillable PDFs for me.			"

												Fantasy grounds has potential but the only real redeeming quality is the game licenses it has. BUT! You have to pay full price for every book that it includes. Thinking of buying the base model? It is a pretty weak program that takes Immense amounts of time to get anything done due to its early millenia style windows. No shortcuts, no intuitive links, no ease of use, no icons that can be iterpreted by looking at them. Its really just a poor platform to do online gaming. The core rulesets are a fantastic redeeming quality but if you dont have additional hours to set up a campaign just because the program has a horrible learning curve and no ease of use, then dont bother. Its simply put, a poor program. It just feels like the devs didn't put in much effort.			"

I had never used Fantasy Grounds I bought it on a whim but now when I see Curse of Strhad DLC is on sale I thought this would be a good oppertunity to buy the book just to read it via  Fantasy Grounds but they don't allow that unless you buy a subscription.

												A warm recommendation despite serious flaws. An unintuitive UI and connectivity problems are like deadly sins, but I never want to go back to tabletop gaming again! Fantasy Ground is sucha powerful tool that I prefer to use it even when I have my friends face-to-face in the living-room.As a player it lets me automate my character sheet to a fair degree up against itself and against the virtual tabletop through a token representation of my character. In supported games FG also let me drag-and-drop both character-creation and level-ups. I still need to do some maintainance as the drag-drop is not complete. Especially spells and powers need to be set up in the action-tab on the sheet, and some of them needs to be macroed by the player to work properly.As a GM it will make story-module usage super-easy, for their supported games. Even for their unsupported games the preparation it lets you do before session, and presentation it lets you serve during the session is superb!There is in other words a steep learning-curve and some initial problems you'll feel was entirely unnessesary because of bad software achitecture, but once you get up to speed FG is fantastic.

												This is a really expensive tool for what you get out of it but I can honestly say that I truly enjoyed using it. I think the biggest problem is that each of the DLCs are exceptionally expensive on top of the price that you pay for the tool. There are a few free DLCs available but they're currently very limited, and the tool is improving all the time. It also has a very high learning curve and doesn't lessen the preperation required before hosting a game.The one thing that I'm hoping for is a ton of fun free DLCs (PS. It's a mission creating your own as there are currently licensing laws preventing you from publishing without royalties paid to the creators of the rulesets. Which really limits the community. Free DLCs will normally only be released by the creators of the ruleset.)Who is this really for? You can normally use the free (demo) version to connect to online games if the host has the full version. So you're not required to purchase this to partake in games. Purchasing this is only recommended for long time GMs who are commited to their games and are unable to host locally all the time. I promise you that currently pen and paper and/or a printer takes just as much time to use and prepare with and if you're organized you can achieve exactly the same.The true value comes from the market. If I were the creators of this tool I would've rather taken royalties from each DLC purchase than charge this much for the tool. My group moved through my story in 3months and I gave up after that as I wasn't prepared to pay more for new DLCs.Anyway, so yes I would recommend this tool but only for long term GMs that have the cash to waste and the inability to host games locally (or technologically obsessed ones like myself that use their laptops for everything) go for it. And I have to stress this again, only for long time GMs.			"

												I've invested $65 for Fantasy Grounds and the BRP Rule-set. So far, I've had 6 hours of play just looking around and familiarizing myself with the mechanics. I was surprised to find out how user friendly creating content for your play style actually is. There are some free player-created content out there ( but I have not looked at that material yet). If you are familiar with other available tools online, there is some comparability; the table function is there, but I'm not aware of button-binding. The scrolling can be difficult, as is the movement of each row to the bottom of the list as you type. I have not seen or heard of any macro-making ability, but the mechanics of Fantasy Grounds doesn't need it to feel the satisfaction of preparing the gameplay.All and all, it is an investment, and the prices are discouraging it's Steam community from growing faster than it is; but it already has it's own community from it's website. After spending $65 (no sale) I recommend the purchase.			"

												A wonderful tool to assist in playing tabletop-style RPGs over the internet. In today's world, it is hard to get a group together on a regular basis, and Fantasy Grounds helps to make it so that those of us who love pen and paper/table RPGs can play them. The program is regularly updated and has a wide variety of user-made custom rulesets, extensions, and themes. This year, Fantasy Grounds became the only officially supported platform for D&D 5th edition online play. There are regular ""online conventions"" that allow free play for everyone, and the license and DLC structure is set so that only the DM needs to pay (I personally take donations from my players to help buy the content, and they each pitched in $15 for the ultimate license - cheaper for them than buying a full version).

It looks the best. The support is top notch. Automation and extensibility is awesome. And there is a very active community.Besides, if you want to play 5e, FG is HANDS DOWN the superior way right now. Nobody else holds a torch to FG.Only thing FG doesn't have? Webcam support. But for that, just run the free version of roll20 in the background and lay your FG interface over it. Very easy and works perfectly.Really, there is no competition.

There are no feats no items no spells. Not even classes. I was hoping for at least some standard starter pack, so you can slowly ease in to the game but from my understanding you need to pay extra for all that.

Once you are familiar with how the software works it can make tabletop gaming very enjoyable, moreso than even the real thing.

												Disclaimer: Ignore the fact it says I only have a few minutes in this game.  I use a non-steam version and have used it for at least 8 hours every week  for the past 4 months.I have a RPG group that meets every Saturday at my place.  A few months ago I bought a projector to use for showing maps and whatnot.  I started out using Roll20 but found it to be annoying at times.  I finally said screw it and tried out Fantasy Grounds, and I haven't looked back since.The only thing Roll20 had that FG doesn't have is the dynamic lighting, but that's still able to be done yourself with the masking in FG.The campaign management in FG is awesome, I love it.  It has most of the game systems you could want.  I'm currently using it for 5th Edition D&D, but will be trying it out for Shadowrun pretty soon, just for keeping notes and displaying maps, as I'll just be playing, not GM'ing.While it is a bit pricey, it's worth the one time investment if you can swing it.  The monthly license are also quite affordable if you just want to check it out first.  I had the Ultimate license prior to buying the regular version while it was on sale during the Steam summer sale.Unfortunatley, I do not have the 5th Editon PHB or Monster Manual data sets yet.  But as a DM, I find it quite easy to just put monsters in as I need them, and I don't really need the player details on my end, just the important stuff.All in all, I cannot recomment this product enough.  Doesn't matter if yo'ure using it to game online, or for live games, it's an amazing tool.  And not that I use it myself, but there's the possibility to create your own rulesets as well.			"

Then the Steam Sale happened and all was forgiven. I bought the big ultimate awesome deluxe version and a bunch of packs for it and I don't regret it. I love the intuitiveness and ease of operation.       There are some things I still can't figure out like how to get the spell ranges and that stuff to work properly on the map. It makes being a DM a cinch and I have plenty of time and utensils to make awesome campaigns. The premade campaigns are a great way to learn how the program works and buying the books for D&D or if you already own them, you just have to input JUST LIKE THE BOOK to get it to work seamlessly. I even added spells from other ED's just modified for the game we are playing.      I got 5 of my friends together and they all play off of my pack which makes people more inclined to buy the full version for themselves.

												The program claims to support Dungeons and Dragons 4th Edition games and on the very basic level it does.  Provided YOU have every single manual and every single source book, you can create a 4th edtion game and build 4th edition characters.  If you don't have these now out of print and difficult to find books, none of the DLC for Fantasy Grounds will help you.  All of the D&D material is for 5th edition, because that is the only edition for which they have a license.Now, I would normally not be upset about this.  Wizards of the Coast is notorious for making their previous products obsolete to ensure their current ones are sold like hotcakes, just look at Magic the Gathering (5 months after a collection is completed a new one is released and a year after that neither are deemed ""playable"" by serious gamers), so I understand that the developers might not be able to get the license for a gaming system the creators want to fade into ancient history.My problem is that NO WHERE on their Steam Store page or main website does it say that the DLC items are not compatible with older verson of the systems their program supports. I spent several hours searching and eventually found one after utilitizing Google Search and it was an archived post on their Forum Boards about others having a simliar issue with creating 3.5 games.  The Steam Store does, however,  celebrates the fact that the company received permission to create 5th Edition data packs, but does not clarify that the data packs are ONLY for 5th.I bought the game to help run my 4th Edition D&D game.  I returned it when I realized it couldn't.			"

												Im obviously a bit of a fan of the Fantasy Grounds platform. You can take that any way you like  - it could be a good thing or it could be colouring my review. You will have to decide that for yourself. I started using Fantasy Grounds about 5 years ago after a 25yr hiatus away from RPGs. I went online looking for a way to play F&D online and after trying everything I could get my hands on I found a couple of options that really excited me. The one that stuck out was Fantasy Grounds.It stuck out for the following reasons:1. It had a commercial license and a ruleset for Castles&Crusades which was the closest thing to the old school D&D I had last played all those years ago - and it rocked!2. It was fun to use. It was fun to throw dice and drop them on my enemy and watch it roll and determine I had hit! and all that cool stuff.3. The users were really welcoming. A lot of RPG players are quirky and quite set in our ways <grin>. These guys were still quirky and all that but were really welcoming. Id never played GURPs before and some random stranger (hola ronnke) setup a one shot game for me and I was hooked.Now after using it for quite too much time I have seen the product continue to evolve and develop continuously.I have seen the amazing things that FG does for 5e.I saw the guys go after the Wizards and keep going after them until they got them at the table and got them to see just how freaking good their platform was and get the license to publish 5e on FG.I have seen the community keep on growing with good people, people who really like to help.The developers and owners are hands-on and interact with the community - with new and old members alike.Ive made so many friends via FG. I catch up with some of them in person now. Some that live in Sydney and some when they turn up down under. My main group has players from AUS, NZ, NL and the US and Ive been playing with some of those guys for over 4 years. I regularly chat and play with people in at least 10 countries.Ive watched nervous players grow into confident GMs.And people who have never programmed in their life start writing extensions and themes and rulesets to keep shaping their hobby their way.But back to the platform itself.I have seen other good quality VTTs join the market and Ive used roll20 in 2 campaigns.They have some great features and great communities too.But Fantasy Grounds still leads the way in its feature set, its continuous development (you should see the stuff being developed for the Unity build) and its licensed rulesets and content all set it ahead of the others.Its got a learning curve. Yep - but once you let go of the fact that its UI is not like an Office application you will find it IS intuitive. And its freaking powerful.It doesnt have a dice roller that can handle all the different permutations that roll20's can (its coming but hurry up already!).It doesnt have dynamic lighting or dynamic fog of war. Again this is coming but it aint here and some groups love that feature.The GM does need a decent UPnP router or some basic networking skills or Hamachi to get things connected (Im fairly sure that this too will be easier in the Unity build but there is no official word on that one yet). If you get stuck on this point I guarantee someone will help you out if you post your issue on the boards.It often gets compared to Roll20 and people hold up Price when comparing. I love that comparison. Roll20 is not free. Someone else is paying and subsidising your free use of the platform. All those servers dont run on critical hits. If the subscribing users stop paying the doors wont stay open. Fantasy Grounds has been a commercial platform for 13 years. Its business model might be old school but its platform and features are constantly moving forward. Paying $40 to be able to play RPGs with people from around the world is a no brainer for me.If you have any questions - Im happy to answer them.And just in case you are unsure - I am a user of this platform, I dont work for SmiteWorks and I bought my own Ultimate License.

												I purchased Fantasy Grounds well before it came to Steam, and at the time, it was well worth it. It worked far better than any other Virtual Tabletop on the market. As things are, however, Fantasy Grounds is outdated, and does very little that can't be done in Roll20 for free. Not only do you have to spend a ridiculous $40 on the software, but you have to count on every other person in your group doing the same, unless you want to drop over $100 for an ultimate license.In short, if Roll20 didn't exist, this would be an excellent purchase. As it is, Fantasy Grounds would do well to annul its price of entry and simply sell pre-made adventures and rulesets.			"

												A little rough around the edges, but this seems like a pretty good alternative to roll20.com, assuming you don't mind the money-grab feel between the demo and various versions. Definitely a lot of macro based potential there, I just wish there was a bit more to the Pathfinder RPG support, as it seems to be lacking in many of the expansions, and jury-rigging abilities from various source books that are not explicitly included can get tricky.

												Me, personally yes I'd recomend it. Once you learn what you're doing it's easy to not only run a campaign but make your own homebrew classes and weapons. With that said it's not a cheep thing, but table top is not now, nor will it ever be a cheap hobby. I see a lot of reviews bashing the cost of the game, look if you're not wanting to the a gm that provides everything to your players then don't. Have them decide what they want to be and then them buy the class pack for the class they want. Unless you're willing to throw down money for an ultimate license or a ultimate license sub having everything won't help you either. But that doesn't stop you from being able to do it sans the books. You can litterally add everything from the class in by hand and just type it in.The type it in method is way more work, but if you already have the books and price is an issue then the type it in method is a work around. You don't need to sub, you don't need to pay for the modules. It's litterally that easy. Roll 20 makes you type it in as well but doesn't have the functionality and you can easily get past all of it with a little work on your own. Here's a quick how to. When you click on the class tab type the name in, select the die for the hit die and drag it into the box and then the type the level and click on caster until you get that right. On the abilitys hit the plus sign and type it in. Type in the name, and then what it does. If it does a spell or power go and add that on the spell page  by clicking the star. Having done homebrew classes this is how I had to do it because I suck at code and was not going to code in all that information.Now that won't keep track of things like spell uses and the dice mod to spells but it will do most of the work for you. It's not perfect but you can do it without spending money on the mods. It's up to how much work you're willing to do vs how much you consider your time worth. I value my time at about 20 bucks an hour. So unless I can type it all up in less than 3 hours it's worth more for me to just buy the mods.			"

												This thing took 26 attempts before it finally downloaded all of the components for the basic version.  No tutorial. No software support.  No community.  As far as I can tell it doesn't even do what it advertises.  Wasted almost two hours of my life trying to start a campaign with absolutely NO results.  The official website must be serviced by one 1600 baud modem.  Connection time outs and resets all over the place.  No help or information there at all.  Searched YouTube and watched several long winded ""how to"" videos that told me nothing but how to compile the finished adventure or how to run a premade one that you buy.  This software will NOT simplify your adventure writing life.  All I wanted was to create some maps and it was so user unfriendly that I gave up.  Hopefully my refund come through quickly.			"

												If you want sheer basic out of date rules for D&D 3rd Edition, 4th Edition and basic Pathfinder rule set go for Fantasy Grounds. If you want more out of this product, be prepared to work on .xml files to build your own ruleset that's actually up to date as the company is going to start charging for the updated rules and books. (SRD's are free and that's all their rulesets are, basic SRD's)Go for something like D20Pro or Roll20. If you need a virtual tabletop, D20Pro, if you need a virtual tabletop and ruleset go for Roll20 as at least for Pathfinder, they're working on their own SRD for free.

												Description of the game should have been a red flag: The author has a severe inability to simply describe what you're buying and what you can do with it, requiring much research. If I created a game or program, the first thing the description would do is describe it. ""You can do this.  You cannot do that.""  Instead the author says cryptic words to leave you guessing, ""supports"" 4e, et cetera.  What does that mean?  Supports? Does it have the rules?  Yes or no? To what extent? What am I buying?  Finally discovered some answers through research and thought I'd buy the game. Couldn't be that bad.Sub-Summary:  CLARIFY YOUR PROGRAM.  Program marketing 101. Looking back, this should have told me enough not to have any faith in the developers.Next issue: Registration Keys.Most steam games are linked to your account, and you can play them wherever and have fun. Some games require a registration key and are bound to a single computer, single install. This is that latter, and it's lame. But at least the developer hinted that might be the case.What they don't tell you is that you get one shot, one moment, to copy down the registration key.If you're hitting enter too fast, talking to someone, or otherwise expecting to have the registration key handy somewhere, you lose that moment.Now you can't register the game.After searching everywhere on steam and in my receipt, the code is nowhere. Searching for help tells you how to recover it... If you bought it from them, on their site.  Otherwise you should send them an email and wait days for their response, or weeks in some reports.This oversight is shocking and embarrassing, and as a terrible first impression it has destroyed all faith I had in this program and my purchase in it. The developer obviously has zero interest in accessibility and user friendliness. I did not purchase this to create problems and chores for myself. Though I was initially planning on paying a large sum of money toward several of their expansions, I will not be giving them another dime, and will be expecting a timely refund.And for the record, from what interfaces I did get to see in the game, they appeared to be thrown together as if by a kid in visual basic class.  A class that the developers probably would benefit from taking, btw.Final Summary:  Do not purchase this embarrassment.  The buyer must always have access to their registration key.  And if there is a way to access it, then it should be a simple and logical matter to find it.Shame on you, SmiteWorks. Take some pride in your work.			"

												I've had this program for a long time (since before it was available on Steam) and have since linked it to my steam profile. Having said that, I've seen alot of the upgrades and revisions that this software has seen over the years and overall it's a good program for what it was intended for. I haven't used it as much as I could have because I wasn't interested in spending the money they wanted for the ultimate edition just to get the free guest licences. But that's neither here nor there, because this review it to warn you all of a greater threat this program can hide. I just ran the auto-update today (14 April 2017, about 6:45 EST) and included with the update package was a Win\Heri virus which my Anti-Virus software promptly removed. Now the software fails to run at all. First of all, why the hell was this virus in the update package at all? Is there an angry employee at SmiteWorks as malicious as the virus they planted?Second, since the removal of the virus broke the software, I am hesitant to even bother uninstalling and reinstalling the software. Logic dictates that the virus would just try to get back into my system.Third, with other options availble (including swearing off digital tools altogether) I feel that the best option is to walk away from Fantasy Grounds at least until they address the issue.TL;DR - Latest update had virus, don't get this program right now			"

												I feel a bit ripped off by this. When I saw this, I thought ""wow, what a great way to handle all my campaign data and have it connected over the internet!"" Well, sadly, this is missing a character creator that you would expect it to have. At a total of $90 invested, and I still didn't end with a character builder... kinda silly. I sank money to get the character core pack thinking surely it was there, sadly no. Just a bunch of text files that tell me the same information that was in my PHB and DMs guide already. I don't understand how hard it is to have added a self populating and even randomized stat generating character sheet. To me this seems like basic content for a program like this. I get all the other things are great and all, but it should have a character creator, plain and simple. I'm desperately hoping the content I am wanting is just buried in the functionality and I can change this to ""recommend"", but sadly right now I would suggest people just put their money towards the books.Edit: Okay, I've found how to do what I've been looking for. Thanks to i3ullseye for the help. I have left my prior review in place because I think its important for people to know that the interface is not what I would call ""intuitive"", but it does in fact have the character features you would expect, provided you have the character core pack for the characters you want to use (I'm referring to 5E).While I've changed my recommendation, devs, please continue to work on the interface and don't rely on people watching internet videos on how to use it. D&D works just fine using the books and if someone is going to pick up software to use to make it ""easier"", it really should be that. However, it does allow users to do some pretty interesting things over distance, so for that reason, I've switched to thumbs up.Keep working as it can be better.			"

												Had some trouble with the save feature not working but after i made some noise i got a response just a day later and eventually worked out the issue. Somehow I went right past the tutorial features in the program but finally getting more hooked into these features. The program is great and I'm really looking forward to the ""Primeval Thule"" content and other upcoming additional features. Big thumbs up here!			"

												I bought ""Lost mines of Phandelver"" and ""Complete Core Pack"". And I will probably purchase all other DLCs. I am amazed, it's fantastic. It's all there: images, maps, stats, tokens, and all linked and automated. FantasyGrounds reached Epic level with this license deal. I am especially impressed with the adventure module. As a DM, this saves me many many hours of preparation. All I have to do now is simply to read it :D			"

												~: This is a hard product to review since Fantasy Grounds isn't really a game on its own, but rather a toolset to enable groups of people to play a tabletop Pen and Paper role playing game across the Internet. While there are plenty of free offerings like Roll20, Fantasy Grounds is a paid toolset that is (I think) the most expensive one. That means it has to do a lot of stuff to compete with its free bretheren...+: Fantasy Grounds is a beautiful product to just sit inside and is only missing a couple of features that its free competitors have (like SoundCloud integration on Roll20), but has a plethora of useful features that those products don't - including rulesets entirely built in with many more able to be purchased! (and only the DM needs to buy them) These built in rulesets are pretty much flawless and awesome if you're looking to run a specific campaign.+: Custom module support done through XML means if you want to add your own content or build your own ruleset, you can relatively simply. I am not a coder by any means but XML isn't difficult to pick up.+: Tons upon tons of plugins and custom content and artwork at your finger tips through the community so even if you're a DM who isn't very artsy you can make some decent looking stuff and integrate it into your campaign super easy.-: Since this is a very niche product to a specific niche community, it's hard to peg down negatives since if you're reading this you're probably interested in this kind of product anyways...the only negative I could think of really is the price. I think the product is worth the price mind you, but I think they would destroy their competitors if they released more rulesets and modules and content such as that for paid money and made the core product much cheaper. This is really the only main complaint I've ever found about Fantasy Grounds in general - the price. That said, if you are a heavy lover of PnP RPGs and can get a good core group of internet people going, you'll get so much value out of this product over time.			"
