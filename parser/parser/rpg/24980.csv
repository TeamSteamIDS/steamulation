												I think many that level bad scores and a list of complaints at Mass Effect 2 have fallen into the trap of looking at games purely as a collection of mechanics. Sure, it's another cover shooter, which taken alone is merely decent. They're right that the RPG elements are simple and at times are obtuse and too black and white. You can, at least partially, break the upgrade system by grinding resource collection. Given all that it would seem there is no reason to even play this game but you'd be wrong. This game, and the whole series, is trying to be more than just mindless entertainment. It's trying to to tell a deep, rich story, trying to get you to really care about it's characters, and it's trying to get you to think beyond the mechanics, beyond the game even. By no means is this just a story with some game attached, but the story and how your decisions effect it and it's characters are a huge part of this game.When you play this game, because to be clear, you should play it, I would urge you to try and actually role play the choices. This game brings up some pretty serious issues in some of it's choices. Issues that should stop and make you think, not just about how this will effect your game but about how you would actually feel about this in your everyday life. You can always go back and play it again and make all the ""good"" or ""bad"" choices but at least once you should really put yourself in Cmd. Sheppard's shoes, make the choices you would be comfortable making outside the game. Don't worry about what the game says your moral score is, play it to learn something about yourself.			"

												I recommend the game--just not as a digital download. The buying options on Steam are misleading (I don't think this is Steam's fault, I believe it is more of an issue with how Bioware chose to package their content); Buying the ""Digital Deluxe Edition"" DOES NOT include ALL in-game content. NONE of the DLCs are packaged into the ""Digital Deluxe Edition."" And NONE of the DLC is purchasable on Steam. This is NOT readily apparent unless you carefully read the description on Steam. Furthermore, to access the alleged extras in this DDE version, you must make a Bioware account, find the proper pages, download the alleged extras manually, and install manually before you can play them. I originally played ME 2 on PS3, having bought a disk edition that had all the DLCs included. That is your best bet for this game unfortunately. If you buy the digital download, by the time you have all the content (vanilla game + DLCs) you will be sinking WAY more money into Bioware's money grubbing hands then this 6+ year old game is worth.

												I would give both my legs for the chance to play this franchise for the first time again. No other game has moved me in such a way that mass effect has. It is just. Unbelievable. I have 42 playthroughs, one being on pc, the others being on my 360. This game is the best game I have ever had the pleasure of playing. And I can't thank Bioware enough for such a beautiful ride.Then we get to mass effect 3. EA, you complete wankstains. You endorse good games, (I'm EA Games, and this is a game to ruin on the internet) and you help produce them wonderfuly, until it gets to the end sequence, then your money instincs kick in and you want it finished in an unfinished state. So for that, ♥♥♥♥ you. But apart from that, if you're considering buying this wonderful franchise. Do yourself a lemon and buy all 3 on Origin. All 3 games in one place. I hope you all enjoy the beautiful ride as much as I have. >I have a poster of Garrus framed on my wall. The only poster I own.If only I could press the recommend button more than once.			"

												Did you know there’s a game where you can come back from death, blow up prisons, take on three factions of mercenaries, deal with wars between species, survive a Suicide Mission and get in a relationship with the hot alien you want? Nominated as the best game of the generation, winning 150 awards of Game of the Year of 2010 and building so much hype that its sequel couldn’t be more than disappointing, Mass Effect 2 is a game you have to play.      Even if you didn’t play the first one, you won’t be left in the dark, people will tell you what’s the deal and the codex has all the extra details. If you played the first one, then you’ll enjoy the fact that your choices carry over and have some weight on what’s happening.      The combat involves 3rd person camera, using your class specific abilities and guns and giving commands to your squadmates and it has an interface made for PC. There are 6 classes and each of them are varied enough for every playthrough to feel like a fresh experience. Some are more power based, other weapon focused, but all of them do damage and are awesome and you’ll definitely find your type, whether you like to make shockwaves in the enemy lines, hack the robots, pull them in a singularity, cloak yourself and shoot them in the back or simply slow down time to shoot them while they wonder what’s happening with them. There are difficulties that vary from casual from insanity, so whether you play games for their story or want to dominate the dominators, you’ll find what you want. 


Game Over; for them

 Many will say the story is great. I say it’s a good one, but that its characters make it to be one of the best. 80% of it you recruit team members and gain their loyalty(only if you want to). They all prove themselves to be interesting and you’ll have enough dialogue options to find out what makes them tick. On your ship, there is going to be the hyperactive mad(ish) scientist, the hot secretary, the crazy all powerful ♥♥♥♥♥, the assassin with regrets, the best friend who took a rocket in his face and is 99% of the time in the middle of some calibrations, a lizard hulk who calles himself “Grunt”, the gun expert that does 663 abs each day,  the cute engineer whose face you’ll never see and some more. You’ll have the options to get involved in their lives. Some of them will argue and you’ll be the one to settle the conflict. Depending on your gender, some of them are available and open to ideas. 


Now I am motivated to go into the Suicide Mission

The last mission a.k.a. The Suicide Mission is what makes everything in the game pay off. It’s the place where the catharsis is unleashed. The place where your love for this game will be cemented.  Whatever you’ve done, there will be consequences and by that time, you’ll care.  If you’ll fail hard, you’ll cry hard. But if you’ve upgraded the ship and made the smart choices throughout the game and in the last minutes, you’ll be overjoyed and feel like you’ve won 1 million dollars.  All in all, Mass Effect  2 is a great experience, when you’ll play it you’ll live your second life, one where you’re saving the galaxy you enjoy being into.

												If you havent played the original Mass Effect, this game is still a must play. You wont be lost as to whats going on, as long as you check out the codex section on the in-game menu. This game is AMAZING and the story line, voice acting, graphics and overall gameplay are all impressive. This game is ahead of its time, dont miss it.From the ominous opening music, until the final decisions through the Omega-4 Relay are made, the perfection builds every step of the way. Sure, there are many cinematic games that play like a novel and are fantastic but Ive never been pulled into a game with a ""need to play"" like ME2 has done.The diversity of the characters and backstory make you feel as if this universe has been developed for a long, long time, and you are only now being introduced to it. The characters make you care about them with their depth, and this increases moreso as the game goes on. I've never experienced anything like it, and Bioware really set the bar with dialogue and character interaction. The ""choices' you are given never feel like lines from a bad movie, like so many games, but are believable and accurate to the story and what you intended to say.The game itself is an exciting RPG/3rd Person Shooter. When you start you can choose from a few classes. Some are excellent at biotic powers and some are just for shooting things the old fashion way. I chose soldier and because of that I had very little biotic powers. I could slow down time but that's about it. The biotic side of the game for me was my crew mates. You level them up along with yourself when you gain squad points. As you add skill points to a skill it becomes stronger until you reach full potential then you have two versions of it to choose from. The gunplay in the beginning of the game was a little boring but it became really fun once you were able to upgrade and get new versions of your weapons. That added a lot of depth to the combat. There are also different types of ammo to use that increases your weapons attributes. Nothing is more satisfying then freezing an enemy an watching them implode.When a game ropes you in, like this one did for me, and creates that yearning to play, the developer has done their job. This game plays like an epic film, but one that creates a universe that I think is on par with any of the great space-epic movies and tv series, and that alone is something. This game is a pivotal point for me in regards to gaming, and it has changed the way I will evaluate and appreciate all games in the future.Simply put, one of the best game I've ever played...			"

""They tell me it's a suicide mission. I intend to prove them wrong.” I still have vivid memories how, on that fateful day in 2010, the delivery truck pulled up at my home with this game deep within. No ordinary truck, this one was holy white, and the gold delivery logo sparkled like a thousand suns, reflected through shards of the purest ice formed with unadulterated water collected at the beginning of the universe. The driver, clad in a robe, coloured in the softest and purest white I have ever laid eyes upon, floated towards me on a cool fog of a hundred fire extinguishers. He smiled benevolently, like a father looking down upon his only child, and handed me a package wrapped in gold, beaten thin to the point where you could see through it. As I touched the package, our eyes met and my soul was filled with an unearthly serenity, never felt before in my short and humble life. Suddenly we were standing in space, surrounded by the debris of countless destroyed ships and asteroids. At the far distance was a gigantic black hole and I knew with every fibre of body, that this was the destination I had to reach to fulfil my mission. The next moment we were back on Earth, and I did not have to sign, because this angelic being could see within my heart, and knew that – as paragon of the good – I was pure. Upon opening the package, an angelic choir started to sing, and reached a crescendo as I placed the DVD into the drive of my PC. Instantly, my antiquated equipment transformed into the latest state of the art technical marvel. The game knew where to go, and installed itself within a blink of an eye into the right folder without any help from me – all the while, the choir sang praises to the almighty digital god. With trepidation, I clicked on the ‘play the game’ button, and was instantly immersed in one of the most impressive action role-playing games I have ever played, with a brilliant atmosphere and memorable companions, all within the framework of a fantastic science fiction setting.Amusing quotes:“It's so much easier to see the world in black and white. Gray? I don't know what to do with gray.”“Have killed many, Shepard. Many methods. Gunfire, knives, drugs, tech attacks, once with farming equipment. But not with medicine!”“What could I possibly be suggesting? I mean, a young woman gets rescued by a dashing commander who lets her join his crew and then goes off to save the galaxy? How could she possibly develop any kind of interest in him?”“Doesn't matter who you are - you got a gun in your face, chances are good you'll do what the other man says. Only two types don't buckle at that point: trained killers and psychopaths. Lot of people can't tell the difference.”Achievements:The game has no Steam achievements.

												Compared to Mass Effect 1, Mass Effect 2 is equally as amazing. It lost a little bit of the RPG feeling, however, with the combat improvements, it makes up for it greatly. The cover system is a lot better and the skills are just a lot easier to use, especially when it comes to the squadmates. The player would just have to press Q or E to make that specific squatmate use a power. The music is stunning, as always. If you like Star Wars KOTOR or anything made by BioWare, you will love Mass Effect. 10/10""Report to the ship ASAP. We'll bang, okay?""			"

												Mass Effect 2 is the sequal to one of my favorites, Mass Effect. The second edition to the series is by far the best one I've played yet. There are so many small improvements that made this game even better than the first. I'm not saying the first isn't worth trying at all because it is an awesome story in itself! However, with this sequal I found it to have it's jaw dropping moments and being able to see old faces from the first game and have them in the squad had that awesome old friend feeling that made a deep connection with the game. I loved this sequal and I suggest you give it a try!			"

												Mass Effect 2 is an adventure I will never forget.In my personal opinion, Mass Effect 2 is one of the best sci-fi RPGs ever made, the world Bioware created is unique, diverse and wonderful, not to say everyone is hugging eachother while hopping over rainbows.The game presents you with many moral and ethical choices, an exmaple is a mission which requires you to blow up a mass relay, but doing so will destroy a colony with over 300.000 residents, but if you don't do it the system will get invaded by the Reapers. (Giant robots with lasers, you have to play the game to understand.)You truly get to form your own personality in the game, do you assert and be a badass, or do you show compassion and be a hero? as you advance in either direction you unlock new dialogue options and actions, ranging from giving someone a hug to kicking someone out of a window.Every crew member has a very devloped personallity, and you will feel attached to most of them, you can even develop relationships and they aren't limited by species or gender (Sadly, you can't be gay, only lesbian, this confused me a little).You can do them personal favors to make them loyal to you, increasing your chance of survining the suicide mission at the end of the game, I have seen some of my beloved crewmembers die in my first playthrough, I was actually crying over the death of a fictional character.But Mass Effect is still a game, not a futurustic dating sim, you can choose to skip the romance entirely, and you don't have to recruit certain crew member sif you don't want.The gameplay is solid, sometimes the 'one-button-does-everything' system gets confusing, running, taking cover and interacting with things is all bound to one button, which can lead to confusion sometimes.When you start the game you get to choose a class, some specialize in weapons, others in tech (this means you get to use combat drones, tech to drain shiles and incinerate or freeze enemies from a distance, and others in biotics (space magic, you get to lift people of the ground, or throw them a few feet away or you can spawn tiny black holes), most of these powers are well balanced and satisfying to use, some of them feel a bit silly though. (I'm looking at you, shockwave..)You can explore a lot of different star-systems, you can scan planets for resources and you may just find a secret side-mission, these do feel a bit cheesy sometimes though. (you enter a hidden facility and the merc leader just keeps saying 'you shouldn't have come here, prepare to die').Whenever you investigate a planet you get a little information about it, like the surface temperature, atmospheric pressure, even travel advisory sometimes, and some even have traces of past civillizations who were space-faring long before that fish with legs on earth crawled out of the water to eventually become a monkey.Mass Effect 2's soundtrack is great, the music in the main missions really made me feel like I was in a dire battle to save the galaxy from detruction, the music that plays during the suicide mission is just.. damn, I still get goosebumps from it, it's truly an epic piece.Sadly, Mass Effect does have it's weak-points, as missions can feel a bit repetitive sometimes, hub-worls are smaller than they were in Mass Effect 1 and DLC is obtained in a very annoying way, you have to make a Bioware account and buy Bioware points with real money, these points you can then spend on the DLC, I would prefer to buy DLC directly through steam without using these Bioware points.If you want to play DLC you need to be online when you launch the game, otherwise it simply won't load or show up.There are also a few annoying bugs that never got adressed, sometimes I run into an object and get teleported on-top of it, then I either have to wait until I die or I have to quit to the main menu and then load the save again, sometimes during conversations characters are facing the wrong person or are doing some really weird stuff with their head.Mass Effect 2 is an epic game, and I would reccomend every RPG or Sci-Fi fan to give it a try, there is a whole galaxy full of different races, friends and foes to explore!

												Storywise, there is nothing above this one. The graphics are great. Sound is amazing. I dont't know why these muppets decided to ruin the experience by adding TWO layers of DRM to the game, steam and also the cerberus network which is origin. I was also annoyed by the fact that i had to buy DLC even if i bought the digital deluxe edition...the shadow broker DLC is no longer included and you have to buy it seperately. Overall a great game with a lot of additional DLC that has to be bought for bioware points....jeez. Still, the gaming experience is great and the possibility of importing a savegame from ME1 with gameplay effects from all your previous decisions is marvelous.Recommended for masochistic double DRM dunces who are not afraid to pay extra for DLCs.

												One of the best games of the current decade, perhaps even the best. I've beaten this game countless times before on console and it still feels as fresh and immersive as ever. The character design, the combat, the visuals, the writing; everything is on point.The only downsides there are at the moment is the fact that the DLC isn't available on Steam, and the class balance is a bit wonky. Infiltrator and Sentinel stand head and shoulders above everything else, and Engineer is borderline useless. Outside of these minor issues, there's absolutely nothing wrong with this game in my opinion. Just play it already.			"

												My favourite from the trilogy.+Amazing soundtrack.+Probably the best cast of characters in any ME game, Thane and Garrus being my absolute favourites. ""Killing is an art and i am a master."" How can't you like the lizard with that bad ♥♥♥ lizard voice.+Great sidequets, unlike those in the first game which made me want to jump from the 5th floor of my building. No filler and fetch quests here.+Amazing DLC, especially Shadow Broker which is probably the best piece of DLC i played in my life. Arrival is also good, as well as Katsumi story DLC.+Better gunplay than in the first game. +Great replay value (paragon/renegade, diffrent classes, male and female characthers also have some diffrent dialogue options.+Did i mention this game has an amazing bad ♥♥♥ lizard (

												What no one seems to mention is almost none of the DLC is included even after all this time. Not once, and I don't mean like it feels like it, I literally mean not a single damn time has the DLC ever gone on sale, it's still the same exact price it ever was and you have to go through Bioware.com to get it.You have no idea how much that pisses me off.It's one of my favorite games of all time too, it really makes me sad that after all this time Bioware can't just give us a complete version without needing to drop what is now more then the price of entry to get the full story that can be played. So freaking selfish.Remind me to never buy a EA game on sale without doing my homework ever again, let my failing be your lesson, my friends.Since someone was ""nice"" enough to ask for it, Here is my full review.                                                Mass Effect 2One of my favorite games of all time. I’ve played it from beginning to end, probably somewhere upwards of three to four times at least. I’ve owned it on both PC and PS3 before. In fact I still have some DLC from both versions through Bioware.comThere’s a lot to love here. It was an expansive sequel to Mass Effect that in your choices from the first game show up here, the gameplay was radically improved upon and the game just looks absolutely stunning!                                                        StoryFrom a storytelling point of view this game is absolutely gaming fodder. In the tradition of the best RPGs you go out looking for your merry (well some of them are merry at least) group of followers. It’s got almost a Seven Samurai vibe going on here. You have to hunt down an assassin whom is forever cursed with the ability to relieve any of his memories perfectly forever. A loyal space marine haunted by the fate of what ever happened to his father. The loyal (or is she?) right hand woman to the corporation that has brought you back from brink of death itself. Old friends and some interesting new ones are met as well.                                   It feels like a good bottle of port.                              Very smooth and relaxing to take it all in.Without spoiling anything major story wise, I’ll just say it added to it in all the right ways. Really made the game shine giving you so much more immersion you really end up wanting to play through to find out how your choices unfold and where these characters might end up.                                   Sets a great stage for the last game.                                                   Presentation                                            Well, it sure is pretty.The difference here is akin to comparing Witcher 1 to Witcher 3. It holds up remarkably well with age. It looks like it could come out today on the PC. My only gripe would be it could with a small update give us a wee bit more access to under the hood settings wise but that may be a tad unrealitic of me of Bioware. The game sizzles with amazing on screen effects, sound is really the main winner here though. Voice acting is the bar other games should set for itself. This game is pretty much one of the best voiced games I’ve ever heard to this day, easily in my top five. Witcher 3 and The Walking Dead season 1 edge it out just barely here in my book.                                                     GameplayOooo, it’s really fun this time around. It’s a cover shooter for sure, it has RPG underpinnings. Think small but powerful skill trees that equal up to either amazing combat abilties or skills to be used in game to help turn events or avoid combat all together, almost somewhere between Deus Ex and Call of Duty. It’s a lot of fun. It’s a squad based game so you almost always have a few allies in the thick of it with you which is really fun and makes combat managable but never impossible. I would say if you like action games, with light tactical consideration this a great contender for you.                                                    Lasting appeal.                                         Well it’s obviously a classic.I don’t particular enjoy the 3rd game which this one builds up towards well. So that's not what hesitates me to recommend this edition of Mass Effect 2. That would be like hating on Empire for Return.  That being said I’ve owned it multiple times which is something I don’t do often. It is a blast to play. But once again, my primary hesitation here is the lack of DLC missing from the current editions. The DLC is amazing content but after so many years it’s still just missing from the game they currently sell via steam and also on consoles. They don't label this at all. Which to me is deceiving. It’s their choice to charge full price after all these years for something that actually fills in plot holes story wise. I really want to recommend this game to you but it kills me a little bit inside how much I and many others have already given them money wise that they won’t just give people this content for free or at least at a huge price cut after almost seven years. I want you to have it I just don't want you to spend almost 30 dollars plus the cost of the base game to get it!   I refuse to pay more than I paid for the game itself for all this content. That and some of the content I bought in the past is missing from my Bioware account no less (not all of it but Lair of the Shadow Broker for example). I would go on but my first review is my honest reaction to buying this game only to find out after the return policy ran out that I have to rebuy content for a seven year old game not via steam but throguh an almost ancient website by todays standards and drop almost thirty dollars for story content (and that's not even all the content). Take what you will from this review and just know that I’m just trying to be honest with you about how this whole thing made me feel so that at the very least you might make a more informed decision then I did.

 BEST. GAME. EVER. EDIT: I never expected for my review to get to the top of the reviews section of ME2 store page, thank you fellow gamers! That's why I'm adding a few more things to it and separating it in sections. English is not my native language so please note that I'll probably have a ton of mistakes here, and I also have a very limited vocabulary. I'm trying my best. Also please note that you'll probably lose more time reading this review than actually playing the game. :)*** **** ****If you played Mass Effect 1, then I'm pretty sure that you'll like this one even better. Also, if you played ME1, you know the story. If you didn't play it, go and play it. NOW. It's a game that everyone should play atleast once in their lives. I could write a review as long as  ""War and Peace""  is about who's your character, what are you up to, what kind of weapons do you have and similar, but still I feel like I just couldn't say everything. This is one of the games you can't experience by just simply reading about it on wikipedia or watching walkthrough videos or reading reviews and deciding is it good enough or not - you just need to feel it.  Bugs and gameplay I experienced zero bugs ! , and I can't say that for the first part. Obvious improvements are made. And finally that annoying elevator music, news, conversations and scenes are in the past! And no more exploring planets by that stupid unstable Mako thing. Combat is improved, much easier, you can use cover much easier, and squad power usage is simplified and very easy to use for fast combo kills. Decisions and storyline The importance of your decisions! I think that's what makes this game so good. I imported a ME1 character and loved how decisions I made affected almost everything I did in ME2. There is almost no right or wrong in this game. You should just play and make decisions the way you think you would if it was real life, and see how would that turn out. Also, ME1+ME2 decisions make a HUGE impact to storyline (main and DLC too) in Mass Effect 3. Unfortunately ME3 is not available on Steam.The story of this game is simply breathtaking. This time story doesn't develop that much around Shepard as it develops around his squadmates and crew members. ME2 is more personal, more sentimental than ME1. Relationship between Shepard and his squadmates is deeper and more complex. Also there are more romance options, and they are great!  DLCs Unfortunately by buying Digital Deluxe on Steam you don't get much DLCs. Also only way to purchase the DLCs that are not included in the DD are through Bioware Blog which is super annoying and super expensive. For example, DD cost me 5 euros, and just the  Shadow Broker DLC  costs 8 euros. If you plan on buying them,  Shadow Broker  is pretty much worth the money. Also  Arrival gives  you a new perspective of the story.  Kasumi's Stolen Memory  and  Zaeed's The Prince of Revenge  are okay, if you want a new squadmate with new combat abilities, but can't develop a relationship or romance. Other DLCs offer alternate appereances, weapons and armors but are not very necessary nor important for the story.  Summary You know it's a good game when the game makes you feel that you want it to be real and to be a part of it, no matter the cost. Well, this game made me feel that way. Only thing I don't like about this game is that it ends. This is, by far, one of the best gaming experiences I have ever had. I even dare to say that it actually is the best.P.S. I am not a very good writer, but I am very passionate when it comes to games so if you want a great story, decent shooting/killing, good graphics, want to feel like a hero and save the galaxy once again, then this is the game for you.

												The Mass Effect Trilogy is, hands down, the greatest video game series of all time right up until the last 15 minutes, and many consider Mass Effect 2 to be the best of the series.This is a crowning achievement of the RPG, sci-fi, and shooter genres that may never be matched.That being said, there are a few downsides to buying this on Steam vice Origin.First, Origin offers the entire trilogy for around $30, which is $5 less than you'll be able to get Mass Effect 1&2 for on Steam, and identical in price to the ME2 DDE offered through Steam.  Steam is unable to offer any such deal because Mass Effect 3 was hosted exclusively through Origin.Additionally, Origin has a much more convenient system for getting a hold of the DLC, especially if you purchase the trilogy as a set (which includes the two DLC packs for the original game, which have compatibility issues if installed any other way).  There are three large packs of story DLC for ME2 - Overlord, Lair of the Shadow Broker, and Arrival, which amount to around 10-15 hours of additional gameplay depending on your difficulty setting.  Additionally there's a bonus mission in which you [SPOILER ALERT] explore the crash site of the original Normandy. [SPOILERS END HERE]  There are two DLC companion characters, both of which appear in the third game if they survive, and several weapon, armor, and companion customization packs.  None of these are required, though at a minimum I recommend buying Lair of the Shadow Broker and Arrival due to the impact they have on setting up ME3.You should absolutely buy this game.  You just have to decide whether or not you want to go with Origin.			"

												This is truly one of my favorite games of all time, if not the very favorite. I've probably played through it 4 or 5 times on console and just had to do it again on PC. This game is absolutely incredible. You're seriously cheating yourself out of a great game if you pass this one by. The graphics are amazing, even for the continous progress of graphics in newer games. The soundtrack is unbeatable. Jack Wall did a terrific job on this game and everything you hear fits the atmosphere and intesity of whatever given situation you're in nearly perfectly. The story is inspiring and as deep as you care to make it. I don't want to reveal content, it's best to experience on your own and take it is as you go along. Aside from base story, every character has their own personalities, dialouges, and loyalty missions. You really grow connected to your crew and want to get to know them, and ultimately survive with them. I don't really think you find this degree of character connection anywhere else. Bioware really nailed it. If you haven't played the first game, I recommend it, but it isn't at all necessary. Story is filled in early on and you shouldn't feel confused or lost at all. On top of all this, Mass Effect 2 is completely replayable with different courses of action and character builds. My 22 hours were only a single completion run, and there is room for much more entertainment than that from this game.If nothing else, give this game a try. It's a masterpeice that shouldn't be ignored.			"

												A title modern, innovative and fascinating, that's what Mass Effect 2, which continues the plots woven in the first chapter, shaking the roots to the canons of Western RPG and finding a balance between action and narrative that certainly leave its mark. Dialogues exciting and epic alternate with discussions of banal everyday life and camaraderie, giving rise to what has become a television series fiction serials, animated by characters full of nuances with which BioWare takes the luxury of tackling any kind of issue with a mature language and ironic. For some, perhaps, the turn from action adventure that took the crew of the Normandy will be a hard blow to be collected, but also for them we do not see sufficient reason why Mass Effect 2 is not a title to play completely.

												I can finally sprint outside of combat.---edit---I am greatly disappointed in one thing though, this version does not include some of the dlc. For example, the PS3 version included all of the dlc's such as the Lair of the Shadowbroker (which is hands down one fo the best dlc's ever), the extra character Kasumi, etc. This version only has Zaeed and a few weapons. When I found out it would likely cost me another $20 USD for the rest of the dlc, it left a bit of a sour taste in my mouth. I was hoping it would be the same version as the ps3 release, but it's not.If you have a ps3, you can get the fully-loaded copy of it for $11 on amazon. It's a must better deal than this, since all of the exra dlc's must be bought through Bioware/EA's website, and there are no sales on those dlc's from what I've seen.This game is one of my favorite RPG's ever. The game itself is absolutely fantastic, and with all the dlc's, there is a TON of content to enjoy. I'm giving it a negative review, because I thought it had all of the content for it, and it does not. There is nothing deluxe about it. Just a few free gimmicks, and a link to another site where you'll have to sink about another $20 to get the rest of the good content.So it's really a question of value. $11USD for all of the content for PS3, or $40-$50USD (when not on sale) for PC. How they can still charge this much, when I got the PS3 version years ago for $20CAD is beyond me.			"

My personal opinion:First of all, if you haven’t played and completed yet the first past of the ‘Mass Effect’, then I strongly-strongly-strongly suggest you buy it and complete it! You would miss many funny and serious links in between the Mass Effect one and two if you didn’t do it!  The game improved much since the first part, and, of course, came a few new issues, but non of them serious. → Here is my ‘Mass Effect 1’ preview ← if you interested in it. There aren’t repetitive side-quests, and it works well on ‘Windows 7’ and 10 64bit without hacking.  As it was in the first part of ‘Mass Effect’, at close to the end of the game, the story and the action dramatically blows up, and gives you an incredible interest! For me, the end cutscenes were better than a film! Of course, it depends on your decisions, if you want see the same as I did, then google it the ‘No one left behind’ achievement for more information.  Recommendation:I can recommend it to them who;   Liked and completed the first part of ‘Mass Effect’.  Like Sci-fi stories.  Like to talk with non human species.  Like to behave as you are. (Or at least similar what you are.)  Future atmosphere.  Achievement hunting:There’s no Steam achievements, but there’s in-game achievements. So, your Average-Steam-Achievement-Rate won’t increase or decrease with this game. It was a good news for me. ✅			"

												If you're here reading this, I'm assuming you're one of two people.1) You heard about how amazing this game is and you're wondering if you should buy it. 2) You played the first ME and are wondering if this one is worth buying. For the first group of people, I have a very simple response. GO PLAY ME1! Trust me when I say you will be grateful that you did. First, it's an incredible game and it won't be a waste of your time. But most importantly, it will make this one feel so much more satisfying. Yes, it isn't ""necessary"" to play the first game. However, since this game follows the storyline of the exact same character from ME1, I believe it is more than worthwhile to experience the beginning adventures of Commander Shepard. The actions you take and the people you meet in the first game WILL import into this one. For that reason alone it is worth playing ME1 before ME2. If you are the second group, let me highlight some of the key differences between the two. This game focuses a lot less on aimless exploring and more on progressing the story. Some of the quests even have timers on them and force you to progress at certain points. Your party members are an integral part of your adventure and in my opinion, have a lot more to share with you and are able to build better relationships with Shepard. The Mako has been replaced with a planet scanner, yes this means there is a lot less world exploration, but there is still plenty of time consuming extra missions to partake in. You can have pets, whom I killed multiple times. Has anyone figured out the key to keeping your space goldfish alive? And, for my personal favorite...there is no inventory. None. Nada. But, I made my armor purple so that's pretty cool I guess. You win some you lose some. Overall this game is a big update on the first. To me, they felt like two very different games that meet at a central focal point. That central point is Shepard, who stays true to who they were in the first game. And isn't that what ME is all about?			"

												Negative review regarding completely screwed DLC system not the game itself. As of this past month or so EA has magically made this game along with a crap load of the DLC free WHICH I PAID FOR VIA STEAM AND HAVE NEVER, EVER BEEN ABLE TO ACCESS BECAUSE ORIGIN IS SH!T. You get like three different CD keys for one single game because of course that makes sense. You are supposed to take these over to EA's site and register them via origin, except it doesnt work. The keys provided by steam do not work. Furthermore, getting a steam account linked to origin is an even greater pain and then ascertaining whether all the DLC is actually accesible to run via steam at that point is not something the average consumer should have to deal with. There is no excuse for this. The main story of this game is amazing. I just re installed origin and am currently getting  a free copy of the game along with all the DLC and more than I received here FOR MONEY ive never been able to enjoy because of this convoluted system. Attempting to buck steam and force people to use your lousy proprietary games client is not a good strategy. Releasing something you call a ""digital deluxe edition"" which does not include every last piece of DLC that has or will ever exist for the game and in fact includes less than 20 Percent of the available expansion content is ethically reprehensible. Is EA really not making enough money? Is ripping off the consumer really necessary just to make a profit? I have now paid for this game in two separate locations. Once on Xbox 360 and again on PC. I received a digital deluxe key for my PC copy on steam but have NEVER been able to access the content and you wont be able to either dont fall for this crap Steam ought to ban EA from selling any game on here again ever for this pathetic system. I am writing this review now because after multiple years EA has done jack all to make their DLC systems more consumer friendly and newer EA games suffer from the same convoluted issues. These measures do not prevent piracy but actually encourage it when paying customers are forced to look for pirated content to supplement the part of their game they were cheated out of. Despite Mass Effect 1 and 2 being my favorite modern science fiction fantasy I have refused to buy three and will likely not buy andromeda either because I refuse to give more money to people who seem so hell bent on stealing it. Dont buy this here. In fact dont buy it at all go download origin EA will give it away for free because their broken DLC model makes it more profitable for them to give you over half the game for free then attempt to nickel and dime you for things that shouldve been included on release rather than just selling a complete and well-polished game for a solid price.

												One of the best story games ever. Yeah, you read it right. I DO recommend this game, but NOT on steam because you won't be able to buy the dlcs(there are some important dlcs, believe me) or even continue the series since Steam has cut ties with EA. In my opinion, this game is the best if you play from ME 1 until the end (ME3).But... If you don't really mind not playing the sequel or buy any dlcs, then go ahead (although it wouldn't be worth it buying alone) Pros: 1. One of the first(if not THE FIRST) story-based game series where you get to make bonds with your extraterrestrial comrades and friends 2. Heavily story based3. A decision making gameCons: 1. Steam doesn't have the sequel game, the Origin does.P.S : I do know that the game does allow you to transfer the save files to the sequel, and that you can buy the dlcs at their own website. When I said you can't, I meant you can't buy the complete trilogy and all the dlcs in Steam. And have a complete set of your favorite game trilogy			"

Pros:Graphics. This game came out 7 years ago, and it still looks good.Fantastic soundtrack.Writing is phenomenal - The overall story is well thought out, and masterfully paced.Crew characters have an amazing depth to them. Writing and voice acting is on point. Crew interaction and potential romances are well executed.Gameplay is solid. They hit an excellent balance between action and drama.Combat. It's a cover based squad shooter, with various character abilities. Character leveling, plenty of weapons and upgrades. It's a great mix of action, tactics, and RPG elements.Hard choices that actually matter.Cons:DLC - You have to visit bioware.com to download and install DLC, and I'm pretty sure the DLC is the same price it was at launch. 7 years ago.

 Best. Game. Ever. What is mass effect 2? Its the greatest choice's matter space action game out there. Mass Effect 2 brings a whole new style of play from Mass Effect 1. Mass Effect 2 is most likely the best Mass Effect game to start out on. Mass Effect 3 is the worst of them all, But its still okay. PROS. +You can make your own Shepard(character).+Choose your style of play, Stand back, Snipe em all. Or run in blazing guns shooting them in the head.+You can get a boyfriend or girlfriend, Depending on your gender.+Your team is your choice. Bring a doctor and a sniper, Bring a sniper and a scout, Bring a scout and a doctor.+The choices effect you and the world around you. Just like Life Is Strange and the tell tale game's.+Story is great.+Combat is the best combat.+Best voice acting and graphics for a 2012 game! CONS. -Not all DLC Is on steam.-Don't got a choice to what race you wanna be.-Some choices seem good, But thier really bad choices.-Can't custom your character's voice nor lips.(if you wanna make your character look like yourself or quiet from metal gear solid 5, you need lip custom ._.) OVERALL. 10/10, This game is the best outta the mass effect series and will hook you into the story and combat.			"

												The Mass Effect series is one of the best (If not, then it is the best) series that I have ever played. With phenomenal music, gameplay and a magnificent storyline. If you have not played this game, I highly recommend it. If you have not played it and have no disire to play it, you're dead to me. Though the third installation of the Mass Effect series felt like it was lacking something, I enjoyed it. All in all, buy the games. It will be worth your money! :)			"

												My review on the first Mass Effect game racked up a bit of a following, so I though I might try a review on the second one. And while I'm at it, I will give out my opinion on the third one, too, as it isn't avaliable on Steam and I can't write a proper review on it anywhere else than here. Well, here it goes.Here's a bit of backstory; When I first heard about Mass Effect, it was just after the third game came out, and everyone was pretty irritated about the ending. I thought, ""Hey, this game looks pretty cool, despite what seems to be a pretty ♥♥♥♥♥♥ ending."" And thats all I did. I thought. It wasn't till late 2016 that I got a beefy PC, and thought now was a good time to play all the games that I wished I could play earlier but couldn't get the chance to. I bought a few games here and there, but then thought about that game that had an amazing cult following and sexy alien lovemaking. So, I got on here and bought the first two games. All I want to do now, is to spread the love of this game to newcomers, to get people involved with the series. One of the biggest mistakes you could ever make in your career of casual game-playing. would be to skip this series, and not enjoy its marvelous story, characters, and atmosphere. The second one, for me, was amazing. The humor continued excellently, the characters grew in the best way possible, and the story branched out, making it an even better Space Opera. The edition of Squad loyalty missions was a huge improvement, making your journey with your characters sincere and meaningful. Characters from the first game made a comeback too, but some came back changed and different. And if you were sensible and played the first one first, and brought over your save so you could continue your journey to its fullest extent, then you have, quite possibly, the best Space-Action, Story-Driven, Romance-Fueled, Humor-Filled tale around.As for Mass Effect 3, its biggest flaw, for me, was not playing it on Steam. I had to go and download Origin, had to once again come up with a password that I will likely forget in a few months, and buy the game on a platform that I don't know how to  use. But it was all worth it. Mass Effect 3 is, in my opinion, really special. It was the end of the trilogy, and the Reapers (You will all be saying that word in Javik's accent soon enough, don't worry) have finally arrived, and Shepard's story comes to a close. Mass Effect 3's story was exciting, it had all the loveable crew back, and ended the series, in my opinion, perfectly. I won't spoil it for all of you that haven't played it yet, but the ending, depending on your actions, can be either bittersweet, or out-right terrible for everyone in the galaxy. But at the end of the day, the ending is tailored to you, and the choices you picked for Shepard. Due to the ending, the music, the conversations, the story, the romance, and DLC (Even though all the DLC costs more that the game itself, and unrightfully so), made this game my favorite in the series.Please, all of you that have not played Mass Effect, please go play it. It went from being a series that I had heard about, but never really took the time to play, to being my favorite series ever. And to all the people that have played them all, go back and play 'em again. It's worth it. Andromeda is around the corner, and it couldn't hurt to go back and refresh your memory. I'll hopefully see you all in Andromeda!Overall Rating: The whole series deserves a 10. Wouldn't want to miss this experience for anything.			"

												The game itself is good but too many parts of the storyline comes in form of dlc, this would not be a problem or particulary strange if those dlc were available via steam but they are not.To get the real full pack you have to access to the clunky bioware shop, yes their own shop not even EA's Origin, where this dlc is stored. If this anoyance was not enough those dlc on biowares shop have not had a price drop since launch, neither have they had any sort of sale as steams does time to time, actually there isn't even a ""get all the dlc"" pack deal.I was looking forward to finish the trilogy but I don't want to play an incomplete game and neither I'm willing to pay for the ""additional content"" several times what I paid for the supposed core game. I feel cheated by this pricing policies and have decided to draw my line here. I'm sorry bioware but for me mass effect ended with the first installement.			"

												Mass Effect 2 was the first game in the Mass Effect Universe I ever played. Perhaps as a result of this, it is also my favorite in the entire series. Without spoiling anything for anyone who has yet to play the series, I won't talk about 1 or 3, neither will I discuss the plot, other than to say it is epic, amazing, and drew me in the way Millions were drawn in by Harry Potter. With that little disclaimer out of the way, Mass Effect 2 follows the story of Mass Effect 1, including whatever choices you made, as the consequences are felt while playing Mass Effect 2. If you did not import a save from 1, don't be afraid, you will get some of the backstory anyway. The playstyle, reminds me a lot of Knights of the Republic series in some ways, as you can slot weapons with upgrades, have various types of weapons to choose from, and so forth. Leveling up works in much the same way. Visually speaking, I think the graphics are excellent with Mass Effect 2, though I played it on the PS3 and not the PC yet, so I am unfamiliar with any graphical differences. As you progress through the story you acquire new members to your crew who can be chosen to form your team when landing on planets or going on missions. You are able to explore the galaxy using Mass Effect gates, and can go to individual planets within star systems, as well as moons, ship-wrecks and more. There are hundreds of side quests to do, as well as personal quest chains for each companion you acquire. Your ship, the Normandy can also be upgraded with the resources you acquire. These upgrades are not mandatory, but remember, every choice you make impacts the story in the end.In all, I would say Mass Effect 2 is a fantastic game and should be a part of anyone's library who loves First person, story driven, sandbox universe action. I highly, highly recommend playing the series in order from the first Mass Effect, so that you can have a story carried over through the end of the series based on the decisions you make. This will enhance your immersion in the game and is worth the cost of buying all three. I hope you enjoy this game as much as I have.			"

												This one is the best in the series. If you asked Mass Effect fans which one is the best, they will say the 2nd one, hands down.Its just better overall. The combat is smoother and more fluid, and easier to get used to. The voice acting is wonderful, and the characters memorable. And the best thing is that you can see all the people you fought with in the 3rd and final game (if you keep your character throughout the whole series).Its one of my favourite games ever, in my top 5.

												A worthy sequel of Mass Effect.This game has much more humour in it. Many new, great and diverse characters (and old ones too). I really liked their interesting and rich backstories.More side-quests. All environments are different and more varied compared to the first Mass Effect. There are no inventory or item drops. You just upgrade the core items (sniper, heavy pistol, heavy weapon, shotgun, assault rifle, submachine gun) with the modifications you find in missions or stores. [Enemies only drop ammo]The action is more fun and varied.The main story is not on the same ""wow"" level as the first Mass Effect tho. Just a few plot twists here and there. But still, it fills many gaps that were left after the first Mass Effect and expands on it.The only thing I didn't like in this game was a simple and annoying bug (It made me press F5 much more often, because I really didn't want to replay the same things if something went wrong). Your controllable character tends to get stuck above objects. You never know when this will happen. I just learned to avoid walking/running near the edges of objects... But still... very annoying. Especially during missions.And a tip:if you want to unlock the framerates and get rid of the harsh/pitch black/dark shadows, paste this in your GamerSettings.ini file.

What an awesome last game of this trilogy. Really recommend to get it on Origin. You will not be disappointed at all.The very first minutes will make you say: ""oh crap, the sh|t just got real!"".The animations and gameplay are much more fluid and responsive than in Mass Effect 2. The sound effects and the massiveness of the enemies/surroundings leaves you in awe.The graphics improved too. Weather effects (storms, rain, dust, etc.) are gorgeous. I think this game has the best dialogues between the characters in the series. There are so many good and funny remarks/situations.Didn't experience any game breaking bugs or crashes. Just some tiny glitches, but nothing bad really.I don't know why the ending was so criticized by the media and players.., I really liked it (just don't shoot anything at the very end, just a tip ^^). What an awesome trilogy. One of the best games you can experience to this date.p.s. make sure to edit the same file in ME3 too, if you want to unlock fps and get rid of the dark shadows.

												Note: This game been tried out and reviewed in Steam offline mode or on Consoles.Mass Effect 2 is a great, nearly perfect sequel to its predecessor Mass Effect. The graphics got better, the gameplay got better, and so did its story. We have ourselves a larger cast of characters, some broader choices, and some nicer areas and gameplay sequences. This game is a must play for almost anyone, satisfiesIt would actually be strongly recommended to play the first game before this one, or else the game may come off with the wrong effect, and it won't be as enjoyable.The game will satisfy you more than any other game and if some thought that the first game is pure greatness, then go try ME2 and double your motivations. just play, enjoy and see how games should really be made.

												Mass Effect trilogy stands as the best trilogy and sci-fi games I have ever played. Mass Effect 2 is the best of the three for me. I can't explain just how much I honestly love this game. I originally played this on xbox360 and later PS3, so obviously I had to play it on PC also. I've lost count how many times I have finished ME2 ^_^.It has amazing story, fantastic voice acting, emotional characters that feel real and you will care about, lots of conversations where you make the choises, space exploration, different species, the gameplay is just really amazing and of course there's one hell of a epic OST that will give you so much feels omg.Building your team and meeting new people is done very well. It has everything that makes a perfect experience imo. The story of ME2 starts with a jawdropping moment and ends in one of the most epic ways possible, that will surely blow your mind everytime...Mass Effect 2 maybe belongs in my top 5 games ever.I absolutely recommend this whole trilogy for anyone who like Sci-fi,  RPG genre and unforgettable characters+story !Few bad sides are that there's no full DLC or achievements on Steam version, Origin's release has the achievements I think. Digital Deluxe Edition don't contain all DLC, but the rest of DLC can be bought from Biowares website using points. Also ME3 is digitally available only on Origin for PC, which is a shame that they couldn't release it here too.			"

												This game was the most amazing RPG I have ever played! 31 hours full of emotional story, action and exploration. This Game is by far one of the best games here on Steam and everybody should play it!This Game has features of the Tell Tale Games but with actuall consequences. Unlike the tell tale games, choices here do matter. Which gives this game a huge replayability. You can also choose to be either way male or female and the outcome with all the characters will be different. So go back and play it again to see what you can make different this time!The Gameplay itself is very good and responsive. Altough sometimes I got a bug where I got stuck and couldn't go anywhere else. What this bug looks like you can see here ->  Mass Effect 2 Bug  But this hardly happened only 3 times I believe. To fix it simply reload your latest save or restart the mission.The Voice acting was rather impressive and the music as well. I also enjoyed very much that I could devcide what outfit my character is wearing and which color it should have. The Ship and Guns/Armor are upgradeable which makes it alot of fun to farm for rescources.I am personally not a very big fan of space game and doubt that I would off liked that game, but after giving it a chance I just fell in love with it and couldn't stop playing, Everything on it is wonderful and I could not find anything negative at all on it. I can recommend this game to anybody for its full price.			"

												Mass Effect 2, aka ""The empire strikes back"" of the  Mass Effect series, is the only SP game I've gone back to play and complete 7 times. It was so good that after pirating to try it out,(t was a long time ago get off my back)it caused me to buy it, then the first game, and lastly the third once it came out. Eventually buying the whole triolgy, twice(console and PC).It is also the first game to actually make me think through and understand the consequences of my decisions.

												In Mars Retract 2, you take control of the Shepherd to assemble a flock of aliens and humans and a robot with a flashlight for a head and also more humans to fight the giant space robot squids, except you don't in this game. Instead the Shepherd forgets about the misunderstood invading aquatic robotics and goes and hangs out with Wrex, that's what this game really should have been about actually. Also the hot blue alien is in it except she isn't really unless you buy reasonably priced EA quality downloadable content which is actually the best part of the game that should have been in it.My favourite game: -34/10 Needs more Wrex - Kotaku IGN.com.org "

This is my opinion of Mass Effect 2   Aspect Rating   story 9.0   Graphics 8.5   Sound 10   Gameplay 9.0   Overall 9.1 Scores are out of 10. Overall score is an average. Mass Effect 2 is the perfect sequel to the Mass Effect series. With its amazing visuals, voice acting, soundtrack, and direction, Mass Effect 2 comes to life. Mass Effect 2 manages to fulfill its incredible ambition while only suffering from very few technical hiccups. I do recommend playing Mass Effect 1 first as the decisions you make in the first one will have an effect on the second Mass Effect. But if you miss out on the first one, that isn't any reason to skip this fantastic videogame.			"

												Mass Effect 2 is the second part of one of the best game series that exists and I've played it twice to see which actions affects which part of the game and I would play it again. After playing ME1 it wasn't an big question for me to play the ME2. The story, the characters and atmosphere were too good in ME1. Mass Effect 2 unfolds the mysths about the Reaper and what happend to the Preatorians.I don't want to spoiler anyone so that's all I am saying about the story.Some parts were better in the first game, for example: The CitadelThey decreased it's areas you are able to explore from game to game. In ME1 you are able to go anywhere.But the developers changed the focus from a explorational to a more action-rich gameplay.The battle controls haven't changed at all. You can give orders to your squad-mates to attack someone, taking cover or using their special abilitys. I do recommend to talk to your whole team for an loyalaty bonus!But be careful sometimes you have to choose one side in an discussion which affects the manner of someone to you. Just like in real life.Overall Mass Effect 2 is an great game with beautiful graphics, an interesing story and characters.Totally recommended!Oh and you better play Mass Effect 3 Extended Cut too. Just to get the whole story.			"

												Pretty much the best of the trilogy, character work is excellent and it ties into the ""decade feel"" of the Mass Effect Trilogy (ME1 - Optimistic 70s Sci-Fi; ME2 - Dark 80s conspiracy sci-fi; ME3 - Overblow, bombastic 90s invasion sci-fi). Great game, fun play, good combat system, and interesting character design.

												While I've my fair share of criticisms of the series as a whole and both the 1st and 3rd entries, I count Mass Effect 2 among the best games I've ever played and believe it not hindered at all by the imperfections of its predecessor nor its sequel.Oh hey, I'm going to spoil some stuff by the way so careful reading. You've been warned.It is, with some caveats, a masterpiece in writing, cinematic presentation, character design, middle-entries-in-trilogies, world-building and tight, focused gameplay.For the most part, it's also pretty and varied in its art style and variety of environments, the only rough bits to look at are the splotchy textures on a few things that look like they're from ME1.The soundtrack is incredible and memorable, and I count it as being among the best game soundtracks. Perfectly matches mood and builds suspense.Fair to note at the outset I've got 130 hours logged on this copy and an additional 130 on another copy, so a little over 250 total.Shooting and cover are responsive and enjoyable. While ME2 lacks the cover-rolling and melee maneuvers of ME3, I'd argue that the health systems, enemy types and level designs make for much better shooting and gameplay in the 2nd title than the 3rd.ME3 segments enemy health into blocks or chunks, ME2 displays it all as one bar continually draining, the same applying for your health and shields. Very clear how much progress you're making towards killing a target.More importantly though, most of ME2's engagements can be handled with methodical patience and careful use of cover and squadmates -- it makes even the hardest difficulty a joy to play on all but some of the collector missions.ME3, on the other hand, is filled with missions involving reaper-type enemies that run at you and force you out of cover and involves more luck than it does method or thought. It was only after running through ME3 a couple times I realized just how well-designed ME2's experience is.You'll get more frustration-inducing kind of difficulty out of ME3's experience than you will the kind of careful, well-designed and enjoyable difficulty you'll get out of ME2.Of course, one can also look backwards and respond to the opposite complaint about this game's sheer divorce from ME1's RPG mechanics. If you want to argue ME2 has departed from ME1, you'll hear no argument from me.Given what an awkward, bumbly experience ME1 was though, I don't think it hurts ME2 at all being a responsive, well-designed third-person shooter with RPG elements. I'd rather it was that than ME1 -- a third-person shooter that isn't sure if it wants to be a shooter or an RPG and just ends up doing the shooting, cover and RPG elements wrong.(Hey, I can see those fanboy tears welling up in your eyes! Before you start writing some inane comment telling me just how wrong I am, I recommended ME1 too.)I mentioned caveats, let's cover those. For those who did the majority of the side quests in the first game, you know that Cerberus is an evil human-supremacist group willing to do horrible things to achieve their ends.In a fantastic writing twist, that same group decides to recover Shepard's body after he dies and reconstruct him, bring him back to life, make him into an effective tool both for humanity's interests but also their organization's.In a not so fantastic writing twist, Shepard seems pretty chill about this. The player is given some opportunity early on to object but for the most part Shepard seems pretty okay with cooperating.Given Shepard's history with and knowledge of the group coupled with his loyalty to the Alliance and affinity for not being a terrorist, you might think Shepard might look for more ways out or the game might present the player with such an option. At a minimum, it seems strange that we are basically funnelled into this path with little recourse in an RPG.There are compelling reasons why Shepard might cooperate. They might feel, rightly, that they owe a debt to them for resurrecting him and they might also be tempted by that shiny new Normandy and the support of former allies Cerberus recruits. They also might agree, as the Illusive Man argues, that Cerberus is the only organization that recognizes the reaper threat at the moment, and will help him/her investigate and stop them.That's all fine and dandy, but the player is mostly left to decide whether they accept these reasons in their head, There's not a lot in conversation and dialogue involving Shepard that makes it clear Shepard understands or accepts any of the implicit or explicit reasons for accepting their present situation.However, that all being said, ultimately the choice the writers made to take the narrative in this direction pays off. We're presented with a complacent and careless galactic government that won't acknowledge countless colonies dropping off the map.Cerberus recognizes it though, and has given you the resources and people to investigate. They suspect it's the 'Collectors'. A mysterous race that most have never seen that dwells beyond the equally mysterious Omega 4 relay. Of course, no one has ever returned after going through this particular relay.Once this is all confirmed, the game sets you into a broader framework of building a team, one that is in it to go through the relay and stop the Collectors.The team you build must be perfect, include the best, most committed and skilled operators the galaxy has to offer.The Council has pretty much disavowed you at this point, and, even if you're nice to them, don't really want to see you poking your nose where it doesn't belong in Council space.All of this sets things up perfectly for the game's setting: an adventure through the dark, criminal underworld of the galaxy. It gives the writers opportunity to flesh out new characters, species and places. Stark tonal shift from the first game. It gives them, basically, an opportunity to hugely expand the depth and breadth of Mass Effect's world. And this they definitely do.Missions span hubs like Omega, Illium and the Citadel to war-torn Tuchanka to mercenary-infested Korlus to distant, hazardous Haestrom. Many more. You're introduced to a lot of corruption and dirty, self-interested politics and characters. Mercenary groups. Extortion. Racism. Murder. Not that you participate in these things, but you see them happening.This dirtier, darker galaxy immerses the player quite well and really sucks you into the subplots of the places and people it affects. You'll care about the people and places of this world.Many more varied places and situations to discuss, not enough space here to write about them.In the context of these dark, horrible places, you're introduced to characters new and old and even the old ones are given new stories, as time has passed since you last saw them. You see characters evolve, change attitude and outlook. Great writing.Past the old characters, the new ones are compelling and interesting. Everyone loves Mordin. Okay, not Jacob. He sucks.Each potential team member is given their own mission with a completely unique level design, objectives and context surrounding their recruitment. Missions are varied and replayable.The team that you build though, after all this world-building and character development has occurred over the better part of the game, is meant to undertake a suicide mission in going through the relay.To say BioWare excellently builds up to this climax wouldn't do it justice. Your choices and the amount of time and effort you invest into the team you build play a decisive role in the outcome of the mission and you get a strong sense about how everything has built up to this point.There are few moments in gaming that I can think of that compare to ME2's suicide mission.There's so much more to say about this game and how amazing it is, but Steam recommendations have character limits.

												The original Mass Effect isn't very fun. The lore and universe it sets up are amazing, but your inventory fills up so fast that micromanaging it becomes necessary at annoying times, sometimes it feels like you pick up more junk items here than in Diablo, the romance options were pretty lame, the combat was just lame, vehicular segments were the worst (climbing up tall hills/mountains at -just- the right angle to try to get over them, copy/pasted buildings on various planets with very slight differences to their arrangement of furniture and such, side quest overload at the Citadel with almost no side quests anywhere else in the galaxy, and...yeah, it just wasn't very good. I'm glad it happened, though, because it meant Mass Effect 2 happened, and boy did I have a good time with it. Oh, and the ending song on Mass Effect 1 is totally great in my book. <3Mass Effect 2 doesn't do much for the lore, in all honesty. You get a little more info on mercenary groups and an organization called Cerberus, and that's about it. Mass Effect 2 is all about gameplay, and it fixes everything I complained about above. Those things are either gone or made better so that you have a good time. Far more romance options with more interesting characters, all fresh maps, the vehicular stuff in DLC is easy to maneuver around in, side quests are all over the place instead of conglomerating 75% or so of them into one map you pick them up at, the combat lets you use special abilities more often while still balancing it out and making it so much more fun with shields, barriers, and armor on the enemies, and instead of mountains of useless items, you pick up a gun, and it's added to your loadout you can choose from on a mission. That's it. No tiny incremental stat gear like in Mass Effect 1 where you waste your time dealing with paltry differences in gear.Mass Effect 2 is head and shoulders above Mass Effect 1, and it is the best game in the trilogy for me. Mass Effect 3's ending was a travesty, and though it had some solid gameplay, I still enjoy 2's better somehow.			"

Pros:- Story (Extremely compelling, it's up there with stories like The Last of Us and BioShock Infinite)- Good Graphics- Great Combat System- Extremely Challenging (on Insane difficulty anyway)- Characters (10/10. Miranda <3)- Character Development- Mass Effect. Nuff said. - Tons of side missions to do, including tons to get the best ending possible- Explore the Universe! (Limited, but still great)- Massive Replayability (Multiple Endings affected by the whole game, so you can replay it lots of times)- Just a Great gameCons:- You can't erase your memory and experience this fine work of art over and over again. :(			"

												This game is such a huge improvement over the first game in which especially the vehicle parts were very dull. In this game you play as Commander Shepherd again after being brought back to life after the incidents in the last game, you can also choose to have all the choices you made in M.E.1 be carried over to this game as you start.The most amazing thing about this game is the story, it is very immersing and rich, and I kept just wanting to find out more about what was going on, the same can be said for Mass Effect 1, which was also amazing story-wise. Other than that the combat is quite mediocre, its okay I mean, but not the best ever. Movements etc are kind of clunky. But as I said you will play this game for the story, and you will love it for the story.Pros:+Amazing story+Semi-Open world+Choices which really change things+Multiple Endings+Well written dialogue and very well voiced.Cons:-With a 2016 viewpoint the combat system leaves a lot to be desired-Squad members are kind of useless-Combat just becomes a means of reaching the next bit of story or lore.-Again, combat is repetitive.-Movement is clunkySo I give it; 8/10			"

												whatever your opinions of EA are, this is still arguably the best ♥♥♥♥ing game series ever. Purists might say that they changed too much going from ME1->ME2 and i'd say for the better. Gameplay isn't as clunky as in ME1. Story flows better. Better Charecters etc. This doesn't mean that me1 is a bad game at all! ME2 is just a tad bit better.			"

												For me Mass Effect 2 (as well as Mass Effect 1) is worth playing because of the characters. Getting to know everyone and then learn everyone's background is such a great idea. Most players can find a connection with each character. You really care for them and it's devastating if any one them dies. The story itself wasn't really good, but it's these characters that made the story work. Mass Effect 2 is set in a richly detailed world on the brink of destruction. It's a must-own for science fiction fans!

												While the game is great, i simply cannot accept EA's decision to not publish everything on steam and let people make the choice of where they buy, if they have to strongarm people into buying stuff on their website or through Origin, it should show just how much of a piece of crap move it is... EA / Bioware is dead as far as i'm concerned and there never was anything after what was released on Steam ;)			"

												Mass Effect 2 lives up to its hype and ratings it has received.  It alters the gameplay and item system enough from its predecessor that it almost feels like an entirely different game.  As you continue the journey of Commander Shepard, you can only be drawn closer to the commander and each of his allies you learn to love - and hate.  Verdict: Mass Effect 2 improves upon its predecessor in almost every aspect and simply adds to the addiction and the wonder that is Mass Effect.  Bottom line, this is a series you will NOT want to miss.			"

												So after Mass Effect you get return as that ♥♥♥♥♥ Commander Shepard to get your mass erect cuz of that ♥♥♥ effect ya feel me?So you chillin in space and then you get attacked by those damn aliens that wanna kill everything. They call theirself the collectors, but they aint collecting ♥♥♥♥, guess they're just a bunch of dumb ♥♥♥♥♥s. Anyways those ♥♥♥♥♥es actually manage to kill you, but luckily the main dude from Cerberus saves your ♥♥♥ and revives you by using that crafty Cerberus ♥♥♥♥ they have in their labs and ♥♥♥♥. So the Elusive man, who is the main man at Cerberus, is all up on your jock. Wanting to be allies, cuz he knows you're hot ♥♥♥♥ and the universe needs you. By the way that ♥♥♥♥♥ aint elusive at all, he's just a chain smoker. They shouldve called him the smoker man, that actually makes sense. God people are a bunch of dumbass ♥♥♥♥♥s faaaaaaaawk.Anyways you travel around in space to form a crew of strong ♥♥♥♥♥s and you actually recruit some of your old homies. There are some new homies too. One is the ultimate Krogan made in a lab with the soul purpose to ♥♥♥♥ up everything that stands in his way. This ♥♥♥♥♥ aint jokin around. And you also find a robot you call Legion cuz he is many or some ♥♥♥♥. That ♥♥♥♥♥ a pretty cool robo-homie too. Oh yeah if you banged Liara in the 1st game, you'll have to find a new honey. Cuz she too busy for the meat you packin. Being the true mac daddy playa pimp that I am, I didnt care and found myself plenty of hos that wanted to have dirty sweaty monkey sex with me. So it's all good, I got my nut anyways. When you have assembled your posse you're ready to save the galaxy. They call it the suicide mission cuz apparently if you a stupid ♥♥♥♥♥ your homies can die. But I'm the ultimate leader of my click, so I told my ♥♥♥♥♥s what to do and ♥♥♥♥ and we got out A OK son! At the end you find some ♥♥♥♥ that's dangerous, but could also be used to understand the collector technology better and ♥♥♥♥. And the elusive ♥♥♥♥♥ wants you to take it. I told his greedy ♥♥♥ to GTFO ♥♥♥♥'s dangerous and I dont trust that smokin P.O.S. anyways so like D GENERATION X would say SUCK IT. And his own ♥♥♥♥♥s that were part of my crew joined me. Cuz I'm charismatic as ♥♥♥♥ and ♥♥♥♥. So in the end all is good and you the best.If you a real ♥♥♥♥♥ and know how to shoot your way out of trouble buy this ♥♥♥♥ and if you dont.....well F YOU CUZ YOUZ WEAK!!IM OUT CHUUUUH			"

												Oh, Miranda. Oh, dear Miranda...Mass Effect 2. You've had to have heard those words at least once in your gaming life. Whether if it was a Youtube video, or maybe just chatting with a friend. You had to have heard of this legendary title. Well, I'm here to say that Mass Effect 2 is EASILY one of the finest games of last generation.I'll start with the visuals. I have to admit, the visuals in this game are still very impressive, even after nearly four years. If you are a friend of mine, you would probably notice that I frequently take screenshots of in-game stuff, usually something about it's beauty. Now, I've played numerous games that are really stunning, but I haven't taken this many screenshots for a game since Skyrim. I'm HIGHLY impressed with this game's graphics.The gameplay is a very strong point in the game. Mass Effect 1 was more tactical and people didn't like that, along with squadmate abilities, some in-game choices, and more. However, Mass Effect 2's gameplay was much smoother, even if lots of ME1 RPG elements were taken out. The gunfights were heated and awesome. Choosing squadmates and using the abilities they have make the game have a slightly more strategic approach. However, when you could actually have an option to do something else. In one mission, one of my squadmates said that we could sneak past the enemies, but when I attempted to do so, there was no way of actually sneaking past them without triggering the alarm, thus making some missions pretty linear.The story is a step down from the first Mass Effect and even the third Mass Effect. It goes completely off topic. But, there's a reason why I'm praising the game in the ""story"" section. It's simple. The lore in this game is INCREDIBLE. When you search planets for resources to survive missions, you need to scan the planet and send probes to retrieve your materials. Before you do scan though, there is a decent sized blurb that describes life on the planet and lots of facts about the planet. There's lots more, too. However, you'd just have to buy the game so you can be amazed by that. Also, the CHARACTERS. The best part about this game is the CHARACTERS. Tali is a little clumsy, especially around me. Grunt has an aggresive attitude and lusts for bloodshed. Mordin is crazy, and seems like he cares little for death, and talks in an extremely fast pace. Should I describe anyone else? I didn't think so. Although the plot was rather off-topic and poorly done, I praise this part of the game highly for lore and characters.The audio is just alright. It seems like A. The same music is played over and over again or B. All the songs sound the same. This is probably the weak point to this unforgettable RPG. Even friends of mine agree, the music in this game is just meh. However, I do think the voice actors did a strong, strong performance for their roles. The replayability is actually pretty good. Beat the game? Play as a Renegade, or maybe play as a heroic Paragon. Play as the opposite gender. Side with someone else. ""Do it"" with another romance option. There's lots to do, and there's even some DLC you can download. You have quite a bit to do. The key problems to this game include the following: Lots of glitches, the space bar seems to be overused, making cover/run/interact/etc a bit clunky. The game is somewhat linear. That's about it!In the end, Mass Effect 2 is one of the best RPGs of last gen, but also one of the best GAMES of last gen. It's amazing, and I highly, highly, highly recommend it. Go ""do it"" with Miranda, would you?Graphics- 9/10Gameplay- 8.5/10Story- 10/10Audio- 7/10Replayability- 8/10**GANDHI GAMING PERSONAL PICK**.:9.4/10:.+Amazing characters+AWESOME final mission+Lots of lore+Good gameplay+Stunning graphics+High replayability-Relies heavily on space bar, makes controls a bit clunky-Numerous glitches-Somewhat linear			"

""They tell me it's a suicide mission. I intend to prove them wrong.""Chances are that when asked about games you consider to be classics or personal favourites, you have a handful that you fondly remember and can still pick up and play even today. As such, Mass Effect 2 is, by no means, a perfect game nor the ""greatest"" game. It suffers from issues that have polarised many in the community, from the supposedly awkward combat to the infamous elevator rides. Yet even after nearly 5 years and dozens of playthroughs, (across multiple platforms), it still remains a personal favourite.Though released under the thumb of everyone's favourite publisher, the period around the release of Mass Effect 2 also saw the equally excellent Dragon Age: Origins appear, marking the triumphant return of BioWare and Western RPGs in a whole new way. You are once again placed in the boots of Commander Shepard and are weeding out the remnants of indoctrinated Geth when a new threat, known as the Collectors, reveal themselves, turning the tables on you and your crew in an incredible opening sequence. Abandoned by The Council and now working under the orders of the pro-human extremist group Cerberus, you must once again build yourself up from nothing, gather your crew, prepare yourself and travel through the Omega-4 relay to end The Collectors once and for all.""We're all asking you to do the impossible, Shepard. No pressure.""A heavily stylised and cinematic experience, BioWare's so-called space opera features some of the best writing around, easily quotable and frequently amusing. Regardless of your opinion of BioWare and the controversies in recent years, it is difficult to deny the depth of characterisation and investment that the studio has brought to the Mass Effect series. From the opening titles all the way to the end credits, Mass Effect 2 has a quality that others still aspire to and fail to achieve. You will grow attached to your crew but in different ways compared to other playthroughs, especially with the romance and loyalty mechanics. The game allows for what can only be described as true role-playing, in a more accessible medium than that of pen-and-paper.From the character customisation to the dialogue wheel to the open-ended Paragon/Renegade morality system, you are free to shape your Shepard however you wish and determine the fates of not only your crew but the galaxy itself. With the addition of the import save file feature, playing through the series carries further weight as for every choice there certainly is a consequence; many of which are severe and often unexpected, especially in the final mission where everything and everyone is on the line. Successfully pulling off the aforementioned Suicide Mission without a single death is truly epic and will stay with you long after the credits roll and Jack Wall's excellent soundtrack finishes. As it is action-oriented, the squad-based gameplay features an impressive range of enemy types and classes, six of which are available to Shepard and complement specific weapon loadouts and cross-class abilities with your team of four per mission. Although the game goes to great lengths to encourage experimentation with a good range of weapons, you'll most likely have a loadout well and truly established for each character within a few hours, with exception to the researched upgrades later in the game. Finite magazines have replaced the overheating component of previous weapons, which significantly affects the style of combat between the two. You'll be taking cover and pausing more often, relying more on biotics than the first especially to get through the various layers of protection. The tactical UI has been cleaned up a bit and there are other significant changes from the first game. For one, there isn't an inventory or loot system. At all. The top-of-the-line weapons are simply found, bought or researched. Weapons are assigned prior to missions and medi-gel is frequently littered throughout levels, now used only to revive teammates. Shepard's N7 is the centrepiece in terms of armour, featuring modular customisation, but other parts and sets can be found or bought. Over all, combat is certainly more streamlined then the chaotic firefights of the first game, but feels more realistic and enjoyable. Shepard no longer feels like a demi-god, instead like the lone soldier fighting tooth-and-nail against all odds that they're meant to be.""The Collectors are about to find out what happens when you ♥♥♥♥ me off.""The galaxy map and vast array of missions will take you from the heights of glorious Illium to unsettling space stations to the seedy underbelly of Afterlife and Omega. In terms of graphics, Mass Effect 2 isn't the best looking game for its time, choosing more of a gritty, contrasted artstyle that BioWare's heavily modified version of Unreal Engine 3 allows for but still looks great all the same.. even when wandering around the Normandy for the umpteenth time. AI is surprisingly quite good, significantly better than a lot of other games, with only the rare kamikaze or doorway block. There were occasional minor framerate drops and in terms of bugs, I encountered some clipping and camera issues but nothing significant or game-breaking. A quick reload usually fixes most of the few that remain. Having played this for hundreds of hours on the PlayStation 3, the experience has been pretty good on both platforms. The only major criticism here is due to the Steam version, rather than the game itself, and the lack of DLC. Already having owned all the available DLC on console, the Digital Deluxe edition contains the ""Cerberus Network"" DRM, (which, at the time of writing, apparently has been shut down), with the only meaningful addition being Zaeed Massani as an additional companion. The best content, like the Lair of the Shadow Broker, Kasumi and The Arrival, costs more than twice the initial price of the Steam edition, let alone when it's on sale. Besides the fact that this is overseen by Electronic Arts, the fact that DLC costs more for a game that is over half a decade old is unacceptable.""Just once I'd like to ask someone for help and hear them say, ""Sure. Let's go. Right now. No strings attached.""Do I recommend Mass Effect 2 for everyone? No. In fact, I know many people who hate it with a passion, and that's fine. It certainly isn't for everyone. But this is a Steam review, so let's continue in the not-so-objective manner. It is a captivating ride from start to finish with thousands upon thousands of lines expertly delivered by the cast, bringing Shepard's crew and the complexities of the alien worlds and relations to life. The triumph of Mass Effect 2 is that it captures not only the sci-fi epic but the humanity that underpins it. The love and effort that BioWare have put into crafting this is second-to-none as the game constantly drives you into exploring and, above all, determining how you play. For a genre that is so overused, parodied and often mishandled, Mass Effect 2 is a truly epic example of a game done right and the pinnacle of the BioWare RPG. How much enjoyment and investment you get from this ultimately comes down to personal preference, though coming from someone who knew nothing about the series going into their first playthrough, I'd ask that you give it a chance. Even just on sale, it's worth it.Though I'd recommend that you experience the trilogy from start to finish, this also stands proudly amongst the best in its own right. This and Dragon Age: Origins may be a far cry from the days of Baldur's Gate or KOTOR but still remain a personal favourite. Just like old times. Cheers for getting this far, reader, as this review is certainly long enough. I should go.			"

												Pretty damn good. I'll just ditto and list positives and negatives. +Great story with good characters and different choises. The last mission was actually really thriling.+Way better animations, slighty better graphics.-The controls took some time to get used to.You cant crouch and instead of using E to use, space runs, uses and goes to cover. Q and E move your squadmates. A bit annoying but I got used to it after 5 hours.- Less side missions, therefore shorter.9/10Really rememberable and replayable. I liked it.(Side note: I very likely won't play ME3 because Origin and really ♥♥♥♥♥♥ ending with some weird cyber-kid and dumb ♥♥♥♥. Also, no matter the ending you pick, you die.

												So I picked up this game a while ago and it kinda sat in my library for a while because I bought ME 1 around the same time, so I play all the way through ME 1 and get to know all of the characters. Fast forward to me starting a new game, I thought all was going to be great until I died. Then after being resurrected I realized that all of the characters I have grown to know and love had all moved on away from me and that I was essentially on my own against a dangerous enemy with only a bunch of rascist ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s around me. Then I recruit back two of my former squad and was so happy that I had some familiar faces around. Later on I learned that one of the former squad was in love with me since ME 1 and that I had been ignoring them the entire time. Then more towards the end something catastrophic happened and a lot of people that I had now grown closer to died. The ending was extremely satisfying and very emotional based on who died.10/10 would cry from a fictional character death again.			"

												I got emotionally attached to Commander Shepard and his/her crew. I was so involved in the whole story that I cannot find any defect on this one. I very much appreciated EVERYTHING this game has to offer, and there is no game that is even comparable to this one when it comes to story+environment+characters. I highly recommend it, I enjoyed every single second of it.			"

												Just go buy this game. It's the best thing created by a human ever. Except for Breaking Bad. Both are amazing...not convinced? Damn. Well, let's review Mass Effect 2 then.A hundred and fifty years in the future, humanity has figured out FTL travel and has found their place in the galaxy among the numerous alien races. A rogue Spectre nearly brings on the end times by summoning giant robots that wipe out all life called the Reapers, barely being stopped by another Spectre (yes, that is you and yes, this took place in the last game), proving humanity's worth. You play as Commander Shepard... until he or she gets spaced. This isn't really spoiling since it happens in the first five minutes. But a group called Cerberus decides to bring Commander Shepard back to life to fight the Collectors, a mysterious race of aliens who have been abducting human colonies. Shepard agrees to work for it, though he or she is a bit hesitant since Cerberus is barely a step above a terrorist organization. The story then follows you recruiting numerous people with various talents for a Suicide Mission against the Collectors, where your decisions there and your team decides whether everyone lives or everyone dies. Good luck, Commander.Gameplay is fantastic. The combat is a lot better than ME1, instead of the overheat system, you get the traditional gun system, and I like this more than the overheat system. There's also now a reason to use powers, even if you have awesome guns, you'll still need to use them on some enemies, compared to ME1 where once you got some good guns, it didn't really matter if you used powers or not. Squadmates are also a lot more useful, the 6 in ME1 (5 in the end... sometimes 4... spoilers?) gets boosted up to 10 (12 if you have the DLC), all of which are very good and have distinct personalities. Plus you can bang some of them, so that's nice.  All hail dat Quarian booty! There is also a good upgrade system, although in order to get the materials to do so, you have to do a kinda boring scanning minigame, which is not that fun to do. There are six classes (Soldier, Adept, Engineer, Sentinel, Vanguard, and Infiltrator), all of which are a lot more distinct than in ME1. I for one prefer Vanguard, but all classes are overall decent from what I hear. There are multiple conversation branches, a Paragon/Renegade morality system that is affected by dialogue and interrupts that you take, and loyalty systems, which once you do a mission for a character, they become loyal, making them more likely to survive the Suicide Mission and gets that squadmate a new loyalty power. Gameplay is fun, that's all that matters.Characters are likeable for the most part. Shepard is customizable, letting you choose his/her looks, gender, and backstory. The squadmates you'll get, Miranda, Jacob, Garrus (returning from ME1), Jack, Grunt, Mordin, Tali (also returning from ME1), Thane, Samara, Legion, Zaeed (if you get the Cerberus Network DLC) and Kasumi (if you get the Stolen Memory DLC.) Your pilot Joker, played by Chris Griffin (Seth Green, but I call him Chris Griffin), is basically comic relief, however he and the banter with the AI is actually pretty funny. You'll encounter your previous ME1 squadmates who won't join you, Liara, Kaidan/Ash, and (if he's alive) Wrex. Wrex and Liara have some good scenes, but Kaidan or Ash... don't. The Illusive Man, who's the head honco of Cerberus and awesomely played by Martin Sheen, is probably one of my favorite villians of all time. All the characters are well written, are well voice played, and I can't really hate these characters. My personal favorites are Garrus and Tali.Criticisms? There are some kinda baffling plot details, Shepard's revival making no sense being my biggest complaint. The scanning minigame I mentioned earlier isn't very fun. There's hacking, which I hear a lot of people hate, I didn't... that much, at least, but I see where people come from when they say it's lame. Also, there aren't very many weapons, which is kind of lame, to be honest.Still, this is an awesome game that everyone should play in their lifetime. 10/10, if you have the money, buy it. Now. Get the other two games in the trilogy as well, ME1 is on Steam as well, but you have to deal with Origin for ME3.			"

I spent more than 241 hours in this game and can say that the story, character development, and play style set the bar high for other top tier games coming out.I would definately recommend playing through this and the third if you have not.

Definitively RecommendedOne of the most amazing games I've ever played. Mass Effect 2 (And the entire trilogy - in general) gives you an epic space experience. Be the badass Shepard of your dreams and go Renegade. Or be a nice, peaceful Shepard and go Paragon. You can choose many different choices that >will< affect the story later on. And whats epic is - it has dynamic endings, which means your endings are based on what choices you make and what you do (I am serious on this). Cons*Awesome space experience!*Romance - You can even romance a cricket hitman! (Not literally a cricket, but close enough). *Numerous charcter-creation and choices, lots of classes and the ability to give your character *some backstory. *Heart-touching story.*Lots of dialouge and dialogue options. *Rich story.*Paragon/Renegade system. *Dynamic story-line and ending (Your choices affect how the story goes and how it ends).*Slightly more content than Mass Effect 3 (Resource gathering is something Mass Effect 3 doesn't have). Cons *No Mako. Sadly this wonderful vehicle isn't drive-able in Mass Effect 2. *Scary flying horrifying Scythe ♥♥♥♥. *Confusing covers and controls. Ratings!  Aspect Rating   Graphics 8.1/10   Gameplay 7.9/10   SFX 8.9/10   Story 9.2/10 Overall - 9/10 "

												Mass Effect 2 hat es bei Release im Jahr 2010 auf Anhieb in meine persönlichen Top 10 der Games geschafft, die ich in all den Jahren gespielt habe.Optisch ist das Spiel dank Unreal Engine ganz gut gealtert. In seltenen Fällen stört der für diese Engine gewohnte, übermässige Glanzeffekt, welcher selbst an Stoffen auftritt ( aktuelles Beispiel: Batman Arkham Knight bei Joker's Verbrennungsszene ). Beim Missionsdesign bemüht man sich im Vergleich zum Vorgänger um Abwechslung - insgesamt gelingt das auch, wenn man mal von dem Planetengescanne absieht. Mich persönlich hat es nie gestört.Was dieses Spiel so herausragend macht, ist die grandiose Inszenierung. Die Story ( die gemeinsam mit dem ebenfalls empfehlenswerten Teil 1 ein großes Ganzes bildet, welches im März 2012 seinen krönenden, aber auch kontroversen Abschluß mit Teil 3 fand ), das intuitive Kampfsystem, die eingstreuten Zwischensequenzen, der ohrwurmverdächtige Soundtrack & die liebgewonnenen Charaktere, das alles fügt sich so gut ineinander, dass man unbedingt wissen möchte wie es weitergeht.Beim ersten Durchgang habe ich Mass Effect 2, abgesehen von den Collector´s Edition DLCs, ohne jeglichen Zusatzcontent gespielt, den es mittlerweile gibt & die Story ergibt auch so 100% Sinn. Man verpasst also nichts. An Spieldauer werden einem rund 30 Stunden geboten, wenn man nur strikt der Hauptgeschichte folgt.  Allerdings verpasst man dann vieles von den Quests der Nenebchraktere & wird das große Finale je nach Verbesserungen des Schiffes relativ einsam bestreiten müßen.Aber: Man muß sich, wie auch schon bei Dragon Age: Origins, mit seinem Bioware- bzw. EA-Account einloggen , um die DLCs nutzen zu dürfen. Mass Effect 2 bietet sogar einige kostenfreie DLCs, welche insgesamt unterhaltsam sind & die Story bereichern. Gerade die DLCs, welche einiges an Story mitbringen ( Kasumi, Shadow Broker,)  sollte man gespielt haben.			"

												This game along with ME1 and ME3 has taken up so much of my life i expect to turn around and see Vorcha in the streets or events of the Shadow Broker on the radio and events from Omega on the news with cover ups of the Collectors.Do NOT buy this game if you value your sanity as it literally breaks you. The friendships you build makes you pissy at the real friends you have as they dont live up to those of Garrus and his quirky remarks.On a serious not though, there is so many different paths to go down with this game with decisions you make in ME1 having the capability to be butterfly effected right through.

												IF you didn't buy this when it was on sale make sure you do next time, BUT make sure that you buy Mass Effect and play it first. The gameplay in ME2 is much smoother and will make ME feel really dated and clunky in comparison imo. Many people like the more RPG aspects and upgrading of weapons in ME, but I found ME2 to be more streamlined and perfectly fine. The gameplay and combat I defintiely like better. I fell in love with all of my crew and couldn't wait for ME3. I also highly recommend the DLCs for Kasumi, and the Shadow Broker DLCs as they add a decent sized quests for SB, and add a phenomenal member to your crew with Kasumi, not to mention one of the best weapons in the game.Note that if you want to play the Mass Effect series you really should start at ME and go through all 3. The games are tied closely toether with decisions from previous games and to get the full experience you need to actually partake in it from the beginning! From people that you save and will remain with you until the end, to romances you have that can chancge the way crew members feel about you. If done properly things you did in ME will shcarry all the way over to ME3. It truly is an amazing accomplishment I think for this series and as a gamer consider it a must play series. Of course you can find save files around the net that can be placed in the game folders to pretend that you played MAss Effect already with the decisions you wanted, but that's pretty lame isn't it? haha			"

												Mass Effect is one of my favorite games of the past decade. Despite its technical shortcomings, BioWare's first in what it promised to be a trilogy took the role-playing genre to new cinematic heights. Mass Effect 2 is a better game in near every way. From the very first scene, you will be hooked. And the farther you dive into this epic action role-playing game, the better it gets. It fulfills the promise of its predecessor while continuing to push the boundaries of what we should expect in a videogame. and the MUSIC=SUPERB			"

												The whole game convinces emotionally and brings to continue to play. One lives, and feels like in a breathtaking movie. If not, you even feel yourself in the middle of Space. Mass Effect 2 is for me the best part, since I find that this offers the most leisure time and play time. One can land on many Planets with its space ship, and this exploration. You can personalize and customize your Character according to your own wishes. Regardless of appearance, or Armor. Mass Effect is a madness game!I split my opinion into the following categories:-GraphicThe graphics are excellent for an already older game, and it does not consume too much hardware performance. However, Mass Effect looks very good, not more.-SoundThe sound is a part of many that makes the game so class! The sound effects sound realistic. It is not a simple shooting of a laser beam that delivers a gun. There is something more behind it. Everything feels very real. The music and the soundtracks in the game are bombastic. They make the entire game more emotional and genuine. It's like in a movie.-ControlMass Effect 1 Players have to adapt very much, since the control has been completely revised. For example, it is no longer possible to jump to Shift. This is done by pressing the empty button while running. The control is however not bad, or spongy.-AtmosphereThe last and most important category in my report is probably the atmosphere of the game. The whole galaxy is open to you! It is a beautiful image, if you are not on a mission, for example, and simply looking out of the window in your space ship.			"

												Quite possibly one of the best games I've ever played in my life.  With a very thrilling and immersive storyline, bioware made a masterpiece with this series.  Too bad origin wont let us have ME 3 on steam.  Regardless, I wish I could wipe my memory of this game, and the others, just so that I could rediscover the love I have for this game all over again.  Though the gameplay differs from Mass Effect one, the characters still capture your heart with their enchanting personalities, and the storyline you so love progresses onward to the climax in Mass Effect 3, where the culmination of your decisions in the first two second games finally form together. The very fact that this is a dynamic storyline spanning three games with each decision dramatically affecting scenarios in each game is simply incredible. I dont just recommend this game, I'm telling you to get this game. Now shoo, go get this game! (and the first one too...you wont understand this one otherwise)			"

												Writing this after three playthroughs. Few of the issues to start with - > No crouching> Can't top ME1's atmosphere> Needs more RPG elements> Fewer skill trees available to upgrade  > Galaxy feels restricted and less interesting without planet exploration> Mako missions from ME1 replaced with a planet scanning mini-game: where you stockpile             eezo and other minerals to exchange for combat / ship upgrades (latter being for variation in   the main story). After that it feels like an unnecessary chore. > Expensive DLCs  (Arrival, Shadow Broker and Overlord being the only ones worth buying imo). Onto the positive bits - > Texture pop in and frame rate issues resolved> Better gameplay and combat compared to ME1. Cover system vastly improved> Removal of ME1's cluttered inventory system > Story has good pacing and feels nicely written.> New species and characters provide excitement as you build your squad> Return of codex entries and planet descriptions make for interesting readsOverall, the strong game narrative, well-written characters and immersive lore make this game and series worth at least one playthrough.9/10			"

												Mass Effect 2 is a great game, a fun story that drags you along and engulfs you, but has a few plot holes in the context of the series story. The Shooting and combat were fine tuned and made excellent at the cost of more of the RPG elements of the first game. The tone of the story shifts from the world building and hard sci-fi of an Asamov novel to the more adventurous and fast paced sci-fi of a John Scalzi one. This is not a criticism as I enjoy both, just be aware of the change in tone if comming in from the first title.  "

												The Mass Effect series has been my all-time favorite video game series ever since the first one.Let's start with the obvious, which are the downsides:Mass Effect 2 is unlike the first one, and consequently is less of a BioWare game at heart than it could be, clearly showing the signs of transition between pre- and post-EA acquisition.World exploration has been highly minimized in favor of action sequences, whether centralizing scenes with shootouts or with much more intense scenarios for the vehicle sections.Going from point A to B revolves more around the action of that path, rather than a combination of full control, observation and going in unprepared.The RPG elements are also dumbed-down, in particular with the equipment by making minimal changes between outfits and weapons, leaving only the character-building experience with dialogue sequences.All this being said: the improvements definitely make up for most — if not all — of these downsides.The enriched universe shown in the first game is still present in this title, which still leaves you with the same amount of awe.The dialogues, despite feeling like two robots speaking to each other most of the time, is filled with character, where each line tells you just enough about the world you're playing in, and they're super well delivered thanks to the amazing voice actors like Jennifer Hale (if you played femshep), or Mark Meer (maleshep), or even the other awesome members of the main cast, including and especially Martin Sheen. Sure, the exchange between two parties doesn't feel like two human beings talking, but their amount of detail definitely make up for this fault.The characters themselves are mostly unique; they have many facets to themselves that are progressively presented to you as you develop tighter bonds with them, and generally never feel unnatural.Finally, despite the locations being abruptly cut in portions (sometimes by giving you menus of where to go next), they don't cut too much to prioritize cinematic display, which although is something inherent in video games nowadays and they're specially gorgeous in this one, is something that easily breaks the pacing. Mass Effect tackles this appropriately since most of the cinematics involve player prompts, so there's never a moment where the game forces you to put down your controller (or stretching yourself in your chair) unless you want it to.All of this while you experience an epic story of a Commander that participates in something much more interesting than a mere ""saving the Galaxy"" (which the 3rd title unfortunately definitely uses as the main theme), by jumping between solar systems.I'm a video games fan, so I'll play mostly anything, even if I end up highly disliking a game; before I judge them critically, I must give all a fair chance by at trying to play it from beginning to end.Mass Effect 2, however, is the only game in my library and past experience that gives me a profound amount of pleasure while playing it.If I was allowed only one part of my memory wiped, I would definitely use that to my memories of this series, so that I could re-experience it ""for the first time"" all over again.

												[UPDATE] And then i got all the content for the game ( not available in steam but throught origin ). In that content is the Project Overlord DLC and OMFG... It realy made me cry. One of the best moments in gaming ever...Amazingly good.Having played Mass Effect 1 through and being a massive fan, I went into the second iteration with enthusiasm.I was severely disapointed by some of the design decision i met there (vs Mass Effect 1):RPG skill system severely dumbed down.Planet exploration turned into horrible annoying mini-game.Third person combat shifted severely into ""gears of war"".Now the good:The game still is one of the best stories ever. The number of time you get goose bumps by what is happening on the screen is breath taking.If you like Bioware Games or even RPGs, this is mandatory to own as is Mass Effect 1.Caveat: Playing the game without doing the first mass effect 1 and then using the save game makes you lose a lot of content. If you are new to the series, play both back to back.RECOMENDED at full price.ABSOLUTELY MANDATORY at 75% off.			"

 Mass Effect 2  This is not a ordinary game, it is a masterpiece. I personally went through all the parts and it is one of the best series for me. Mass Effect 2 is a continuation of Commander Shepard's story. This time our hero is rescued by Cerberus and with the help of the Illusive Man and the team of humans and aliens our aim will be to stop attacks on human colonies in the Terminus System. The game offers a great soundtrack, character, ship and squad development, travels through the Milky Way galaxy, and performs a great story and loyalty missions, side missions and resource gathering and many interesting characters and planets. For me it is not just a game it is a masterpiece that everyone should experience. Production in which for the first time our choices matter. If you have not played yet, you definitely should.  "

												The original Mass Effect was something of an enigma when it came out in 2007. Then an Xbox 360 exclusive, Bioware’s tried and true Knights of the Old Republic character development formula mixed with an action-oriented shooter setup. You could spend time grinding, and yet it still boiled down to aiming a gun and pulling the trigger. You could pump all the points in the world into increasing your health, but forget to take cover and it’d all be for naught. While most hybrid games lean a little bit more in one direction, Mass Effect stood stubbornly on the fence between shooter and RPG.It seems that the complaints – which were at the time, minimal – about Mass Effect‘s indecisive design really got to Bioware. Nearly every issue the community seemed to have with the game has been fixed. The number-crunching RPG elements are gone. The floaty Mako driving segments are gone. The barren side-quest worlds are gone. The indecipherable inventories are gone. The cutting and trimming has left Mass Effect 2 in a rare situation: a genre shift. Granted, at first glance everything seems to be in order; however, when the rubber hits the road and it’s time to play, the game feels very, very different.Mass Effect 2 is no longer an RPG. At least, it’s not an RPG in the sense that the first one was. There is now a simple skill tree system instead of a fully blown stat sheet, and the action now plays out like a third-person tactical shooter. What remains of Mass Effect is the excellent conversation system. The already impressive presentation has also gotten an upgrade, leaving the first Mass Effect behind in a trail of dust. It’s really quite bizarre to see a sequel to a game so well received to change so much.Honestly, though, for as many things Bioware changed, the game still feels solidly planted in the universe Mass Effect presented. Even if the gameplay is different, everything has a sense of familiarity, right down to the synth-infused soundtrack and 1970s aesthetic. Mass Effect 2‘s story picks up two years after the end of the first game. By default, Shepard’s choices left the Council to die, putting humanity in control of the galactic government. Importing a save from Mass Effect is a much-touted feature; however, the timespan between the two games makes the impact of Shepard’s earlier choices fairly minimal. It might be nice to see an old friend or two, though.Instead of continuing the story directly, Mass Effect 2 is the start of a new conflict between Commander Shepard and a new enemy. After being attacked by an unknown vessel in the fringes of space, Shepard is killed while attempting to save his crew. Brought back to life by The Illusive Man, the leader of a human-supremacist organization called Cerberus, Shepard is tasked with unraveling the mystery behind The Collectors – a race of aliens that are showing up in human colonies and stealing away their inhabitants. It makes for a much darker adventure than the first game, taking you to planets around the ♥♥♥ end of the Milky Way to construct a team of the best possible warriors to confront this threat.The characters are the game. Building this team isn’t just one quest; it’s the lifeblood of Mass Effect 2. Each one out of the twelve (thirteen, sort of) characters has a lengthy story to tell, and there are dozens of side characters with almost as much detail. The game builds a rich history for each person, making the time spent with them much more interesting than the original six party members from Mass Effect. In action, the game plays like a story-oriented tactical shooter, funneling Shepard and his entourage through conversations and choices before plunging them into firefights and chase sequences. Shepard can take cover behind walls and other objects, popping out to blast a few rounds into enemies before ducking back down. Instead of Mass Effect‘s infinite ammunition, Shepard’s guns take “thermal clips” of energy that effectively work like magazines in any other shooter. Different types of ammo can be loaded into guns, tailored to damage different kinds of enemies. Biotic and Tech powers are now hotkeys that can be pressed to unleash instant attacks on foes, ranging from physics manipulation to active camouflage.Off the battlefield, The Normandy spaceship has received an overhaul, acting as much more of a hub than it did in the original game. The huge cast of characters can be spoken to, and some will offer suggestions for ship upgrades, or reveal personal missions they’d like Shepard to take them on. The Normandy feels more alive than it ever did in Mass Effect, thanks in part to frivolous additions like Shepard’s quarters and bathrooms, as well as background characters that provide endless chatter. It’s the little details that count; even the elevators are gone, replaced with – shocking, I know – loading screens, which take about a third of the time to complete than any lift ride did in the first game.Still, with all of these atmospheric expansions, it’s clear that the actual game has been trimmed quite a bit. Instead of allowing Shepard to hop into the Mako buggy and drive all over random planets, Mass Effect 2 only features a mining minigame, used to find minerals to upgrade various weapons and ship parts. Occasionally, the scanner will yield an anomaly, which translates into a side mission; but for the most part, the planets are there strictly to be combed for resources.While the choices Shepard made in Mass Effect don’t have too much weight, Mass Effect 2‘s own array of decisions are always interesting, and some may lead to intense consequences in Mass Effect 3, if Bioware keeps its word. While the line between Paragon and Renegade is still quite clear, there are many situations where the Paragon sense of charm can be used to do Renegade-ish things, and vice-versa. Shepard can use his charm to convince hostage-takers to drop their weapons in exchange for their lives, only to blast them anyway as soon as they do; likewise, players can threaten prison guards to force them to stop beating a helpless convict. The progression of each conversation feels much more natural in this regard, creating a grey area that Mass Effect often lacked.On the PC, Mass Effect 2 really shines. The interface is slick, allowing players to hotkey their powers; the control scheme is also quite simple by default. It also looks fantastic on PC, and scales fairly well to older computers. At its highest settings on a good gaming rig, the game is a total joy to watch in motion. The gorgeous character models animate perfectly, and the overall direction has taken a step up from its already admirable presence in Mass Effect.Mass Effect 2 is quite clearly the middle game in a trilogy. The actual story takes a backseat to character development, spending 25 hours introducing a motley crew before wrapping everything up with a jaw-dropping final mission and cliffhanger ending. The experience is worth playing through at least twice for the Paragon and Renegade choices; maybe more for those who want to explore every nook and cranny of the game. Mass Effect 2 is a triumph of an action game, blending satisfying shooter levels with dark themes and hours of heated debate.			"

												I wasn't at all a fan of how many of the RPG elements of the first game got axed, and the switch to a more shooter-centric combat system made the already strict freedom of movement feel even more constrained. The story and character development is rather jarring compared to the first as well, but is totally self-redeeming and very much worth it. In the end, this game somehow managed to finish with even more of an addictive quality than the first. The thing that makes the series really great is how important it makes your actions feel. They have weight, you get to see their effects, and the story remains very engaging and powerful.			"

												Bioware has alwyas been a wonderful company since Baldur's Gate UNTIL they got bought by the worst software company the world has seen ELECTRONIC ARTS.The game is very good and will give you very good moments. Sadly one has to include the ELECTRONIC ARTS experience in the equation and it can go somewhat smooth (where your DLCs work sometimes or you have to visit pretty bad designed with new passwords and registrations and some DLC work some others not or you might be unlucky and you have to deal with a BUG. Not any kind of bug, but an ELECTRONIC ARTS bug, where you will have to visit painful webpages asking things one time and the other for some ridiculous ♥♥♥♥ and maybe find a patch only to realize that although you have FIBER it is like you are in the 90s with a 9600 baud modem and downloading a patch file from EA servers takes TWO HOURS, i repeat TWO HOURS for a 70 Mb file.One can only hope that ELECTRONIC ARTS closes and stop destroying so many wonderful companies that end in their deadly incompetent hands.Where are you my dear Westwood? Where are you Bioware? Just names now. Oh my dear Dune2. Ok i am crying now. People please leave me alone. /hides.			"

												I don't even know where to start. At first I thought I'd get a typical space adventure with laser beams and stuff, but what I actually got was beyond all my expectations. First of all the story is great. It keeps gradually developing between the games and keeps the player intrigued at all times. We all have played at least one of those games that keep you wide awake through the whole night, and this truly is one of those. Even after finishing the game there are loads of fascinating lore waiting to be read and trust me, it's worth it.Sadly if you're not interested in talking to people wholeheartedly or just don't care about the dialogue that much, you'll miss most of the game's charm since most of the important stuff happen during conversations. Some things tend to get complicated really fast if you decide to skip even a few important dialogues. And sometimes just listening to random NPCs was enough to keep me entertained, even if it didn't have anything to do with the mission itself. The amount of work that has been put into the dialogue really pays off, and I barely remember times when talking with someone didn't put a smile on my face.Probably the thing that made the game for me were the characters. I found something intriguing in all of them (even if Kelly Chambers deserves death for ""you have new messages"" when there are none) and I couldn't wait for getting to do their loyalty missions and actually making them my friends rather than just comrades during the war. Only some of them started to grow on me. The more I talked with them the more I started to love them to bits... especially Tali, Garrus and Mordin. I actually started to feel like I wanted to keep them alive and protect them at all costs, and that's when you know they're well made.After playing the first game the controls feel so smooth and not complicated at all, so there's nothing to complain about. During combat the only flaw I found was that at times Shepard seemed to be unable to follow the instructions and just died without jumping over a simple obstacle, but those things happen. Also the AI might seem a bit idiotic, but that probably can be corrected by choosing a higher difficulty setting.And oh god, the replay value. The possibilities are almost endless when it comes to how you want to play. Different classes, gender, decisions, romances... everything can be played differently and affects things in different ways. In most games the only thing you can affect is whether you want to be the good samaritan or not, and that's it. This is the first time I've ever felt that by replaying I might actually achieve something I didn't the last time I played, even if it'd take another 30 hours of my life.The graphics were really good too, even if Bioware still tends to overuse the blur effect. Overall the game is pretty and really pleases the eye. There simply aren't reasons why someone shouldn't at least try the game out - except if you aren't ready for the bumpy ride Mass Effect 1 first wants to offer you. tl;dr Awesome calibrating simulator. 95/100			"

												TL;DR A worthy sequel to ME1. The grittier feel extends to all areas, including a shift from 'futuristic blue' menus to 'diarrhea yellow' menus. The simplified mechanics are a mixed blessing.Mass Effect 2 is very much the 'gritty second installment' of the Mass Effect series. Think The Empire Strikes Back compared to A New Hope - the whole game takes a darker tone, from the locations you visit, the characters you meet, the urgency of the story and the significance of the choices you make. A warning, though - there is much more language and blood/violence.Due to a surprise attack by an unknown spaceship at the beginning of the game, you are forced to work for the pro-human activists Cerberus. Remember those guys from the first game? They did genetic experiments on aliens and killed a pro-alien human officer who got in their way. Things are a little awkward as you, erstwhile saviour of the galaxy take up arms alongside the space-Nazis.Having defeated the lone Reaper in the first game, the Council believes that the Reaper threat is over, and refuses to acknowledge there are more out there. However, since they are sending their minions to capture human colonies, Cerberus sends you to investigate. In the course of your adventure, you visit all sorts of places, from the poorer areas of the Citadel to the Krogan homeworld, the corrupt but glamourous Asari world of Illium and even the notorial criminal capital of Omega. You recruit a new team, composed of some of your old comrades, but also a whole host of new characters. Some of the new characters are not as developed as the old ones, but on the whole, the calibre of storytelling is consistent.The combat system has been completely revamped, and the controls alone can take a couple of levels to get used to, but overall, they're mostly an improvement, as things are generally simplified. The loot/inventory system has also been changed. Instead of picking up millions of useless weapons, you research new types at your ship, which can then be used by anyone. The weapons are all subtly different, even within a certain type - ie, instead of each successive sniper being marginally more powerful, the first is a standard rifle, the second is a higher capacity one which fires 3 shots at once (useful for groups) and the third is a slow firing but amazingly powerful anti-material rifle.A new feature is research. In a special lab in your ship, you are able to research upgrades for you and your squadmates weapons, armour and abilities. Armour upgrades are different, in that you can switch components like your helmet, shoulder pads, leg armour, etc for ones with different bonuses, rather than the whole suit at once. You can also buy research from shops, unlike the first, where I never used a shop at all!Research takes minerals/rare metals, and this leads us to one of the worst elements of the game. Mining. You take the ship into orbit, and fire probes at a planet until it's depleted. Over. And over. And over again. I preferred the Mako.The game has also been divided up into 'hub' type areas, where no enemies ever appear, and 'mission' areas, where everyone you meet is an enemy. I feel this is a bit of a step backwards. Fortunately the tactical combat part of the game is significantly better, so fighting is much more enjoyable.One of the best bits of the game is the final mission. it, again, follows a general storyline, but depending upon choices you made during the game and during the last mission itself, there are any number of interesting variables. One interesting thing is that you can die and still beat the game...I've not seen that often in video games.			"

												Bioware did some big favours for themselves with this release.The combat has been completely redone which was my biggest complaint about ME1, and while it still isn't as satisfying as a dedicated TPS like say, Resident Evil or Max Payne, its an admirable effort for a hybrid RPG, and most especially from a studio that's usually stuck to D&Desque rules for combat.The graphics, style and presentation have all been kicked up a notch, and the world and scope of the game has been vastly expanded.The story however, is a little underwhelming, and almost insignificant compared to the first game. Where ME1 was concerned with the almost extinction of all sentient life in the galaxy by an ancient evil force, ME2 is about some kind of splinter remnants kidnapping a few hicks on the outskirts of space AND ONLY YOU CAN STOP THEM.More than that though, the structure of the story is a bit too straightforward. The game is about recruiting people in your team, and then going to kill the bad guys. That's basically it.It's a bit unfair to simplify the game as such, as there is some decent writing concerning your ship mates (some of which return from ME1). And the presentation and emotional investment of the final mission in the game really is quite an experience.There's plenty of content to be had, with my blind insanity playthrough being almost 50 hours. However this is including all the side missions, which consists of exploring lots of boring empty space for a blip on a radar, that leads to an underwhelming and somewhat pointless mission (usually just give you some negligable amounts of money and xp)As a sequel, the game is a fantastic continuance of Shephard's journey, but on its own merits as both a TPS and an RPG, it may leave some people wanting.

												9/10 Overview RPG/Third Person Shooter The Good: + 6 Character builds to choose from: Soldier, Infiltrator, Vanguard, Engineer, Biotic, and Adept. Each one specializes in different abilities, skills, weapons and each class feels distinct. + The combat is excellent as each weapon feels different, the controls are tight and the third person cover and shooting mechanics are solid.  + Both artistically and technically the game is visually appealing especially when you visit outdoor locations. I particularly like how each of the major cities in the game feel distinct from one another. The bright/light colors of Illium contrast the dark red hues on Omega for example. Just by the appearance of certain locations you can easily get an understanding of what the place is about and what to expect.  +Like the first mass effect, the scope of game is equally impressive. Everything this game has to offer, the characters, races, locations, missions, cities, etc is designed to make you feel like you are part of an epic science fiction adventure.+The story is more self contained than the first and third game, it certainly doesn't feel as big in scope to the other entries but that doesn't make it is any less interesting or fun. The story focuses more on individual characters rather than a grand narrative and because the characters are so good it makes the overall game better.  +Bioware's strength is writing detailed, interesting characters and this game is no different. The NPC's that you find and join you are some of the most interesting characters you will find in the entire series. Speaking to them and learning about their lives is interesting and adds an extra layer of believability. +Arguably the single greatest improvement over the first game is the side quests. This time around they are varied, fun , provide interesting back-story to many of the characters and locations and overall make you feel like you are part of a much larger universe. Side quests come in two types. The first is loyalty missions for your crew aboard the Normandy. These missions flesh out more of the characters history and most of the time involve you shooting many enemies. The second type involves you scanning planets to find an anomaly which leads you to the planet's surface to investigate. Most of the time these mission are self contained, however sometimes these types of missions will lead to other side missions. +Soundtrack and special effects. The Average:Probably one of my bigger disappointments with the game is the lack of rpg elements. Rather than improve some of the mechanics of the first game (inventory, UI, exploring planet on vehicle etc.) Bioware simply removed them completely. Even the character classes themselves have been streamlined with each class only have 4-5 skills. The game could be considered a third person shooter with some rpg elements rather than a full blown rpg. Its great that your choices from the first game carry over. It adds a bit of continuity to the story. The problem however, these choices don't really amount to anything other than a few changes in dialogue. In would have been nice if the choices you made had a much bigger impact in the following games. The citadel is suppose to be the major hub of the galaxy where all the trading and races come together, yet the design of the citadel feels small and cheap compared to the first game. The citadel is a few floors consisting of shops The series STILL lacks of controller supportA few crashes  The Bad:- This is more a fault on EA than the game. Under normal circumstances, when you buy a game on Steam with any dlc or bonuses everything gets downloaded at once, at least that is what I thought. Not with this game. In order to get any of the DLC, you first have to create an account with EA, log into the bioware social website, download each individual piece of dlc and then install each one separately....Thanks EA. - The game introduces planet scanning to find resources. These resources are used to upgrade weapon damage, biotic powers, upgrade the Normandy etc. This itself would not be a problem except for the fact that scanning planets is repetitive and boring. You are commander Shepard savior of the galaxy, speaking to different races, saving people, exploring planets, fighting dangerous missions... and all of that comes to a grinding halt when you have to stop and scan planets to upgrade anything. It sounds like something that was good on paper but failed in execution. -I found it odd that the only way to compare weapons is by reading the weapon description. There is no way to compare weapon damage, rate of fire, reload speed, etc.ConclusionThis is a worthy sequel to an already great game. I just wish they didn't have to sacrifice so many RPG elements to make it.  "

												Mass Effect 2 was a great game.  The mechanics changed a bit from one, and at first I was dissapointed at the loot system change.  I did get over it.  I did get annoyed by the fact that the only way to access the squad skills and journals was by hiting escape.  Why not keep the same keyboard layout as the last game.  Ohwell Story was great, the AI did a good job of fighting with the occasional went behind cover that hindered any view of the fight making them a little useless at times, however commanding them to move locations would overcome this problem.   I look forward to Mass Effect 3 that I just picked up...			"

												And so i sit here at the end of the Mass effect Trilogy with manly tears in my eyes :'( and a large amounts of joy in my heart :D . What a ride... What a ride.... i'll keep spoilers to a minimum but by the Protheans what a tale. This isn't like Fallout 4 in which all of the character are paper thin. There is real emotion and story behind each character my personal favourites being well, ALL of them! :D . The gameplay gets better and better with each game all complex but concise and easy to understand. The Plot, well let's just say the council should have listened and heeded the warnings ;) . As for Mass Effect 2, i believe that this is the best out of the series. There are minimal faults in this game and possibly the best plot out of the trilogy as well. And don't even get me started about Suicide Mission probably the pinicle of the series. The combat is great in comparison to Mass Effect 1 with a few tweaks and advancements here and there. However the star of the show is the interaction between you, your squadmates and the crew. So much depth to everyone whilst adding a few new characters here and there. Solid 9.5/10. Go do yourself a favour, buy the Trilogy and experience the Mass Effect universe a story like no other.			"

												What can I say about my favourite saga until now.  I would not recommend anyone to play Mass Effect 2 if they have not played Mass Effect 1 first. The storytelling is impressive, graphics are very good in spite of being a game from 2010 and each character has his/her own charming. The many possibilities of playing this game is what makes it even more amazing, you can build your own story ina  positive or a negative way. I mean, of course you can lose some of your crew but it would be because of the decision you have taken. I cannot say much more about this fantastic game and saga because i can't see a single coun of playing this game and getting involved by this universe. Totally recommended.			"

Rank: 9/10Recommendation(s): Play Mass Effect 1 to port your gameplay results to change plot, port saves into that legal copy of Mass Effect 3 on Steam, and play with 3D Vision assisted by Helix Mod.Major Theme: Well balanced Sci-Fi RPG designed and built by Bioware with  just enough EA meddling.Bought at Price: $35 (for Mass Effect 1 and Mass Effect 2 Deluxe)Bioware is an interesting studio. They have pushed out some very note worthy titles such as SWKOTOR (Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic) and Dragon Age: Origins. They are both worth a go, but are not for ""modern"" gamers who like action packed games.If you have played Mass Effect 1, you will find that Bioware had moved on from the classical ""RPG"" elements such as attributes (Dexterity, Strength, etc.) and inventory (limited slots, customization items take space). You will also discover that you can port your save game data and input the results to affect gameplay in Mass Effect 2.The stripping of core RPG mechanics was done to allow for as many people to enjoy the game as possible. The plot was re-designed to make it more action packed. The 3 plot necessities were focused, being: gore, sex, and humour. This unfortunately causes a problem for some; there's more on this later.

The result was a much more interesting, action packed title which should allow anyone to play it.You should however, take into account that Unreal 3 is more of a console porting engine. You can see this with the lower quality textures, limits on the detail of scenes, field of view (FOV), hidden frame rate smoothing, and loading in between decks of the Normandy.

When I think of consoles, one of the first things I think of is DLCs. While I describe them to be the evil of all evils to some, there are some ok ""patches"" such as the Shadow Broker, which adds to the story, save porting abilities, and even highlights the back story that I wasn't aware of from the comics. Another issue with porting is that meaningful keyboard shortcuts and keys are not used. This is where the concept of ""spacebar does everything"" comes in. While most games use the ""e"" key for interactions (failing that, the ""f"" key), Mass Effect 2 uses the spacebar. This is quite the switch from the original Mass Effect.Comparing to another successful title such as Dragon Age: Origins, you can see how the game has improved and worsened.Improvements range from not being so dry thanks to humour, to less about fine tuning character attributes and more enjoying the story.The list of things that you can say have become worse include: ""The getting laid simulator"" romance mechanic, the plot is too simple, and that the game is generally ""dumbed down"".Side Note: It should be up to you to evaluate what is important to you, but I will make as side note here to say that the game has replay ability. You can even replay Mass Effect to change how the story unfolds in ME2 and ME3.Another point that should be made apparent is that the 80% process is used.Due to the 80% process, cut scenes don't use weapons assigned by you. While not a “game breaking” issue, just could have been worth the weight (thanks gabe for the comment). In this process, studios finish things to 80% and move on, hoping to come back and finish them later. Sadly, most of the time this means picking the more meaningful features before shipment.Stereoscopic 3D done via Nvidia's 3D vision and improved via Helix Mod, really make this title a treat and greatly improve immersion.To end this off I will say this. The beauty of Mass Effect 2 (as with the others) is that you can play a different style or character the next playthough. Go with male Shepard once, then with the Female another. Things change, and thus I have played 4 times all the way though. Yes, you will feel like doing that one day. Maybe Romance Tali in one, Garrus the 2nd, or Miranda in the 3rd.			"

Make wonderful choices, like whether to sell out in order to get a discount at the store (just like Bioware did to EA) or maintain your dignity! Experience a game where your choices matter, and if you don't do every single loyalty mission, your crew will die horrific deaths! Love making has never been better, as you choose between a girl with severe daddy issues (and too many tattoos), an alien with no face, or a female who has been genetically altered to be perfect!Seriously though, buy it.

												Like it's predecessor, Mass Effect 2 does not dissapoint with it's stellar storyline and delivery. Top tier voice actors, and simply the *best* storyline out of *any* RPG game out on console and PC. ME2 improves on everything about ME1. Giving the game a more fast paced feel to it. They cut back a tad on the RPG aspect, but not in a bad way at all. I reccomend the entire Mass Effect series. 1-3. For any RPG gamer who appreciates a game with an excellent story, interactive characters, and just good ol' shooting fun-- the Mass Effect series is the perfect fusion of the two, for you to receive optimal enjoyment.

												The essential link between Mass Effect and Mass Effect 3. Mass Effect 2 is less focused on the general story background, but puts building a team and relationships into the focus of its story line. Apart from the introduction of the ""Collectors"", there's isn't much added to what has been learned about the reapers in Mass Effect 1.Mass Effect 2 is best enjoyed with an imported save game, giving away bits and pieces about what happened to all the colorful persons the payer met in the first game. Combat has been drastically simplified, giving way less emphasize on building the character and outfitting them with gear. With speed of the encounters picking up, the tactical impact of squad utilization has been dropped seomwhat in favor of putting the player's reaction time more into focus. It's not necessarily a bad thing, but won't appeal to those who wish for a less hectic approach to combat.While enjoying ME 2 greatly at the first time, I personally didn't find the second playthrough of ME 2 as rewarding as it felt for ME 1, because of the rather thin story development. While building relationships with the NPCs feels rewarding, it comes somewhat short in terms of depths. Less squad mates with more character development would have been preferable.Bottom line: Essential to (re)live the trilogy, but feels slightly like a stretch for those who already know about the dramatic developments of ME 3.PS: Don't miss updating the game with a HD texture modification! Due to technical limitations the developers did include low res textures only! The screenshots I have taken showcase HD textures for all squadmates. IMPORTANT:  Despite being published by EA, Mass Effect 2 DOES NOT require Origin to play. BUT: You are able to register your Steam copy of ME 2 at Origin as well, which enables you to download the DLC you're already eligible for by purchasing the special edition of the game.  "

												Mass Effect 2 is just a great game, with very few draw-backs. If you haven't played the first Mass Effect game, go play it! If it weren't for the b*llsh*t DLC situation, Mass Effect 2 would easily be worth the standard retail price.You can view the opening of the game here.Presumed dead by the Alliance, Shepard is given backing by the human-first extremist group Cerberus to investigate a strange phenomenon: whole Alliance colonies are simply disappearing. Investigating the disappearing colonies and a strange new enemy are the primary missions of the game that stretch from beginning to end; it's the core narrative that makes the game work. Within that framework, you as Shepard put together a combat team of the galaxy's most elite operatives - literally a sort of intergalactic ""Dirty Dozen."" Each team-member has a recruitment mission (required if you want them in your squad) and loyalty mission (not required, but ignore at your own risk!) The final mission is a masterpiece of programming and pacing. You'll want as many squad-mates as possible. Who is loyal and who isn't is a crucial factor in determining who lives or dies. Choosing the wrong squad-mates for support duty as Shepard and 2 others fight the (very creepy) final boss can result in more deaths. Decision making and laying the groundwork (ie loyalty) are crucial. Choices made throughout the game were never more consequential.The graphics still look great for a 2010 game. The music soundtrack is superb. There are some new minigames, like hacking wall safes and datapads. Both are fairly easy and don't slow down game-play that much. Scanning planets for resources, quickly devolves into a chore; you have to do it, though, to research improvements for your ship, guns, and armor. Planetary exploration from the first game is gone, which was disappointing to me. There are a LOT of side-missions, which are great if you just want to tool around the galaxy looking for stuff to do. And, yes, squad-mate romance is back. An added bonus are some fantastic actors to voice important characters, including Martin Sheen as The Illusive Man (yes, THAT Martin Sheen!), Yvonne Strahovski as Cerberus officer Miranda Lawson (from the TV show Chuck), and Carrie-Ann Moss as Omega gangster / ruler Aria T'Loak (Trinity from The Matrix). While the first Mass Effect was a great RPG, Mass Effect 2 focuses more on story and action at the expense of customization. It's like watching a favorite movie play out, except you are IN the movie, making the choices. A great story-based and combat-based RPG / FPS hybrid with high replayability. One of my all time favorites! Because of the DLC situation, though, only purchase the game when on sale at 75% off.A note about DLC:The DLC situation is, frankly, b*llsh*t. Once the game is fully assembled it is truly superb; but save your money and get the game on sale, because to acquire ALL the DLC will cost around $40 at this point.The Digital Deluxe Edition includes the Cerberus Network Add-on. The Cerberus Network provides access to the following DLC: Zaeed - The Price of RevengeFirewalker PackNormandy Crash SiteCerberus Arc ProjectorCerberus Weapons and ArmorThe Cerberus Network requires that you to create a profile on Bioware's Social website. Once your purchase of the Mass Effect 2 Digital Deluxe Edition is verified, you will be provided links to download .exe files (hosted on EA's severs) that will install the DLC. These will work on a Steam installation, and do NOT require the installation EA's Origin software. Purchasing additional DLC (which can be done on the Bioware Social website) follows the same pattern.			"

												While I don't have much Steam time on this game, I took the fight to the Collectors plenty from a retail disc. Great Cinema. Great tatooes! Sex with aliens! What more could you ask for? The move and shoot dynamics suck and the levels while beautiful are very small, thus it is weak on the 'game' side of the ledger. The game mechanics are not great but the STORY IS. For $5 on sale you would be mad not to get it. If you are a masochist you can also check the Bioware homepage where where there is plenty of overpriced DLC that they really should be giving away much cheaper.			"

												Have you ever wanted to be the captain of a space ship but Star Trek is too nerdy for you? Well now you are in EA Presents Bio BeWare Mass Effect 2: Axe Effect. Take on the role of commander Shepard and be you in space. Or be Shepard in space. It’s whatever. Best friend of waist high walls, you shoot your OWN path through predestined story missions. Talk to some bros and listen to banter in space in this Sci Fi mans shooter. In space, all of the shooters are mans. There are aliens that don’t look like mans but they don’t shoot thank goodness. I really get to feel like it’s cold blood murder in space and the action is visceral even when poor humanoid robots shoot me. To be fair there are also space spiders and space dogs so geeze I guess it’s not a total copy and paste skeleton job!The gameplay is cover man shooting but it is also talking to people in towns and making numbers get bigger. You will be playing an RPG sometimes, but then you are working for the establishment  and gunning down mens next thing you know. What genre of game are you even playing? We’ve all played a game before so the rest of this review is not about gameplay.The star of the show is codex talk man. At any time you can pause to stop playing the ♥♥♥♥ing game and go through menus to listen to a smooth talking gentleman chat about the game. You may be familiar with codex from Drag on Age or Final Fantasy XIII 1-3. but this time the codex is the highlight of the game as you sit back and get read the game to you. Over the course of the game you will get more bros for your ship and redder guns but the new codex entries are what pull the player along. For all you creepers out there you can have a romantic relationship with all sorts of space dudes and ladies. But not dude on dude because that is gay. In this Mass Effect no one is gay in space. Except women sometimes. But that’s not gay in space.Resource farming minigame? Lockpick minigame? We got it all here folks! Why don’t you slide up behind a turret or bap some heads off? But before you say seen this and peace out you get psychic abilities. If you are Vanguard (only be Vanguard folks) you can flip guys up to slow motion gravity and be goku instant transmission across the battlefield in space. You get some slaughterpals like Space Mad-Scientist Frog and Bald Girl Wanna Kill Things just to name a couple murderbuddies.Mass Effect 2 has a revolutionary choice-O-meter. You are red or you are blue and you cut yourself off from future opportunity just like in the real world. You can scratch the code off of your Doritos (™) Shepard’s Favorite Chips On The Citadel (™) chips to get more empathy points to spend on your dating harem if you choose to play the game like a weird alcoholic space pimp and not a serious professional going about saving the galaxy. Paragorn Mountain Dew for blue bloods.So strap on your watch which is a computer asap at your your local Valve Steam store. You are the telekinetik undead military captain rockstar and everyone loves you when you pull the trigger in space.

Fantastic unique characters, awesome atmosphere, great story, beautiful well-made world that you will get into, improved gameplay and combat system.

												This game is the second part of an awesome trilogy. It improves upon the first game greatly and has managed to succeed in surpassing it through its epic story, fantastic characters, and enjoyable gameplay. It is well worth the time and money and should be played by all.			"

												     Fantastic fantasy sci-fi rpg that makes your choices, and decisions throughout the game matter. The game itself does storytelling right, by starting off with a high-octane beginning bordering on cliche. This is where the game differs from most other games, where others would continue with the cliche beginning of starting with your charecter dying, then revert back to the present with some sort of prophecy garbage. On the other hand, Mass Effect 2 rolls with Shepard dying and bases the game behind this trillion dollar man, creating a exiting beginning that leads into a solid mid-game. The way they present the beginning story means that the player is independant to the council's wishes, in contrast to the previous game, meaning a greater degree in this open RPG. The choices you make in the mid-game regarding charecters, items, and ship upgrades influences how the game ending will proceed.  The late game provides a final mission, no spoilers for you, that all I can say is epic and worth you playing throught his masterpiece to see.     Besides the way the story is told, the game makes many changes from the previous game which include: a revamped weapon system, a simpler level up system, a planet scanning mechanic instead of the mako vehicle mechanic, fully customizable armour, and no mako vehicle sections of the game, plus many more. The game also changes on the graphical front, with higher resolution testures than the previous game, that still run very well on lower quality machines.     There is much more I can say regarding this game, from the charecter progression, the amount of content, the pitched battles in the game, the fitting and well-done soundtrack, the fixed combat system, and many, many more. This game is one of the  best games I have ever played, from a production values persective, to a content and personal perspective. I give the game 93/100 an A+, plus the CDFW seal of approval, I highly recommend it to everyone who likes good video games.tl;dr : Buy this game, it is good.			"

												I have a hard time speaking in a balanced manner about Mass Effect 2 because it's one of my single favorite video games of all-time. There are so many good things to gush over, but the bad pieces are really, truly bad and do a lot to ruin the experience of actually playing the game. The most concise way I can describe it is 'flawed masterpiece'. It's a game propped up by fantastic art and sound design and far better overall writing than the much maligned Mass Effect 3, but at the same time, the gameplay is nowhere near as tight and the overall design is way rougher -- To the point where I'd criticize the combat as being unfinished.To start, the graphics and the engine run pretty smoothly on the PC. It runs easily enough -- I see around 110-120 FPS on my 120hz 1440p monitor, but the textures are often muddy and low-res, a curse of the title being designed with far outdated consoles in mind... Even back in 2010. I had a similar experience with the first Mass Effect, though that game is even rougher-looking than this one is. The textures here are, on average, higher res. It helps that the lighting is far better designed than the first game (goodbye, ham-fisted lens flare!). There are a great many visual bugs, though. Far more than the console version. Glitches with the eyes, characters model inexplicably spinning, etc. But it's saved mostly by the beautiful art design. The use of colored lighting really adds a great touch, and the environments are unbelievably vibrant. There's a lot to 'feel' here just by looking at skyboxes. It's indicative of good art design and adequate design on the technical side to support it. The art team is the MVP here.The sound! Where to start? Jack Wall is absolutely fantastic, almost up to the level he was in the first game. He's at his best when he's laying down eerie music for the tense missions (Collector Ship, anybody?), but he does a great job with handling the huge change in tone from the first game. Mass Effect 1 was carried by a super-techno, futuristic style soundtrack, whereas this one has touches of futurism but mostly just feels brooding and dirty. It fits the art direction of the game perfectly, and even a minimalist track like the droning that plays during the loading screen really does a fantastic job to impart and augment the overall 'feel' of this game, which is a big part of what I find so enticing about Mass Effect 2.The writing is probably the games single strongest aspect. I don't mean to exaggerate, or to gush too much here, but there are some of the most well-written characters in any video game I've ever played. It's clear that Walters, Karpyshyn, and the rest of the writing staff were going for a Dirty Dozen, Wild West type feel with the characters and settings here, and they've succeeded in spades. There are a lot of characters that might even fit into a cliche, but the dialogue is so well-written and the voice acting is so superb that the game manages to skip that pothole and cruise along. Thane Krios, the spiritual, regretful assassin, is a stand-out among a cast of solid personalities. His discussions with Shepard and his dealings with his son Kolyat are excellent. Garrus is far more fleshed out here than he was in the first game (in which I found his character to be disappointingly underdeveloped), and the writing here creates a bridge to his being so likable in the third game. Legion, a character who arrives unfortunately late in the game, is another stellar twist and an amazingly well-written and impresses in unexpected ways. It's hard to go into detail without spoiling anything, but suffice it to say that his obsessive 'complex' is wholly unexpected and goes on to completely destroy any expectation I had when I initially learned of the characters presence in the game.There are some pitfalls here, unfortunately, mostly in the form of Jacob Taylor. He always came off as completely unlikable to me, though that's more a personal feeling and not a general criticism. I think he's a poor character simply because there's not really much there to dig into. He's got some father issues to deal with that feel crammed in mid-game and seem to hover around the outside of his character rather than fleshing out his core, like so many of the other characters side missions are intended to do.Now that I've gushed over the good things, let's talk about some of the bad.The game plays as if its half finished, particularly during combat. There's a nice idea and an adequate core design here, but it seems like it could have used far longer in the QA process than it actually had. The core mechanics of taking down the enemies shields/barriers, armor, and then health are really excellent. Each is weak to a different type of weapon, ammo, and power, so each encounter becomes a sort of puzzle where you're evaluating which enemy is the most threatening and thus must be dealt with first, and by using which power or weapon to do so. It's incredibly complex but relatively simple to learn, and getting through some of the more difficult encounters on hardcore or insanity difficulty is amazingly satisfying.Sounds great, right? Unfortunately, while the game is at its best on the two hardest difficulty modes, it also suffers the most on those modes due to extremely buggy cover mechanics and unbelievably poor friendly AI. The AI is absolutely abysmal, and if you want that Insanity trophy you better be ready for some frustration. It's necessary to completely micomanage your allies by controlling where they're taking cover at all times. The problem with cover also manifests itself here, as there are many times when allies simply refuse to listen to you and wade out into enemy fire only to die immediately. It's so frustratingly idiotic that I find myself wondering how the game ever shipped in this fashion. It's a mess, and having to babysit your idiotic, suicidal squadmates really destroys what would have been an otherwise fantastic gameplay system. The general design is there, but the technical execution is utterly terrible and enough to make you bash your head against a wall. It's much more passable on Normal and Casual, but if you're gunning for Hardcore or Insanity, get ready for a headache.The overall design of the game, despite these poorer aspects, is excellent. The episodic style of gameplay in which you're recruiting allies just feels right, and the game feels far more organized and direct than the first game ever did. On the harder difficulties you really get a sense of it being a race against time. You've got to plan out what missions you're doing at what time, because upgrades are incredibly important and if you find yourself trying to take on Horizon or the Collector Ship without the good ones, you can actually get completely stuck and be forced to start over. While this sounds frustrating, it actually does a good job to suck you into the situation that Shepard and the crew find themselves in. They've got to get all of this done, and quickly, because the Collectors are on the move and they aren't waiting for you. This episodic style is paced perfectly, and you never seem to experience any of the drag that you see in the first game when you get dropped onto the Citadel after Eden Prime only to find yourself immediately bogged down with a huge area to explore and dozens of sidequests to tackle. It does a far better job with making sure you never feel overwhelmed than the first game. It's open-ended enough without stranding you in a sea of objectives -- You've always got a handful of options of what to do next, and it's up to you to decide which seems to be most important.All of the gameplay here comes to a head in a fantastic final act that sees everything you've done so far in the game build up to one massive conclusion. The suicide mission is truly excellent, and caps off a must-play game for everyone interested in RPGs.Insanity gameplay video:

												Mass Effect 2  is Role Play Third Person Shooter. It does stray from the original title on the game play but it is some great improvements on play style and some horrible one just take it all with a grain of salt.  Now the real challenge to this one is o wait don't want to ruin the ending.  But if you played the first you should get his one as well if your looking at this one and not the first you won't miss much but  you won't get the full mass effect of the game (stupid pun).  Be the righteous hero or be the renegade the choice is yours.  I do recommend the bundle for the two.  If you see it on sale it is unquestionably worth it.			"

												The Mass Effect series has probably been the most rich and emotional trilogy of games I've played since I've started my 'gaming career'. While the current RPG market is oversaturated with boring, shoot 'em ups, and your choices have little to no effect in the games currently on the market. Yes, Mass Effect's main game is a shooter, but Bioware makes up for those rough edges with a fantastic narrative, amazing soundtracks, characters who feel real, and choices that feel satisfactory while having big impacts on your next campaign in Mass Effect. Simply put; this trilogy is a masterpiece.As the iconic Commander Shepard, will you save the galaxy and all of its inhabitants, or doom them to extinction?10/10. "

												Mass Effect 2 sees you, yet again fighting to save the galaxy from the mysterious, alluring Reapers.Human colonies are disappearing and you are sent by the shady Illusive Man (Martin Sheen), the leader of the Pro-Human organization,  Cerberus  to find out what is going on, on the way you'll rediscover the new Normandy SR2, rebuilt by Cerberus after the devestating attack in the prologue. On your epic journey across the galaxy you'll meet powerfull allies, old friends, and dark enemies, on your mission to stop the Collectors and thwart the Reaper's plans.Mass Effect's story is one of sheer brilliance, the characters, location, soundtrack and intricately detailed codex will leave you enchanted for weeks. With moral choices that can leave you either stricken with guilt or brimming with a feeling of goodness, you can be sure that Commander Shephard is at the forefront of the fight. With detailed locations and quests you can be sure of a long, rich, gameplay experience that you may find yourself playing after your first playthrough.Mass Effect 2 once again employs the Renegade and Paragon speech options, this means that you can either pick the good option, or bad option when in conversation with a character, this can then, later on affect the choices you can make and the reaction of different characters upon meeting you.In the end, I can not possibly try and sum up Mass Effect 2's brilliance, it is my favourite game of all time, and is a story telling epic, it can and will more than likely leave you in awe and will want you cming back for me, with thoughts of ""Just one more hour"" becoming frequent. There is nothing more for me to say really than buy the game, I urge you, you won't regret it, and for the next 2 days is 75% off!EDIT: In case you're wondering why my play time is so low it's because I own Mass Effect 2 on the Xbox 360, and have played through it around 4 times :D(Mass Effect 2 is a Sci-Fi RPG)			"

												Mass Effect 2 is the greatest game of our time. Never before in the history of gaming has an individual had so many different choices as to what kinds of extraterrestrial to have sexual relations with. Although the romance stories are quite engaging and emotional, and the cut scences leading up to the implied intercourse quite titilating, I am always left scratching my head. It is not explained thuroughly enough how said conjugations works. How do the parts fit together? Can  commander Shepherd become pregnant? Why are the aliens so attracted to women while I am not? These are questions that are left unanswered. My first love was a krogan, and he will always be closest to my heart. But inspite of my intimacy with Grunt, I was ultimately confused by the biology involved. I understand that krogans posses four gonads but what isn't explained is how large or what shape their members are. One thing I know for sure is that the krogon would likely be on bottom as their sheer mass may very well crush the human involved. The previously mentioned questions perplexed me so much that I wrote my term paper in Human Sexuality class on them. Inspite of it being excelently written I recieved very sharp criticism from both my peers and my mom, who's help I enlisted in editing my paper. Innovators will always be persecuted and misunderstood by the thralls of the ignorant. Love is free. The rules of biology should not limit one's sexual desires. Just as the Supreme Court ruled for marriage equality, one day I would hope they will grant rights to those of us who wish to share physical intamacy with those of another species from another planet. Until then I will fight on with pride in my heart, knowing that being a xenosexual is not a sin, nor a lifestyle. And knowing that is more important than knowing how a krogan's parts fit with a human's parts, and in that lies the true value and lesson in Mass Effect 2.			"

												This game is epic. After you complete it, you feel like having saved the galaxy, which you actually do in this game.The first ME had a great story, but everything else was bad or mediocre. ME2 has fixed all the flaws of its predecessor. So, what you get, is almost a perfect game.Specific improvements:- Graphics and textures: a wider variety- Galaxy map: easier navigation, there are mission marks, so you don't have to read your journal, to know where you should be going- Mining: actually makes sense in this game, as you gather resources for your upgrades; although, sometimes it feels like overkill- More squad members to choose from- More action, the dialogues are more compact- Better battle system, though it's still not completely convenient to control your squad members- More weapons, no floating when zoomed- Mako is gone – yes! – hated that thing- Better interfaceThe only flaw this game has, is occasional camera behaviour problems, e.g., in the mission where husks are running into you in narrow cave corridors, there are problems with FOV and camera rotation.Grenades would have been useful, but there aren't any.My overall rating:9/10			"

												Amazingly good game following the story of Commander Shepard.Play this game if you want to know cool Characters, a good story and universe and a decently good third person shooter. This game is about the choices you make.You can buy DLC from the Bioware store, but I would say its worth it. At least the DLC for the additional story. The weapons not so much.(Those who wants the full experience)Play all 3 games.The choices you pick in the first game affects the second and so on. So get ME1 play through it with YOUR Shepard, then   import your Shepard from the first to the second and play it and so on. All the story DLC for the games are recommended.  "

Overall, I really loved this game. Playing most of the side missions and finishing the game took me over 20+ hours! A great game, great value. Buy it.Worth Full price. I rarely say that.

												Mass Effect is one of the most immense, well written and interesting story based game sagas I've ever played. If you haven't played the first one, you're missing a LOT, especially since all of the choices you've made in the first game can be ported over to the second game to change the experience. The combat's more crisp and cover based, and with cover based combat, my old enemy, ""regenerating health"" came with it, but it's varied nicely through six different player classes you get to select, ranging from abilities in tech, biotics, or good old fashioned, ""Shoot it even harder."" On a better note, the tedious inventory management is gone, as well as that stupid Mako vehicle. The story and atmosphere feels darker and more compelling, but will feel a tad slower in this one compared to the first, because much of the game is spent preparing you and your very likeable crew's survival odds for a final mission laid out early on. If you're a story nut, this series is where it's at!			"

rating: worth buying at full pricescore: 10/10 - masterpiecesimilar games: Deus Ex, The Bureau, Dragon Age: Origins, Spec Ops The Linetags: story-rich, action packed, epic, character development, choicesMass Effect 1 was an okay game, it had dull gameplay but a good story and cool characters. Mass Effect 2 does not simply improve everything ME1 did, the devs completely overhauled the whole thing like they build it from scratch, this time with much more budget and a longer deadline. Whats impressive about this is the size of the game and the quality of everything. It is very rare that a big game like this, an open world game or RPG, is so well designed in every area. If you think about it there is always something which is not really fleshed out in some game you think are great, of course they are just small things, but that is the difference between a masterpiece and a very good game. For example look at the trading system and shops in most RPGs. Probably the shops will sell random equipment and you can sell everything you find there, and you probably will get tons of loot you never need.In Mass Effect 2 you get no loot, except money and resources. There are only some moments in the game where you find an upgrade or an alternative to an existing weapon. Giving the player tons of loot like in other games (also in Mass Effect 1) just doesnt make sense, because it does nothing except wasting your time because you have to compare it to your existing loot to see if its worth it, if not you will sell it. That also breaks the balance of money the players gets in most games and to counter that the developers balance the shops in a way that you rarely find something useful to buy. Because the money you get in ME2 is more controlled and shops have only specific items they sell only once (you only need them once), everything gets better. Exploration and hacking is more rewarding, because the money you get is more useful. Visiting shops is worth doing because EVERYTHING you can buy is worth it, you just need the money for it. And it opens more flexibility for the devs to design their missions, or just small things like giving you opportunities to get discounts which wouldnt be worth getting in other games. All that is just a tiny fraction of the game, I just want to explain to you to how fleshed out and well designed this game is.Bioware didn't care about genre conventions or did things only because this game is supposed to be an RPG, every decision they made is because it makes sense for the game, nothing else. Another example for that is the inventory system, you have no inventory actually. You only need to find one copy of a weapon, it will be available for all squad members. That removes the really annoying fiddling around with the inventory crap in ME1. They also moved the ammo upgrades from the inventory to the skill menu, which means they are skills now and every crew member has maybe 1 or 2 ammo upgrade available to him, which also gives you more criteria to pick your party-members. There are also other criteria to pick party-members apart from who is the coolest, which was really the only criteria in ME1, skills of your crew didn't really matter. Every party member has set weapon-types he can use, set abilties and strengths which can synergy with others or be redundant.Also there is a mission every crew member will have for you. Doing these will not only make them loyal, they will also unlock an extra ability for them and also matter for the story (no spoilers), but its not just ""doing"" these missions, you can fail them and then they are gone and you have to live with the consequences.In Mass Effect 2 you get your crew members much faster than in ME1, which is good, because it gives you more variety early on and there are more crew members in total, all of them very different and interesting in their own way. There was only 1 character which I hated and is cliche in my opinion (Jack). Actually the conversations with the crew members were the most fun part about ME2 for me, the dialogues were really interesting but not just exposition or alibi character development and all of it is optional, which is great for several reasons. There are many things in Mass Effect 2 which are optional, I think if you do only the must-do things, you could finish this game in 5 hours or so. It took me 25 hours and I know that there were easily 5 more hours I could put into it, but I don't recommend doing everything you can, it could get tenacious. Luckily unlike ME1 where every side-quests was obvious filler, every side mission in ME2 is unqiue and meaningful and you get useful rewards for them. They even managed to make the exploration of planets fun. In ME1 you just clicked on every unexplored planet and you got some text. In ME2 you have a scanner and have to scan the surface manually to find resources. That process is not boring because it is presented very nice and it is very rewarding, because the resources you find are crucial to get upgrades, and the upgrades themselves are also crucial. Still you are not forced to do these scans if you don't want to, there are enough upgrades you can buy and find and you also sometimes find resources on missions.The combat got the biggest overhaul, it is actually fun and challenging now. The AI is improved greatly compared to ME1, but your party sometimes still does stupid things, but you can control them much more easy now and still more flexbile just with 1 button for each party member, and managing them is more important now, because of their powers. Shephard also has powers now depending on the class you pick, most of them you already know from ME1 (they are still cool), but there are also some new powers. These are not only useful and necessary, they are also really fun to use thanks to really good sound-design, animations and hit-feedback. Bioware also proves that you can make satisfying gunsounds for sci-fi/laser weapons. Enemies aren't bullet sponges anymore, if you know how to bring their shields down, they react to your shots, fall down, scream because you burn them or if they are mechs they loose an arm or something. Your shots just have more impact now which makes combat more fun overall. The only thing which could be improved is the enemy design, the enemies are cool and there are a good number of enemy types, but the tactics you fight them with are not much different. With more diverse enemy types the combat could have more variety, which it does not really need though. I'm not a fan of regenerating health, because it makes the outcome of a fight irrelevant for the next fights, it only matters that you win the fight, but regenerating health makes sense for this game and works.I don't want to talk much about the story, because I don't want to spoil anything. What really surprised me was the amount of elements which carry over from ME1 and how many choices you have in general, these not only have impacts on small side-stories, but also on the ending of ME2. The ending alone of ME2 is a masterpiece. There are so many variables in the ending it easily surpasses the amount of choices you have in other games, and in most games your choices don't really matter anyway. I'm really eager to see how the consequences will affect ME3. There were parts in the game where I really had to think about my decisions, rarely the choices are black and white, sometimes you might not even notice that something is a ""choice"". Especially one decision kept me thinking for a very long time, and I still don't know what the right thing to do was (probably because there is no simple right and wrong for that question). The story is much more engaging and the dialouges much more interesting than in ME1, because they properly animated the cutscenes this time. Characters don't just stand infront of each other like robots, they move around, do things, even Shephard does. I have no more characters left for this review.			"

I really enjoy the little upgrade system and not finding a gun in every corner so you can get attached to the one you have for a while. The skill tree seems a bit more limited compared to the first, but it still makes a big impact in-game. Not sure if it's still worth 20 bucks though. I'd say more on the lines of 10 or 15 at most.

												After finishing Mass Effect 1 a couple of days ago, I was eager to start playing Mass Effect 2 as soon as possible. Expecting more of the same, I was in for a few unpleasant surprises. So much has changed that it almost feels like a different game. CONTROLS:The controls are so radically different from ME1 that it actually got me killed on several occasions. I felt like my arms had been cut off and then sewn back on backwards! I know that eventually I'll get used to the new controls but they still feel super weird.WEAPONS:Reloading? Seriously? Can't buy new weapons, only the blueprints? Really? While I'm happy that I don't have to manually customize every single weapon on every single squad member, this is a bit too simplistic.MAP:There was nothing wrong with the maps in ME1. The map in ME2 is hard to read and too colourful. It looks like somebody just resized all the locations to 20x10 pixels and made them into a map. What happened to the ability to add waypoints?HUD:Why am I able to ""light up"" objects through walls? It's distracting. The colour and thickness of the rectangle make things easy to miss. In the first ME game everything stood out great when you placed the crosshairs over an item.CHARACTER SKILLS:What happened to all my skills from ME1? Puff! Disappeared into thin air! Now you only get five. Yay! Thank you, Bioware!PROFANITY:I don't remember hearing much profanity in ME1. While I'm not against it per se, I didn't expect this from ME2 judging by the tone set by ME1. Completely unnecessary.Overall I can't say it's a bad game and I'm curious to see how the story develops. However, compared to ME1, I can't help but wonder: WHAT WERE THEY THINKING!!?			"

												A must-have sequel to original Mass Effect. Not that it is particularly great - in my opinion, it doesn't measure up to its predecessor nor to the trilogy's finale - but it's a necessary part of the story and it's definitely worth playing.The second part of ME franchise puts greater accent on squad interaction. In fact, you can get as much as a dozen companions, and missions related to their backstories occupy most of the game. It might be a turn-off for some, but if you felt immersed in the first Mass Effect, you should find most of those characters and missions quite enjoyable, at least during the first playthrough. I promise you're going to love some of your new squadmates, who will make you laugh and cry, and it seems that your old friends haven't forgotten about you after all.The main storyline is consequently even shorter than in ME1, though with all the other assignments it shouldn't be a problem. One's for sure - I'm not going to spoil the climax, but it's as epic as the battle with the Sovereign. Mass Effect series didn't lose its scale and there are still moments that make you turn up the volume and sit at the edge of your seat. The ground battles have a whole new quality to them (finally Mass Effect has elements of a proper shooter - ducking behind cover and shooting seems more real and exciting than in the first part of the series), though perhaps you're going to miss the Mako.A few words about the equipment system - it's much simplier than in the first game and I personally consider it an improvement. If you enjoyed comparing stats, shopping, and painstakingly equipping every single member of your squad, you might be disappointed, but if not, here's good news. The whole equipment system has been replaced with several items of weaponry, a few customizable elements of armor for Shepard, and a variety of upgrades giving bonuses for Commander or the whole squad. You may like it or not, but it's definitely easier to deal with. Leveling system has been simplified as well - maybe even too much - but it's now more intuitive, and it doesn't take 40 levels to get you the skill you want anymore.My biggest pain with this game lies within DLC-s, which cost more than the game itself (especially when it's on sale), but when you finally play them, they seem essential to the story. It might be a pain in your wallet, but the sad truth is that some content has been apparently cut from the game and sold in separate bundles. Mass Effect 2 is still a fairly good game by itself, but it feels somehow incomplete without that additional content.That said, it's still Mass Effect, and thus it's a part of one of the greatest stories I've been immersed in. Don't forget to check digital deluxe edition available here for the same price... and have fun!			"

												Finished the game with insanity difficulty yesterday (and started with it ^^) and now I'm going to the new game+ in casual, damnly hilarious!This game has pretty much everything for itself, the gameplay's wonderful, the graphics are very good, it has boobs (and sex somehow) and guns, there are aliens. The syfy part is really intersteting and every planet has its description. You have many many choices during the game which, for most of them, does truly matter for the rest of the game. There are many possible classes, though as I just ended the game with one of them I can't really talk about it. Though, I suspect it is a good point. And way, much more... ^^ (such as hacking, bypassing... Reminded me of Alien Isolation, loved it) The bad points will take me more times, but it's because I don't want to spoil any of the game. I insist this is a wonderful game, I rarely end my games and I'm about to do it a second time. It's just that I found intersting to explain what can be bad, for two reason. First, because it's important for you to know if there are thing you can't live with (but I doubt it'll be the case here), and second because other people will be able to contrast my opinion. ^^There are some bad points too. Glitches, damn I was almost at the 400th save cause even when no battle was excpected, I feared to start flying or to get stuck in wall or similar weird behaviors. These does not happen often, but as there sometimes are no way to get rid of them if not reloading a previous game, it can be really really annoying. (It has never been for me as the first time it happened to me I started saving as I was breathing, but no doubt it can be) Another glitch which is quiet weird but is not a problem at all is that sometimes characters don't have their proper voices (and no, I'm not talking about mike going weird, there's that too I know it's normal), this isn't exactly a bad point as it's even funny sometimes.Another bad point is the money. You're limited in money by the money you get from your missions and this isn't enough to buy everything, I think it's possible through new game+ though, I'll see that soon enough. Quiet the same, but some people will probably prefer it this way, it's not possible to level paragon and renegate to the max. It's though probably to have one to the max if you foccus, but you can't try to have always all choices, or if it's possible, I clearly missed something. (If that's the case, please tell me that, without telling me what this is, wanna find out by myself)And there is that keybinding that made me mad more than once. the SPACEBAR which became LEFTSHIFT to me is used to, well, everything. Interaction, picking up, talking, hiding, crouching, running. This is conveniant, but also very annoying. You're just trying to running from those enemy of yours, you just slip for a bit on the left and there you're now hiding in plain side which is a suicide move. And there lots of other ugly situation this is causing. Another thing, and if you've never play the game it's important you hear that, the tip at the beginning of the game ain't dynamic. So if you change you're keybinding's settings these will still point you to the default settings, so be sure to remember really well after changing you biding that you'll be able to know how to use them.And one hell of a bad point... You can't have a lesbian relationship between Shepard and Miranda. (damn! xD)Oh another bad point I'm starting to experience, I yes I know manipulating the file it is possible, but you cannot skip the long, long introduction of the game. And when you wanna restart it, this is becoming a real pain in the <3. ^^I'd like to add that I didn't play Mass Effect 1  (yet :p), and this isn't really annoying, the game kinda ""remind"" you of what happened in the first game, though I think it'd be better, but that doesn't have to stop you.About difficulty, this isn't a realy hard game. As I said, I started the game with the insanity difficulty with no previous experience in the mass effect franchise and I managed to keep it isane 'till the end of the game. Not that insanity is not hard (it is ^^), but the game is quiet intuitive, it's easy to find how to handle a battle and if you're not to bad at aiming, this isn't that hard. I can't advise any difficulty as I only know insanity (and a bit of casual now).I'm disappointed there's only a ""yes/no"" notation on steam, I'd like to put a ten to this game! :D			"

												If you haven't played Mass Effect 1 then stop reading this review AND GO PLAY THAT FIRST to have the best experience! Mass Effect 2 takes many of the rpg elements from Mass Effect 1 out but solidifies the gameplay more and trims out all the fat from the first game so you get nothing but pure meat.The exploration is gone but in return you get better dialouge and better combat. The characters are more diversed and flushed out and I thought they were better due to personalities and more backstory into them, If you are into sidequests over main missions then ME2 does a way better job than ME1 in that respect and the main quest is still really good but the side missions mostly involve loyalty missions to give your crew members more story and helping them out. Would I reccommend ME2 over ME1? No because I believe that you have to play all 3 games to get the full experience but IMO the gameplay is a lot better than ME1 but less tactical and more action. It still feels like a choose your own adventure game and has that 70's, 80's Space opera feel that the first one has but adds more spices to it like Omega which is heavily inspired by the film Blade Runner. It's well worth a buy and you will love every minute of it. Suicide mission is also one of the best end missions I have ever played, I felt really engrossed and felt like I was in a daredevil mission with the odds stacked against me. It's hard for me to choose between which I like more in Mass Effect 1 or 2 because they are both awesome but this game is worth a playthrough and It is one of the best sequels ever.			"

SummaryHonestly, doing a review for such an already ubiquitous game may well be a pointless exercise, but to be honest I just played this game for 40 hours in 3 days and I wanted a place to put my thoughts. The game isn't perfect, but it's damn good. The few flaws are mostly a consequence of the development being focused towards consoles, but they aren't game destroying.Also I'm writing this withough having read any other reviews - it was a bit of an impulse buy - so apologies if I repeat everything you've already read, or completely miss the point somewhere.Pros:Immersive worldFantastic writingVoice actingShootingCons:Texture quality/general graphics optionsVariety of combatKeybindingsFacial expressions made by ShepardStory (Spoiler free)Frankly, this is the only reason anyone should get this game. If you have no interest in storytelling whatsoever, there are much better shooters out there; if you have no interest in shooters, it's not worth being put off. The story is very immersive, with an incredibly fleshed out world, and more than makes up for any flaws the game has in other areas. Characters don't feel neglected, although sometimes there isn't quite enough content for a character you want to experience more of. (Side note: You may get a mixed first impression of ""The Salarian"", which could prompt you to stop going out of your way to talk to him. This is the sensible option if you wish to preserve your sides later in the game. Some of his lines are just golden.)If you haven't played Mass Effect 1, I would recommend playing it first, even if it is mechanically slightly inferior to it's sequel, and you can play it without. However, a lot of enjoyment can be derived from taking a single Shepard, with all his actions, choices, and in my case, awful facial hair, through the series.CombatSatisfying, though slightly repetitive. The cover system can be awkward to use at times, thanks to Use, Sprint, and Take Cover all forcibly bound to the same action - by far the ugliest scar from the console port. If, like I did, you want to play with the same controls as every other PC shooter in the universe, the easiest fix is to use the primary and secondary keybinding functionality to bind the do-everything button to both what you want the Use and Sprint buttons to be. Often you'll be sprinting into cover anyway, so it kind of works, but it's definitely not ideal.There's a lot of variety to be had in terms of the ways you can build Shepard, but during a single playthrough it can get fairly restrictive, especially if you want to play optimally. That said, the variety in squadmates can allow a few different tactical approaches for the same Shepard, even if you only get to experience their skills and playstyle via the tactics interface, which carries over nicely from Mass Effect 1.Roleplaying and MoralityThe morality system is extremely black and white, which can be an issue, but if you stick to any non-gamey moral compass for your Shepard, it will probably see you pick up a good few Paragon and Renegade points each. Some important dialogue options require many of one or the other, though, so it's difficult to play a middle man, which is a little disappointing. Additionally, some choices don't really fall under stereotypical ""good"" and ""evil"" labels either way, but they assign Parargon and Renegade points to them anyway, so it doesn't always make sense. I didn't find it really hindered me in any way though. The feeling of decisions having an impact in the world is always great, though.			"

												Great game! The only problem - Mass Effect 1 exists. Narrative: I just finished Mass Effect 1 and started playing 2 and I like it less because the story is so fast paced. I'm not thinking about the dangers of the reapers or what could happen later and how I will plan for it, I'm thinking what will this next mission throw at me. And connection and feeling for characters have decreased greatly; if they gave me a choice between Grunt and Jack, like on virmire, I'd play eenie meenie miney mo, I wouldn't think of about the personality of both characters and where our friendship was headed - frankly because I hardly care.﻿ The narrative of Mass Effect 1 is probably the best I've ever experienced in a game, but Mass Effect 2 is ""just"" really good. The story in Mass Effect 2 is too fast paced, it doesn't really give you time to smell the roses, to admire how glorious the game could've been. Combat:The combat is significantly better, even with the not so great addition of thermal clips and controls worse than the original game. It looks better, but doesn't feel as good as the original, almost entirely because of the controls (which can be edited in the settings) but even after changing them to the original game's controls it doesn't feel right.     Mass Effect 2 is just kind of awkward compared to Mass Effect 1, but still a great experience.			"

The syfy part is really intersteting and every planet has its description. You have many many choices during the game which, for most of them, does truly matter for the rest of the game. There are many possible classes, though as I just ended the game with one of them I can't really talk about it. Though, I suspect it is a good point. And way, much more... ^^ (such as hacking, bypassing... Reminded me of Alien Isolation, loved it) The bad points will take me more times, but it's because I don't want to spoil any of the game. I insist this is a wonderful game, I rarely end my games and I'm about to do it a second time. It's just that I found intersting to explain what can be bad, for two reason. First, because it's important for you to know if there are thing you can't live with (but I doubt it'll be the case here), and second because other people will be able to contrast my opinion. ^^There are some bad points too. Glitches, damn I was almost at the 400th save cause even when no battle was excpected, I feared to start flying or to get stuck in wall or similar weird behaviors. These does not happen often, but as there sometimes are no way to get rid of them if not reloading a previous game, it can be really really annoying. (It has never been for me as the first time it happened to me I started saving as I was breathing, but no doubt it can be) Another glitch which is quiet weird but is not a problem at all is that sometimes characters don't have their proper voices (and no, I'm not talking about mike going weird, there's that too I know it's normal), this isn't exactly a bad point as it's even funny sometimes.Another bad point is the money. You're limited in money by the money you get from your missions and this isn't enough to buy everything, I think it's possible through new game+ though, I'll see that soon enough. Quiet the same, but some people will probably prefer it this way, it's not possible to level paragon and renegate to the max. It's though probably to have one to the max if you foccus, but you can't try to have always all choices, or if it's possible, I clearly missed something. (If that's the case, please tell me that, without telling me what this is, wanna find out by myself)And there is that keybinding that made me mad more than once. the SPACEBAR which became LEFTSHIFT to me is used to, well, everything. Interaction, picking up, talking, hiding, crouching, running. This is conveniant, but also very annoying. You're just trying to running from those enemy of yours, you just slip for a bit on the left and there you're now hiding in plain side which is a suicide move. And there lots of other ugly situation this is causing. Another thing, and if you've never play the game it's important you hear that, the tip at the beginning of the game ain't dynamic. So if you change you're keybinding's settings these will still point you to the default settings, so be sure to remember really well after changing you biding that you'll be able to know how to use them.And one hell of a bad point... You can't have a lesbian relationship between Shepard and Miranda. (damn! xD)Oh another bad point I'm starting to experience, I yes I know manipulating the file it is possible, but you cannot skip the long, long introduction of the game. And when you wanna restart it, this is becoming a real pain in the <3. ^^I'd like to add that I didn't play Mass Effect 1  (yet :p), and this isn't really annoying, the game kinda ""remind"" you of what happened in the first game, though I think it'd be better, but that doesn't have to stop you.About difficulty, this isn't a realy hard game. As I said, I started the game with the insanity difficulty with no previous experience in the mass effect franchise and I managed to keep it isane 'till the end of the game. Not that insanity is not hard (it is ^^), but the game is quiet intuitive, it's easy to find how to handle a battle and if you're not to bad at aiming, this isn't that hard. I can't advise any difficulty as I only know insanity (and a bit of casual now).I'm disappointed there's only a ""yes/no"" notation on steam, I'd like to put a ten to this game! :D			"

												El mejor Sci-Fi RPG que jugué en mi vida... una excelente historia, muy de película, bastante sombría y dramática.El gameplay es más dinámico que el Mass Effect 1, pudiendo hacer una enfrentación sin tener que pausear para que la squad use sus poderes bióticos, o sin tener que pausear para cambiar el tipo de munición.Los gráficos son más oscuros y nítidos en color, eso le da una linda atmósfera, sintiendo estar en otro juego, sacándote la idea de una expansión del 1.¿Si necesitás haber jugado el primero para entender el segundo?Para nada, aunque algunos personajes vuelven, las decisiones que tomaste (las cuales cambia todo, ya que incluso hay decisiones de vida o muerte, tanto de la squad como propias) se mantienen, aunque si no importás el savegame del primero, las decisiones serían las ""default"".Explorar la Vía Láctea, conocer e interactuar con otras razas, explorar planetas y lunas (incluso nuestra Luna), con una fantástica historia.

												Having just recently replayed Mass Effect 2 I was shocked at just how well everything has held up. People praise ME2 for being one of the greatest games made and it's hard to argue. Mass Effect 2 is a truly remarkable game and what makes it that way isn't any one aspect, but the interplay between all the systems that has allowed it to shine. Only by skillfully weaving the elements of combat, story, art and sound together did the men and women of BioWare create such a remarkable experience. But there's one additional system that has helped elevate Mass Effect 2 to such a timeless classic. The players. By adding our own personal stories to the tapestry already laid out by BioWare did each and everyone of us create their own indelible experiences that will always hold up to the test of time. Mass Effect 2 respects the player's choices and because of that it will ALWAYS be that good.			"

SummaryHonestly, doing a review for such an already ubiquitous game may well be a pointless exercise, but to be honest I just played this game for 40 hours in 3 days and I wanted a place to put my thoughts. The game isn't perfect, but it's damn good. The few flaws are mostly a consequence of the development being focused towards consoles, but they aren't game destroying.Also I'm writing this withough having read any other reviews - it was a bit of an impulse buy - so apologies if I repeat everything you've already read, or completely miss the point somewhere.Pros:Immersive worldFantastic writingVoice actingShootingCons:Texture quality/general graphics optionsVariety of combatKeybindingsFacial expressions made by ShepardStory (Spoiler free)Frankly, this is the only reason anyone should get this game. If you have no interest in storytelling whatsoever, there are much better shooters out there; if you have no interest in shooters, it's not worth being put off. The story is very immersive, with an incredibly fleshed out world, and more than makes up for any flaws the game has in other areas. Characters don't feel neglected, although sometimes there isn't quite enough content for a character you want to experience more of. (Side note: You may get a mixed first impression of ""The Salarian"", which could prompt you to stop going out of your way to talk to him. This is the sensible option if you wish to preserve your sides later in the game. Some of his lines are just golden.)If you haven't played Mass Effect 1, I would recommend playing it first, even if it is mechanically slightly inferior to it's sequel, and you can play it without. However, a lot of enjoyment can be derived from taking a single Shepard, with all his actions, choices, and in my case, awful facial hair, through the series.CombatSatisfying, though slightly repetitive. The cover system can be awkward to use at times, thanks to Use, Sprint, and Take Cover all forcibly bound to the same action - by far the ugliest scar from the console port. If, like I did, you want to play with the same controls as every other PC shooter in the universe, the easiest fix is to use the primary and secondary keybinding functionality to bind the do-everything button to both what you want the Use and Sprint buttons to be. Often you'll be sprinting into cover anyway, so it kind of works, but it's definitely not ideal.There's a lot of variety to be had in terms of the ways you can build Shepard, but during a single playthrough it can get fairly restrictive, especially if you want to play optimally. That said, the variety in squadmates can allow a few different tactical approaches for the same Shepard, even if you only get to experience their skills and playstyle via the tactics interface, which carries over nicely from Mass Effect 1.Roleplaying and MoralityThe morality system is extremely black and white, which can be an issue, but if you stick to any non-gamey moral compass for your Shepard, it will probably see you pick up a good few Paragon and Renegade points each. Some important dialogue options require many of one or the other, though, so it's difficult to play a middle man, which is a little disappointing. Additionally, some choices don't really fall under stereotypical ""good"" and ""evil"" labels either way, but they assign Parargon and Renegade points to them anyway, so it doesn't always make sense. I didn't find it really hindered me in any way though. The feeling of decisions having an impact in the world is always great, though.			"

												If you haven't played Mass Effect 1 then stop reading this review AND GO PLAY THAT FIRST to have the best experience! Mass Effect 2 takes many of the rpg elements from Mass Effect 1 out but solidifies the gameplay more and trims out all the fat from the first game so you get nothing but pure meat.The exploration is gone but in return you get better dialouge and better combat. The characters are more diversed and flushed out and I thought they were better due to personalities and more backstory into them, If you are into sidequests over main missions then ME2 does a way better job than ME1 in that respect and the main quest is still really good but the side missions mostly involve loyalty missions to give your crew members more story and helping them out. Would I reccommend ME2 over ME1? No because I believe that you have to play all 3 games to get the full experience but IMO the gameplay is a lot better than ME1 but less tactical and more action. It still feels like a choose your own adventure game and has that 70's, 80's Space opera feel that the first one has but adds more spices to it like Omega which is heavily inspired by the film Blade Runner. It's well worth a buy and you will love every minute of it. Suicide mission is also one of the best end missions I have ever played, I felt really engrossed and felt like I was in a daredevil mission with the odds stacked against me. It's hard for me to choose between which I like more in Mass Effect 1 or 2 because they are both awesome but this game is worth a playthrough and It is one of the best sequels ever.			"

												Exploration is better than the first game. A controller is still essential.It was a shame they decided to go for hubs over the more open sections of the first game.

												The Stuff of legends... Fans of Starwars Knights of the old republic 1&2, this is the game you've been missing. It may not satisfy the diehard Starwarsaphiles but as far as game mechanics, interactivestorytelling, cause and effect style consequences, and the whole play how you want, who you want, when you want, and where you want in whatever order you want to will keep you immersed and hold your attention for at minimum 3 play thru's. In fact, when you factor in acheivements, multiple (several) romances avenues, Perfect good outcome, Perfect bad outcome, Gaining max loyalty of your teammates, and all the DLC's (which depending on your moral values, are easily obtainable, and free) your unlikely to lose interest prior to a 3rd playthrough. Guides are mostly awesome, and there is a fix availible (easy to apply) to give you full xbox console controller support.  Lots of mods are availible also, but its already a perfect game so don't expect to use them until you've finished your first playthrough. All in all people who played SWKOTR repeatedly will love this game, as far as the ""But its not starwars"" crowd, its in space, with a spaceship, And multiple planets. ~Use your imagination, pretend alittle.10/10			"

												don't expect a outstanding shooter/rpg, this game is carried solely by its characters.most of the levels outside of towns are designed like tubes or arenas with the occasional branch which always lead back together at some point, exploring for hidden items is limited. the fighting/shooting is nothing to write home about. the majority of skills you can unlock aren't to exciting either.biggest con are probEably the mini games most of them are fun for the first few times BUT they are HOPELESSLY overused, especialy mining/probing for minerals becomes a very annoying chore after the first couple of planets, expect to spend atleast half of your total game time just harvesting planets if you are the hoarding type of player.once you reach the end of the game you realise you only needed a small fraction of all the minerals that you can mine to unlock all upgrades, perfect example for a artifical game-time extender.the main story is ok but the thing that kept me playing till the end are the dialogues, facial expressions and overall very good design of every character, creature and even most of the enviorments and their individual storys that make this game-univers so believable and intersting.

												I have played and beaten this game over 11 times, the first 10 times were back when I used to game on console (those days are long gone) So I thought since I loved this game so much, may as well buy it again on steam for a cheap price, I personally think that this is the best mass effect in the series, it's also one of my most favorite games of all time.I should note that the combat is much better than in the first mass effect, but a lot of people felt that the story suffered as well in the second game, which I understand since it focused more on characters than the story itself. I would recommend you get this over the first mass effect if you absolutely cannot afford both, the first mass effect didn't age very well....			"

												Let me keep it simple and out of all these reviews thankyou for reading mine. Mass Effect is simply a phenomenally designed and well written for ultimate entertainment. This game for the RPG, third- person shooter, Sci-Fi, and story rich. The game is rather linear as it is all about the story, but you do make many decisions that affect the gameplay. The story is rich and deep, while the gameplay is epic and immersive. You utilize a team of aliens from all over the galaxy to help on a dangerous mission to save the human and alien races from the looming dangers of the Reaper alien threat!!!! One of the best games in the galaxy. 10/10 Would punch another Krogan in the face to earn their respect.			"

												This is a fantastic game. The gameplay is fun, and has a clean layout bar for all your biotics. There is alot of fun to be had. The story took me around 25 hours to complete, and it was epic from start to finish. The pacing of it is also really good. The share of time with the story and gameplay are near perfect, and Bioware definetly knew their strong points in the developement. The RPG factor of this game is also really well made, with dialogue options that progress into relationships and story, and an interesting karma system similar to SWTOR and Fallout: New Vegas that unlock more dialogue options. The graphics are pretty good too, but I'm not gonna go into detail about that since this is a 5 year old game. The sound design helps set the theme for a futuristic galaxy very well, and there are a few songs from the official soundtrack that I really like. Now... technical issues. The game crashed on me twice. I don't know why, but they did. Also one time, I was floating in the air walking around, which was hilarious until I found out couldn't get down. Luckily I could just load the previous autosave. Seriously though, this is still a fantastic game. There's a HUGE galaxy to explore, and a ton of planets to visit or even mine resources from. Even when you finish the storyline and feel those chills from that EPIC ending mission, you can still continue travelling around the Milky Way completing sidequests. Not only is Mass Effect 2 a fantastic game, but it is now one of the best games I have ever played.			"

												Played 20+ hours of this in a single weekend, I literally could not put it down. The possibility of creating your own character and dictate it's decisions and personality provides for one of the most immersive gaming experiences you'll ever have. This is what games should always be, an interactive media where, instead of just inputting action, you're writing your own path and telling your own story, molding the framework the developers created into your liking. This is what a true interactive media should be like.Mass Effect 2 is a masterpiece, filled with the most interesting characters and settings I've ever seen in a video game, stellar gameplay, amazing storytelling and music and the most rewarding - and thrilling - choice mechanic. I cannot praise it enough. A true masterpiece that shows what video games are capable of as a true artform, building upon cinematic language and adding interactivity and the instrument of choice to become the ultimate storytelling medium.To sum it up, don't waste an opportunity to experience Mass Effect 2 at least once in your life. (P.S.: I recommend this specially to Star Trek fans, trust me on that one)			"

												Great sequel to the original, even if it abandons some RPG elements and gets rid of the ever interesting unlimited ammo/overheating system. Running out of ammo was almost never an issue, so it only bothered me a little at first, and the infernal sound glitches from the first game are gone (I do hear voices in slow motion sometimes though...) And the games at least a bit more optimized, CPU fan still goes crazy though.			"

												This game is a masterpiece. I don't think that I have ever had this much fun with a western RPG. The story is wonderful, the combat is fluid and enjoyable. When you get a new crew member, you learn about their history and you care for them. All of your squad mates are like-able and have their own unique personality. If you have played and beaten the first Mass Effect, you can import your data to Mass Effect 2 and see how all of the choices you made in the first game affect this one. All in all, it's great, and anyone who is a fan of RPGs and Shooters will love this.			"

												The great continuation of the Commander Shepard's story, the great continuation of the Mass Effect game. In this game BioWare improwed their battle system, continued storylines from the first game and created new ones, and made storyline more developed. The only thing became worse - now there are not so much ways you can develop your Commander. Most of times I played this game it was not license copy, but after all playthrows even I bought this game. If you played the first Mass Effect game, you must have and play Mass Effect 2. If you didn't - you still will be pleased playing this game. But for better experience - play them both. All RPG- (and not just RPG-) players must try this story - it becomes legacy of our era. Amazing game series.9.8/10			"

												The first thing you notice about this sequel to Space Marine Inventory Manager 2007 is the complete lack of having to manage your space marine's inventory, which oddly enough improves the game no end!You've played the first Mass Effect, right? If so, you know the drill. ME2 delivers more of the good stuff, refines or removes the not-so-good stuff, gives you prettier visuals, etc. BioWare/EA once again test the patience of PC gamers around the world by not bothering to implement gamepad support and offering a DLC purchasing system so terrible that you'll think twice about throwing money their way.But, despite all of that, ME2 remains one of the most impressive action RPGs of the past decade, delivering an interesting gallery of characters, a better-than-average script and art design that puts many blockbuster sci-fi movies to shame.

The Mass Effect Series was an amazing & unforgettable experience. One that I have no intention of ceasing to replay.For Mass Effect 2: Deluxe Edition...Content included with the Cerberus Network Key:Zaeed - The Price of Revenge (Free DLC)Normandy Crash Site (Free DLC)Firewalker PackIncisor Sniper RifleCerberus Arc ProjectorCerberus Weapon and ArmorCollectors' Weapon and ArmorTerminus Weapon and ArmorBlood Dragon Armor (Unlockable if you own Dragon Age: Origins)PROS- You can finally romance Tali'Zorah vas Normandy (Thanks Bioware and Goodbye Liara)- Story Continuation of Mass Effect 1 (For those of you that played it)- Saves can be imported from ME1 and when you're finished into ME3- Even without all the DLC included, ME2 is still a great game worth your time and moneyCONS- Most of the DLC is NOT included with the Deluxe Edition and must be purchased seperately using Bioware Points. None of the DLC is not available to buy on Steam.- The free 'Promotional' Doctor Pepper DLC is only available on the Origin version of ME2- Cheats are harder to enable/useMy Rating: 10/10 (Highly Recommended) "

												Just finished my second playthrough of 1 thru 3, with a couple of the DLCs installed and the extended cut ending. Believe the positive reviews; this game will stay with you! This is the only experience since the original Deus Ex that has had me invested this way. The three instalments each play slightly differently, but all are worth every penny, especially now! IMHO all three are required, in the right order, for the full story to be appreciated, and to witness the character relationships in their maturity.Incredibly well written, countless inter-related stories and subplots, NPCs that really do come to life through the script, top notch voice acting, and how you choose to interact with them (or not!). Excellent character graphics and animation, numerous interactive cut-scenes, action, exploration, intimacy...I can't recommend this highly enough! The only real problem with the Mass Effect series is what to play afterwards without it feeling bland by comparison!			"

												Wow.It's hard to overstate how much I enjoyed this game. It is masterful on every level - story, writing, scope, decision making, combat, environmental design, artwork, lighting effects, cinematography, musical score, sound design, and virtually any other area I can think of. It is, without exaggeration, that good.(mini spoiler) And the last mission - any team member you have come to know in the game can die a very permanent death based on your decisions, giving the finale a weight and consequence rarely experienced in video games. (end mini spoiler)What is perhaps most staggering is that even after a 50-hour playthrough (DLC included), you can be sure that you have seen far less than even half of the possibilities that the game has to offer. The original game isn't nearly as perfect, but still worth a run-through for the storyline and decisions that will carry over into the sequel.No, the game is not without faults. For one thing, it's overly easy and overly simplified compared to the original.It doesn't have the same level of cinematic polish that we've come to expect from AAA titles in 2013 and beyond.It gets excessively talkative and stale in certain areas.Much like the previous game, the romance subplots are stupid. If you want your Commander Shepard to get some quick and casual sex, it's not gonna happen. It's deep love or nothing. And that deep love comes out of nowhere, since your intimate conversations with any given love interest are extremely limited.But by far the worst of Mass Effect 2's problems is the very time-consuming process of grinding for resources, which isn't any fun at all. There are nearly endless amounts of resources available, but the game doesn't tell you how many you need. While there are ship upgrades available later in the game to make these processes quicker, the game doesn't tell you about them, and so you may waste much time in the first half grinding before acquiring them. My advice: grind at a minimum until you get the upgrades, and then only focus on ""rich"" planets, since there are more than enough to get you through.(Issues)I want to mention a few minor issues that you might run into. I frequently clipped through objects and got stuck, forcing a reload, and there are a few missions tied to DLC that resulted in game-breaking crashes. The latter problem was easily rectified by creating a shortcut to the .exe and putting -nomoviestartup in the parameters. One last very strange glitch resulted in my player character stretching her arms out to the sides, unable to shoot or interact anymore, solved only by reloading an earlier save and trying different dialogue choices before the bug. With a game this big, my recommendation is to keep numerous save files and save often.Overall, Mass Effect 2 is definitely one of my favorite games of 2010, matched only by Red Dead Redemption. In my book, that's saying a lot.9/10			"

The RPG element is well preserved from the first game, and interesting new characters are introduced as well as familiar faces returning.

												You won't know the true meaning of cinematic story telling unless you have played this game. The setting, the art style, voice acting and the pace is just: https://i.redd.it/vmaai3h6j8ix.pngThere is an interactive galaxy map where you can fly your ship from planet to planet, or use mass relays and teleport from one point of the galaxy to another. Each planet that you land feels so different and alive. Gameplay is fun, fresh and exciting.

			This is the Mass Effect ""Story so far.."" from Bioware's Website. It's a quick Mass Effect digest video summarizing what happened leading up to Mass Effect 2.		

Sypnosis of Mass Effect 2: The game starts off with the Normandy being attacked by an unknown ship and Shepard being killed in action. He was later on brought back by Ceberus, lead by the Illusive Man, who assigned him on a mission to investigate why the humans colonies have been disappearing. After discovering that it was the Collectors who are behind these abductions, the same species that are responsible for the destruction of Normandy and Shepard's death, the commander must scout the galaxy and build the best team to take the fight to the Collectors.

												I had a copy of ME2 for my old computer, and it was a great game.  I thought I'd go ahead and purchase it to play again for old times' sake.  Digital Deluxe! Sounds great, right?No.Do NOT buy this game on Steam. No major DLC included--and not only that, they're not even AVAILABLE on Steam.  This is what you get for trying to ""do the right thing"".  I wish I had just found a torrent.  It's bad enough to pay for the game twice, but to pay for a significantly *worse* experience than I had in 2010?Unacceptable.			"

   My Playthrough   Youtube Playlist    The Review Mass Effect 2 is an interesting case. While this game does add a lot of things like more exploitable cities, more companions, and a much bigger ship. They also removed some content as well like exploring uncharted worlds with the M35 Mako, the 60 level cap, a lot of talents, and worse of all the ability to talk to your companions at any time. 
This game does have some pros like the story is still good and the companions are well written and voice acted. The gamEplay is still the same as the prequel but now their is ammo and weapon restrictions. The cons are mostly all the things that Bioware removed from Mass Effect but a big one is that this game is far more linear than ME1. Now you can recruit any companions that you want and you have to wait for specific points to recruit your favorite companions. From all the negitives that I listed you are probably wondering why I am still recommending this game. Well while this game is not as great as Mass Effect it is still a good game and I recommend playing it.  "

												The sequel to the game that launched a universe and an epic franchise. Mass Effect 2 expands upon its origins with tighter gameplay and smooth visuals. A stripped down version in some respects compared to the first game, but not to its detriment. Gone are a lot of the more fiddly micromanagement RPG elements of sorting out gear for your teammates, as well as the long driving sections. The only tedious aspect of the game are the scanning elements of planets, but even things like this are sometimes helpful in drawing you into the universe growing before your eyes. Now if only EA would be Mass Effect 3 on Steam...			"

												Okay, this is the best game i have ever played in my life. It has such an awesome story and characters. All of the things you do, all the thing you say matter. Its not just some random game you can play and don`t care about anything, you get attached to your crew and story by itself feels deep and inspiring. The Music in Mass Effect is utterly awe inspiring. It's music that any true Mass Effect fan has felt empowered by, saddened by, inspired by, and moved by. Even on it's own, out of context of the three absolutely stunning games, it always provokes emotion from me. Mass Effect is the greatest RPG series of all time, and it's OST more than lives up to the story and experience. When it came to the end, when everything came down to the wire, everything that you did in the game came out. You put everything on the line, everything you had, and through sheer willpower, and sacrifice, and tremendous effort, YOU did it. Your team. You. You saw in detail how every choice you made in the game came into play in that final half hour of the game. If you failed, it wasn't some planet you'd never seen, or countless random soldiers you didn't care about, it was your teammates that you'd fought with for hours and hours of gametime, characters you'd built relationships with and honestly come to see as friends. The Suicide Mission is one of the best end-levels in history. The fact that you choose your teammates for each task and aren't told which one is clearly the best made it feel so immersive. You actually had to know them, not just take them for missions as if they are dumb robots. The Mass Effect Trilogy (Mass Effect 2 in particular) is not just one of the great video games ever created, but it's also one of the greatest works of Sci-Fi ever.			"

I've found this game have a solid characters, and allowing us to mingle with them, having a good bonding with the characters, and giving each every one of them a good storyline. This was one strong aspect which in my opinion, is quite rare in game nowadays. The gameplay is also quite enjoyable.

												Mass Effect 2 is a great sequel to an equally impressive game. While I do believe that this second installment is a bit over-praised, it is still an incredible game that builds on the successes of its predecessor very well.I do believe that most components of the combat system are improved. The only small detail that I don't personally enjoy is a matter of personal preference and doesn't really bother me, as it is present in most shooters anyways. The visuals are obviously much more impressive as well and make an impact on immersion in this case. Overall, the gameplay mechanics have been vastly improved as far as fluidity and functionality.What truly matters when evaluating this title, however, is the narrative and the ability of the game to make you care about its characters and its stories. While I personally believe that the first Mass Effect did a better job of making the player care about each and every character and his or her story, Mass Effect 2 still retains the important features that characterize the NPCs and make the story memorable and cannot be criticized for a lack of story; my personal opinion shouldn't have an impact on the validity and inspiration of the title. The fundamental RPG elements of Mass Effect 2 make it stand above virtually any other RPG on the market today.Mass Effect 2 is an amazing game and is undoubtedly a must-own title.			"

												Contrary to what some may say, this is the most polished and enjoyable (and probably underestimated) part of the trilogy. The atmosphere and the flow are just great, scenery is fantastic, dialogs aren't boring or idiotic, the combat mechanics work just fine, and the characters are most memorable, unlike the first part where there were not developed as they could have been, or the third part with its combined Jersey Shore / SJW paradox. The missions unfold like episodes of a great TV show continuing on a successful movie. Couldn't recommend it more, especially if playing with all the DLC-s (unfortunately, in that case you should probably get the Origin version like I did).			"

												Yet another EPIC game from bioware, and the second installment of the Mass Effect Series, just as epic, if not moreso, as the first. Choices still matter,and you see some of your choices from the first game making big and little waves in your story; actions matter, who lives, who dies, who do you save....I only have 33.4 hours on steam with this game, but over 100 on Origin (more DLC available on origin). This game along with the first are beyond amazing, this second installment is much darker than the first game.  The Reapers are back, only this time they're using the mysterious Collectors instead of the Geth, whole human colonies are vanishing without a trace, no signs left behind, no struggle, nothing.  Its up to you, to find out why/how and put a stop to it.You have new companions, with returning faces, and a whole other side of the universe to explore and tame.I recommend this game whole heartedly, the graphics hold up to the test of time, the decisions still matter, and it still hits you right in the feels, and keeps on delivering with an epic stoy.

												THIS IS THE BEST SCI-FI ACTION RPG IN EXISTANCE!!!!That is NOT opinion, it is downright fact, you WILL NOT find a better game in the entire genre.If you can get past the dated gameplay / graphics of the first game, you will be enthralled in the story, some of the most beloved characters in gaming.90% of every decision you make in the game, especially who you decide to kill or let live, can have SERIOUS impacts on not just the first game, but the OTHER two games as well, such as who you bring with you on your team for all 3 games, how you approach combat and dialogue, even what missions you get to do!you MUST play all 3 games in order, you CANNOT play them in a random order, you will severely hinder your experience, and believe me, the first experience with mass effect only comes along once, if you mix up the games (e.g starting from the third game, then the first, then the second)  you will have ruined one of the best gaming experiences you can potentially have.You can only purchase the first two games on Steam, but it gets put on sale, you MUST buy the Mass Effect Collection Edition, it provides you with the first game, and the digital deluxe edition of the second game in one cheap bundle, and the third game can only be purchased on origin, in total, youll be paying £18-40 (depending on if you purchase during sales)  for 3 games that will easily take up 20 hours each to complete.not to mention, Mass Effect 3 has a multiplayer, and it is STILL one of the most enjoyable co-op horde games to date.if you love games....just...if you love games, then you have to play this epic trilogy.

												I don't know where to start, and where to end. Catching atmosphere, the music is awesome, the cutscenes great (don't forget how old this game is), and the story is... well, it's a bit lacking in some small minor points, but it's still a great story overall. I went through this game in 30 hours, in 2 days. No. I didn't sleep. Yep. That's how catching it is.Rarely has a game captured me like this. The only reason this game is only gettting a 9/10 is because of Origin's DLC strategy which is, frankly, annoying. "

												Contrary to what some may say, this is the most polished and enjoyable (and probably underestimated) part of the trilogy. The atmosphere and the flow are just great, scenery is fantastic, dialogs aren't boring or idiotic, the combat mechanics work just fine, and the characters are most memorable, unlike the first part where there were not developed as they could have been, or the third part with its combined Jersey Shore / SJW paradox. The missions unfold like episodes of a great TV show continuing on a successful movie. Couldn't recommend it more, especially if playing with all the DLC-s (unfortunately, in that case you should probably get the Origin version like I did).			"

												How do you describe a game that is so extraordinary as Mass Effect 2? Where do you begin? With the superb graphics, that stand with the best today? Do you go with the gameplay that feels a thousand times more polished than the first with absolutely tons of available sidequests as well as Downloadable content? Maybe with the fact that this is the first story game that has allowed a player to carry over player-made decisions onto another game, and with this comes a promise that the character you crafted to YOUR expectations would be waiting for you in this story. (That alone is something that gamers like myself have been waiting years for.) And don't even get me started on the story and where the team at Bioware is taking this series. Not only are your character relationships you made in ME1 still intact, but now they have new and truly exciting avenues that they can take. This is doubly true for the Lair of The Shadow Broker DLC with character Liara T'soni. (Highly recommended, along with all the other DLC) Then there is Shephard. The hero who has a bit more personality than before, is forged through player decisions that can alter the state of your party dramatically. And forging him or her is another matter altogether. How exactly do you craft a character who is the most important human in the galaxy? And more, a character who knows it? These elements are sheer brilliance and the amazing experience gifted to us in the first is grossly intensified. The action feels real and livid. The romantic stories feel romantic (particularly with Garrus, Thane, Jack and Tali Zorah, who seem the slightly less than obvious choices) And the music (yes, I'm yet again, going into the music) composed by Jack Wall fits the situations of the game even better than the first entry. Some take issue with the mining and doorlock minigames because of their repetitive nature. To me, it is small potatoes considering the rest of the experience. By the end, you feel the weight of your decisions and their consequences on your shoulders, be they good or bad. The brilliant thing, though, is that you've felt this all along.10/10			"

												I used to think Mass Effect 1 was the best in the series, and used to be very biased toward it. After recently playing through Mass Effect 2 though, I have to say that I think this one is the best in the series. While I do miss a lot of the RPG aspects that Mass Effect 1 offered, and were removed from Mass Effect 2, I think the overall improvements to Mass Effect 2 overshadow that. The TPS aspects are way more solid, and feel a lot tighter. They also added an ammo system to the game and removed the heat aspect. While I did enjoy the heat aspect of Mass Effect 1, and figuring out ways to manage it, the ammo system works out in the end. I may also be one of the only ones that actually enjoyed using the Mako, but even though it was replaced in this game with a scan type of thing on planets, it makes it a lot more streamlined. Overall, the story and storytelling is awesome in Mass Effect 2. Everything in Mass Effect 2 is more streamlined, and feels a lot more solid compared to Mass Effect 1. It's a great game, and I definitely recommend it to fans of Mass Effect 1, or just fans of deep storylines, and Shooter/RPG fans.			"

												I am absolutely in love with sci-fi series such as Mass Effect. Not only does this game offer a variety of combat, dialogue, exploration, you can also do ""sexy time"" given the right scenario is placed. If Mass Effect 1 didnt convince you this game is awesome, import your file to Mass Effect 2 & enjoy. If you're still not convinced, Mass Effect 3 has it everything Mass Effect 1 & 2 could not provide you at the time. If you're still not convinced, youre probably a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ bag. Joking aside, I am very pleased with my experience playing this series. Have you ever played long, dull rol playing games, where you just drown out in the background doing whatever? Dont worry this game will keep you exploration new obstacles, new dangrous missions & moar sexy time!			"

												A truly great sequel which is on par, if not better than the first game. Where the first game had the best story(imo), this sequel greatly expanded upon the gameplay elements. But dont let that fool you. Mass Effect 2 still delivers an epic story where as old faces return while new ones are introduced. Where the first game was clearly a rpg, this sequel has been labeled as an actionrpg, to reach out to a broader audience. Many would say that this is a bad thing, but the game is more fluid as well as some of the rpg elements have been toned down. That isn't necessarily a bad thing as this was often quite grueling in Mass Effect 1. So overall it expands on its predecessor when it comes to gameplay, lore and characters. Even though the story in Mass Effect 1 was better(again imo), this sequel still got an epic storyline as it is a continuation of the first game.			"

My personal review for Mass Effect 2.This review has been made with the intent of having as little spoilers as possible, but it's inevitable. Read with caution.Short Plot Synopsis: Mass Effect 2 takes place weeks after the first game, starting with Commander Shepard (Mark Meer or Jennifer Hale) and the crew of the Normandy searching through a sector where three ships have gone missing within one month. After spending four days finding nothing, the Normandy is attacked by an unknown ship, ripping it apart. The crew evacuates, and Commander Shepard tosses Jeff ""Joker"" Moreau (Seth Green), the ship's pilot, into the last available Evacuation Pod. Shepard is thrown aside from the pod to a control panel, where he closes off the Evac Pod and sends Joker to safety. However, an explosion damages Shepard's suit, causing a breach, leaving Shepard to ultimately asphyxiate and fall into the nearby planet. Shortly after death, a company named Cerberus, that has a bad reputation for extremist behaviours to secure the fate of Humanity, recovers Shepard's body from the surface of the planet. Cerberus then creates and begins the ""Lazarus Project"", the act to revive Shepard. The process takes two years, and Shepard's awakening wasn't pleasant. When he finally awakens, alarm bells are going off in the Research Station. The ship's own Security Mechs have turned rogue, and the ship needs to be evacuated. This begins Mass Effect 2.Features:           - Re-take the role of Commander Shepard, defeater of Saren and saviour of the Citadel, and control him through the events of Mass Effect 2.           - Carry off from where you left off; Choices from Mass Effect 1 affect Mass Effect 2. You can also import your previous character. You are also able to import your Mass Effect 2 character into Mass Effect 3, where your decisions will affect the story and your crew. Though it involves a little bit of work, details later on.           - Every choice matters; Whether it's delaying a mission, or helping out your crew, every decision will influence your outcome and determine your crew's fate.           - Personalization; You can shape Shepard into your own view of them, making Shepard either Male or Female, and having control over their looks, personality, armour style, class, abilities, and weapons.           - Moral System; The Mass Effect series has a moral compass with two sides; Paragon and Renegade. However, unlike numerous other moral compases that determines being either one or the other, Mass Effect brings a new idea to the table. It tracks both your Paragon and Renegade sides at the same time, meaning if you choose to spare someone, but extort someone for a discount, sparing that person will not balance out your moral compass. Unlike Mass Effect, there is no more Charm or Intimidate skill. They are now determined solely by your Paragon and Renegade standings, respectfully. Having enough Moral Standing points, you can then use special dialogue options, as well as a new feature introduced in Mass Effect 2 called ""Interrupts"". These are special dialogue options used when other characters are talking, activated with the mouse buttons. Using these can cause impacts on the story, such as calming down two characters before they end up fighting, point out other characters immoral choices, or even assault a character entirely. Another interesting feature is your moral standing affects Shepard's appearance. If you choose a Paragon path, Shepard's scars from the Lazarus Project will heal and start to disappear. However, if you choose Renegade, those scars will deepen and show more.           - A wide crew, made of different races. Your personal squad, who will assist in battle, is interchangable, and comes with the ability with choosing their loadout and abilities. If you do your squadmate's loyalty missions, they will gain a unique ability, and this will help with the end-game.           - The ability to use your teammates abilities when you want to.           - Unique, original plot, with lots of mechanics you can't find elsewhere.           - The universe is vast, full of interesting species and races, each with their own quirks and personalities.           - You are able to create relationships with your crew members, that will affect the story in the next game.           - Has a Planet-Scanning mini-game, where you search for different minerals and possibly side-missions on different planets.           - New hacking minigames, including connecting Matching Pins and selecting matching pieces of code.           - New Game+ Mode.           - And many more features.Pros           + Many customizable character and armour features. You are able to shape Shepard into your own image of him/her, choose your own class with their own set of abilities, choose your backstory, personalize your armour with different material and patterns, and mix-and-match armour pieces. Each piece of armour also has different effects, meaning one helmet could grant extra health, while another could improve accuracy.           + Deep story, with a fair amount of lore. The developers specifically noted to make the side-quests as deep as the main story.           + Every choice matters, each with their own consequences. Will characters agree with your actions, or frown upon them?           + Many new characters, each with their own detailed backstory.           + Brings back old characters from Mass Effect 1, with their own story of what they've been up to since Shepard had died.           + The ability to import your Mass Effect 1 character into Mass Effect 2, with all the decisions you have made in the first game affecting the story in the second one.           + The ability to import your Mass Effect 2 character into Mass Effect 3, though this comes with a little bit of work. Again, I'll explain further in.           + The outcome will be entirely determined on the player's decisions.           + Able to interact with and get to know your crew. You will be able to do specific missions for them, to gain their loyalty, unlocking a specific ability for them.           + Like I said in the features, Mass Effect has a very unique plot and story, with mechanics found hardly anywhere else.           + Nice graphics, even for a 5 year old game. It even runs smoothly for the amount of effects it has.           + The Mass Effect series has had a Heavy influence on lots of sci-fi games.Neutral           +- You won't find yourself short on Credits anytime soon. Every mission is funded by Cerberus, and will include at least a 20,000 credit payroll at the end of the mission. You can also find additional credits on PDA's, Terminals, Wall Safe's, and (for some reason), Medi-kits. However, Purchases are evened out to higher prices to even this out.           +- ""I'm Commander Shepard, and this is my favourite store on the Citadel."" You can endorse numerous stores on the Citadel with this line, which could technically create conflicts. It has no effect on the game though. However, this isn't a good way of laying low if you choose to tell the security guards at the entrance you would prefer the records to state that Shepard has died. Again, endorsing numerous stores has no effect on that choice.           +- It requires a little bit of work to transfer your ME2 save file to ME3, due to ME3 only being available to Origin.Cons           - The game has DLC, but it's not available on Steam.           - If Shepard dies in the end-game, you can not import your save to ME3.           - Mini-games can get repetitive.Final DecisionI highly recommend this game. Mass Effect had a large impact on the Sci-Fi genre, and for good reason. I'll admit I had to cut a few points due to character limit, but I covered most of it. This is a fantastic game series, 8.9/10.			"

												I cant think of another example of how gaming could be done right, better than the Mass Effect series.An epic trilogy that spans three games in which you are in control of how the story evolves around you.Mass Effect 2 lived up to everything that was expected of this great space epic and is an amzing sequel to the its predecessor.Pros:-Ability to import ME 1 character and profile-Very good animation and graphics, voice acting is great-Great Combat with new powers and weapons-Streamlined Upgrades and Weapons-Your choices shape the story (especially the ones from the first game)-Even more characters, with interesting backstories-Side quest are more tied in and diverse-Very engaging story-REPLAYABILITYCons:-Planet Scanning for upgradesBioware did a great job taking Mass Effect to the next level and clearly deserves better than being owned by EA, but the Mass Effect series is sill the best example of how passionate game making is done right.

												When I first got this game I started losing my rag with it as the controls are so different, but after I got used to the controls it was fun. I can see where Call of Duty Advanced Warfare and Black Ops 3 got there ideas from. My favourite character is Miranda Lawson, she's so hot and makes Lara Croft look like a tramp. The way I got to getting this game is weird and after a conversation with a friend, catacombskitten, I was convinced to buy it. An all star cast in the vocal department and nice choices too. Another downside to this is you can't romance whoever you want to romance. I'm playing as a female but I can't romance Miranda Lawson, sad eh?

												Mass Effect 2 had a lot to live up to, and wow did it fail. At first.The base game for Mass Effect 2 was devoid of almost everything that made the original great. Each mission was nothing more than killing some guys with no option to do anything else. Inventory management was completely removed from the game and the gameplay became that of a shooter - choose mission, go to instance, kill guys, cutscene. But, - and this is a big but - the DLC does a lot to fix this game. Where the base game was devoid of anything but the main mission, the DLC adds much-needed hand-crafted content - and just enough for me to recommend this game (with DLC).			"

												Mass Effect 2 adds another chapter in the Mass Effect trilogy, and it does so pretty damn well. It's been argued this game has the best plot out of the three games, and I'd say that's a fair statement. They really liven it up compared to the first Mass Effect. That being said, you'd be doing yourself a great disservice if you didn't play the first game before this one; you won't understand what ANYONE is saying. More importantly, you'll be missing out on crafting your very own story, making those important decisions in ME1, and that's what really stands out about this series. The gameplay is more refined, and smoother than the first, but dumbed down. A lot of the RPG'ness is sucked out of this one, which some people like. You can't customize your weapons or armor as extensively as you could like in one, but it isn't a complete loss; the game is still utterly fantastic and worth your time. All in all, this is an important step in the story of Commander Shepard, and until you beat it, you'll be absorbed.			"

												A great sequel to an excellent sci-fi game.  I personally recomend playing the first one as that is still a great game unless you are more a shooter fan than an RPG fan in which case I woudl start here.  The combat is perhaps the biggest improvement and brings the game up to par with lots of other action games.  The characters and side quests were also improved over the original.  The main downsides are the story which very much has that ""middle chapter"" feel but is still good and the rpg feel which was dialed back too much for my tastes and may turn off other rpg fans.

												While Mass Effect (1) was a good story, had some good elements, the game was simply one of the worst, mechanically speaking, games I've played in a long time, yes I understand I'm late to the party, and that its and old and was an experimental game, but the mechanics itself put me so much off the series when I played it at release, and still do when I now try to play it again, its simply a waste of time and not to my liking. Simply watch a video or read the lore to get the story of it, and jump to Mass Effect 2 right away!Mass Effect 2 is in every single way better. It's smoother, game-play feels a lot better, the game mechanics are pretty damn solid now and the story, is a blast.The game is very good at making you feel in control of the crew, the ship and last but not least, control of your character. You feel bound to the people around you, you feel their pain, happiness and suffering.While you progress the ""main"" story arc, you will get multiple ""side-missions"" that will not only give you rewards and experience, but also in some ways, make you feel more connected to the planets and galaxies, giving you a higher incentive of beating anything in your path, anything for humanity and the safety of the galaxy, you clearly show, no matter who's in charge, you will get the job done.And with the help of people you meet along the way, recruit, talk to, consider your closest allies, you can take down even greater threats.Along the story arc line, your companions will ask you for help, doing so will make them more ""Loyal"" towards you and what you stand for, but it's not all a cakewalk, you get to see some dark sides of certain characters that change the view of them completely, they can put you in hard spots, do you do as they want? Do you keep them from doing something stupid? What is right? And, what is wrong?In the end it's all up to you to decide, and it will reflect on you, and your ship crew.So the question then is, should you play this or not? Is it worth the price? Hellyeah it is, the game can get picked up for cheap and nothing now, Mass Effect 2 is a huge improvement over its predecessor, not only in the way the game looks, but the game mechanics in general are a lot more smooth, feel good to use and best of all, no more irritating screens that pop up and take hours away.

												The sequel to the previous game (as sequels tend to be) in the series, Mass Effect 2 fixes the inventory system and rids itself of the Mako (which had horrible controls for anyone who remembers) and drastically increases it's storyline, adding in new characters and building on top of the choices you made in the previous game.This is widely regarded as the best game in the series and with good reason. While the story is amazing, the characters are what keeps me coming back to play through this game multiple times. They're enjoyable, fun to be around, have flaws, and so on and so forth.Just like I advised with the first game, I would suggest having two save games, one where you screw everything up because it's your first time playing, and another where you do some digging and figure out the best way to play the game so everyone makes it home in one piece.And I meant that about the one piece bit. INDIRECT SPOILERS FOLLOW.  The endings for the game range from everyone dying, including your character, to everyone pulling together and helping each other through the worst. Highly recommended.

												The second, and in my opinion, the best game in the Mass Effect trilogy. Improving upon the first game in every way, but NOT dumbing down many gameplay elements, it introduces a new, dramatic, exciting story full of unpredictable twists and turns, making it look like a spectacular, highly interactive space opera movie.The driving sections around barren planets from ME1 are gone (and replaced with planet scanning, and new driving sections if you own the appropriate DLC), even trivial sidequests have great direction, and seem important even though they do not tie in directly to the main story line. I loved the introduction of clearly Lovecraftian horror elements in the story, something that the third game completely ignored. The Reapers, ancient enemies of all sentient life, are basically intergalactic gods, dangerous even when destroyed, their huge spaceship-like bodies able to brainwash would-be explorers millenia after their ""death"". It feels you're fighting truly unknown and horrifying adversaries, which gives the game a very unique atmosphere.The characters are unique and believable, dialogue is well-written and interesting, and it's hard to leave the game once you've started playing.Playing ME1 is pretty much a requirement prior to playing ME2, though- after all, it is a continuation of a great storyline.The end is well-rounded, and even though it implies a sequel, it doesn't leave you hanging from a cliff, so to say :)Recommended!P.S. Getting the DLC for this game is a relatively hard process nowadays, thanks to EA's greedy, unoptimized and ham-handed decisions. Basically, you'll have to activate your ME2 copy on Origin, buy DLC on Origin, download them through Bioware Social website, and install them manually after installing (and running) ME2. Why would you do all that?Some DLCs (such as the Arrival and Lair of the Shadow Broker) have story-critical content, along with additional quality gameplay, which adds a lot of new content to the game. If you turn out to be a real fan of the game and hooked on the story of Commander Shepard, you WILL need to play through these additional stories, as they cover some moments heavily referenced in the sequel, Mass Effect 3.EA's way of selling DLC means they NEVER go on a sale, so be prepared to dish out some serious cash for them (individual DLC prices can be several times higher than the price of the base game!!!) and only purchase them if you're REALLY interested in the story. Also, you can safely ignore the ""equipment"" DLC, as they are really only a money grab, selling you variations of weapons or cosmetic ""upgrades"" to your team for real money.			"

												This game is proof that no matter what your religion, race, creed, gender, age, or sexual descisions someone out there wants us to be happy. It's that good, it could transcend all boundaries and unite humanity under a roof of happiness. I recommend that not just you play this game, but everyone you know as well. In a perfect world everyone would play the Mass Effect trilogy upon reaching legal age of consent at least 9 times to ensure a happy cohesive world order.

												I have not finished playing Mass Effect 2, however I applaud it and its predecessor for its creative use of modern physics to penetrate, if only slightly, the vast distances that lie between stars. Mass Effect 2 also adds more realistic flight sequences, as one has to calculate how much fuel will get them to their destination, acknowledging that fuel is, in fact, a finite resource. However, it does to some extent ignore Newton's first law in that one slows to a halt the minute the ship ceases to accelerate, however, there are worse gripes to be had about a video game than ""It follows Aristotelian physics,"" as Aristotle essentially laid the groundwork for all modern thought.One of my favorite things to do as Commander Shepard was to probe undiscovered worlds, as this was something that I did in real life with the Voyager Probes. However, I doubt that these probes contained anything like the Golden Record that we put together, as First Contact has already been established in the Mass Effect universe.			"

												I give this game a recommendation *ONLY* for the diverse sci-fi tapestry that forms the background to a shallow storyline.  It is obvious the time and energy that went into the computer entrie surrounding the alien races, their homeworlds their history and even their prejudices FAR outweighed the time and energy spent on other things. Not to mention the energy spent on making the communities you encounter seem vibrant and alive.  That being said there is ALOT of regurgitation from KOTOR especially the second.  When I first watched the Ebon Hawk... errr I mean the ""Normandy"" land on Omega my jaw dropped (the whole scene, it seemed to me, was ripped from KOTOR 2).  Till I realized that ME2 was made by Bioware. Still if video game developers were more like writers half of the cutscenes and characters would come with a disclaimer in the corner *Reproduced From An Earlier Work*.  These things mostly lead to loud guffaws from me as I watched something that seemed so unnervingly similar to somthing I had seen before...... felt like I was playing a KOTOR 3 that lost the rights to use the Star Wars I.P. The other thing about Mass Effect is the constant similarity to Star Trek.  The whole thing with Shepard falling onto a planet, project Lazarus (sounding like a nod to Project Genesis from ""The Search for Spock"") even the Geth being ideologically near identical to the BORG.  Two major negatives are the semi-dependance on ownership of the first Mass Effect to get crew members and certain side quests (nothing major really just unfortunate to me) and the fact that I found this in the RPG genre when really it's not.  Good for a nice sci-fi vacation but don't expect it to break much from the KOTOR mold that it was obviously pressed from.			"

												If you, like me, were upset that the two Bioware Star Wars RPG's came to an end, check this game out. This game and its predecessor (Mass Effect 1) are very much in the same vein as the Star Wars games. From squad combat, to leveling up, to an engrossing story, to just plain amazing games, Mass Effect 2 (or 1) will not let you down. This game is a steal at 19.99			"

My personal review for Mass Effect 2.This review has been made with the intent of having as little spoilers as possible, but it's inevitable. Read with caution.Short Plot Synopsis: Mass Effect 2 takes place weeks after the first game, starting with Commander Shepard (Mark Meer or Jennifer Hale) and the crew of the Normandy searching through a sector where three ships have gone missing within one month. After spending four days finding nothing, the Normandy is attacked by an unknown ship, ripping it apart. The crew evacuates, and Commander Shepard tosses Jeff ""Joker"" Moreau (Seth Green), the ship's pilot, into the last available Evacuation Pod. Shepard is thrown aside from the pod to a control panel, where he closes off the Evac Pod and sends Joker to safety. However, an explosion damages Shepard's suit, causing a breach, leaving Shepard to ultimately asphyxiate and fall into the nearby planet. Shortly after death, a company named Cerberus, that has a bad reputation for extremist behaviours to secure the fate of Humanity, recovers Shepard's body from the surface of the planet. Cerberus then creates and begins the ""Lazarus Project"", the act to revive Shepard. The process takes two years, and Shepard's awakening wasn't pleasant. When he finally awakens, alarm bells are going off in the Research Station. The ship's own Security Mechs have turned rogue, and the ship needs to be evacuated. This begins Mass Effect 2.Features:           - Re-take the role of Commander Shepard, defeater of Saren and saviour of the Citadel, and control him through the events of Mass Effect 2.           - Carry off from where you left off; Choices from Mass Effect 1 affect Mass Effect 2. You can also import your previous character. You are also able to import your Mass Effect 2 character into Mass Effect 3, where your decisions will affect the story and your crew. Though it involves a little bit of work, details later on.           - Every choice matters; Whether it's delaying a mission, or helping out your crew, every decision will influence your outcome and determine your crew's fate.           - Personalization; You can shape Shepard into your own view of them, making Shepard either Male or Female, and having control over their looks, personality, armour style, class, abilities, and weapons.           - Moral System; The Mass Effect series has a moral compass with two sides; Paragon and Renegade. However, unlike numerous other moral compases that determines being either one or the other, Mass Effect brings a new idea to the table. It tracks both your Paragon and Renegade sides at the same time, meaning if you choose to spare someone, but extort someone for a discount, sparing that person will not balance out your moral compass. Unlike Mass Effect, there is no more Charm or Intimidate skill. They are now determined solely by your Paragon and Renegade standings, respectfully. Having enough Moral Standing points, you can then use special dialogue options, as well as a new feature introduced in Mass Effect 2 called ""Interrupts"". These are special dialogue options used when other characters are talking, activated with the mouse buttons. Using these can cause impacts on the story, such as calming down two characters before they end up fighting, point out other characters immoral choices, or even assault a character entirely. Another interesting feature is your moral standing affects Shepard's appearance. If you choose a Paragon path, Shepard's scars from the Lazarus Project will heal and start to disappear. However, if you choose Renegade, those scars will deepen and show more.           - A wide crew, made of different races. Your personal squad, who will assist in battle, is interchangable, and comes with the ability with choosing their loadout and abilities. If you do your squadmate's loyalty missions, they will gain a unique ability, and this will help with the end-game.           - The ability to use your teammates abilities when you want to.           - Unique, original plot, with lots of mechanics you can't find elsewhere.           - The universe is vast, full of interesting species and races, each with their own quirks and personalities.           - You are able to create relationships with your crew members, that will affect the story in the next game.           - Has a Planet-Scanning mini-game, where you search for different minerals and possibly side-missions on different planets.           - New hacking minigames, including connecting Matching Pins and selecting matching pieces of code.           - New Game+ Mode.           - And many more features.Pros           + Many customizable character and armour features. You are able to shape Shepard into your own image of him/her, choose your own class with their own set of abilities, choose your backstory, personalize your armour with different material and patterns, and mix-and-match armour pieces. Each piece of armour also has different effects, meaning one helmet could grant extra health, while another could improve accuracy.           + Deep story, with a fair amount of lore. The developers specifically noted to make the side-quests as deep as the main story.           + Every choice matters, each with their own consequences. Will characters agree with your actions, or frown upon them?           + Many new characters, each with their own detailed backstory.           + Brings back old characters from Mass Effect 1, with their own story of what they've been up to since Shepard had died.           + The ability to import your Mass Effect 1 character into Mass Effect 2, with all the decisions you have made in the first game affecting the story in the second one.           + The ability to import your Mass Effect 2 character into Mass Effect 3, though this comes with a little bit of work. Again, I'll explain further in.           + The outcome will be entirely determined on the player's decisions.           + Able to interact with and get to know your crew. You will be able to do specific missions for them, to gain their loyalty, unlocking a specific ability for them.           + Like I said in the features, Mass Effect has a very unique plot and story, with mechanics found hardly anywhere else.           + Nice graphics, even for a 5 year old game. It even runs smoothly for the amount of effects it has.           + The Mass Effect series has had a Heavy influence on lots of sci-fi games.Neutral           +- You won't find yourself short on Credits anytime soon. Every mission is funded by Cerberus, and will include at least a 20,000 credit payroll at the end of the mission. You can also find additional credits on PDA's, Terminals, Wall Safe's, and (for some reason), Medi-kits. However, Purchases are evened out to higher prices to even this out.           +- ""I'm Commander Shepard, and this is my favourite store on the Citadel."" You can endorse numerous stores on the Citadel with this line, which could technically create conflicts. It has no effect on the game though. However, this isn't a good way of laying low if you choose to tell the security guards at the entrance you would prefer the records to state that Shepard has died. Again, endorsing numerous stores has no effect on that choice.           +- It requires a little bit of work to transfer your ME2 save file to ME3, due to ME3 only being available to Origin.Cons           - The game has DLC, but it's not available on Steam.           - If Shepard dies in the end-game, you can not import your save to ME3.           - Mini-games can get repetitive.Final DecisionI highly recommend this game. Mass Effect had a large impact on the Sci-Fi genre, and for good reason. I'll admit I had to cut a few points due to character limit, but I covered most of it. This is a fantastic game series, 8.9/10.			"

												A truly great sequel which is on par, if not better than the first game. Where the first game had the best story(imo), this sequel greatly expanded upon the gameplay elements. But dont let that fool you. Mass Effect 2 still delivers an epic story where as old faces return while new ones are introduced. Where the first game was clearly a rpg, this sequel has been labeled as an actionrpg, to reach out to a broader audience. Many would say that this is a bad thing, but the game is more fluid as well as some of the rpg elements have been toned down. That isn't necessarily a bad thing as this was often quite grueling in Mass Effect 1. So overall it expands on its predecessor when it comes to gameplay, lore and characters. Even though the story in Mass Effect 1 was better(again imo), this sequel still got an epic storyline as it is a continuation of the first game.			"

I thought for a very long time that i have ""everything"" they ever created for mass effect 2 but boy i was so wrong. Just go to the bioware homepage and look at the DLC's for mass effect 2 to see what youre missing here. Edit : You can buy the DLC's for Bioware points at the homepage, download all the DLC's and link them to your steam game! This is how you can get the full expirience. Sadly its not possible to purchase the dlc's via Steam.			"

												Let me say before anything else that this really surprised me as much as the first game. The side quests and the anomalies, newly introduced in Mass Effect 2, in the first game the side quests and some of the main quests required you to use your Mako to travel around the landscape and go to the where the action really began. In Mass Effect 2 you don't need even to travel around the planet, I really enjoyed watching the landscape while driving in the first game but after you got inside the buildings where the quests were taking place the level design was always the same and after some missions you would probably get bored, but in this game they totally improved these aspects. Every single quest has an an unique level design and there are so many backgrounds which look ABSOLUTLY GORGEOUS. Doing the side quests was in no way boring but completly a pleasure for me. Now, you certainly remember that in Mass Effect there was little micro-management or perhaps you can say that there was none at all, you had credits, medi-gel and omni-gel, nothing more and you could just get TONS of creds by selling pretty much everything you didnt needed on the stores. In Mass Effect 2 there's alot of stuff added to the ""resource management"", for example, remember that quest in the first game in which you had to survey several planets for resources for the Alliance? Well now you actually have a mini-game other than just clicking ""SURVEY"" one that is actually entertaining and requires you to purchase probes at the fuel depots, which of course, cost credits. Those resources that you acquire from mining/surveying can be used to acquire new upgrades for your weapons and/or research new weaponry, this ended up excluding the looting of weapons which was possible on the first game. Other than buying upgrades for yourself and your squad you can actually purchase upgrades for the Normandy which actually will help you in the end game. Each member that you add to your squad grants you with new upgrades for both your squad and your ship. Now the combat, it is pretty much like the first one but in my opinion you don't really feel as much ""overpowered"" as in the first game because there's no mods for the weapons and the guns have alot more recoil in Mass Effect 2 and you also have limited ammo making the use of your powers a must, making this way, the combat alot better than in the first Mass Effect. The space exploration has alot more depth into it now, with the adding of fuel using while travelling, you can also purchase fuel in fuel depots for credits. The story continues where the first game left of and it is just incredible in my opinion, one of the best I've seen and experienced in a long while with the soundtrack keeping up to par with the cutscenes and the emotinal moments which are capable of making a sensitive person cry. The character design is as good as the story as far as I'm concerned didn't really noticed someone ""where it doesn't belong"". Every single squad member has their own unique personality and even the geth,  ""Legion"", and EDI have a very interesting dialogue. There's also the love story in which you decide you want to take part or not. The Codex keeps up the great job in providing you with aditional information and ""lore"" which you don't find in the characters dialogues. And of course, surprisingly enough the choices you made on the first game carry on to this one and the ones that you make in Mass Effect 2 will carry on to the third game. I honestly don't know what more I can say about it, it's an awesome game and experience that both role playing and shooting fans most definatly will enjoy but I judge this game by it's storyline so the 2 games I've played so far are for me only one and for that I can say it is really a hell of a game that you should try.

												Mass Effect 2 is an amazing action-rpg with great third person shooting mechanics.  The combat is very fun but not what makes Mass Effect so unforgettable.  The highlight is the characters, the way you interact with them, and the choices you make.  The characters are fully fleshed out and many of the game's missions are dedicated to gaining your allies' loyalty and learning more about them.  The ways you interact with them and decisions you make in the game, or have made in Mass Effect 1, have consequences both grand and subtle.  They combine to make the game one of the most personalized gaming experiences out there.Many triple A games aim to deliver an epic experience, and I won't claim that they fail.  But Mass Effect 2 is probably the most epic game I am familiar with.  Its epicness cannot be overstated and in fact its epicness is quantitatively thrice as large as the epicness of other triple A games whose epicness is the main selling point.  Yet despite the incredible epicness of Mass Effect 2 (and I am in no way discrediting the power of epicness), it doesn't neglect to add incredible depth to its characters and choices.			"

												I don't understand why would anyone check the user reviews of this game. Dude, this game is one of the best games out there. The Mass Effect trilogy is, in my book, the best one in the entire gaming history. By far. I don't care what anyone have to say about the third game. These games made me cry like a little b*tch.Well, let's see:PROS: Amazing and breathtaking prologue (Trust me on that one) and an incredible story. Old and new companions. Each one with an amazing back story that will make you love them. Customizable armor. Impressive armory with new awesome weapons. The perfect mix between RPG and TPS. The best game of the trilogy (And I'm not saying that the other two are bad at all). Biotics and powers are much better than ME1. Of course, all the choices you made in ME1 will be crucial in this game and you will continue your story depending on what you did in the previous game.CONS: Downloadable Content is not included in this version of the game and it's incredibly expensive to buy through BioWare Store, sadly (Story DLC's like Kasumi's Stolen Memories, Project Overlord, Arrival). Exploring the galaxy and probing for resources can be a little tiring.If you want to enjoy the game even more, play it on Insanity difficulty.			"

												A really wonderful game. The story is the main draw, but the gameplay is fun enough to keep you invested, as are the secondary characters - who are very well written, reminiscent of characters from Firefly. Can be played linearly if you just want to follow the story, or in a much more open way if you take the time to explore. Great game.			"

												Mass Effect 2 is a continuation of the Mass Effect story and adds a heaping ton of more Mass Effect goodness. If you liked any of the other Mass Effect games this is a must play. If you are just starting this is the second best place to start. I wholeheartedly recommend Mass Effect 2 and the entire Mass effect series. Its one of my favorite RPG series and one of the best Sci-fi games to be released in years. If you play the Mass Effect series from beginning to end you are in for one heck of a ride!			"

												Part 2 of an awesome Mass Effect game. Improved in many ways over the original, with new story to keep you occupied for many, many hours. You continue as commander Shepard and his crew in this new story, with somewhat unique start. You meet a lot of old characters from first game as well as new ones on your journey. Make sure you kept your saves from ME1, so you can transfer your choices and story to this game. It will give you a lot of sweet flashbacks on what you did in first game, in form of mails, unique character dialogues or on the local news. It's the sequel of an incredible game that don't disappoint. Game has great visuals, voice acting, animations and character design. Enjoy.			"

												Mass Effect is one of those games... One of those that make you think... That make you want _more_... A game that is, in every sense, much more than a game. Mass Effect accomplishes all that by having a very strong story line told through gorgeous cutscenes that blend perfectly with the action filled pace of the game.Mass Effect 2 is a game for you, whether you like shooters that have brain, RPGs or just anything as long as the package is polished and the plot is good.

												While Mass Effect (1) was a good story, had some good elements, the game was simply one of the worst, mechanically speaking, games I've played in a long time, yes I understand I'm late to the party, and that its and old and was an experimental game, but the mechanics itself put me so much off the series when I played it at release, and still do when I now try to play it again, its simply a waste of time and not to my liking. Simply watch a video or read the lore to get the story of it, and jump to Mass Effect 2 right away!Mass Effect 2 is in every single way better. It's smoother, game-play feels a lot better, the game mechanics are pretty damn solid now and the story, is a blast.The game is very good at making you feel in control of the crew, the ship and last but not least, control of your character. You feel bound to the people around you, you feel their pain, happiness and suffering.While you progress the ""main"" story arc, you will get multiple ""side-missions"" that will not only give you rewards and experience, but also in some ways, make you feel more connected to the planets and galaxies, giving you a higher incentive of beating anything in your path, anything for humanity and the safety of the galaxy, you clearly show, no matter who's in charge, you will get the job done.And with the help of people you meet along the way, recruit, talk to, consider your closest allies, you can take down even greater threats.Along the story arc line, your companions will ask you for help, doing so will make them more ""Loyal"" towards you and what you stand for, but it's not all a cakewalk, you get to see some dark sides of certain characters that change the view of them completely, they can put you in hard spots, do you do as they want? Do you keep them from doing something stupid? What is right? And, what is wrong?In the end it's all up to you to decide, and it will reflect on you, and your ship crew.So the question then is, should you play this or not? Is it worth the price? Hellyeah it is, the game can get picked up for cheap and nothing now, Mass Effect 2 is a huge improvement over its predecessor, not only in the way the game looks, but the game mechanics in general are a lot more smooth, feel good to use and best of all, no more irritating screens that pop up and take hours away.

												I feel that comparisions to the original game is necessary when writing a review for Mass Effect 2, so here it goes:1. Like Mass Effect, Mass Effect 2 is a story-rich 3rd-person FPS where you play as Commander Sheperd. However, the story was not as captivating as ME1 and it seemed that I spent more time assembling and gaining the loyalty of my crew than on the main campaign, which in retrospect was pretty short and straightforward.2. The combat system was an improvement from ME1, where it was much easier to utilise abilities (both yours and your squad's) by binding them to the numerical keys. However, combat got really repetitive after a while. The hacking/ bypassing system was also an improvement, although mostly unnecessary and also repetitive. 3. Anyone who played the original game would remember the dreadfully long elevator rides. Thankfully, ME2 had smoother transitioning and also higher quality cut-scenes which were very enjoyable.4. Like in ME1, it was possible to flirt/ develop relationships with a number of crewmates, although you would have to complete your target's loyalty quest before you could express interest. However, I was disappointed when Liara (ME1 character) could not be recruited into my squad, even though she did make an appearance in the game.I gave ME1 a rating of 9.5/10 only because of the elevator rides. While ME2 was a good game, it seemed to be lacking in story and also its descent into repetitiveness. 8.5/10			"

												I have not finished playing Mass Effect 2, however I applaud it and its predecessor for its creative use of modern physics to penetrate, if only slightly, the vast distances that lie between stars. Mass Effect 2 also adds more realistic flight sequences, as one has to calculate how much fuel will get them to their destination, acknowledging that fuel is, in fact, a finite resource. However, it does to some extent ignore Newton's first law in that one slows to a halt the minute the ship ceases to accelerate, however, there are worse gripes to be had about a video game than ""It follows Aristotelian physics,"" as Aristotle essentially laid the groundwork for all modern thought.One of my favorite things to do as Commander Shepard was to probe undiscovered worlds, as this was something that I did in real life with the Voyager Probes. However, I doubt that these probes contained anything like the Golden Record that we put together, as First Contact has already been established in the Mass Effect universe.			"

												I give this game a recommendation *ONLY* for the diverse sci-fi tapestry that forms the background to a shallow storyline.  It is obvious the time and energy that went into the computer entrie surrounding the alien races, their homeworlds their history and even their prejudices FAR outweighed the time and energy spent on other things. Not to mention the energy spent on making the communities you encounter seem vibrant and alive.  That being said there is ALOT of regurgitation from KOTOR especially the second.  When I first watched the Ebon Hawk... errr I mean the ""Normandy"" land on Omega my jaw dropped (the whole scene, it seemed to me, was ripped from KOTOR 2).  Till I realized that ME2 was made by Bioware. Still if video game developers were more like writers half of the cutscenes and characters would come with a disclaimer in the corner *Reproduced From An Earlier Work*.  These things mostly lead to loud guffaws from me as I watched something that seemed so unnervingly similar to somthing I had seen before...... felt like I was playing a KOTOR 3 that lost the rights to use the Star Wars I.P. The other thing about Mass Effect is the constant similarity to Star Trek.  The whole thing with Shepard falling onto a planet, project Lazarus (sounding like a nod to Project Genesis from ""The Search for Spock"") even the Geth being ideologically near identical to the BORG.  Two major negatives are the semi-dependance on ownership of the first Mass Effect to get crew members and certain side quests (nothing major really just unfortunate to me) and the fact that I found this in the RPG genre when really it's not.  Good for a nice sci-fi vacation but don't expect it to break much from the KOTOR mold that it was obviously pressed from.			"

It's main flaws are outside factors, such as hard to access DLC, with major features locked behind paywalls.But overall, the game is solid, focused and tells a story that is easy to get invested in.  You come to know your squadmates well, and the game encourages you to explore your relationships.  And of course, there's plenty of character building and shooty action.  But there's a lot of RP in this RPG, and that's in stark contrast to some newer games that claim that genre.If you like scifi, epic storytelling, romance subplots, third person shooting, or games that let you make meaningful choices, ME2 is a game for you.

												Mass Effect 2 is an amazing action-rpg with great third person shooting mechanics.  The combat is very fun but not what makes Mass Effect so unforgettable.  The highlight is the characters, the way you interact with them, and the choices you make.  The characters are fully fleshed out and many of the game's missions are dedicated to gaining your allies' loyalty and learning more about them.  The ways you interact with them and decisions you make in the game, or have made in Mass Effect 1, have consequences both grand and subtle.  They combine to make the game one of the most personalized gaming experiences out there.Many triple A games aim to deliver an epic experience, and I won't claim that they fail.  But Mass Effect 2 is probably the most epic game I am familiar with.  Its epicness cannot be overstated and in fact its epicness is quantitatively thrice as large as the epicness of other triple A games whose epicness is the main selling point.  Yet despite the incredible epicness of Mass Effect 2 (and I am in no way discrediting the power of epicness), it doesn't neglect to add incredible depth to its characters and choices.			"

												There was a point where I hated what was happening in this game. Not loathed, because then I would've stopped playing. But I *hated* it.Not long after, I loved what was going on in the game so much I weirded myself out a little.(What Bethesda does with locations, Bioware does with characters.)So play the first game. Import your save file. Brave EA/Bioware's site for 'the arrival' and 'the shadowbroker' DLC/expansions. And prepare for an amazing emotional ride.			"

												while the game itself is fantastic. DO NOT!!!!! Buy the DLC on steam, dont get steam keys for it. DONT. They will not work. Just get the game and buy the DLC throug EA.  The Steam key no longer work as a result of steam cutting ties with EA and their titles. Get the game on steam sure, if you want dlc for it... you must go through EA \.			"

												I was going back and forth on what game to nominate for the ""Test of Time"" award. And while I was debating I realized there's only one game (series) that I've played damn near ten or more times by now, and that I STILL plan on playing again in the near future. The world esign, lore, characters, and storytelling just don't get old to me. And the variety you can play with throughout the three games is just immense with the different character classes, backgrounds, gender (holy cow if you only play games as one gender you're missing out), and just that your choices affect the future games beginning in Mass Effect 1. Mass Effect 2 gets the award simply because the updated game design over Mass Effect 1 make it the truly timeless entry in a 3 part franchise that is amazing in all three parts. Mass Effect 2 would still get it over Mass Effect 3 because of its ability to stand on its own however. You get a bunch of new companions as well as a couple old friends, meet up with old ones for just mere cameos with dialogue that can get enough of a backstory across, travel to mostly different locations with some familiar places, and the enemy and ending sequence are fully contained (you meet and defeat the main enemy, the Collectors, within the context of Mass Effect 2). The DLC is great in that all of the story packs add to an already complete game and the Arrival DLC wraps the ending up and sets up the sequel perfectly.			"

												I've played over 200 hours and still can't stop playing. This game seems to be more unique and more intense and have more decisions to make then in Mass Effect 1. With new allies, new weapons, and plenty of DLC to download online, you are going to need a case to carry more guns! Familar faces and friends will return as you continue your battle with the most dangerous species in the galaxy...the Reapers. This game is worth $20 and if on sale, GET IT IMMEDIATELY!!

												Amazing game with an awesome story. My only advice is don't play it right after you finish part 1. The gameplay is so different that you might be turned off by it at first. At least I was. If you didn't like the loot system in part 1, then you're in good hands, as Mass Effect 2 ditches the loot sytem in favor of upgrades, constant upgrades. It's fun, amazing, but part of me always missed the loot system. The story wasn't as engaging as part 1, but still amazing fun. Enjoy			"

												Hands down, one of the greatest video games of all time. The atmosphere, the dialogue, and of course the characters are absolutely unparalleled. The only reason you shouldn't buy this game is if you have never played Mass Effect 1, in which case you should buy that, play through it, and then import your save file to Mass Effect 2. Sure, the DLC may be a rip off and you can only get Mass Effect 3 through Origin, but this is one of the top games ever for a reason. It's worth it.			"

My personal review for Mass Effect 2.This review has been made with the intent of having as little spoilers as possible, but it's inevitable. Read with caution.Short Plot Synopsis: Mass Effect 2 takes place weeks after the first game, starting with Commander Shepard (Mark Meer or Jennifer Hale) and the crew of the Normandy searching through a sector where three ships have gone missing within one month. After spending four days finding nothing, the Normandy is attacked by an unknown ship, ripping it apart. The crew evacuates, and Commander Shepard tosses Jeff ""Joker"" Moreau (Seth Green), the ship's pilot, into the last available Evacuation Pod. Shepard is thrown aside from the pod to a control panel, where he closes off the Evac Pod and sends Joker to safety. However, an explosion damages Shepard's suit, causing a breach, leaving Shepard to ultimately asphyxiate and fall into the nearby planet. Shortly after death, a company named Cerberus, that has a bad reputation for extremist behaviours to secure the fate of Humanity, recovers Shepard's body from the surface of the planet. Cerberus then creates and begins the ""Lazarus Project"", the act to revive Shepard. The process takes two years, and Shepard's awakening wasn't pleasant. When he finally awakens, alarm bells are going off in the Research Station. The ship's own Security Mechs have turned rogue, and the ship needs to be evacuated. This begins Mass Effect 2.Features:           - Re-take the role of Commander Shepard, defeater of Saren and saviour of the Citadel, and control him through the events of Mass Effect 2.           - Carry off from where you left off; Choices from Mass Effect 1 affect Mass Effect 2. You can also import your previous character. You are also able to import your Mass Effect 2 character into Mass Effect 3, where your decisions will affect the story and your crew. Though it involves a little bit of work, details later on.           - Every choice matters; Whether it's delaying a mission, or helping out your crew, every decision will influence your outcome and determine your crew's fate.           - Personalization; You can shape Shepard into your own view of them, making Shepard either Male or Female, and having control over their looks, personality, armour style, class, abilities, and weapons.           - Moral System; The Mass Effect series has a moral compass with two sides; Paragon and Renegade. However, unlike numerous other moral compases that determines being either one or the other, Mass Effect brings a new idea to the table. It tracks both your Paragon and Renegade sides at the same time, meaning if you choose to spare someone, but extort someone for a discount, sparing that person will not balance out your moral compass. Unlike Mass Effect, there is no more Charm or Intimidate skill. They are now determined solely by your Paragon and Renegade standings, respectfully. Having enough Moral Standing points, you can then use special dialogue options, as well as a new feature introduced in Mass Effect 2 called ""Interrupts"". These are special dialogue options used when other characters are talking, activated with the mouse buttons. Using these can cause impacts on the story, such as calming down two characters before they end up fighting, point out other characters immoral choices, or even assault a character entirely. Another interesting feature is your moral standing affects Shepard's appearance. If you choose a Paragon path, Shepard's scars from the Lazarus Project will heal and start to disappear. However, if you choose Renegade, those scars will deepen and show more.           - A wide crew, made of different races. Your personal squad, who will assist in battle, is interchangable, and comes with the ability with choosing their loadout and abilities. If you do your squadmate's loyalty missions, they will gain a unique ability, and this will help with the end-game.           - The ability to use your teammates abilities when you want to.           - Unique, original plot, with lots of mechanics you can't find elsewhere.           - The universe is vast, full of interesting species and races, each with their own quirks and personalities.           - You are able to create relationships with your crew members, that will affect the story in the next game.           - Has a Planet-Scanning mini-game, where you search for different minerals and possibly side-missions on different planets.           - New hacking minigames, including connecting Matching Pins and selecting matching pieces of code.           - New Game+ Mode.           - And many more features.Pros           + Many customizable character and armour features. You are able to shape Shepard into your own image of him/her, choose your own class with their own set of abilities, choose your backstory, personalize your armour with different material and patterns, and mix-and-match armour pieces. Each piece of armour also has different effects, meaning one helmet could grant extra health, while another could improve accuracy.           + Deep story, with a fair amount of lore. The developers specifically noted to make the side-quests as deep as the main story.           + Every choice matters, each with their own consequences. Will characters agree with your actions, or frown upon them?           + Many new characters, each with their own detailed backstory.           + Brings back old characters from Mass Effect 1, with their own story of what they've been up to since Shepard had died.           + The ability to import your Mass Effect 1 character into Mass Effect 2, with all the decisions you have made in the first game affecting the story in the second one.           + The ability to import your Mass Effect 2 character into Mass Effect 3, though this comes with a little bit of work. Again, I'll explain further in.           + The outcome will be entirely determined on the player's decisions.           + Able to interact with and get to know your crew. You will be able to do specific missions for them, to gain their loyalty, unlocking a specific ability for them.           + Like I said in the features, Mass Effect has a very unique plot and story, with mechanics found hardly anywhere else.           + Nice graphics, even for a 5 year old game. It even runs smoothly for the amount of effects it has.           + The Mass Effect series has had a Heavy influence on lots of sci-fi games.Neutral           +- You won't find yourself short on Credits anytime soon. Every mission is funded by Cerberus, and will include at least a 20,000 credit payroll at the end of the mission. You can also find additional credits on PDA's, Terminals, Wall Safe's, and (for some reason), Medi-kits. However, Purchases are evened out to higher prices to even this out.           +- ""I'm Commander Shepard, and this is my favourite store on the Citadel."" You can endorse numerous stores on the Citadel with this line, which could technically create conflicts. It has no effect on the game though. However, this isn't a good way of laying low if you choose to tell the security guards at the entrance you would prefer the records to state that Shepard has died. Again, endorsing numerous stores has no effect on that choice.           +- It requires a little bit of work to transfer your ME2 save file to ME3, due to ME3 only being available to Origin.Cons           - The game has DLC, but it's not available on Steam.           - If Shepard dies in the end-game, you can not import your save to ME3.           - Mini-games can get repetitive.Final DecisionI highly recommend this game. Mass Effect had a large impact on the Sci-Fi genre, and for good reason. I'll admit I had to cut a few points due to character limit, but I covered most of it. This is a fantastic game series, 8.9/10.			"

												I was so excited to continue the story of my Shepard and the game didn't disappoint. Some adapting was in order because the controls are somewhat different than the first game. Wanted to customize the controls to be closer to the first game, but I already got used to the new controls so it didn't pose a problem.I'm not much for shooters or sci-fi but the story and rpg elements made it all worthwile.New characters to interact with, new friends to be made, romances to kindle.

If you do your squadmate's loyalty missions, they will gain a unique ability, and this will help with the end-game.           - The ability to use your teammates abilities when you want to.           - Unique, original plot, with lots of mechanics you can't find elsewhere.           - The universe is vast, full of interesting species and races, each with their own quirks and personalities.           - You are able to create relationships with your crew members, that will affect the story in the next game.           - Has a Planet-Scanning mini-game, where you search for different minerals and possibly side-missions on different planets.           - New hacking minigames, including connecting Matching Pins and selecting matching pieces of code.           - New Game+ Mode.           - And many more features.Pros           + Many customizable character and armour features. You are able to shape Shepard into your own image of him/her, choose your own class with their own set of abilities, choose your backstory, personalize your armour with different material and patterns, and mix-and-match armour pieces. Each piece of armour also has different effects, meaning one helmet could grant extra health, while another could improve accuracy.           + Deep story, with a fair amount of lore. The developers specifically noted to make the side-quests as deep as the main story.           + Every choice matters, each with their own consequences. Will characters agree with your actions, or frown upon them?           + Many new characters, each with their own detailed backstory.           + Brings back old characters from Mass Effect 1, with their own story of what they've been up to since Shepard had died.           + The ability to import your Mass Effect 1 character into Mass Effect 2, with all the decisions you have made in the first game affecting the story in the second one.           + The ability to import your Mass Effect 2 character into Mass Effect 3, though this comes with a little bit of work. Again, I'll explain further in.           + The outcome will be entirely determined on the player's decisions.           + Able to interact with and get to know your crew. You will be able to do specific missions for them, to gain their loyalty, unlocking a specific ability for them.           + Like I said in the features, Mass Effect has a very unique plot and story, with mechanics found hardly anywhere else.           + Nice graphics, even for a 5 year old game. It even runs smoothly for the amount of effects it has.           + The Mass Effect series has had a Heavy influence on lots of sci-fi games.Neutral           +- You won't find yourself short on Credits anytime soon. Every mission is funded by Cerberus, and will include at least a 20,000 credit payroll at the end of the mission. You can also find additional credits on PDA's, Terminals, Wall Safe's, and (for some reason), Medi-kits. However, Purchases are evened out to higher prices to even this out.           +- ""I'm Commander Shepard, and this is my favourite store on the Citadel."" You can endorse numerous stores on the Citadel with this line, which could technically create conflicts. It has no effect on the game though. However, this isn't a good way of laying low if you choose to tell the security guards at the entrance you would prefer the records to state that Shepard has died. Again, endorsing numerous stores has no effect on that choice.           +- It requires a little bit of work to transfer your ME2 save file to ME3, due to ME3 only being available to Origin.Cons           - The game has DLC, but it's not available on Steam.           - If Shepard dies in the end-game, you can not import your save to ME3.           - Mini-games can get repetitive.Final DecisionI highly recommend this game. Mass Effect had a large impact on the Sci-Fi genre, and for good reason. I'll admit I had to cut a few points due to character limit, but I covered most of it. This is a fantastic game series, 8.9/10.			"

												I bought this game a while ago but the flashbacks are coming back....this is my story.  I bought this game a year after it came out due to a recommendation from a friend for only $5. Within the first 5 mins. of playing the game, I suffered a seizure followed by explosive and violent ♥♥♥ blasts. I remember blacking out after about 30 mins. of debilitating and painful cumming. I woke up in a hospital a week later. I was told that I had cummed myself into a ♥♥♥ cocoon and that I need to have my testicals removed or else I would die from over cumming. To this day when I play Mass Effect 2, I still black out and have phantom ♥♥♥ blasts. All in all, this is probably 2010 Game of the Year. 10/10 will definitly ♥♥♥ again.This review was inspired by the real life events of Pete Holiday.			"

												Let me say before anything else that this really surprised me as much as the first game. The side quests and the anomalies, newly introduced in Mass Effect 2, in the first game the side quests and some of the main quests required you to use your Mako to travel around the landscape and go to the where the action really began. In Mass Effect 2 you don't need even to travel around the planet, I really enjoyed watching the landscape while driving in the first game but after you got inside the buildings where the quests were taking place the level design was always the same and after some missions you would probably get bored, but in this game they totally improved these aspects. Every single quest has an an unique level design and there are so many backgrounds which look ABSOLUTLY GORGEOUS. Doing the side quests was in no way boring but completly a pleasure for me. Now, you certainly remember that in Mass Effect there was little micro-management or perhaps you can say that there was none at all, you had credits, medi-gel and omni-gel, nothing more and you could just get TONS of creds by selling pretty much everything you didnt needed on the stores. In Mass Effect 2 there's alot of stuff added to the ""resource management"", for example, remember that quest in the first game in which you had to survey several planets for resources for the Alliance? Well now you actually have a mini-game other than just clicking ""SURVEY"" one that is actually entertaining and requires you to purchase probes at the fuel depots, which of course, cost credits. Those resources that you acquire from mining/surveying can be used to acquire new upgrades for your weapons and/or research new weaponry, this ended up excluding the looting of weapons which was possible on the first game. Other than buying upgrades for yourself and your squad you can actually purchase upgrades for the Normandy which actually will help you in the end game. Each member that you add to your squad grants you with new upgrades for both your squad and your ship. Now the combat, it is pretty much like the first one but in my opinion you don't really feel as much ""overpowered"" as in the first game because there's no mods for the weapons and the guns have alot more recoil in Mass Effect 2 and you also have limited ammo making the use of your powers a must, making this way, the combat alot better than in the first Mass Effect. The space exploration has alot more depth into it now, with the adding of fuel using while travelling, you can also purchase fuel in fuel depots for credits. The story continues where the first game left of and it is just incredible in my opinion, one of the best I've seen and experienced in a long while with the soundtrack keeping up to par with the cutscenes and the emotinal moments which are capable of making a sensitive person cry. The character design is as good as the story as far as I'm concerned didn't really noticed someone ""where it doesn't belong"". Every single squad member has their own unique personality and even the geth,  ""Legion"", and EDI have a very interesting dialogue. There's also the love story in which you decide you want to take part or not. The Codex keeps up the great job in providing you with aditional information and ""lore"" which you don't find in the characters dialogues. And of course, surprisingly enough the choices you made on the first game carry on to this one and the ones that you make in Mass Effect 2 will carry on to the third game. I honestly don't know what more I can say about it, it's an awesome game and experience that both role playing and shooting fans most definatly will enjoy but I judge this game by it's storyline so the 2 games I've played so far are for me only one and for that I can say it is really a hell of a game that you should try.

												Hands down, one of the greatest video games of all time. The atmosphere, the dialogue, and of course the characters are absolutely unparalleled. The only reason you shouldn't buy this game is if you have never played Mass Effect 1, in which case you should buy that, play through it, and then import your save file to Mass Effect 2. Sure, the DLC may be a rip off and you can only get Mass Effect 3 through Origin, but this is one of the top games ever for a reason. It's worth it.			"

At least I was. If you didn't like the loot system in part 1, then you're in good hands, as Mass Effect 2 ditches the loot sytem in favor of upgrades, constant upgrades. It's fun, amazing, but part of me always missed the loot system. The story wasn't as engaging as part 1, but still amazing fun. Enjoy			"

The game is now a bit more shooter-oriented/action-oriented, but still packs an incredible storyline.Some events in ME2 will depend on what you did in ME1, assuming you import your characters/saves from the previous game.

												Mass Effect, the game where have no idea which dialouge choices affect the story and which ones are just for show. Missing these important game-changing dialogue can really change the outcome of your gameplay, so watch out! This is the major selling point for me. Other than the great squad-based combat, Mass Effect 2 has a great, immersive story with interesting characters who each have their own unique history and past. The atmosphere is unique and the overall univerese is just so diverse and fleshed out. The conflict is great and the choices that have to be made are crucial and important. So, if you're looking for a game with a great story, a colorful cast of characters, strategic combat and crucial choices, then Mass Effect is the game for you!!!-Yumi			"

												In addition to some of the best science fiction writing I've ever encountered and excellent gameplay (although the combat is better in the first game), this game also has one of the most perfect endings of any video game I have ever played. I would definitely recommend it.			"

												The Mass Effect series writing is great! This second game is more polished and I liked playing through the game to gain loyalty from my shipmates, which meant that more people would survive. I missed the planet exploration from the first game.			"

												First playthrough...failed some loyalty missions, watched Yeoman Kelly (whom I was boning as a female Shepard) turn into genetic goo, made to feel like dirt by Dr. Chakwas, lost some of my favorite crew so defeating the Reaper was a bittersweet victory. Second playthrough....Succeeded in all the loyalty missions, didn't get the Noramandy up to specs, watched Yeoman Kelly turn into genetic goo (again), suffered Dr. Chawas' scorn (again) and had unacceptable crew losses (sigh). Third playthrough....Succeeded in ALL loyalty missions, got the Normandy up to specs, saved Yeoman Kelly (yes!), got Dr. Chakwas' admiration (yes!) ended suicide mission with all crew intact (yes! finally!). Although Yeoman Kelly wouldn't bone me in ME3 (sigh).  I'm Commander Boingo 420X and this is my favorite RPG....EVER			"

												This is one of my favorite games of all time. The story and characters were great and so was the gameplay. I liked that you had to assemble your team and improve them in order for you and your team to survive the final mission. This has to be my favorite game in the Mass Effect trilogy. I would recommend playing all 3 of these games in order and importing your save each time if you really want to enjoy this. Mass Effect 2, like the rest of the trilogy, has great replay value and you can easily play it for hours. BioWare games always have a great story and Mass Effect 2 is no exception. I had previously owned all 3 of these games on PS3 but had to buy them again for the PC because they are just so good. Mass Effect was the first RPG I had really played and since then I have gone on to enjoy others. I would strongly recommend starting here if you are used to action games and want tho get into RPGs or just enjoy sci-fi. I would also recommend this to any RPG fan because it is a great RPG with an immersive sci-fi universe with an interesting backstory and memorable characters.			"

												To start off I only really bought this game because I heard it was good, and my computer could actually run it. However when i started playing it, I lost track of time. This game has some decent combat, but its shining strength lies within your decisions. The good/bad decisions, offering to help people, each of these brings a whole depth to the characters and makes you feel true emotions for them. While there are a few awkwardlt executed moments, this is still a delight and  I highly recommend checking out the rest of this series. You won't regret it!oh yeah..10/10 my genius tali and my feared assasin who's never been caught love to run into hoards of enemies. T.T			"

												I cant stress how good this game is it is my favorite franchis of games its so good its hard to comprendi would reccomend buying the series and playing it through. The mass effect universe is so complex and beautiful with its many species, planets, options and choices, speaking about choices it allows you to put yourself in the game which develops how do you say a actual friendship with the characters in the game which is something i will never get over. I have logged about 50-75 hours into the series because i am shepard a commander in the alliance because i have made the choices that define me and my actions.So please do yourself a favor and play the series because this is the best series there shal be in  the gaming franchise. P.S You could think this is overhype but this is truley how i see and im writing this because my head is still stuck in the mass effect universe.			"

												I did play this game, or rather 40+ hour movie right through. However, it has a very different way of managing weapons and updates. I found this annoying and to ""consoled"" up for my taste.But the story is good and keeps interest going through the hole game.But you should know this, EA has put their claws in this and I almost lost my temper when trying to download my DLC content. You see, EA forces you to use their mega-crap software origin for downloading the DLC belonging to this game.And as all EA games they have employed someone suffering from brain hemorage to design it. You need to register an  origin account to get your stuff, then you need to download your DLC from a browser, then you need to run every DLC as a seperate EXE file.And that is not all, every time you start up your game, the origin crap-good-for-nothing built in client fails to connect to their demonic servers so you need to manually insert your origin credentials every time you want to play this. And modern things like cut and past for those of us who use password managers, nope, forget about it, and using 90:s era things like tabbing between form boxes, nope, cause EA don't know about that.I recommend this game but will rather drink from a toilet than to buy an EA game again.
