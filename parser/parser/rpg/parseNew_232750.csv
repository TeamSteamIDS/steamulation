												Mars: War Logs is a game of potential. The universe created by Spiders is certainly curious but is often let down by the badly written dialogue and pacing of the story, or the sometimes horrendous voice overs. Graphically it is an appealing game and the environments and music is all there in a solid fashion. The combat is largely enjoyable and has a nice punch behind it, the skill system and crafting mechanics are nice but the lack of variety within loot is a letdown. In the end, Mars: War Logs is an above average game that will certainly be an enjoyable experience for those looking for a nice little third person RPG, and are willing to forgive it for its diamond in the rough state.

			Mars: War Logs is a 3rd person action RPG from Spiders and Focus Home Interactive that takes the player into a futuristic and decadent universe. But is it a universe worth fighting over?

												This is not the best RPG out there, but I would be lying if I said it is not fun as hell. Combat is smooth, landscapes are gorgeous, and the story isn't too bad either. I'm aware when this game came out it was pretty bad, but they did an excellent job at fixing what needed to be fixed. So many of the negative comments don't apply anymore. However, many have said the combat and crafting system is a rip off from The Witcher 2. I will have to say false. Similar? Without a doubt, but not a rip off. This game takes it much more slow, and the option to use the techromancer abilities makes it its own. And a crafting system is a crafting system. Not much you can do there. Now, my impressions: I love this game. I was constantly entertained from start to finish. I love action RPGs and this game delivered. But not only that, the landscapes were amazing. The towns and such were nice, but you got tired of looking at them after a bit, but when you stare off into the distance, beyond the towns, you saw beauty. They made a boring red planet into something else. If you enjoy a not so hardcore RPG then by all means pick this game up. But maybe wait until a sale. I love the game, but $15 is still a tad high in my opinion, but nonetheless I think this game should be on any RPG lovers game library.			"

												An imaginative role-playing game, the various pieces never quite come together into a satisfying whole. Its settings is poorly described, even after I read through the in-game journal and the documents on the game's web site. The characters feel shallow and - not helped by poor voice-acting and writing - I never empathized with their plight. Mars is gorgeously rendered, but the detail is only skin-deep; too-few NPCs, quests and maps results in an world that is artificial and empty. The combat and crafting are moderately entertaining but, again, the lack of content hobbles even this; a mere handful of weapons and spells did not give me much to play with. Mars War Log plays very much like a game where the developers had a great idea, but neither the talent nor the ability to bring that idea to fruition.			"

												This game reminds me of several titles: Dragon Age 2 (how the maps are confined), Witcher 2 (combat), and Mass Effect series (story/quest branching). For a traditional RPG it's got some things right, but it has its share of problems.Pros:1. Tactical combat. Combat gets even more challenging and fun at Extreme difficulty, but at a price...2. Nice setting and atmosphere. Mars here is like a remnant of some former colony; a fresh change from those high-tech ones. Everything is rusty, red, and make-shift. Put it another way, it's more like an apocalyptic Mars.3. Your choices matter. People may die/live, quests may be locked/opened, etc... If you like replaying for different endings then this is for you.Cons:1. At Extreme difficulty, a bad selection of skills will make the game almost impossible. There seems to be some skills that must be unlocked first, such as Evade, Sneak, etc.2. No crowd AI. At hubs you may get invovled in battle, but civilians do not react at all, even when the fight is happening right under their noses. This hurts the sense of immersion.3. Some quest are hidden inside branching conversations and are easily missed if you choose the wrong reply (but you have no idea of the difference). Choose between ""just say it!"" or ""ok ok i got it""?4. Characters and lore are rather under-developed. For an RPG of this length (30hr for me), you only get to know a few of the characters. Some just pop up with little background info. The romance here is merely a filler.5. In combat you only have limited control on your companion (only 4 ""states""), which sometimes is not that helpful.Despite the cons, I still enjoy this game a lot, primarilly for its combat and story. If you aren't that picky about graphics and AI and just expect a down-to-earth action RPG, this shouldn't disappoint you.			"

												Spiders made a cyberpunk RPG borrowing the best elements of the Mass Effect franchise. Too bad the game offers only a short adventure. Although a complete walkthrough can be done under a dozen hours with all sidequests accounted for, War Logs offers replayability thanks to the variety of specialisation it offers along with the choices the player can make during dialogues.Pros:-- An interesting story that puts our protagonist, Roy, in the centre of a guild war. Two guilds are battling for the power on Mars where the most valuable source is water. Roy is a prisoner of war who desperately tries to escape the camp he's sent to by joining forces with others to plan the great escape.-- Techromancy: The manipulation of electricity. Technomancers are the mages of this RPG. Roy later on obtains this ability and along with combat and stealth the door is open to the 3rd gameplay style.Cons:-- Horrid voice acting: Some of the voice acting is just awful. One particular example was when I needed to get rid of someone bothering a farmer. Intimidation was a good way to do that instead of a fight but the actor was so awful that I really felt like loading the last checkpoint and going for a fight. Also, sometimes the texts do not correspond to the sentences uttered. An example of why War Logs feels a rushed development.-- Shortness: See the first section. The game is quite short considering it's an RPG. They could have included a couple of more missions and one or two extra chapters. The ending also felt rushed and while the epilogue was satisfying I thought the game could have offered a better antagonist.-- Companions: Just like in Mass Effect you have companions. Sometimes one and sometimes two. The problem with them is that they die. All the time. I played the game on normal difficulty and a couple of hours into the game the enemies were so strong that they immediately took out my companion. -- Taking sides: Again, a similarity with Mass Effect. You can take the good or the bad path. But what exactly is the result of this? I could not really find out as I became good but did something at one point that immediately rendered me neutral. This could have been more refined.Well, I have more negative bulletpoints but make no mistake War Logs is an entertaining RPG. Coming from an indie developer it is a plus. Do give it a try if it has a discounted price.			"

												Mars: War Logs , I wrote this review after finishing the game most likely because I was so emotional and had to talk about it. Mars is an amazing game despite what the Meta score says. People complained saying it falls short of a great RPG because it's to simple , but that's the wonderful thing about this game - It's simple. Its gameplay and combat is like Witcher 2 with Slow-mo chosen abilities , blocking and rolling. For someone that likes the idea of an RPG but doesn't have the time or doesn't like the complexity of RPG's ,this is the perfect game for you! You don't have 20+ type of stuff you can get items from , only enemies , crates and piles ( No max items slots or weight too) There are side quest but not so much that you will leave them later on ,  but instead you will most likely do them all.An amazing SIMPLE wonderful RPG that deserves your attention. Buy it if your a fan of RPG's or when ever it's on special.9/10			"

												A French RPG that combines 3rd-person action with questing and crafting. It is really an indie game and tries to depict its large ambitions with quite limited means, leading to an uncanny feeling of discrepancy.Pros* Fun combat system once you get enough tools in your arsenal, a bit frustrating otherwise* A good art direction for characters and enemies, but the decors are too linear and empty* A cheap price for a reasonable amount of contentCons* The lack of polish is frustrating considering Mars: War Logs looks and play like an AA product rather than your standard indie game* The story is blandly-executed; it tells too much and don’t show enough, which is disappointing considering the setting itself is interesting and bring back some memories of Fallout and DuneThe game falls short of its expectations, it is not bad but it feels cheap and the player may not be expecting that feeling. If you’re looking for a flawed but enjoyable 3rd-person action RPG, I’d rather recommend Alpha Protocol.			"

Mars: War Logs is a 3rd person sci-fi action RPG. On a Mars that's been cut away from Earth for decades, Roy ""Temperance"" is an Aurora soldier stuck in Abundance P.O.W. Camp 19 that wishes to escape back to his home city of Shadowlair, just to find out the Technomancers have taken over the government.Pros: Good base story that reflects a rich universe, much larger than the span of the game. While the graphics themselves are sub-par for 2013, the aesthetics are excellent, showing a dry planet built from scraps where people have obviously grown beyond their resources and no supplies are expected. Combat gameplay works well and prevents you from just going flailing about or shooting all in sight: you need to think and react properly to the different ranged or close-ranged attacks, blocking, leaping and hitting when the time is right, and the A.I. actually does a great job at becoming much more strategic and challenging at higher difficulty levels. Also, ranged weapons are under-powered, a good thing as it forces you to make use of the melee combat mechanics. There is an interesting, although limited, crafting system for upgradable items.Cons: The voice acting and cut scenes are bad, and I mean it: out of sync voices, long awkward pauses between character reactions or interruptions, bad character animation, all so much more dated than the game itself is. The maps feel just as dated: floor surface is polygony, there is no climbing or jumping over 1 inch obstacles, invisible walls and ""decorative"" stairways or ledges your character should so obviously be able climb on, it reminds me of the one thing I hated in the map layout of Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic. The story is rushed, as so many concepts are introduced or teased at but get no development whatsoever. There is barely any equipment you can purchase (a few suits and a few sticks, some of which are not upgradable).Verdict: ★★☆☆☆ - Forget itI wish I could recommend this game, but in all honesty it's not that good. The writers obviously wanted to bite on much more than they could chew, as the game introduces concepts meant to rival the biggest modern RPGs or sci-fi stories out there: Mars being cut from Earth, futuristic guild wars, mysterious ruins from the first colonists, serum (body fluid) being used as currency, that and so much more gave the game a lot of potential, none of which is exploited in a significant way and all end up falling flat. Still, the setting's potential is enough to have me interested in its recent spin-off The Technomancer, hoping it'll be any better.—————————————————————————This was just my opinion.If you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up, and feel free to check out more of my (purely opinionated) reviews.

												Worthwhile for any fan of Mars based sci fi. Many nods (mostly subtle) to other things and some great visual designs, but ultimately the game is flawed and evidently missing a bunch of content. Feels like they wanted to make a Witcher style open world game, but were somehow constrained or forced out of that path.All things considered, its a good enough game to while away a weekend with if yer in the right mood and you get it at the right price.Controller recommended as the combat can be a pain on kb+m.

												I recommend this game simply because its different and interesting. Yet I am somewhat disappointed with it. There is so so so much potential for story of this game but it just misses its mark. I think with a better budget and studio and with perhaps a different name, this game could have been huge. The plot/story starts off really well is so very interesting but this drops off rather quickly. It's still interesting, but the depth drops and the plot starts to feel somewhat half formed, before dropping out completely with a sudden ending. It feels like there needs to be a sequel, to fully round things up. This may seem like a criticism rather than a recommendation, but I want people to play it and see exactly what I mean about the beautiful artwork, interesting concept and huge potential for this game despite the misgivings. Just grab it on sale and give it a go and see how this game makes you feel!			"

												I wanted to like this game, I really did. But oh god, it's so repetitive.You'll just run through short, narrow hallways and fight groups of 4-5 respawning enemies that all fight the same way. You'll also always fight the same way, because there's only one weapon type in the whole game. The odd thing is how the tutorial is the best part of the game. It manages to present an interesting setting, a decent plot & characters and create illusion of freedom, with some big areas and the promise of a lot of new things to unlock. But sadly, those never come, and any motivation the characters had vanishes. If you own this already, really I recommend playing the first 2-3 hours. If not, just avoid the whole game.			"

												This game is an unpolished gem - it has decent graphics, good story and a fighting system that's enjoyable enough and doesn't frustrate (looking at Risen). On the other hand you have a crafting system that is more or less useless (I especially liked one skill that said I would receive new explosives recipes, but nope, didn't happen). It stays quite realistic in the matter that you never feel unnaturally powerful, but then again when you receive your ""magic"" it leaves you quite disappointed at how weak it also is.Nevertheless I've enjoyed time spent with this game and even managed to get myself to see the second branch of the story, so given the opportunity you may want to check it.7/10			"

												I have been pleasantly surprised so far. It has a skill tree similar to Witcher 2 with the same evasion and block system (which is a plus to me as I loved Witcher), decent voice acting and good action. The exploration is pretty good and combat is fluid and easy to kick♥♥♥♥♥after a while.My two biggest complaints: 1) You'll take out a bunch of bad guys whose bodies will be laying there, shown holding a weapon, but you can't take it. I really don't care, but to some this is a deal breaker.2) The tutorials and in game tips are entirley for controller, and you have no active keyboard help (also liveable).Otherwise the storyline has been engaging, keeping me wanting to play more and I've found myself enjoying the game throughly. Get it on sale and you should be happy, I paid $4.99 for it, definitley worth it. Regulalry $19.99, unless you're a huge fan of a this type of game I would wait for a sale again.   4/5			"

												This is a tough recommendation choice because it's not a BAD game - it's just not a good one either and given the number of RPGs available I just can't really recommend this one.There's some nice ideas in here - the setting etc. is fine - but a lot gets lost under VERY poor quality voice-work, somefrankly bizarre plot ideas and VERY repetitive environments.The game also relies too much on 'go get this and come back' quests - it's a seemingly endless stream of those.  There's really not much latitude in how you progress - lots of linear 'do this, do that' quests - combat is quite tough and VERY random (but there's lots of options/upgrades etc. which is one of the strong points, really) and so  on.After a couple of hours I just didn't have any reason to continue - there was no 'carrot' drawing me into the game - nothing enticed me to spend more time getting things for people (often for simple nonsensical reasons)So it's not a BAD game - as I said - it's just not a good one either...

												This is another case of ""you either love it or hate it"" best way I can decribe this game is a cross between Dragon age 2 and Risen... that mgiht not be 100% accurate but in my opinion it felt like I was playing both games in one. For me I really really loved this game...it did have its silly moment like at the beginning I think there was missing dialog for the character because you spend 60 seconds having a 1-way conversation with a shower jail♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ also the voice acting isnt spot on for some characters but I got used to it pretty well. Final problem I had was the game is of somewhat short in its story and it feels like it jumps past some important things. But overall I really loved it...I wish it was a bit longer though. Combat kind feels the same for each of the 3 type of enemies you fight (Yes there are not many varity but the game is a little small if you skip most of the seartching and side quests). I would recommend it if you like RPG games like Risen and Dragon Age 2~ c:			"

												It is not the greatest RPG ever made, so if you're after only that, look past this game.However, if you're a fan of the genre, this game does have its own personality and charm. Look past the sometimes horrendous VO and the dodgy dialogue flow and there are characters here that are very interesting and relatable. Most scenarios also leaves the player with a choice (check the brackets in the following paragraph).An ex technomancer (one of the powers) who you play as, who has given up his past but is drawn back into it amidst this war escalating and for personal reasons (or you can not care about the kid). A companion who doesn't trust technomancers but overtime someone you can win over (or not). A general who is a great war strategist and is both honourable and dirty in the way he achieves his goals (or you can side with rebels instead).A woman who was ""rescued"" by her -what she goes on to call him as- her master, who went on to use her as a sex slave (you can take advantage of this yourself, or try to set her on a better path). So there's sprinkles of interesting stories and characters throughout that I've enjoyed. And all of that is put together by what I would describe as simple yet fun combat system along with conversation branching story and also gameplay mechanics feeding into your character (i.e: you can kill downed enemies for currency of the world, but it has negative impact on your reputation).So if things like that draw you in, you will be taken in by the game and since it doesn't drag on and is not padded out, the story can finish probably under 20hours (and I've tried to find every side quest).A lot of reviews have already touched on the crafting and what-not but I wanted to point out the above feeling of characters was what made it very fun and easy to make my way through this game. So for the £12 it asks for on Steam at the moment, it's to me well worth it.			"

												Rating 6.5/10Overview: Third Person RPGThe Good:+ 3 skill trees allowing you to specialize in combat, range, stealth, abilities etc. You also get character traits for further customization. + Find items scattered around the world or loot it off fallen enemies to craft stronger weapons and armor. + The game has plenty of side quests, many side quests have different ways of solving them. Depending on the dialogue options you choose, and how you resolve certain situationsmore side quests could become available later on. + Similar to Witcher 2, the game forces you to make a choice in the main story which changes the story and how things play out. + Interesting story and settingThe Average:The combat starts out really bad but gets better slowly as you level up and improve your skills. You have one button for attack, dodge, block and break enemy guard. Attacking enemies never really feels satisfying and most combat situations revolve around you hitting an enemy once or twice and then rolling out of the way over and over again until you get a clear shot to attack. The worst part however is the camera, as you are fighting one enemy, two or three other enemies will attack you off screen. Get in too close to a wall and it becomes even harder to locate enemies. You can also 'lock-on' to an enemy causing the camera to focus in on them which sometimes actually makes things worse. It isn't until you really start to invest a lot of skill points into your character that combat becomes more playable.  The game features a basic morality system that grants you some extra character abilities depending if you are good or bad. This is determined whether you let enemies live or die after a fight. It doesn't change a whole lot and other than a few character abilities, morality has very little impact on gameplay, dialogue or story. The Bad:- The voice acting and dialogue are bad. Every line is read without emotion or feeling. It feels like they handed the voice actors a script and said 'read this' and called it a day.   - The graphics are bland and boring. Red and brown seem to be the primary colors and the textures even set to high look terrible. The overall presentation and UI all feel substandard. Conclusion:A game that has everything you want in an RPG but lacks a lot of polish in almost all areas of gameplay. I certainly had fun with this game, enough to complete it twice and collect all the achievements but don't go into this game with high expectations. "

I had over 50 save slots and I was unable to load back and recover it.That was the only con I could think of not being able to go back and load a save when needed.

												Mars, War Logs is a budget RPG. Has all the elements of an rpg (character development, central story with a hero protagonist, etc), except for the extremely linear level design and exploration. The world is divided into hubs, each with 3 or 4 linear maps with repetitive design and art - and this is the one and major drawback of the game. Otherwise the story is decent, with few branching quests, but with a strong separation between following a tyrant or a peaceful path. The characters are also believable and have a fair developed background with a few options for romance. Game runs well with no bugs to report. Graphics are average (think last gen console level) but the combat mechanics are solid and the gameplay is fluid. I recommend the game for player looking for a ~12h RPG with no grand expectation. You will definitely derive enjoyment from the game.			"

												I'm not a fan of indie developers making epic-looking trailers that spice up their product.  This is a good example of a game that is supposed to look astonishing only to end up being a mediocre mess of good concepts that weren't fully fleshed out.  The game gets repetative quickly as you're forced to run around the same exact boring areas.  The dialogue is scarce and full of yawns.  The voice acting is terrible.  The combat is interesting and actually quite enjoyable but still manages to fall short of being outstanding.Even the story is bland and nonsensical.  I tried to enjoy it but it was just so convoluted.

												I like the combat. I like the setting. I like some of the RPG leveling. That's about it.The game is mostly ok with a few above average moments and a few awful ones. Give the game a spanking when it goes too far and enjoy the rest. Nothing in the game is offensive/moronic it's just lame here and there. Lame character backstory, lame voice for a character, etc, etc. But there are a few good characters and some good voice work. Visually the game looks like what you'd expect to find in a post-apocalyptic, ramshackle colony on Mars. Technically nice even if what you're looking at is rusted and filthy.Combat is what i really like because it's challenging. Very difficult to just rush and crush and very rarely are you swarmed by hordes of weak enemies. Take a little bit of time to try and fight tactically and it may work, and be pleasent. Or it may suck. It's not a perfect game. But Vampire The Masquerade: Bloodlines *was* a perfect game and it had it's share of ♥♥♥♥♥♥ combat.I like Mars WL enough that i'm not bored or disgusted by it, but i can't say that it's really very good. The game doesn't understand the difference between swearing to acentuate context or verbiage, and swearing just because reasons. It comes across as crass and pathetic rather than fitting. Sure guys in prison camps swear and occasionally explore sodomy, but Mars WL just tacks it on with almost no impact. Portraying emotion is very rarely done well.It's a game that fluctuates a bit. Reaching occasionally lofty heights and on other occasions slamming it's face into the sewer grate. You will probably facepalm a few times and wonder how some bits made it into the game without anyone asking ""Why are we putting such♥♥♥♥♥♥in our game?"" But i found it easy to forgive because it's really kinda petty and small and nothing is terribly insulting.The Martian setting is a-ok. Well presented and fits the gameplay. Combat is good if you want to be engaged. If you want to plow through mooks you might get some satisfaction later in the game when AoE attacks become available but more likely you'll hate it right off the bat. You're frequently outnumbered and your teammates are worth their weight in♥♥♥♥♥♥offensively. If they focus on some D, they can keep a few enemies off you long enough to make a difference.And that is why i like combat. Because smashing my face into a brick wall fails and i'm left with a headache but also ideas on how to defeat opponents without headbutting myself to death. There's explosives; grenades and mines can create a temporary opportunity or flatten a squad if you're lucky. There's also blinding attacks which work on enemies with unportected eyes. Dodge rolling is sometimes better than running away, and other times it can lead to some backstabbing. You can block, swing and miss, or guard-break enemies, and they can do the same to you. RPG leveling up can give you advantages including wounding enemies or leaving them stunned, etc. etc.Oh you can also show the enemy what a fancy faux-steampunk pistol you have. Maybe you can even fire a shot before they interrupt and beat you sensless. Envy, you see?I would not play Mars WL if combat was a cluster♥♥♥♥ or a clickfest and tactical combat basically meant ""spam attack as quickly as you can!"". I get why some hate the combat but that may be because they had different expectations. I was told before playing that combat was solid and was not dissapointed. It's good.What isn't so good is stealth or exploration. There is no exploration except in the KOTOR vein. Explore all areas before you leave if you want to find all the scraps, but you're mostly confined by the story or area. Some areas are devoted solely to combat, others are mostly talky/questy/looty hubs. Stealth is a mixed bag. Since combat awards a pittance of XP and loot most of the time it's perfectly acceptable to avoid it. However combat is occasionally unavoidable and most of your leveling up goes straight into making you better at combat or having the ability to craft better equipment that makes you better at combat.Oh, there's also crafting. It's fine. Not mind-blowing but not blown out of proportion either.Stealth is best used to scout the enemy location and position yourself well for a usefull sneak attack. But a stealth RPG this is not. It's mostly hand to hand combat with RPG elements, so stealth isn't as useful or fun as it was in Deus Ex. A ""swing a pipe in the direction of the enemies skull ... ON MARS"" -RPG. Yes gimmicky, but not bad.There's also a bit of morality though fortunately being a good guy isn't sickenning and being a prick isn't that advantageous. Kinda reminds me of the ways of the Open Palm and Closed Fist from Jade Empire, if it actually meant a thing. In JE that is.You can also have conversations with your companions from time to time and their attitudes may cha... you know what? Go play the game! I've written a book here and you've stuck with it to nearly the end so obviously you're at least a little bit intrigued.Like cold pizza and cheap beer, a good game is still good. Even if it could be a lot better.			"

												Single-player action RPG with 3rd person view, in the sci-fi setting. Very story-driven, that means NO for open world experience. But there are none good tale as well. Just a decent action part in narrow tunnel of somewhat ""noir"" agenda.In truth, game isn't all bad, it's just mediocre. But I'm freaked out by how it is presenting itself there on Steam: ""An Intense Cyberpunk Rpg On the Red Planet!"" While it is really telling about humans on the fourth planet, it is as far from cyberpunk, as me from being a wealthy man. And ""Intense"" means it is very short and linear. Not a good point to present for decent ""story rich"" RPG, you agree?I'm going to tell you about my experience with the Mars: War Logs, so there will be some minor spoilers. Sorry for that, if you don't want any spoilers - don't read any reviews on that game before playing! But I suggest you to look the other way, there are plenty of games of much greater value.There are many comparisons for this game to others. Somehow, Mars: War Logs are truly looks sometimes like Mass Effect or Star Wars KOTOR 2... But these moments are rare and second-handed at best. In other words, all what is that game going to show you - already been somewhere.Take a first act, for example: you are in the prison, and you're going to make escape from there. By stealing a train, for that you need some guy at generator, and some guy from the guard. And weapons. Funny, but ALL of these were in russian game Planet Alcatraz (2009), where you also starting at the prison, and gotta run out on the train. Only difference is what in Planet Alcatraz you can trust only in yourself in that prison, so you need to choose: either make yourself an electrician, or try to evolve in a guard - to get your hands on weapons and make ways to the train...Okay, I'm feeling I'm skidded away. Let's forget for a moment all other games, movies or books, in some way similar to our Mars: War Logs. Let's just look at it. For what gaming experience should we pay our money?Story? Well, it's sketchy. Bleak. At the end of the 2nd act you need to decide whoever party you'll side with. But truly, none of those parties are good choice for you. And, which is more - even that most affecting choice doesn't really changing anything for the player. Maybe except for the game achievement. But we know what genuine achievement hunter want all achievements, so he's gonna play for both parties. I suggest start with the Rebellion, and then for the General, it seems scheduled in that order by the game plot.World? Well, we don't really see Mars. Or participating in war, like it shows in the title. There are decent background, but it is absolutely static. In the worst way. Side-quests are about running from A to B, beating some guys, returning back. After that in point C appears some other quest person, and it's going further, to running to the D point - to beat or scare another bunch of losers. And the most annoying part is what sometimes some scripts aren't working properly, and you unwillingly skipping from A to D point, without even knowing what it was. Example? There are many, but side quests with romance line(s) are coming in mind first.As for visual part of showing the life on Mars... well, it's nothing pretty. No John Carter stuff there. Dirty suburbs where we hanging back and forth, that's all you'll gonna see in the whole game.Sounds are nothing spectacular too. Music is boring and forgettable. And voice acting... it's not That Bad, as some other reviews are pointing, but since all characters in the game are pretty obscure, their voices aren't really helping to bring them some personality. Pity on that.Finally, action part! Can you fight in this game? Yeah, there are decent battle system. You mashing people with your mace in the right hand and shooting with some nail gun from the left hand. Also you can cast some spells, like electric bolt, or stunning wave. Or you can throw grenades and mines. It helps in the fight, but, since the resources are scarce, you're still need to bash people with the stick. No power-chokes there.But then, combat part is decent, but not really good. It is imperceptible at normal fights, but bosses are turning everything down. They are too easy to beat. And even easier to be shot. There are only one out of the line boss fight in the 3rd sequence, where you meet some challenge for the boss. But alas! It's only because of it's health bar, other than that - same boring stuff.Synopsis:1) game is not original. Not in the scenario, neither in the action part. And over the most of all, it is treating you not as an associate, a hero of adventure, but strictly as a player clicking the buttons behind the screen. There are no place to dive, it's knee-deep at best.2) I can suggest you many games of much higher value. Even for the action part, which is the most satysfying in the Mars: War Logs. And I'm not talking about AAA titles, like Mass Effect or Deus Ex. If you are looking for well-written story where your actions are really changing something, try Alpha Protocol. And if you are up to the good trip, try Risen 2&3. And if you are really want a sci-fi story, there are a fine gem of forgotten games, Septerra Core.As for marks for Mars: War Logs, it would be 6.5/10, for the effort, and almost working scripts. It is almost a good game. Not worth buying though.			"

												When I first started this game I said to myself ""Blah, another mediocre game, this is boring"", but strangely I found myself addicted after about an hour or two hours of playing it. To be completely honest I knew I'd end up liking it anyways simply because it's a sci-fi action-rpg, taking place on Mars in the future in some Cyberpunk-ish, Steampunk-like setting. The story is okay I guess, nothing special and super crazy like something you would expect from a game like Mass Effect, but it's... ""okay"". I liked it. What REALLY drew me in was the fact I could invest skill points into my character, the ability to also not only wear different armor and weapons but also modify them to suit your playstyle, which you need to find parts to do so. You can also romance two women in the game, I won't spoil that though if you plan on playing it. The combat is kinda' hard at first since you seem to have to dodge and roll around a lot to avoid enemy attacks, you can't just go in there and start button mashing because you'll get owned in probably less than a minute. Should've called this Mars: Enemy Dodging Simulator 2013. Also your partner barely helps you, if anything he's only useful if you plan on using him as a way to distract the enemy (at least I think so). The game is also extremely short, yes.... I beat this game in 16 hours, that also includes most of the sidequests, if not all of them. Crazy right?But anyways, there is a sequel (or prequel) coming out called ""The Technomancer"", and it looks pretty damn good. As for this game, if you plan on playing it just play it without any high expectations whatsoever, understand this is a.... I guess you could say ""Budget"" game.			"

TLDRMars: War Logs is one of those gems that lurks behind ""A"" titles, just waiting to shine.  Very much like Mad Max or WoW in playability, tactics, NPC aggro proc, and utility of various game strategies, the GUI will be familiar to anyone who has played a 3rd person and the particulars are not complicated; you can also change keybinds for fine-tuning.  The detailed plot can go in at least three different major directions near the end, and choices determine results on several questlines, but the first two chapters will be very similar/same for any given playthrough.  First playthrough on""normal"" difficulty was challenging to learn but not difficult, and my second on ""difficult"" wasn't too bad (except for the Moles in 2 particular encounters)... but ""Extreme"" has me stumped.  There must be a build order that I haven't identified correctly... yet.In my 90+ hours I managed to get Roy physically stuck only once, and have not encountered fatal errors or other bugs of any sort.Regarding achievements, they are all pretty straightforward, but achi hunters who don't want to spend time playing through twice (two separate endings with achis) or to playthrough on Extreme (game complete on Extreme difficulty achi) will not earn 100% here.Time to complete on Normal difficulty... about 8-14 hours, depending on playstyle and choices; most people will probably be about 12-14 hours.-----------------------[break!]-----------------------Other useful observationsThe layout of the first area sucks, and your interactions there tend toward the ""run to this place and return"" sort of mission.  Further, some things don't live in the game world, but only spawn after you've (for example) entered an area for the second time.  There is a particularly useful couple of guides for this game, one of which has to do with top armor/weapon locations in each chapter (always buff up your gear as soon as you are able to, and focus on doing damage and resisting physical damage), the other of which is about a particular achievement where you have to do all the side quests (more on that achi later***).The one thing the game lacks is a visual skill chart progression; you can't see what future skills are, without unlocking everything before them in the tree.  That single fault aside, you can be a character who sneaks a lot and that will help you sometimes... but the non-human NPCs aren't fooled by your tiptoeing, and will require a proper threshing when they come at you 5 and 6 deep in confined quarters.  There is no functional disengagement from combat in this game; once you're aggro, you're in it until either you or they are finished; if you go down before any sidekick falls, you're dead just the same and they won't rez you.  However, you can let your sidekick fall in every fight and always get them back on their feet immediately after a fight ends (this is automatic).Fortunately, and at least on the normal difficulty setting, you can pick just about any skills you want at the beginning, and still muddle through the game.  In my view you WILL NEED much of the combat tree, but some very useful skills are in stealth as well (bonus damage/wounding strikes from behind; throw blinding sand over a larger area; craft nailgun ammo with less resources; are all amongst the most useful skills in the game).  Conversely... I don't think you ever need a single point in the Technomancer tree, or to activate a single ability, though it will happen automagically at some cut scenes.A note on certain character traits: most traits are bought with points earned, 1 point per level, with the traits costing varying amounts and having various pre-reqs.  I have played through as a White Knight and never done anything wrong, always helped others, and been nice to the NPCs, but I have never found out how to gain reputation on the GOOD side (first is a shopkeeper discount for good reputation, second is bonus partner HPs and damage output.  However, it's VERY easy to earn the worst reputation, and the benefit of doing so is a higher critical bonus and a chance to hurt people more effectively - and in order to earn this, all you have to do is start killing everyone you fight (you'll get a tool to extract serum from a body, which is fatal to the source).  Happy murdering; they deserve it anyway.***Now, regarding that one guide, and the achievement ""Completionist"" (Finish all of the secondary quests in Mars: War Logs): First, I *suspect* the text of the achievement is misleading, and that the intention is for the player to finish the game including all of the quests that you have been assigned... which isn't the same thing as finding and completing all secondary quests.  As I've read at least four different accounts of popping that achi after playing through four different methods, I'm fairly confident of this theory.  However there's a lot of good information in that guide (just look up the guide for the ""Completionist"" achi; the author did a good job of putting quest keywords in the guide as well as inserting pictures of relevance).All in all... this is a great game, I'd say easily 8+/10, and it does go on sale periodically.

												Loved the game, nice story and great gameplay. It kind of reminds me KOTOR. The downside is that your companions are nothing more than punchbags (which, in the end, is something good because combat is hard). You HAVE to dodge. Try going in a combat w/ mindless button smashing and you'll be dead in a sec. Story is not a fairy tale, it's dark and grim. By the middle of the game an event caught by surprise. I must admit, didn't see it coming (and I both hated and loved it)Also, your choices matter, so be careful.

												I really wanted to like this game more than I did. I did enjoy playing it, but it was a bit on the underwhelming side. Nothing in this game really stands out except for the world-building element. There's a lot that will fly past you about civilization on Mars which is kind of a shame. Combat isn't too bad -- being able to choose your skills from three different trees is nice, plus other types of ability points and customization of weapons and armor give a lot of choices to play with. I can't comment on how well stealth works because I utilized that skill tree the least.I think what I missed most from this game is that the protagonist, Roy, never seemed to have much at stake in the plot. Even playing him as a straight-up good guy, it often seemed like he was involved in this story because he didn't have anything better to do for a few weeks. He was once a Technomancer, but left the group, and while it is clearly something that other people in the game react strongly to, it seems to serve no purpose other than a talking point and doesn't figure much in the plot.I'd give this game a ""maybe"" recommendation. And a thumbs up because it is a kind-of-prequel to The Technomancer.Rating: 6/10Everything about this game is average. But the sum is still on the entertaining side. "

												Personally, I found this game very under-rated. I thoroughly enjoyed it. The combat system was fun to use and adapt to and can make your character look like a total badass if you've got it down, or a blind 10 year old waving a stick if you don't. Hell, maybe you're even a badass blind 10 year old with a stick. In any event, I found the combat very satisfying. As for characters, Roy (The protagonist) was great. I loved the way he sounds, his word choice no matter what option you choose, and just the way he lookes (having a main character with heterochromia just looks cool). I also liked the other characters and how you can influence them and converse. And as far as weaponry goes, you get a huge selection of makeshift, modifiable weapons and explosives. I can see why some people might have less praise for this game than myself though, it isn't a typical game like many of us are used to. It's not like any shooter here, and not even that similar to other RPGs like Fallout or The Elder Scrolls. Nonetheless, I would recommend this game to anyone looking for a good game with a good story, unique combat, and well rounded (and yet somewhat mysterious) characters.  "

												Mars: War Logs is an action RPG from publisher Focus Home Interactive. I've only been playing the game for a short time currently but I absolutely love it. If you're a science fiction fan or like games that really pull you into the story, what roleplaying game fanatic doesn't right, then you will really appreciate this title. The game like its namesake takes place on Mars and you play as Roy, a renegade tough guy, who gets inadvertently pulled into an epic story of which I won't get into so as to potentially spoil anything for you. The game is played for the most part in a third person view as you navigate yourself through the environment. There is enjoyable combat and anyone familar with titles like the Batman Arkham games or Sleeping Dogs will feel right at home with the controls as the fighting consists of similiar methods of attack and counterattacks. The roleplay elements of the game seem quite deep as there are many skills and perks that you can apply to upgrade and develope Roy to your particular style of play. Graphically the game is very beautiful...it manages to capture that rugged futuristic cyberpunk style that so many people seem to love. Another thing that I really like is that it's one of those games that doesn't use many load screens. Most of the time the story transitions from normal gameplay to cutscenes then to combat and vice versa seamlessly. Also like any great RPG you have the ability to craft and upgrade your gear. So far I've only scratched the surface of this fantastic title but I am really enjoying it and can't wait to play through to the end. Highly recommended!!!			"

												Mars: War Logs is pretty much a diamond in the rough. It's story felt a little rushed and the (Honour, at least) ending felt flat and underwhelming. The game approaches mature themes and has good story paths (two different endings): the universe is interesting and has tons of potential.The game is graphically appealing and it's fights are satisfying enough. The costumization and scavaging system are well implemented, with lots of upgrades to do. The atmosphere and backstory of the world are specially good, even though the cities don't actually feel alive: they are filled with people that exist only to be there. The dialogues are pretty bad and, unfortunately, the voice acting leaves a lot to be desired (just as the lip syncing and the facial animations, which provoked some unexpressive characters overall).This Cyberpunk RPG needed just a little more time on the oven and it could have been a fantastic game. Sadly, it's just an enjoyable experience.➡️️Final Rating: 7/10			"

												Because of some of the comments in the forum I gave this a try.It is good I did.You are on Mars without oxygen problems, colonized, more or less. Think of it as just a sand desert world and you get the idea.You are playing in 3rd person and you have during the normal game only one NPC in your party which always cares himself for his armor and weapon. You only decide the way they fight. I always put them to ""defensive"".The story is understandable and good. The side missions don't look like side missions, it is just so that you are in a situation and can do some things. So I did everything I saw which I could do because I WANTED to do it. There is no ""oh my god, another one of these side missions, AGAIN"", nope. You just play the game and see the story and do what you want. The fights are fair and sometimes you have to do them more than once until you get them done.But the fights are fun. (And there is a quick save, yeah.)You have to decide if you kill the guys or not, you decide after each fightYou don't have 1000 variants how to fight, but enough to not make it boring. And I just liked the different ways. Could not decide which one I like more, switched all the time.First attack with stealth for the fast first ""kill"", a bit of rolling and attacking from behind, breaking guards, throwing hand grenades and... ups, sorry guards, did I forget to mention the mines I put down in stealth mode before? After that a bit of magic, back to melee, win and loot.Then perhaps changing armor or weapon (that is all you equip) or upgrading one of the two.Or handcrafting some grenades, mines or ammo? I even had sex with one of the girls. Not like in Witcher, just so you know had it. And I liked girl even more after that.She is a bit weird but really nice. I like her. I am weird too, so everything is ok.And each time she asks ""can I do something for you?"" you remember that one time and think, man, where is the dialog option for ... you know? ;)It took me 15 hours to complete the game. Because the game is a bit repetitive after some hours this is really enough.I liked the story, I liked the fights and now, after the finish, I am contended.This is for sure not for everyone, and can't even imagine what people will like it,but if you can get it for cheap and like stories and fighting and just do not want to read a book today, give this a try. It IS worth it.			"

												To be honest, probably I would never bought this game myself, because I'm not really a game collector and I purchase only those games which I'm planning to play for sure. But good friend of mine, a great RPG lover, gifted it to me, so I gave it a try. Nice, it also has achievements. Well, let's load this thing up, and roll it on the hardest of difficulties (because achievement demands it!!!).First thing you'll notice - lots of orange and brown. Lots and lots of orange and brown. Good God! I know its a game on Mars, but orange and brown coloring is so intensive that after this Red Faction Guerrilla looks like an old black and white movie. It gets tiresome for your eyes sometimes, making occasional grey interiors relaxing... Its not that the graphics is bad, though. Its not perfect, but everything looks very detailed, although facial animation isn't that great. Movement and combat animations are very nice, and my personal favorite is how characters are bouncing of when they strike someone protected with the energy shield.The game starts with ""Innocence"" Smith (who, for the difference, looks like his name, unlike many others in the game), narrating on his way to the prison, like the other cannon fodder from the clan wars. Skiny guy, with a soft voice... Well, since this is a RPG game, I guess experience will make him manly and muscular soon, since the war isn't already... Upon arival, big, fat and ugly welcoming comitee is so happy to see some fresh meat, since he's ""grow tired of drillin' same old arses."" Enter Roy ""Temperance"", who saves Innocence's innocence just in time, and he is the character you'll controll, which makes better sense. Roy is also tired of something, tired of being in prison, and with Innocence's help his plan to escape is set in motion. Similar to Witcher 2, the game contains 3 large(ish) areas, through which you can explore mostly freely (some small gaps are locked until you get a side quest which leads throught them), but once you finish with the final task in them you can't go back. Besides story driven missions, you also have a bunch of optional tasks, given by the various folks in the world. If you are aiming for the 100% completion you have to chose dialog options carefully, and sometimes actions within those missions. Completion of these quests gives you XP points (just like fighting), and every time you level up you'll get 2 skill points and 1 character point. Character points are invested into unlockable perks, which you are unlocking by accomplishing certain tasks during your playthrough (they are unlocking better crafting items, giving you more XP from the defeated opponents, etc), while skill points are invested into one of the 3 skill trees: renegade tree is mostly about sneaking and some dirty fighting techniques; combat tree upgrades your armour and makes you better in melee; and the 3rd tree will be unlocked at the end of the 1st chapter, after you defeat a Technomancer and obtain a power glowe from him. I would advice you to not waste any points into sneaking perks, because stealth in this game is useless, and you'll be able to sneak successfully maybe in the whole 2 places in the game.Combat is mostly melee focused, although you'll get a gun as well (it can't be equiped, its usable like an ability by mashing a hotkey) plus technomancing powers later on. Pressing ""Q"" key slows down the action and brings the combat menu, from which you can select your abilities, and you can also tie them to the numerical keys on your keyboard. Over it you can also give the orders to your current follower. Besides blocking, there's also, imo more efficient, dodge roll (and you'll better be upgrading it to the max becase you'll be doing it a lot...). You can break your opponents guard in a couple of ways, including throwing a sand in their faces, and the game even takes in consideration if someone is wearing goggles or a riot helmet (needless to say that this ability is completelly useless vs mutaded creatures with no eyes).Defeated opponents aren't dead, they are just incapacitated and will get up soon after you pass through that area several times. Near the end of the chapter 1, you'll get a hold of the serum extractor, which will give you the option to finish them off and get some serum (which is a curency in here), but it will lower your reputation which may influence how the enviroment is reacting to you.Some armour and equipement pieces are having slots (up to 3), which you can upgrade by crafting upgrades on them. Each type of upgrades requires certain amount of resources, which you can scavenge around, including from killed/incapacitated opponents. Via upgrades you can give various bonuses to your equipment, having better protection but with a trade off in another area, getting more damage to your weapons but being more susceptible to attacks, getting better chances to cause various crits like bleeding, stun, etc.Now regarding its difficulty. To say that this game is super-cheap is an understatement. On the easiest difficulty level you can run through it in just 5 hours, with completing all of the side quests (it also includes considerable amount of the backtracking), and its probably the only level on which your follower is semi-useful. On harder levels - its a nightmare. Except in the couple of side quests, where you'll be combating a single opponent, on every other occasion you'll be outnumbered and outgunned. Vastly. The best you can hope from your companion is that he will attract 2 or 3 opponents, while you are trying to deal with the rest of the gang. Once he is down you'll end up with a tail of 5-6+ thugs chasing you around, while you are rolling and dodging their attacks, desperately trying to make sucker punches with hit and run tactics...Like that isn't hard enough, the game is also glitchy, with devastating Technomancer shock attacks heat-seaking you through the walls. Also, you get hit if you don't dodge early. Even if you can clearly see that the model isn't touching you, somehow their claws/teeth/bats end up on your face. The game is so unforgivingly hard sometimes, it will really make you to think about your tactics and equipment. You'll be often changing your armour upgrades to suit the curent situation, trading damage sponge enforced metalic plates which are useless vs Technomancer's electrical attacks, to more shock resistant upgrades but they are offering less protection against physical attacks (at very least those cannot reach you through the wall...). Not to mention that happens when you load a quicksave where you were sneaking pass sleeping guards they end up awaken...Overall, its cheap but not that bad. It offers two endings, interesting dialogs, and I had some 10 hours of fun in my overall playtime, but the rest was a chore. For its price (especially on the sale) it may offer you your moneys worth, if you don't have anything better to play. But, as I said, I would never buy it myself, and I gave a thumbs down to some far better produced games than this (Crysis 2), so taking these things in consideration I think it would be a little bit unfair to say that I'm recommending it. Which is really a shame, because you can't get rid of the feeling like its overambitious, and a huge wasted opportunity.Besides somewhat interesting main theme, the rest of the soundtrack is generic and repeatable. I would recommend ""Nine Inch Nails - Pretty Hate Machine"" album in the background while playing this. Accidentally, friend of mine linked this album to me while I was playing, and for some reason it went nicely with the game.			"

												A nice RPG style game with some good and bad points, if I could give it a neutral vote I would, but when forced to make a choice I think I would recommend this game. I’ve nearly finished the campaign but doubt I would give it another run. This is a nice well written story but this not a well-polished title with a few good and ugly points see below.The Good; Good story, with nice voice acting (not amazing but good), well laid out level design which flows. Detailed background to backup story with some feeling of link to the main characters. Nice skill trees (3 of them) which nicely make you think about your next upgrade.The Ugly- Combat tried to be technical and give you choices but its very clunky and nowhere near as fluid as many modern (not always AAA titles) games. Tried to make you feel you have choices but is a very linear game with very few real choices. Some voice acting is bad.Overall I would recommend the game if your into your dark sci-fi future RPG’s but only if you have nothing better to get and it’s on sale, not for everyone but thumbs up from me!

												""Mars: War logs"" is a great game in genral, and with some great factors leading me to give this game a good rating. But with its great upside, it has noticeble downsides with it. I will explain the pros and cons of the gamePros: - Enriching, diverse and great combat system- Fitting music soundtrack- Great storyline of missions, places and different attitudes in the people you meet- Great Upgrade/ salvage system within the world. - Nice volley of powers, tools and attacks during fights to keep the battle interestingCons:- The voice acting in the game is by far laughable. - Dialogue and writing is just not well doneBesides those 2 things in cons, which are some of the worst ive seen in single player games, it doesnt take away alot of the fun out of the game. I definitelly recommend this game.( 7/10 )			"

A Nice Find [KAMGUSTA's REVIEW]I wasn't expecting much from this title and instead I got surprised.I'd call the game a ""Third Person Hack and Slash RPG"", much like KOTOR or Mass Effect (but not as good, obviously!).The graphic is a bit outdated (from the Steam screens it seems awesome, but it's not) but it is by no way bad.Story is fine and you won't wander too much without clues. The biggest downside is the amount of backtracking, really too much (also used for increasing the longevity).Not a hidden gem, but one of the few games I finished, so it has to have something special.Best played with Keyboard and MouseRecommended Buy Price < 10$Score 7/10 "

												This is  a great little RPG, do not let yourself be dissuaded by the reviews slamming the combat system. Is it a great or detailed system? No, but it is fun once you get a bit into the trees and figure out how you like to fight. I have a lot of fun dodging attacks and roasting enemies with lightning. It can get frustrating in the early stages if you stupidly run in a horde of enemies you can`t seem to defeat. But that is rare and after 2-3 attempts normally no problem. You need to learn how to dodge and vary your attacks a little.The worldbuilding is very interesting and the place feels pretty well thought out, though not really alive. The story is intresting enough and I wanted to find out more about the protagonists past and the world of Mars. The ending was fitting and satisfying with a touch of sadness.Biggest negative would be the back and forth running, there is A LOT of that. But it is not too bad since the levels are not huge and with sprinting it goes fast. Overall it feels a bit rough, it is clearly not a AAA Budget game. As it is not sold as such I do not feel this makes this game worse. Spider is definetly a developer I will keep my eye on.			"

												I was looking for a cyberpunk game to play and this rolled across my lap. There is a karma system but I didn’t see it come into play too much. The crafting system was a bit strange, useful but not exactly a game changer. The only real annoying part I can say was that combat took a while to get used to and the camera, even when locked on to an enemy, didn’t cooperate in a useful way. The world building was done well though and I finished the game twice wanting even more plot.			"

												This is a so-so action RPG, gameplay is similar to Mass Effect (you go from one small level to another, battle groups of enemies, collect various garbage from blinking boxes or piles). Very very generic. The locations are so small and they are divided into even smaller compartments by doors or ledges. It feels like an epic story of navigating through an office building. Graphics are depressing, both in technology and in design. NPC quests fell generic (kill monsters, search garbage piles, talk to someone).The things I liked:- combat may look interesting (but all the fights are almost the same, especially near the end when you steamroll everything using local 'magic' called Technomancy)- some talents in the skill tree are interestingI won't recommend this game since there are way better action RPGs. If you want a Mars setting and don't mind even less RPG and more action, then play wonderful Red Faction: Guerilla and (to a less extent) Red Faction: Armageddon.			"

												I know I may sound like dumbass but this game had really promising start... Who wouldn't like mixing up Prison Break series on Mars?Tactician fights using techno-abilities and gadgets were supposed to bright action elements, but hit boxes in this game are just frustrating. At some point you will end up getting consistently thrown into enemies chain attacks, which will suck your health to 0 in few seconds. You won't be able to do anything. Game is just hard, you need to dodge like crazy. Is it rewarding our efforts? Thats the biggest No. Plot is simple run-away / get revenge. I dont mind this if it is well executed theme. For most part here cutscenes are not rewarding our efforts since the voice acting and dialogues are really cheap.As closure graphics are nice, crafting is nice and we can see changes on our equipment. Sound is fine and as I mentioned fighting system might be weird but it is playable. Question is will you find fun with just that?			"

												This is one of those RPG's where:-You have to roll non-stop and kite all over when fighting multiple enemies. (3-6 at a time)-Your companion will ALWAYS die. Yes, in every fight it will drop to 1 or 2 enemies pretty quickly.-So you really don't have any companion or help in this game, luckily it gets back up after combat ends.-You can be fighting a mob of people or monsters and the guards/npc's will stand around and watch.-It's primarily a melee game, you get scarce amounts of supplies to make some bullets, that go pretty quickly.-The story is pretty straight forward, but a little boring. I didn't feel compelled to hunt out and do any side quests like you would normally do in most RPG's.-The atmosphere is what initially lured me to the game, I like sci-fi RPG's. and on Mars? What a plus.-Voice acting is awful, graphics aren't anywhere close to great, and the combat can be a little sketchy at times.Regardless of the flaws, this game had me entertained enough to finish it. It's short, especially for an RPG, but if purchased on sale, I would recommend at least giving this game a try. You will either hate it, or not mind it, but you won't love it. 6/10			"

MARS: WAR LOGSA budget action RPG that's at times an incredibly frustrating and unpolished experience yet JUST about entertaining enough to recommend.Rating 5/10The game’s flaws are many so that's where I'll start. The worst of these is the voice acting, it's terrible and the game would have benefited with just text. At times the voice work verges on parody, badly stilted and it makes you wonder if English was the actor’s first language.Not only does the voice work detract from the game but the writing doesn't help. There's a good story hidden away somewhere but you have to dig deep to find it. The biggest frustration however is with the combat, which is best described as the worst aspects of Risen crossed with the worst aspects of The Witcher. I played and completed the game on 'Extreme' difficulty mode which only highlights the problems, early on the game turns into a mini game of rolling around in circles desperately trying to regenerate health. The lack of weapon choice, a long stick with some additions doesn't change throughout the game but thankfully later on the technomancer skill tree opens up and allows for a bit more choice in combat. It's not perfect but helps break up the monotony of the combat in the first chapterThe UI and inventory system is also badly thought out, forcing you to craft one item at a time. On later levels you might want twenty health kits and have to painstakingly click through the system twenty times. Like Risen there is also no weight limit meaning you can pick up as many items as you wish which leads just grabbing everything. I had so many items at the end of the game that had no real use.Next up is the reputation system which is basic with what appears to be three different reputation levels, Good, Neutral and Bad. I hit the bad reputation early on and even though I killed as many people as I could I didn't go any further than bad. I'm not sure of the effects that reputation has on the game, I didn't notice any major changes to the way I was treated, the game says Merchants treat you worse but then Merchants aren't needed at all.So what are the positives and why I am recommending it? Well the setting of Mars is well realised and the background lore is new and fairly interesting. The fluff is interesting enough to read through the diary excerpts and information about the various locations and characters. It also moves along at a nice pace and just when one area gets boring it moves onto the next.There is something that I enjoyed; I just can't really put my finger on it. There's a lot of potential here and if we ever see a sequel and they iron out the various issues then it could turn into a great series.			"

												Mars: War LogsI recommend this game if you are a rpg fan, like games on other planets, like semi-open worldish games, or just want an average experience. If not, just past this one by. This game is like a decent group of ideas put together somewhere between Mass Effect and Red Faction: Guerrilla, but somehow still fell short either due to funding or time. This game could've been great. Instead, its just ok. It just feels like a lot of game is missing and under developed. Here are a few examples of my point.1)Too many things just happened that felt like it should of been played out or at least made into a couple of cut scenes. Like after the first chapter, you escape prison and by the time you get into town, the long war was randomly over.2)Some things are not really explained well like the different groups of water companies or how the leaders got there positions of power. 3)There are also things that come have been utilized better like the romantic aspect of the game, or the morality meter, or even the crafting of weapons. All of these are good ideas that if used right can improve a gamers experience but in this game, they were all kind of just there. BREAKDOWNThe graphics are decent, the music is tolerable, the camera is horrible, the story is interesting but broken. The voice acting was actually pretty good. The game could've had replay value but the multiple endings are too similar to make me want to play the whole game over.Overall, the game was above average and is a decent buy when on sale @ 75% off, but I would even question picking it up @ half price.

												Alright, this is a short game, so it's up to you and what you feel like playing. However, there's high replayability since there are several paths to follow that lead to different endings (altough for that purpose, I highly recommend that you save prior to key conversations, as they do matter a lot in this game and the outcome).The thing is... the combat sucks. Like, big time. But if you get hooked by the story, it's bearable and you can get used to it. The game's got pretty interesting things actually, it does a good job at imagining a distopian futuristic Mars, and lets you build your hero/antihero with an fair enough skilltree. Not to mention that you can romance someone in it, as long as you're not a♥♥♥♥♥♥at a specific point in the story.All in all, yes I do recommend it BUT keep in mind that the combat is real crap and that the game's a bit rough around the edges.

												This small studio has done remarkably well, despite limited funds and has presented a sci-fi RPG with a slight cyberpunk mood, that has gathered all the good elements from various genre blockbusters. The voice acting is solid, the story is interesting and the game mechanics work. The controls are good with a keyboard and mouse but better with a gamepad. The game has some short comings but nothing that is horribly bad. No micro transactions like you can find in AAA games. Cough... Deus Ex: Mankind Divided. You have side quests, you have simple controls, you have crafting and you have a good storyline, what more can you ask for? I personally think, the critics gave this game a low rating only because, it wasn't made by a triple AAA studio. This studio deserves your support and this RPG deserves your attention.			"

												I recommend this game if it's on sale only.This is a short story of a game with an interesting world that the game itself doesn't do much justice.  Uniteresting set pieces and a general everything is rust or mud color scheme take away from it, the morality system is broken but at least adds something to it to desperately try to make work.  The combat is fun when it works but as soon as their are more than 3 enemies or it's a large horde of those damned mole rats it tends to just go to♥♥♥♥♥♥until you throw a grenade.  The voice acting is tolerable but has it's atrocious moments and they don't have much in terms of awesome cosmetics.  You also get stuck with basically 1 crappy ranged weapon and pipes of sorts as the end game goal weapon to upgrade.   The side quests are easily missable in a few cases and don't clearly lay out when you can totally miss one, despite all this however I didn't completely hate my time in this game, it had a lot of potential and I enjoy the core concepts(more or less)  If you don't mind looking up quest info from time to time and the tedious loot and craft system that is manditory for success the game does satisfy for some reason and is worth picking this title up on sale.My friend owns this and Library shared it with me, I wasn't given a free copy by the developer or anything like that.

												Imagine walking into a house. 3 floors, 6 rooms, 3 baths. It's got a big game room on the bottom floor with a big screen TV, Pinball, and arcade. Fully furnished. Comes with a big pool and 6 cars in this really big mechanics-like garage. You go in the house, see all this stuff, and are in awe of the awesomeness of it all. But eventually you realize that everything is made out of cardboard. Yea, you can say you have all this stuff, but it doesn't work and it doesn't even look good in the house. Its just a really nice house with the idea of cool stuff in it. That's how I feel about this game.There's a really cool crafting system, but coupled with the really bad fighting makes it seem like a waste. I keep seeing tips about relationships with your partner, but I never saw this in game. You can't level up your partner, can't give them better equipment, can't give them weapons, nor can you even heal them in battle. They give you the ability to give commands, but its bare commands like ""attack the closest"" or ""attack who I'm attacking."" All really good ideas, but none of it actually works.The story is a really nice idea, but it feels off. I realized at the beginning that I shouldn't expect much though. When a game doesn't take the time to name a pretty promient character shows the lack of shine on the story. When the game starts you fight ""the fat guy"" in a prison who's so well known in the prison that he has been giving everyone trouble for a long time. Yet the character has no real name. Every one just says, oh I heard you took out ""the fat guy.""The fighting system in the game, is also lacking. The ""magic"" isn't very good, and the fighting style isn't polished. It reminded me of the way Arkham games do fighting, except there's no flow to the fights. It's like they said 'here's what we want, and we'll put in the basics, then go back and fix it up'. But then never went back and tried to fix it. All in all the game was, lacking. It's a good idea, but that's about all.			"

												I've seen other reviews for this game stating that the creators of Mars: War Logs wanted it to be Mass Effect-like and then continue reviewing it on based this comparison. I don't find it to be entirely justified and seeing Mass Effect elements in it seems to me like more of wishful thinking than actual intent of the creators, and I don't find it's fair comparing it to ME anyway. It's important to note that some M:WL-s faults can be written off as results of budgetary constraints, however, some of them do stem from flat out bad writing, design and editing. Once you get over the fact that you want to give the small studio an A for effort and look at it for what it is, the game has a couple of highlights, but in general it's less-than-half-way there, I'm sad to say.Pros: + Combat. The combat system is the sole shining gem in this game. My small complaint would be that I found that the difficulty varies weirdly in between combat sequences, being very easy at one point and maddeningly challenging the next. There was far more of the latter than the former, however, so I'll chalk it up as a plus. + Story and the overall idea. This is a weird one, I know, considering that it was half-way there (the other half will be in the 'cons'), but the half that was there I found enjoyable and I liked where the creators were going with the idea. IGN picked on the naming of the characters, but I found it to be a rather original bit, I just wish it was explained a little more thoroughly. + Skill tree. It's not as expansive as some of the bigger RPGs' (obviously), but it holds its own and is decently thought-out. Cons that I can forgive, because they can be explained by the small budget: - Voice acting. Not even average. It's actually laughably horrible. - Facial animation. It just falls flat. - UI. Very clumsy, making the crafting system a bit awkward. Cons that I can't necessarily write off as resulting from budgetary issues: - Cutscenes. They're sometimes framed and edited really badly, cutting out half of characters' faces. I'll take it back if I somehow find out that it was intentional, but it didn't feel like it. - Backstories. This is the other half that I didn't like as much. The game did a poor job explaining the background of the setting, the missions and the characters, leading to quite a bit of confusion and overall feelings of ""meeh."" - Unnecessary combat. Tying in with the previous point, the game just kept throwing in gangs of some sort in the streets for you to fight for absolutely no apparent reason. I feel like there should have been either an explanation or less such generated gangs. - Unnecessary doors, walls, hatches. Considering that there weren't any loading screens between the smaller sections of the maps, I fail to see the point in having to climb walls and open doors for each tiny section of the map. And I seriously mean tiny. It's like the studio thought that letting you walk 10 uninterrupted meters is boring, so they put a wall in the middle of it for you to climb, because **** you, that's why. I understand the impulse of wanting to give this game a break, because it's a small studio and for the tiny budget they had, they did a fairly good job. However - as I mentioned earlier - once you get over the feelings of pity and wanting to give it an A for effort, it's really not that good of a game. From what I've seen, most positive reviews for this game come from grading it on the budgetary curve, but there are some people out there who seem to legitimately enjoy this game. I would still mark it ""recommended"" for the purposes of trying it out yourself and making up your own mind. But under no circumstances should you buy this at full price. 4/10			"

												Mars: War Logs is one of the games which you wish were made a bit better so you could love them. While this game delivered great story and a few interesting characters, the game's environment is very empty. Not only the envorinment, but the combat system is not fun. While the developers tried to implent epic storyline, maybe they should have tried adding some entertaining things into the game. Perhaps add some fun sidequests, secrets, or a better RPG loot system so you can get stronger weapons by grinding. However the developers did make a nice game. It runs very well on low end machines while still looks astonishing. A positive review for their efforts isn't too much.			"

												My first ever review, and for a game that didn't exactly blow anyone's socks off. But, you know what, this was fun. I bought it cheap, played it for 10 hours and made every penny back. Interesting story, engaging lore, awful fighting that can easily be won just by having  A LOT of nails for the gun (only worked this out by Act 3) and some really difficult choices mid way and towards the end of the game. If it's in the sale I would pick it up. Final thought, I think I'll go and try out some of the other Spiders titles now...is Technomancer any good?			"

												I bought this game relatively cheap on sale (I would recommend you do too!) and to be frank, for what I paid I got quite the package of a game.The game starts with some weirdly named characters in a prison camp on a Mars colony. In what I thought (from what I saw from the previews) was a simple hack then dodge, then dodge, then dodge again game I was slightly mistaken. Yes there is dodging, however there is a point to it. The storyline behind the game is an interesting one as you slowly discover what's going on around you and at this Mars prison camp. Gameplay is as follows, 3rd person view with the ability to use a variety of weapons from a pipe tube, to a nail gun, to landmine explosives, to throwing sand in someones eye, to throwing grenades etc... Having options in any game is good and in this one you are able to buy a variety of weapons. My personal favorite is throwing sand at people as the only game I remember being able to do that is Assassins Creed ( which I never used it in ). Anyway besides having a multitude of things to choose from, the game play is somewhat consistent as multiple weapons provide for different tactics, and of course different opponents need different sort of lovin'. Visual graphics are stunning and are probably as top line as you can get for 2014. Although the graphics are cool at first it seems the game has some frame issues but just may be my computer, but that just may be the way the game is. At first glance it's noticeable but as the game goes on it becomes negligible. Now... what do I give a game that seems like people cared for it - but all the while keeping in mind something like this has been done before? An average rating for an average game to be blunt. Some will enjoy playing it, others won't. I'd give it a higher rating if there were objects in game that could be picked up and used randomly.RATING : 7.0/10Gameplay B- Story / Campaign B- Visuals / User Interface B Sounds / Music B- Replay-ability C+ Overall  B-*note, some parts are ridiculously meticulous and require some serious fire power. Going in with a metal rod ain't going to cut taking on a few enemies at a time.			"

												A couple things that are important to know before buying this game:-the story caters to a mature audience, younger you are, less likely for you to enjoy the story.-game is difficult and requires skill, attention to detail, spatial awareness, fast decision making and planning.What really makes this game stand out is the exceptional combat system, the unique setting and the story.The story branches heavily so in order to understand it and get the whole picture you will have to play it at least twice.The combat is hard and can be frustrating, hence the amount of hate this game got.Once you get into the combat, it becomes really addictive and i found myself playing this game over and over mostly for the combat despite its exceptional story.There are choices, lots of them, and they make a difference, another reason i played this game several times.The graphics.....technically they are nothing to write home about, but artistically they are excellent, the world this game depicts is alive and fascinating.The story is in a class of its own, reminds me of Graham Greene novels.Problem is, the story is not shoved in your face, so if you dont pay attention or dont care, you wont even notice there is a story or that character personalities have depth.Hint: if you think technomancer Sean is a bad person, Roy is a good person and Mary cares for Roy...well...play the game again and pay more attention this time.This game doesnt boast high production values or the Hollywood flavored drama found in popular games, but it does have a heart and a soul.Its not a cheap indie game, its a game made with love and passion, and a lot of effort was put into it.Its not for everyone but its one of my all time faves and i recommend it as a good quality game.

												3rd person, action, RPG with melee combat.You play as a Technomancer, a gifted individuals who are forced to go through hard training to master their force talents. Story takes place on planet called Mars, in time of war and poverty that followed soon after the colonization. Story is about different groups of people fighting for control over the land and resources.RPG element includes three character skill trees, perk system, weapon and armor modification and crafting of support, utility items (like medkits, explosives, etc.). You have a variety of abilities available, some allow you to enchant weapons, others protect you from damage like electric shield, some do damage or stun enemies like arc lightning shock, etc.You mainly use melee weapons, like metal pipes modified with different attachments you make with metal scraps and hardware found throughout the game. Ranged combat is really limited to one shot nail guns, grenades or Technomancer electric abilities. You can craft and place traps, that are useful if you're surrounded by enemies.There's decent amount of missions and side missions available, some have choice and effect element, so pick your answers wisely. Good amount of voiced dialogues. Reputation system in game was a bit weird, I didn't change from Neutral all game, though I didn't do anything bad, nor did I juice the downed enemies. Main currency in the game is pretty much human blood, as far as I understand, and was kind of weird.You can have followers in game, five in total, two of those can be chosen by joining one or other group of people, one is partially available and two are available pretty much throughout the whole game. Two males and three females as far as I could tell. You can romance females, if someone wondering, though there's nothing special, just hugging and groping. Visually game looks poorly, a lot of low resolution textures for 2013 game, model quality is bad, animations are poor, voice over quality is decent. Game has a lot of glitches, texture clipping, hovering objects, bad lighting and other sort of things that could be fixed in post-production.Overall game was fun experience, but lacked serious polish. Some missions were hilarious, I also liked typos in text that made no sense, and weird naming for drugs and nurses advice for cutting someone's jewels off. Don't know if it was intended, but apparently you can bed both female followers and then chose which one you like more.			"

												Well, after finishing this game on Normal difficulty, I'd say that the overall review score is accurate. The game's fun and it has a good story. The game also splits into two at the halfpoint and due to that I'll definitely go another run.Right, so the game itself. The combat is clunky, but surprisingly fun and fluid. All of the animations somehow fit. The clunkyness is what gives it charm a lot of the time.The story is interesting, but the lore is... well, unexplained and just overall pretty boring if you go into detail. The first chapter is definitely the highlight of the game, with the second one being pretty decent, but a bit too long, while chapter 3 is weak, but at least short. The graphics look nice enough, very similar to Red Faction Guerrilla, which is good, considering that you're on Mars. All of the characters (except for one) look very similar and due to the naming of the characters being just plain attributes like ""Tenacity"" and ""Innocence"", it's hard to distinguish the characters. The game has achievements that are pretty easy to do, if you're ready to play the game twice for different paths and one of them has to be the highest difficulty as well. So... is this game worth a buy? For the full price, no. But there isn't really any game out there that I'd buy for full price, so take that as you will. I'd definitely recommend it during a sale though.Overall7/10(All games start at a 5/10 and get their score raised/lowered due to the pros/cons)And from me, a happy 9/11 to everyone!			"

Quite a few people complained about the repetitious fighting, but I thought it all made sense.  There was no fast travel going back and forth between one place and another, but except for maybe twice in the whole game, I didn't think it was anything really annoying.  I thought the whole thing made sense.  I enjoyed the character development, and the story had some twists that really kicked.  Overall, GREAT job, I thoroughly enjoyed the ride.			"

												This isn't a terrible game, and the premise is pretty cool. Mars: War Logs does some things very right, but does far more wrong.The combat is clunky, with weird difficulty spikes. I didn't manage to pull off a single parry the entire game, though that was supposed to be a core combat mechanism. The voice acting is pretty good, but the dialogue is lough out loud terrible.  There are times that I can't even follow conversations because they don't make sense. (And to make it worse, the captions are often wrong.) The dialogue is so poorly put together that it ruins what would be a really interesting (if not wildly inventive) plot.All that being said, it was enough fun for me to play all the way through and there were only a couple points when the flaws made the experience actually unpleasant. If you can pick it up for a few bucks on sale, it's worth the 15 hours it takes to do a thorough playthrough.			"

												For a 15 dollar game, this seems about right. It's not AAA material, but it tells its story. There are plenty of technical issues to take wih the game, but again, for a budget game, you get what you pay for.The writing is heavily thematic and sometimes a little predictable. In a way, this game reminds me of a grittier, darker, knights of the old republic, but don't expect KotOR's polish. The main draw here is the world building and story. You have to look past the imperfections of the game to appreciate this, but it's definetly there.For the money, I'd absolutely recommend it, and I am looking forward to The Technomancer.			"

												Nice little indie game that's surprisingly fun, if you adjust your expectation level. Combat is adrenaline filled, requires active dodge and parry--very much like Witcher 2--and you can pause, well not totally pause it but slow time to a crawl, if you've played Witcher 2 you know what you are expecting. The combat also feels akin to Kingdom of Amalur and Game of Thrones RPG (which is jointly developed by Spider Studios i believe). Crafting is rewarding and simple: almost every weapon can be improvised using various material you've looted or recycled from other trash equipments, and upgrades not only give a variety of customizable stats bonus of your choice, but also modify the look of the gears significantly.The plot and setup of the game is sort of refreshing--like Red Faction games, tossing in some Fallout's apocalyptic lo-tech touch. Only problem is the Dev's budget is low, so even though the graphic is alright, it's nothing special or impressive. This reminds me of Alpha Protocol, which resembles the look and feel of this game (only the levels in Saudi of course).If you like:--Witcher--Alpha Protocol--Red Faction--Fallout--Kingdom of Amalur--Game of Thrones RPGthink you can give it a go. Only takes roughly 20 hours to complete. Not a bad RPG game.			"

												I'm happy that i decided to try out this game, although it had mixed reviews.I recommend this game, as i wasn't bored with it at all during my playtime. This game is pretty much a standard action rpg, designed with consoles in mind. Story is pretty nice, characters are interesting, but the setting is great. I really loved the brown, postapocalyptic Mars landscapes. You have customization of your weapon/armor, you can craft various things and advance your skills in three trees (pretty much stealth, craft / melee / magic). The game itself is pretty linear, there is no open world, and most of the locations are narrow, so if you expect open world gameplay, pass on the game.What i really loved is the amount of time the playthrough takes: 15 hours. It is ideal in my opinion, the game does not get boring and does not end too quickly.The game is not ideal at all, as every aspect of it lacks something (limited options of crafting, skills, choices etc.), but it does not make it a bad game.So, if you don't like corridor like levels, lack of open world and a bit limited options, pass on the game.However, if you don't mind these things, want a game that will take you about 15 hours and love the setting, try it out, i recommend it.

												Having just finished everything there is to do in this game, I can safely say that it's absolutely terrible. Don't waste your time or money on it like I did.Normally I'd say that bad gameplay can be made up for by a good story, but in this case both are equally abysmal. Fighting largely consists of kiting enemies around for long amounts of time waiting for your health to regen so you can risk getting another hit in. This is exacerbated by the fact that any ability other than melee is worthless. For example, by my count there are about 100 total nailgun ammo shots that you can pickup throughout the entire campaign (and it's the only gun) but it would take about 20 shots to actually kill a single enemy. The other abilities are similarly worthless. Fighting becomes a chore best avoided, and you can't respec your abilities, so if you commit to one that doesn't apply - e.g. you have points in stealth when a big battle is forced upon you - you can be screwed and have to replay a checkpoint for hours until you get lucky enough to edge by. The NPC's also die in just a couple hits, so there's no help. It's like they didn't try to balance this game at all. Or worse, they purposefully didn't want anyone to have fun playing it.The story isn't even worth mentioning. The writing, the voice acting, everything is just at the worst caliber imagineable.Even mediocre RPG's or third person action games are better than this. I'm baffled at how it got funded and made.

												Mars: War Logs is such a difficult game to review. On the one hand, I loved it with every fibre of my being, I was constantly reminded of when I was 11 or 12 years old playing KOTOR for the seventeeth time, the awe of playing a game that really, genuinely lived up to the promise of what a game could be, another world, a world that felt as real, or more so, than my own. The graphics are about on par with KOTOR, now that I think about it. But despite such promise, this game is not KOTOR. It is unpolished, hard to look at, and ends far too soon. The setting is probably the best part, a Mars torn by war over her most precious resource, water and split between humans and mutants used by the humans as slaves. We start the game a prisoner of war, and this prison camp is perhaps the most interesting area of the game, where we have to fight former allies and befriend former enemies in order to escape. Shortly after escaping, we arrive in a generic sci-fi lite city, whose corridors are no less restricting than those of the prison camp we so recently extricated ourselves from. This reveals a major shortcoming of the game, which is the level design, made up of corridor after corridor of cookie cutter enemies, and the game never comes close to achieving the scale the story needed. Another problem affecting the game is the voice acting, which though it has supposedly been upgraded from its launch state, is still in a dearly sore state, with voice actor's deliveries ranging from flat to... flatter. One sometimes wonders if the voice actor's  hired were actually fluent in the language spoken. And this is especially dissapointing because of how much dialogue there is in the game, you can easily spend around a third or so of the game listening to your companions or other NPC's and it can be grating to listen to sometimes. This is especially dissapointing because the written dialogue really isn't terrible so much as it is unsubtle, and at some points, at least before the dreadful third act, even good. While we're on the subject of story, it might be pertinent to mention that there are several companions you have the option to ""romance"", with all of these pairing being strictly heterosexual, and in addition, two of these companions are hidden behind specific story paths. All this really amounts to is some extra dialogue, and eventually, a ""sex scene"" between you and your partner.Combat is another area where the game lacks quite a bit, with heavily Witcher inspired hacking and slashing dominated by the tactical nuance of hitting a button over and over, and occasionaly hitting another button to break things up. Most enemies only need running up to and hitting over and over while the occasional enemy requires that you flank them and hit them, over and over. The only challenge comes in the early game, when you don't have a gun, and you can be easily overwhelmed by enemies ganging up on you. But after getting a gun, the game becomes a cakewalk, with the action devolving to a couple seconds of clicking and then an eternal sleep. Or not. The game early on introduces, a.... weird game mechanic, wherein after you mercilessly pummel and shoot your enemies, they don't actually die but merely fall unconscious and you have the choice to either drain their veins for extra currency and incur a penalty to your morality, or leave them flailing there, presumably to later get up and go home crying to their mommies. The morality system is a minor part of the game overall, with going evil giving you a general combat bonus and staying a goody two-shoes eventually leading to merchants giving you a massive discount, not that you'll ever really need it.I'll be honest, this review has probably seemed fairly negative, and for good reason, but the game has such ambition, is such a unique experience, that if you remember KOTOR, or well... KOTOR fondly, I really think you should give it a shot, sale price or no. I can't imagine very many others liking it as well as I did, but hey, most of the other reviews seem positive right, so who knows?			"

												Recommend with caveat: sale only (I picked it up for $4.99, Fall sale 2013)I normally play games on hard skill level - after the first chapter, I gave up (thankfully, the devs included difficulty switching mid-game).  Hard difficulty meant rolling around on the ground for minutes while getting an occasional hit in with melee weapons.  I just wanted to stop playing altogether.  Reducing to easy difficulty made the game playable (albeit a bit too easy), and some fun was had.  There is a monetary system of sorts, but no incentive to sell items.  Nothing available to buy with the cash you could get that you wont find laying around/be given for completing quests.I read reviews from console players gushing over the graphical qualities; the visuals were nothing more than ordinary.  DOOM3 on the PC made me fell as if I were on another planet; Mars: War Logs takes place under a damaged metal umbrella, ostensibly on ""Mars"".  You never see the alien landscape.  You could be in BombayThe voice acting and cut scenes are extensive, but with subtitles you can (right click) skip through the scenes as fast as you can read the lines.I can say I got five bux worth of net entertainment value as a B-grade Space RPG, so I am recommending			"

												Like all RPGs by Spiders Studios, you will at first be impressed with how good it looks for a title by such a small company.  After you play it, you will realize that that is really all it has going for it.While it does do a good job of getting you interested in the story, it seems to quickly lose focus of said story and then make you feel like you're just being dragged along.  My other huge complaint is the combat which is really just the same repetitive scenario over and over again where you get attacked by several mobs, blind one, counter the attack of the next, beat on the third, run from any others and slowly kill off a group one at a time.  That or find the infinite serum exploit unintentionally and use it to craft a ton of grenades and breeze through the game.  They say the reputation makes a difference but it honestly has such a tiny impact on it that you might as well just go good for the store discount.Pros:Looks good at firstStory-drivenUpgrading armor and weapons changes their appearanceCons:Boring and repetitive combatStealth is almost worthlessStory falls apartCrafting is very very limitedOne gun in the whole game with no upgradesAll enemies behave identically.

												Fairly entertaining game. Being older and indie it won't wow you with the graphic fidelity, but it does have a decent story and interesting skill progression. I really liked that they didn't go with ""Good"" vs ""Evil"" but two differing but equally questionable shades of gray. Gear customization was pretty good, but the overall variety of gear was a bit lacking. The fight system isn't too bad, it's nice that its more involved than ""hold block and click attack occasionally"" but at the same time it's not animation interrupt level fighter complex either. Overall I'd easily give it 3.75 stars out of 5 with the camera INI tweaks from the forums. Without the camera tweaks it's damn near unplayable.			"

												Apart from the poor pacing and narrative structure, Mars: War Logs is an exploration of how lifeless you can make an RPG whilst using a decent-looking graphics engine. It’s almost funny, given that solid combat mechanics, decent visuals, and creative and interesting lore should give us something substantial to play with – it’s better than a lot of games do nowdays, right? But it’s the little things like the fact that NPCs are placed at either the bottom or top of every staircase (in the same pose) to stop you from being nosy if you have the audacity to try and interact with the world, or that the dialogue options as they are written don’t match the dialogue that is it spoken – in either text or tone, or that the first two characters we see are two NPCs that use almost the exact same character model, sitting next to one another and performing the exact same looped movement, synchronised perfectly. These things break any immersion the graphical fidelity serves up and leave the game feeling really half-baked. Not to mention the down-right awful voice acting in parts. “Sorry the dog attacked you, really…” is read as “Sorry. The dog attacked you? Really.” Who, in 2013, was overseeing the development of a game where such obvious issues are overlooked or left uncorrected? And what kind of society are we if we let these basic things wash over us in favour of ‘pretty 1080p widescreen’ and a ‘smooth feeling fight’?Really this all makes me seem more angry than I was when playing the game - I was mainly just frustrated by the multitude of basic core issues. The game's NOT a piece of crap! It's just average or sub-par in a lot of immediately evident ways. Mars: War Logs seems like it’s trying to be the love child of Mass Effect and Red Faction, but it’s as if the developers thought that the key to the success of an RPG is that ‘they’re set in a far-away place and you get to fight things’, rather than the IMMERSION that the RPG genre is famous for, and the reason that it was created in the first place.

												I got this game in a cheap humble bundle and I was pleasantly surprised by it.  I wasn't expecting too much with the 59 meta score the game had as well as 1 out of 3 reviews being negative but I have to say this game is somewhat underrated.  The environments make you feel like you are stuck on crappy mars and some areas have that cyber punk kind of feel.  One thing I like is that the minimap does a goodjob of displaying where important people are, where to go to persue certain missions and the best route to get there.  The game has many side missions and you will probably want to do them all.  Another cool thing is that your decisions matter in this game, whether its picking a side that will determine 1 of 2 possible endings, picking which female you want to be your lover, deciding who lives or dies, having a good reputation or a bad reputation which can affect store prices and even open up more possible side quests.  Combat is in real time and it may take a bit to get used to.  I think the game does a decent job of making the combat somewhat challenging but not too hard.  This game is on the shorter side for a rpg unless you want to play through the game again and make different decisions which leads to a different storyline and ending.Even though there are 3 skill trees, at times combat may feel kind of repetitive.  Also, its kind of hard to prevent your npc allies from dying often.  Sometimes the camera angle sucks and some enemy will hit you  from the back and you won't really have time to react to it.  Sometimes the dialogue doesn't match the text at the bottom, but that is usually pretty rare.  The game probably could have added a few more enemy types as well.  Some of the characters in cities kind of look similar after awhile.  Regardless of some of these cons I just mentioned, this was a fun game for the most part I would recommend it if you can get it fairly cheap.			"

												I spent almost 2 years contemplating buying this game. I finally did due to the Christmas Sale. Having completed this game, I understand entirely why reviews on this game, along with all of Spiders games are so mixed. There is a lot of good stuff here. Spider really nails the world building here, they establish their setting with expert command. the graphics are decent, the sound design is adequate, and the voice work is about 50/50 throughout the game. But that is the story of this developer isn't it? 50/50. The main flaws of this game boil down to mechanical issues. The Companion characters are utterly worthless in combat situations, the combat animations are clunky and akward, and the dodging and blocking does not always function flawlessly. The Stealth system is not good, and could use a serious overhaul. I did every nice guy thing I could think of, and never once raised my reputation above Neutral. I've no idea how to raise it, I overall enjoyed my time with this game, and will actually probably replay it again in the future, with that said as has been stated numerous times, some tlc and polish would go a long way. I recommend this game with a caveot. Buy this only if you can tolerate janky gameplay like myself. I played the game on Easy due to all the complaints, and I was able to tolerate the system as is. I've played worse combat systems than this by far, but there is no denying that this is not the best. Beyond the combat I have very few complaints about this title, mostly nit-picky things like spelling and level design choices.			"

												Quick Review. Great game for the price, especially for a indy RPG title. Don't expect anything outstanding as a triple AAA RPG such as Mass Effect which most have compared this to. For what it is, it delievers and I am happy to have played through this game. I didn't trust it, and only got it due to Humble Bundle low tier. I am happy to say I was mistaken.The story and environment itself is the selling point here more than anything. You will love it or hate it. Personally it sat well with me. Small things however do make this a lower than Triple AAA title which I hope will be fixed for the sequel.1. Mouth animation. What the hell, I can't be the only person to notice this. In sub quests it is god awful and some time in the main quest itself. It isn't game breaking, but it is irritating if you ontinue to stare directly at it. 2. Odd pacing. The monsters you face in the earlier levels that make a return later briefly IMO are the hardest thing in the game next to enemy swarm. To place them so early, and to have so many made you really have to build supplies early. Once you built supplies for this said area you are pretty prepared to coast through most of the game as long as you visit shops and stay on your toes in large groups. Which I don't mind but the you can't do it one way then jump to the other it is unsettling. At least to me.3. Have more of your dialogue options actually have outcomes that effect more often. This is a common complaint to any multi-dialogue or choice option RPG but with the small environment given it missed the chance to really stand out and go above and beyond other titles in the genre.4. Tedious enemies. This isn't something I mind as much, but others might. Over halfway through the game aside the casual boss whom has played the same as normal enmies you will encounter 5 enemy types....5. So if you don't like the linear beat-em-up RPG style or are loving the story. This could be very concerning.With the price it is right now however, and the story aspects being above par the generic RPG IMO. This is a good title to buy and play through on a weekend. Or maybe even a bit more if you tend to play less hours in a game day. Hopefully more see and enjoy this title.I hope and expect great things for the sequel now that they are getting a larger budget, and will be getting it.			"

												There's a lot of promise that isn't quite cashed in, but it's a pretty all right game and I had fun with it.The good:It's enjoyable, short enough to easily play over a long weekend (not much more than ~10 hours from start to finish, and I'd say that's a pretty good length), and has some replayability.The mechanics are solid, and generally work without issue or fanfair.The visual aesthetic is consisteny, and I think it suits the game's overall feel quite nicely.The world and backstory to the game--what little you can get from playing it--are great, and I really wish there were more of that.  The story is serviceable--interesting enough to keep your attention, but it doesn't exactly blow your mind.The bad: There's almost no variation between areas visually or mechanically, which isn't too big of an issue due to the length of the game, but is very noticeable.Combat gets tedious, since while the mechanics are solid, it often gets repetitive and you only ever fight five real enemy types through the whole game--and one of them quite rarely.  This isn't helped by the fact that some often-traversed areas have respawning enemies, which makes traveling around somewhat of a chore, since you do the exact same fights over and over again.The characters generally feel underdeveloped and oddly-written, and the voice acting for a few characters feels a bit weird (but this is generally not a problem, and Tenacity's voice acting is as good as anything you'd see in other games, all things considered).While the backstory and world of the game seem very interesting, very little information about them is ever given to the player.  I ended up with questions at the end of the game that I really wanted answered, and I really want to see more fleshing out of this world.  What's there is great, but it's very sparse.The tutorial seems to leave a lot of things out, and a few things regarding the control scheme are completely unclear.  Namely, how to unlock from targets in combat--I couldn't figure this out, so I just stopped using the lock-on all together.Overall: It's definitely not a BAD game.  But it's also not a great game.  It's definitely not a game to actively avoid (if it's on sale for a few bucks, I'd go ahead and recommend it full-heartedly), but I wouldn't say you should go too far out of your way for it.  It has a lot of promise but never quite cashes in on it, and I would absolutely love to see another game set in the same world that goes into much more detail about the world itself.I'm going to click the ""recommend"" button because I did, at the end of the day, have fun playing Mars: War Logs.  Not the most fun ever, but enough to justify the time I spent on it.  It's probably a perfect 5/10 or 6/10--average, functional, and entertaining enough.			"

												The game runs smoothly, does not bug, nor do I experience screen tear or lag. That's a big plus because technically, its well coded.The plot is decently interesting as a whole with little loop holes but do not provide any gripping turning points or decisions that most enjoyable plots have.My criticism with the game is mostly design related, because they feel redundant, unbalanced, trivial, or unrelated, all of which hurt mainly because it breaks immersion;1) Why did the company put in a reputation/karma system but make it that the only thing that gives you 'bad' karma is finishing off an opponent? No one in that universe considers sparing enemies you beat within an inch of their lives in self defense to be chivalrious. Actually, using excessive force stopping short of murder is also not really chivalrious in reality either. You can argue that being a♥♥♥♥♥♥to a fragile sexually abused girl or insulting a nurse who's son is a drug addict is bound to give you ♥♥♥♥♥♥ reputation, but meh, not really. And then there's the lack of redemption. Reputations can improve or recover, but in this game it can't.Also, the premise is that Mars is an unforgiving and dangerous place, right? It's not strange to protect yourself by finishing off an enemy that just tried to kill your life, because it's likely they'll come after you once they're on their feet again. So, is it immersive to be a ""bad"" person because of it? Maybe in reality, but not on Mars (in tandem with the rest of the story).2) What's the point of making money if it's so easy to find parts for crafting, and items are so cheap in the store? The economy is very unbalanced in that if you loot the containers you come across and clean up the enemies' drops, you will have everything you need to craft everything you need. Even if you didn't bother looting everything, you're so rich or things are so cheap that money is not at all valuable. (But at the same time, lore-wise, 5 serums (less than a piece of scrap metal sold in a store) is the equivalent worth of a person's life).3) The game is very short for the plot-line covered. This is the feeling I get watching the latest season of Game of Thrones, where the bad guy or whoever dies shortly after their character is developed (barely) enough for the audience to care and feel bad about. Case in point, the big bad and the dragon (tvtropes) have their differences and politics games in the back but the audience can't relate until the last cutscene of the game. There's a lot of intrigue that technically occured throughout the plot but the dialogue is so shallow, it's hard to really appreciate it fully.4) The side-quests occur pretty much in tandem with the main quest location and wtvr else -wise, and don't require extra effort to seek, do, fight, etc. All side-quests occur along the paths of the main quest anyway so by completing the main quest, you finish could its contents simply by talking to npc's you happen across. That's not entirely a ""side"" quest. Most of them got nothing to do with the plot. Why am I looking for counterfeit coins again? Overall, it's worth the $1 I paid it for on Humbl Bundle.			"

												I have to admit I love this game - admittedly at the time of writing I'm only 6 hours in and maybe my opinion will change? Unlikely, but I'll update accordingly - Maybe I'm easily pleased or have a greater tolerance of something a wee bit different? Who knows, but quite frankly for a £10 it sate's all my story telling and RPG nuances with very little issues. I've been electronically/computer gaming in some form or another for 38yrs (grandstand console to a mid range PC) and owned and played some of the considered classic's; Fallout, System shock, baldersgate, deus Ex and far to many more to mention. So arguable I've learnt a thing or two in respect to what I like and possibly what makes a classic tick? However all of this is subjective and has very little bearing on what someone will actually enjoy! ;-) I get it's not everyone's cup of tea. Hardcore rpg'ers and gamers in general tend to reasonably inflexible due to, lets be honest, pseudo high standards, but that's nothing new, so this game won't impress on soooo many different levels if you have this mind set. However if you're looking to play something a wee bit different that has a pleasent, yet simple mechanics, and has that good '80s/90's B movie feel about it - you know how hungry you feel after a skin full and are looking for that moorish comfort food. Chippy anyone? - you'll know what I mean and thoroughly enjoy this wee♥♥♥♥♥bitFor me this is a diamond in the rough. With that in mind, if this review (6 hours in) is some help in anyway I'm happy to oblige. If not? Fair game ;-) "

												Mars Logs ReviewB-Budget Mad Max/Mass Effect Weird BabyTL;DR at bottom.Interesting beginning, follows another character rather than the MC. Tells a realistic, dirty life of a foot solider that can be related to in our world.Story/Dialogue: Story started out strong. Dialogue is can be a bit wonky, but its wonkiness can be refreshing compared to AAA by the book dialogue we are used to. One negative though is that some dialogue was written, yet not voice overed, makes the game look more budgety than it should. There is character relationship development lite. Mass Effect kind, but a very lite version of it. So yes you can sex your companions. Overall the storyline was average, the world created was somewhat unique. Plot twists were somewhat weak and predictable. Combat/Gameplay: Combat at first felt very fluid. That continued to the end. New combat elements were introduced but overall combat still was not complicated. Slight RNG in combat made it more interesting. I believe this combat system for an melee action RPG is one of the best I've played yet. The system of 'wounding' and 'stunning and the RNG makes for less scripted combat and more reactionary one. RPG Elements: Quests interweave with one another, if you help one character it might unlock a dialogue option for another. There are multiple ways to complete quests, some locked by other quests. In example there is a character that you can convince to help escape in different ways, with different outcomes for each. The tricky part is you do not know which is the best way, and some of the ways they might not survive at all. Makes for a deeper and more unknown decision making process that you won't know the consequences of your actions until later, very good system. Talent tree focuses on three different fighting styles, ala warrior/rogue/mage. But any good playthrough a player will dabble in all trees to get the strongest talents, which are a must, otherwise combat can be quite challenging as some other newbies on the reviews cry about the combat difficulty. Audio/Graphics: Audio was pretty standard, graphics  were suprising decently done for a BBBbudget game.  Enviornments were reptitive though.The enemy models and combat effects looked nice. Animations were fluid.Overall/End: A decent B-Budget game. Really an unknown game at the bottom of RPG barrel. Beat it in 20 somethin hours. Looking forward to playing Sequel. (The Technomancer) Graphics and some models were repetitive. Combat was the best aspect. Storyline was alright. I would reccomend it if you plan on The Technomancer.Verdict:7/10			"

												I bought this game a few years ago, tried it for a few minutes, then put it away again. I think it was because in the first couple of conversations the same character had two different voice actors doing different lines. Roll on a few years later and I thought I'd clear the backlog. Tried to continue my previous game - where I'd done nothing but beat up the fat man - and somehow I was transported to the Epilogue for the Resistance path. Free achivement! Rather wierd.Started a new game and was pleased to see the voice stuff was resolved. I'm sure I remember it being bad, maybe I am thinking of another game. Or maybe it was fixed who knows.Anyhoo, this is a pleasent RPG. It's not ground breaking, and suffers from being a 3D game that is strangely 2D (for example no paths cross each other at other levels), and it's far too fond of little invisible walls that stop you going into doorways and so on. And you can't jump.Graphically, it's not the best you'll ever see, but it does a nice enough job of depiciting a ramshackle Mars. In fact, the thing that annoyed me most was that you couldn't look up properly, so when you encounter giant cranes, towers and shields over the settlements you can't actually get a good look at them.Voice acting was great, and the audio wasn't bad overall.Storywise, it's a decent story, with a few marring jolts here and theres. There's plenty of side quests in addition to the main quest. The levels are fairly small, and quite linear.I liked the crafting system.Combat was fairly dull and it annoyed me that enemies respawned, although I did my usual non-kill policy. Next time I'll kill everything that moves and see if they still respawn.Overall, it was an enjoyable, if potentially forgettable, game, and I'm glad I went back to it.			"

Posted: October 5, 2014
												The Steam Christmas Sale will be coming up soon, so I thought I’d go and revisit some of the great games I’ve played in the past, as they’ll likely be coming up on sale again soon. And since I’ve had Technomancer on my Wishlist for what seems like forever, it’s glorious predecessor came to mind in, Mars: War Logs.Don't let the first half an hour of your experience with Mars: War Logs dictate your view of the game as a whole. It's pretty clear having finished the game now that the 13 year old intern with daddy issues wrote the script for the opening scenes, and fulfilled a lifelong dream of using every swear word he could dream up in his moment of glory as a developer. The rest of the game is superbly written in terms of plot and plot progression, and some of the moral choices this game forced me to make had me stressed and knocking back shots of hard liquor in anticipation of the outcomes they would generate. I can overlook many little things if a game can deliver this calibre of story and that tasty, tasty feeling of originality; It’s what I look for in and RPG, and it’s definitely what I got from Mars: War Logs. There are several points of divergence in the story, so before making any big decisions regarding joining factions, I highly recommend using individual saves so you can go back and experience them all if you don’t want to play through the early game more than once.The skill trees actually contain USEFUL skills, which is very nice for a change, and a lot of care has obviously been taken to only include things which will have a direct effect on gameplay. The only criticism I have is that if you wanted to specialise in Technomancy (and master every skill in the tree) you would have to bank your skill points for quite some time. This would drastically increase the difficulty of the game in the early stages because the story doesn't unlock that particular tree for some time, and then ends too soon for you to be able to generate enough points if you have spent them already. Perhaps this is intended as a lure to play the game through again? I am more inclined to think that it’s a slight oversight in the RPG/Storyline balance however, as the game certainly doesn’t feel like the story has been cut short to meet a deadline or anything like that. I rarely play caster-types anyway, and was having far too much fun beating up people’s dogs with a lead pipe to care about whether I could become mechano-Raiden. Melee combat in Mars: War Logs can be quite challenging (especially if you’re banking skill points), but has that satisfying feel of impact to it that all of us, even if it’s only subconsciously, look for in an RPG. Mars: War Logs also has a crafting system for weapons and armour, and it appears that Spiders have really thought about why it should be included, as they appear to have favoured crafting your own gear and upgrades to actual loot drops. Sounds logical right? But I can honestly say that I haven’t played many (if any) RPGs that have the balance so right when it comes to this aspect of their mechanics. It therefore becomes worthwhile, if not absolutely necessary, to collect all the bits and pieces you find buried in scrap piles throughout the map. I am also a massive fan of the way that gear is essentially made from junk, and retains that wonderful sense of poverty mixed with apocalypse.I’m assuming that because Spiders have done the bulk of their work for console, that the controls were designed primarily for controller use, but nothing was so far out of place that I couldn't adapt easily (and I am very stubborn about bindings). The only suggestion I would have made was that someone should have really considered how the game would play on Steam by making sprint, shift; and toggle map, tab. The levels aren't really big or detailed enough to warrant a giant map anyway, so possibly a classic action approach would have suited better? There is no colour. Post-war Mars is like the 1970’s version of Washington D.C in Fallout 3. If you can't handle lots of orange and brown, you will not have a great time. Despite that, there are some great (albeit obvious) screenshot-worthy vistas, and the environment is pretty much exactly what you would expect from a poverty-stricken alien planet. Being in control of the camera also nabbed me some funny selfies of Roy while he went about his dog-kicking and police-bashing. Mars: War Logs is a great example of a fresh, creative action story, and anyone who enjoys that will enjoy this. I have certainly paid a lot more for less in the past, and while it’s still on the pricey side at full price compared to games by the big publishers, it’s a definite thumbs up.			"

												Mars War Logs is a game that tries very hard to be appealing and pleasing. At the outset the story plot seems interesting and the introduction to the characters are equally intriguing. Even with the bad voice acting the premise of the game shows a lot of promise. That is about the extent of what is good about this game for Spiders' efforts. The biggest flaw with this game is in the combat itself. The method of combat is clunky and oftentimes buggy. Add to that sudden spikes in difficulty curves makes this bad style of gameplay nearly unbearable to deal with. Drops in Framerate giving the game lag, and leading to repeat deaths in the most random of areas makes this an unpleasant and unenjoyable adventure. At even 14.99 for the price point the game is not worth the cost. Wait for it to go on sale and be prepared for an uphill climb towards enjoyment.			"

												This is more of a 'thumbs in the middle review' since I can't pick it that option.The thumbs down is based on the full price of the product (14.99), I got this game on sale for $5 durning the summer sale.Pros:A good Mass Effect/Dragon's Age knock off type of game with a Sci Fi Mars theme.  I don't think I see many games based around Mars, with that, they did a decent job.Fast Pace CombatGood menu system overall for doing quests and such.Limited resources which makes the game feel challenging.Cons:The story was okay, but felt very rushed while a lot is explained it's own version (War Logs) of it's Codex; I feel the game should have explained this in a bit more detail.  Roy the main character of the story is still a mystery to me and a lot details wasn't revealed about him.  Wheather or not this was intentionally, he just felt empty of a character.As for other characters, except for the first character/party member Innocence everyone's story felt rushed.  Mary the other character is the only othjer one that didn't feel too rushed as her storyline was cut and dry.For other aspects of the story, it really felt rushed and while I could tell I was near the end, the final moments felt really anticlimatic.  Romance options are in this game but they too, are very rushed and other than a few dialog options, They're easily romance and don't build up to the point of snoo very well.  Wanna go out?  Sure? Ok that's that.Short game under 20 hours and VERY linear aside from a few side quests.Combat and such is cut and dry while there's a few tactical things you can do it's more near a button masher for most of the fights.  Sometimes hit detection wouldn't hit on enemies.Overall not a bad knock off of Mass Effect but there's a LOT of room for improvement.  If it's on sale it's an overall decent expereince.			"

												4/10 - the game is pretty lackluster, to linear and the combat was terrible, the storyline was lacking any suspensefulness, i think they only reason i played this was to see how it finished. crap ending, the only good thing about this game was the crafting of melee weapons and clothing, but it was limited to what you could craft and wear, the graphics and gameplay felt like i ws playing on a ps2 game or a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ version of a ps3 game. i enjoy adventure games but this one is in the♥♥♥♥♥♥pile for adventure games			"

												Gutes RPG mit Schwerpunkt auf der story. Wer sich gern dialoge durchliest und gefallen an der strukturierten storyline findet wird diese spiel mögen.Außerdem gibt es ein alternatives ende, weshalb es sich sehr lohnt es ein zweites mal durchzuspielen.Das kampfsystem ist allerdings sehr eintönig geraten. Zwar gibt es skillbäume, wo man verschiedene attacken lernt, doch meist bleibt es beim stumpfen drücken der linken maustaste.Insgesamt trotzdem noch ein kaufwürdiges spiel.			"

												I just finished playing through the game and found it to be overall an enjoyable experience.  It is a Spiders game so you should go into it knowing what you're getting.  If you were a fan of their other RPGs (Of Orcs and Men, Game Of Thrones, etc) then you'll probably be able to overlook the simple combat and weird mechanics.  The Mars setting is unique for a game of this type, and the game is overall competent enough.  The voice acting was terrible but that comes with the Spiders brand as well.  The story was decent and had a solid conclusion with two separate endings creating two different final chapters.  The world building and the Technomancer idea is unique enough that it's worth checking out but be aware the gameplay is a little janky.  Hopefully their followup ""Technomancer"" will fix some of the gameplay hiccups and give this universe the game it deserves.			"

												I got this specifically for it's campy value and voice acting. It certainly delivered there, but what I saw was a sad half-baked atempt at decent storytelling and rpg mechanics. I can't rightfully recommend this game because:1.It's just plain boring, little reason or motivation to do side quests2.you'll have your mini-map up the whole game because all the locations look exactly the same and they are confusing3.OPENING DOORS ARE SKIPPING THE ANIMATION EVERY 30 SECONDS4.1/3 of the way into the game and you literally have the best weapon and gear, it never improves.5.Extreme difficulty imbalance, you'll probably just want to play on easy to make it bareable.Don't get your♥♥♥♥♥to Mars.

												While not a spectacular RPG, Mars: War Logs is still able to introduce to us a different/interesting setting: How many Rpg's nowadays are set in Mars? The story is great and the lore as well and it's not forced upon you. You know what you want to know, that's something that i enjoy in these type of games. The combat it's a little bit wonky but it works, the customization and leveling system are done in a interesting way, i enjoy the fact that when you change something in your armor/weapon it shows a different plate or handle because of the changes you made to that object.I think the major issues of this game come from the low production costs that it had, you will see a lot of repeated NPC's with nothing to say, the voice acting sometimes is great sometimes not (for ♥♥♥♥ sake Mary...), the story ends in a abrupt way.But it has strong points as well for example the decisions you make will have a strong impact in the outcome of your playthrough and graphically i found the game for the most part well modelled with good lighting effects.Pick it up on a sale, but don't expect a massive world like Skyrim, or Mass Effect or even Dragon Age.It's a solid game.

												This game feels like it tries to be The Witcher 2 in space. It has very similar mechiancs, and a very similar combat system. While I can't say it succeeds, it's definitely very enjoyable.The graphics aren't very impressive, and Mars is very monotonous and boring to look at.The combat is fun and sometimes challenging, though since there are only a few different enemy types it gets repetitive fast.The voice acting on most characters is pretty bad, and the dialogues aren't very well written for the most part, but they do the job in telling the story. There is a companion romance option, but it's so badly written it feels like they put it in last minute just to make sure the game has a sex scene. ""Hey I like you"" - ""Oh I like you too, and now that we're finally alone with the entire crew watching, wanna f**k?"" TRUE LOVE.That being said, the story and the world are interesting and well crafted. A lot of thought was clearly put into the backstory, and I did feel intrigued to know what happens next at every point in the game.The RPG elements are all there, some better than others. There's also a morality system but its effect on the game is so tiny that it really doesn't matter if you're ""good"" or ""bad"" (i.e. if you're bad you get more money, but if you're good shops sell to you for less. Ends up exactly the same... and doesn't matter either way since there is no reason to buy anything in the shops anyway). There is a significant choice to make at the end of the 2nd act which does alter the story, and isn't as obvious as good/bad, so I did enjoy that one.I really like the weapon customising system. It was new and innovative - You start with a pipe or iron bar or something like that, and you craft it according to your will. Add a sharp piece at the top and you have an axe, put a brick there and it's a club. Put iron on the bottom if you want a hilt, or leather if you want a better grip.Overall this game reaches far and doesn't quite get there, but it's definitely worth the ride. Hell, if they ever make Mars: War Logs 2, I'll probably buy it as well.			"

												first thing i noticed when I played the game was how tanky the movement felt, like trying to make a cube roll before you character actually started moving. but that didn't take out my hype for the game. sadly as i went on and on in the game i started feeling a little ""tired"" of playing it.The COMBAT -is not great, it was mostly furstrating on my part since counter attacks or parry seem to be a bit un polished, that and after a certain number of hits the NPC get a huge amount of invisibility frames even tho you can be heavily outnumbered with a worthless companion. you can die from around 3 hits or 4 and you will be simply stun locked to death. until you can upgrade your armor  and get some good weapons and a decent companion. then the combat is actually enjoyable but repetitive after a while.Quests - Quests made me feel more of a rat running through a boxed maze then an actual hero, the invisible walls and lack of facial expressions from the NPCs killed the joy of quests for me as i felt there lacked importance or emotion on what they were asking me to do. however there are 2 or 3 really good quests later on in the story.History - If you can go past the above then the story is indeed intresting, it actually makes you think of what decition you will take since it does matter and it will make the npc and other people help you or go against you. tho, as mentioned before the lack of character emotion makes the game feel so detached from yourself. If you see this on sale then pick it up. otherwise 14 seems a bit too much for me.			"

												The game starts off ok but you quickly realize after the 2nd act you’ve seen everything there is to see.  The locations are not that big, way too much brown and you’ll spend most of your time running back and forth.  In the 3rd act things don’t change much and the fights start to get a little tedious.. Reasoning for this all they do is throw more enemies at you and the area in which you battle is way too small. I would give this one a pass.  "

												Mars War Logs is a budget action RPG that reminded me, because of its involvement in development, of Of Orcs And Men. Of Orcs And Men was a sleeper hit for me personally. It was a game with terrific graphics and fun and exciting gameplay. Yes, it was light on the RPG elements, but that didn't matter. It was truly fun. Mars War Logs has none of that fun and exciting gameplay, and comes across as dull. First of all, the graphics are decent. They're in no way similar to the graphics in other RPGs or even OOAM, but that's to be expected for a budget game. It's perfectly understandable and they're perfectly serviceable. Besides, it has lots of stuff that other RPGs have as well. Think of crafting and sidequests, for example. But it all feels so similar to a low quality version of OOAM, I just can't help it. The interface reminds me of it, the way the story is cut up in chapters, the quick-skill menu, you name it. It's all feels the same, but... cheaper. The voice acting for the main characters is decent, but for most of the other characters it's just terrible. The quests, however, are somewhat fun so it's not all bad. Mars War Logs should take about 7-8 hours to finish. And that's including all or most of the sidequests. So it's not that long, but still long enough to keep you entertained. If I had to make a decision I'd pick up Of Orcs And Men, but, then again... that's me.[Rating: 71/100]			"

												This game is really not what i hoped for. I'm really into playing RPGs a whole lot of time in my life.  I's really not worth 15€. If you want it, buy it at mayby 5€ in sale, not more. Pros:- It works fine, i did not encounter many Bugs. I fell through a wall one or two times, thats all. - Game mechanics are easy to see through. You get a short, but good tutorial. Neutral:- It's pretty straight forward. Except maybe three quests you get a point on your map, get there and quest solved.  If you like that - ok. I didn't. Well, you can end this game pretty quick through this, but thats not the point of playing I guess. - You don't have many NPCs to talk to. Some kind of the same point as the one before, but yeah...it keep everything pretty simple. - Graphics are ok. Its not so much a main point, but you have to consider for yourself if it matters.- It's short. I'm a really slow player, looking in every corner an speaking 50 times to everyone (which did not turn to some new experiances) and i needed 20 hours. Thats really not fullfilling.Negative:- The Environment. Its all the same. Everywhere. Everything. I mean, would it be so bad to build in something not Desert-scrap-metal-city like? - you need to go every way like 50 times to get and solve the main and side quests. This is boring. If you ""explore"" (and thats really not the right way to discribe that activity) a new map, for a main quest for example, you need to go back to the entrance by foot. all the way. Nothing new...- If you plunder anything you get the same, about 7, items. If you have a good stock, there is no way in plundering at al anymore. you cant get any special equipment or anything. Just trash to ""enhance"" your already maxed out stuff. Which is, by the way, one of the around 6 suits or 7 weapons you can get. If you exspect to get nice armor oder weapons - don't.- Talking to your companions is not worth the time. Their design is not really deep, nothing to really feel empathy for. (No spoilers here.)- Camera movement sucks. It's pretty slow moving an in my opinion really close to the character. If you don't look in the right direction, you're unable to for example pick up trash. or open doors. Plus in tunnels or any narrow place, camera stucks around on the back of Roys head. So nothing to see here- literally. - Quests have two types: ""go kill"" and ""go get"". Maybe with a ""go talk"" in between but yeah...that's it. I guess you have to play it yourself to see if the story touches you, but I'm a bit dissatisfied with what I got. This is not my mothertongue, but I hope you understand sufficient.			"

												Mars War Logs is an interesting RPG, with a surprising depth to the characters in the story, whether they are enemy or friends and many of the decisions are steeped in shades of grey. However it is hardly a perfect game either, first of all the story is rather short the campaign barely feels like it has gotten started before it is over and the cast of characters are rather small and quite a few of them seems a bit random. As does the random encounters which are quite hard in fact most of the ""big"" fights are in fact easier than the random ones. Also the amount of equipment in the game seems rather limited and has very little to do with modern much less sci-fi concepts I spend most of the game running around with a metal pipe with what was basically a nail through it. Finally the biggest flaw of the game is it tends to forget to teach the player the consequences of using ingame mechanics, apparantly to be ""good"" in the game you shouldn't kill (do forget that we knocked the guy down with a barrage of 7 inch nail darts and several massive blows to the skull), however if you do kill you gain more money, when this mechanic is introduced it isn't explained that you just knocked everyone senseless up to know (except animals which you apparantly kill). On the up side the game autosaes quite often before fights so you can redo them, the dialogues are fully voiced and feel more natural than most RPG dialogues and the dialogue choices actually fit well with what is being said (I am looking disapproving at you mass effect) and there are sometimes everal different ways to handle a situation. the combat mechanics are solid and doesn't change wildly from one fight to the next with two exceptions, other than that the enemies mostly stay the same in terms of tactics while you gain new combat skills and improve your old ones.All in all I will give this game a 7 out of 10.This game is a joyful little trip to a post apocalypotic world.

												Mars War Logs is an crpg in the best kind of way: your living/playing a story.Like all Spider games till now Mars got an interesting (very) plot, setting, athmosphere and characters, while beeing ""rough"" in many other aspects.Spider games suffer from a very floating, rather clunky feeling combat-system; character-proression doesn`t feel very tight or balanced also; that said all Spder games are rpg-pearls.Mars. War Logs might be their best game up until now and despite the still strange combat-mechanics it`s a must buy for everyone who likes blending out reality and just playing a crpg like you would read a book or watch an interesting movie.

												A fun but heavily flawed game. Despite the low budget feeling being present throughout every aspect of the game from the serviceble story, to the somewhat ok combat, the interesting but underused lore of the world and the forgetable characters, the passion behind this project is undeniably strong. It reminds me of the older Bioware games, back when they were actually respectable game desginers making actual RPGs. This was my first game from Spiders Studios, and I came out pretty satisfied despite the lackluster ending. I'm definitely going to give the rest of their games a try, but if nothing else, for those who care to read this, 15$ is really not a high price for 25 hours of gameplay. Recommended.			"

												I finished my first game from Spiders.At first, I bought this game with other during a summer sale, then I left it aside: This autumn 2014, there was so many expected releases that I prefere to play other things, like blockbusters and big-prod games. When after their release some of those 'most-expected' games appeared to be expansive slot machines without real next gen innovation. I opened my list of old 'to-do games' and went to Mars. What I discovered there on Mars was not a 'game of the year', but remain for me an honest and original RPG, at a good price.+ atmosphere = music, sound effects, artwork, dialogs, light and dust animations, levels and background are coming very well together. The game managed to get you the taste of this rusty Mars of Bradbury or mad-max like post-apocalyptic background.+ scenario = Mars is an abandoned colony from an Earth who failed the terraforming and simply left his colonists/workers behind to die in the dust. Technology became religion (Mars of 40k), water became more valuable than gold and oil put together, and mutants are both superstitious slaves and relics of a mysterious first 'war'.. The main/side quests are making good illustrations of a rich background, unfortunatly without special revelations on it. (budget limitation?*)+ Characters/dialog: morphing, voice casting, etc.: all NPC and allies have a particular personality, story and place in the scenario. Funny choices and dialogs. The bad reputation gives you some nice situation of intimidation.+ RPG Inventory= which is not as complex or labyrinthic like in other RPGs (which are mostly fantasy RPGs and not SF), but fun and easy to explore and try out. + Scavenger/upgrade system: original and well designed+ Combat system: not perfect, but I get the feeling of table RPGs when you have to think about all your stuff and upgrades and levels. - *like it was explained on the forum, they don't had enough money to expand the game like they wanted in the first place. Yes, there are too few bosses or real cinematics, some bonus like artworks to gain with achievements, and the separate Epilogues could had been more 'customised'. But the game remain coherent. - FOV: especially in fights and some maps, you have to choose carefully the place/corner of the map who you want to fight, otherwise your characters can disapear from the screen and get kicked by invisible enemies. (there is already a fix from the dev in the forum to modify the FOV)- too easy: especially with bad reputation (when you kill the wounded): you get intimidation which is nice, but also very quickly all the best upgrades for weapons and material (Difficulty=normal). - not very long (3 chapters) but can be replayed with a lot of side quests.IMHO:- if you like SF, RPGs and Mars, get curious and build your own opinion			"

												A solid action role playing game. Not excellent in any way, but decent enough to draw me into it's low key, nitty gritty universe. It has a lot in common with the Witcher school of similar games and borrows heavily from the combat system of it's peers, although it never reaches any heights. It gets you through, at least, and lets you concentrate on the atmosphere and setting, which are somewhat unique and interesting.			"

												Though by no means the greatest game to be released this year, I found Mars: War Logs to be worth almost every penny. The combat can be a bit clunky and the story was far too short for its own good but in the end it provided a welcome distraction from the norm. Mars creates what could have been a vibrant and rich universe were it not for the disappointing length of the story. I will say caution that those who value the story above all else -like myself- may find themselves slightly skeptical of the events that transpire but if you can manage to overlook a few convenient events, you should be fine. Similarly in terms of mechanics, Mars has the feel of something that could be great if only more time was taken to hone and streamline the end result. Visually, the game isn't bad. Though somewhat lacking in striking alien vistas or magnificent architecture, Mars makes up for it by bringing us the gritty almost noir feel of refugee ridden slums and the vaguely resigned industry of POW camps. Though saddened by thoughts of what the game could have been, I still found the experience to be enjoyable. I rate thee seven out of ten.			"

												From the first two hours of this game i can see its flaws. The voice acting isnt that great and the word arent in sync with the character's lip movement. The combat is solid, it isnt the best but it does the job. The story is basic and the skill tree and leveling up system is good. AI is pretty good but the cutscenes arent that great. This game isnt a normal RPG its different because of the 3 main things- Combat, Renegade, and Technomancy (I honestly prefer Combat and Technomancy but thats just my opinion) you can level up these 3 skills and it important because each one changes your gameplay experience. Combat- 3/5Story-3/5Voice Acting-2/5Skill Tree/Leveling Up System-4/5AI- 3/5Cutscenes- 2/5Its a game that is pretty good and i recommend it for anyone who is into RPG'S, i give it a 8 out of 10.Also its impressive that such a small company can make a pretty good RPG and you will get about 11 hours of content.

												I spent quite some time playing this game, and I really /wanted/ to love it. The world they've created is really interesting and cool, the character design is good, and the premise is fun. I like the level design, and the character levelling up system is unique and cool.But despite these positive points, the gameplay quickly becomes repetitive - combat, run around, combat, talk to someone, combat. The combat mechanics are a bit glitchy (maybe the controls would work better with a game-pad?), and when you're playing real-time melee combat, this becomes a big problem quickly. In the end I simply couldn't be bothered grinding through the quests to find out the rest of the story.If the same studio were to make another game, I'd certainly take a look, but I would be a little cautious before spending too many Ducats on it.I'm giving it 2/5 stars, and would only recommend buying it if it's on sale for a few bucks - even at the cheap ticket price of fifteen bucks, it's not polished enough for me to recommend.:(			"

												Mars war logs is an intense RPG with a cyberpunk theme based on the planet mars in the distant future, as a technomancer in a martian slum you choose your own path, good or bad as you fight foes from prisoners, to dogs to martian mole rats with a vast array of upgradeable abilities, I personally focused on the technomancer abilities which gave me powerful psionic abilities such as overload and arc, which were very fun to use, I like how it wasn't much of a shooter, it had a nice balance between powers, shooting and hand to hand combat.

												Mars: War Logs wants to be a Bioware game; a sprawling epic with sharp and nuanced action-RPG mechanics, full of big moral choices, set in a well-defined sci-fi world. Unfortunately those kinds of games are really expensive, so we get janky-yet-serviceable gameplay accompanying us through a story that could've either used a few more or a few less edits, in a sci-fi world that was clerly well thought-out, although poorly communicated.But if it was 'Bioware big', it would blow most of Bioware's catalog out of the water. If you give it a chance to try, you can see the seeds of a fantastic game that just didn't get the care and money it needed. The end result is a decent enough game, worth picking up on special, but couldn't reach its potential.			"

												Mars War logs is trying ever so hard to be a great RPG, yet it mostly fails.  While no game can be truly great in every respect, you still need to do at least one thing really well.  To me it seems the creators either didn’t know how to or simply couldn’t decide what to focus on.  The characters while unique in some ways are not well written and are easily forgotten.  The plot while trying to be edgy in some parts is just plain gone in others.  Oh and the writing, how many games have adult relationships described by 10 year olds.   Mary at one point goes from enemy, to friend, to sack mate in about 30 seconds of game time.   The game really peaked at the end of the prison camp, it’s clear the ideas and time was dedicated to that part of the game, what takes place after feels rushed and unpolished.  To be fair I think with another year or so of development the game could have been a gem but as it is Mars just is a subpar game that will be forgotten the day after you play it.      My Score  50/100			"

If it was anything like the witcher i would be spinning around from one end of the battle field to the next watching my helpless foes plead for mercy in a steel spinning blood raising battle, but this ... i killed and armored man with a pipe, and proceeded to beet down his buddies with said pipe while they attempt to shoot me and hit me with there own pipes. this game has an obsetion with pipe related combat.

												This game is really mediocre. Whatever propaganda the publisher/designer wrote that you've heard about, it is a lie. I gave it hours of my time, hoping it would get better. It didn't. You might like the game alright - it isn't pure horrible, but overall I'd give it a 4 out of 10. Everything is unpolished and the engine is awkward. The ""freedom of choice"" situations are similar to a game you might play in the late 90's. It is pretty close to linear, though you get to make choices here and there that make subtly different outcomes.			"

												I really wanted to like this game. The moebius-esque images of the ""technomancers"" with the total recall setting of mars really caught my attention.The truth is this game is the proof that small studios should not do ""open-world/areas"" RPG games.CONS:* NPCs: The game presents you with small areas, supposedly cities full of NPCs, but reallity is they dont feel like cities at all. NPCs are no better than crate boxes just standing there, they stay in the same position 24/7, they don't even react when you are fighting enemies 1m away from them. The only NPCs you can talk to, are marked in the minimap so that you can rush directly to them, they are normaly vendors or quest involved characters, 3 or 4 per big area, and are very shallow and uninteresting characters. You'll forget them immediately.* Quests: Quests normally are take this item to the other end of the city, or kill this guy and come back, which you get really bored of at the third time, even if they try to call the objective something else.* Maps: The minimap is horribly implemented, to the point I try not to use it, even though it is essential for not hitting dead-ends while you run around the city, dead-ends are extremely common and add to the destroying of the city feeling, there's normally just 1 or 2 paths from point A to point B.Normally, when you start a new area, you can open your minimap and guess which of the areas will have enemies (it's always the ones which look like big rooms for you to roll around to avoid enemy attacks, opposing to the rest of the city, which are just corridors). For some reason I really don't understand, each city, or area, is divided by some shut-doors, or barricades, which you have to interact with in order to advance. They introduce no apparent loading-time, so they just break even more the feeling of being in a real city.* Enemies: Enemies for some reason know you are a threat, even though they have no way of knowing it, at least in the early stages of the game. They just attack you on sight. There's some enemy respawn too, I'm not sure how does it work, but it is very annoying when you have cleaned a now full of enemies area less than 10 minutes ago.PROS:* Fights/Crafting/Skill Tree: The fighting is melee based, where shooting is just a special ability. This, along with the crafting abilities and the skill tree, are very decent. They all remind me of The Witcher 2, they are very similar. The fights, even in normal difficulty are tough, you die a lot, which require you to do somekind of planning or preparation before confronting enemies.* Plot: If you can ignore all this gameplay wrecks the game presents, the story is somewhat interesting.I feel like this game could have been incredible if more depth had been added to it, but I have to say I do not recommend it. I got it for 2.65€ in Steam sales and I still payed more than what it's worth.			"

												As a curiousity purchase for some really low price, this might be an interesting game to check out. Especially if you like studying games from a design standpoint. As a full (even if low) price story driven action RPG, Mars: War Logs isn't very good.Story never picks up, partially because of a rather bad translation, partially because everything in the game is fit into very claustrophobic locations and it's hard to take anything seriously. Characters go from ""we just met"" to ""like family to me"" in 15 minutes, with no indication if in-game time flies differently from player real-time or not. A lot of plot threads get hinted at as being important and grand, but then just kinda resolve in the most disappointingly boring way possible.Gameplay-wise, it's also pretty badly put together. Combat has some nice ideas, but they never work properly. You constantly find a lot of crafting stuff and money, but there's almost never a need to buy anything and best weapons and armor for the chapter (of which there are 3) are available from the start, so when you can just wait to find or buy best possible stuff you need, upgrade it in the best way you need and play out the rest of the chapter without ever caring about it again. So, by the end of the game you have tons of money and stuff you don't need at all. Skill system is also rather weridly done, as the most useful skills are in the combat tree and by the end of the game you'll have enough points to max out it and about a quarter of another skill tree, so focusing on anything else feels like a waste. And one of the trees is not even available until the second chapter. And companions are useful only for diverting attention from you, but useless otherwise. Also, there is a morality system, which simply doesn't work. Or, more specifically, it seems that I did finish the game as a best guy ever, since merchants talked about giving me a discount (which is a feat for being ""good""), but in-game menu always showed me as ""neutral"" and ""good"" feats were showing as locked.It is a shame, though, really, since there are some nice ideas here and there and the game world seemed to have been put some thought into. Game also looks quite good, with its own distinct colorful style. But the game is so underwhelming and frustrating and most of the time simply boring, that it's hard for me to recommend it. Unless there's a big story RPG itch you have, and you can't scratch it with countless better games. Like Rise of the Argonauts, for example, which is actually a better game.			"

												Mars: War Logs is a bit of an enigma. Some have deemed it the ""poor man's Mass Effect"" but this is incredibly misleading as the similarities between the two games stop at the sci-fi setting.When I finished the game I found myself wondering how I made it from start to finish without utterly giving up on it. If it wasn't because the game is only 10 - 15 hours long then the only other reason I could come up with is that the game really makes you ponder what it could've been if it had come from a more experienced developer with a bigger budget.All the usual trappings of an RPG are present but none of them feel particularly fleshed out or provide any kind of depth. The combat harks back to the ""old school"" style of pause-and-play (ala Knights of the Old Republic, Dragon Age: Origins, etc) but beyond the fact that you can pause and then choose an ability none of the other aspects of the style are there. On top of this, while the game allows you to have a companion character you can't choose their attacks, outfit them with weapons/armor, or even take control of them in any way other than choosing their ""stance"".A dialogue system is also in place but a lot gets lost in translation - literally. Since the developer is French the game is localized for anything else and it's terribly done. You'll find countless examples of this when your character says something that doesn't even kind of sound like your selection and/or when another character reacts to you in a seemingly opposite or confusing manner. Additionally it doesn't help that the voice actors bring disgustingly wooden performances to the table as well.The inventory system is barebones (perhaps 4 different sets of ""armor"" and maybe 6 weapons), the crafting/upgrading system is totally out of whack, despite having skill trees to that branch into RPG archetypes (rogue, warrior, magic user) the game almost seems to want you to max out everything and use everything in one playthrough, a romance system is there but is so poorly done it's easy to find yourself not knowing it's even there at all or glitching it/breaking it yourself, and finally the story (while pretty unique) is at times confusing, ill-paced, and withholding.How/why did I finish this game? In the end perhaps it was it was a strange desire to see a good idea shoot itself in the foot with poor development and virtually no QA. Mars: War Logs is a yet another example of something that could've been great, that wanted to be great, but just couldn't.			"

												I cannot, in good faith, recommend this game. The voice ""acting"" is horrible, and that's apparent even though the actors admittedly have nothing to work with in the script, and a plot that plods along with only the loosest justification for its characters (but a laughably healthy appreciation for cursing). The PC port is especially atrocious, given that it does not even consider that one might use a mouse and keyboard instead of a gamepad. The fighting is somewhat similar to Dragon Age 2 or Batman: Arkham City, yet less engaging than either of those, as it has a targeting system that loses track of the enemy constantly. And then, to top it all of, it's got that same feces-and-metal color palatte as every other game, plus a dosage of rust that does nothing to make it visually more enjoyable.			"

												Think about it like Fallout 3, but scaled back....WAY back.  Still, for what amounts to an inexpensive Indie game, it's pretty damn good.  It's got all the required RPG elements, such as a leveling system, crafting, inventory, etc...just all somewhat simplified (which is not neccessarily a bad thing).  The combat is actually pretty good.  It's virtually all melee, and it sort of reminds me of Witcher 2 (as someone else already pointed out).  Lots of parrying, dodge-rolls, counterstriking, and dirt-throwing.Bottom line, if you're looking for a deep, complex, Elder Scroll-ish kind of game, you should pass.  But for $5, Mars: War Logs provides a lot of cheap RPG fun.			"

												Despite what the store page says this game does not have working GamePad support. The Devs do not care in the slightest that most GamePads will never work at all. If you ONLY use KB/M and never intend on using anything else then you can prolly play this game. I have a Steam Controller so I can set up a full KB/M config and that works but XBOX controller users do NOT have this option. I will not be buying any other games from this dev since it seems they just don't care at all about their games or the users who wish to play them, the way they want to.EDIT: Seems it is a thing that some users can unplug their KB/M entirely and sometimes it will see the controller, this is ridiculous if they expect users to actually do that. Such a simple fix could be made to always allow GamePad input even if it is not detected in the initial initialization of the game or the first device seen.			"

												Great start, horrible, horrible combat scheme. I actually appreciated the story and crafting. But then I got into combat. Jeezy chreezy, it's. just. bad. Sorry, I don't want to sound too melodramatic. But the actual controls change in the middle of combat. Normally, W moves you forward and you change direction with the mouse. But in combat, the camera locks in one direction. The mouse does nothing. Many times, you cannot even see where you are going or where the enemy is! This doesn't end until combat does.Worse, you cannot go toe-to-toe with enemies. You *must* maneuver behind them or attacks don't work. Of course, enemies don't have the same restriction. You also cannot get behind them unless you roll away from them. (Yes, as in hit the ground and roll at an angle away from the creature, then hope you didn't roll too far and give it time to face you again.) They also turn around after being hit once. Every combat is the same: struggle to get behind it, hit it, rinse, repeat. Oh, and you cannot run. Or jump. And attacking with melee is a mouse button but attacking with ranged is a number key? It makes no sense and ruins what could have been a fun game. Please don't bother. Even at less than $4, it was a waste of money.			"

												I got a small amount of entertainment out of this low budget RPG. The story is pretty barebones, the characters are very hit-and-miss (especially their names, with one of the main characters being called Innocence!) and the graphics looks like something out of the Playstation 2 era. It took me about seven hours to complete and I completed one or two of the side quests, otherwise it was only main/story quests all the way through.You're playing as Roy (his real name being Temperance) and you start in a prison camp where the goal is to... simply break out. After that it's time to get revenge on... errr... the government. And I can't really remember why... that speaks for itself, it has gone about ten minutes since I completed the game and I can't remember one of the bigger plot points of the game. Well done...Sure, I bought the game for about $4 and that's not a very high price. One of the better things with the game was the combat... which was rather repetetive but at least action-filled. Hit two-three times, roll to dodge, hit two-three times, use a nailgun or a ""spell"" - repeat. But, the biggest (and it looks like the only one) ""pro"" I have is that now I want to play some more RPGs... but one with more interesting characters and better story this time around. The Witcher? Dragon Age: Origins? Who knows?			"

												Mars: war logs. This isnt a bad game but it isnt particularly good either. It shines in the first half introducing a Sci-fi prison break sequence which is of great enjoyment but a tad long. During the first chapter you are introduced to a limited skill tree with either Brute or rogue as your choices becuase mage is left till you exit part 1. Story wise I actually really liked this game but the story left a longing for the epic backdrop painted in so many conversations. the war logs sounds like it should have an epic lore, but your left with a very mysterious character who never really gains a solid back story, in an environment that never seems to be more than a few blocks in the back of a big city. This man is trying to find freedom as a nomad rather than a techromancer, relying on his skills in combat to keep him out of trouble. The combat in the game was rather basic, assassins creed-esc parry, attack system, with crafting on the side. Overall this game is a nice pickup at a low price if your looking for a sci-fi rpg that is out of the ordinary. 5/10 Exceige			"

The crafting and leveling up system is intuitive and easy enough to use to where adding upgrades to your armor and such isn't that hard to do.

Along the way you meet the rag-tags of the slum, the underground resistance fighting for freedom and a power crazed group called the technomancers.Very enjoyable game, despite some of the voice acting being on the odd side. The world reacts to the moral choices of your character, and despite having no definite class system beyond three skill trees, the game has a high replay value.			"

												Epic game. It is refreshing to play a game with such a good story. Reminds me of gothic. Combat isn't bad either. Rpg with semi good combat. It is so flashy as witcher 2, i prefer it this way, not a big fun of those quick action rpg's. Worth to pick up even for full price. Good value for time spent. But it all depends what are you after. I am a sucker for a good story.			"

												An ambitious game from a small team with big ideas. It's clear the game takes inspiration from BioWare-style RPGs, though it seems to suffer from a lack of budget and manpower. It's a flawed game with a lot of potential, with an interesting crafting sytem and a fairly unique, immersive setting. Definitely worth picking up in the sale, and even full price if you're into RPGS.			"

												This is actually a great game.  I would not actually pay full price for it, but for $3.74 it is worth it.  :D  I enjoy this purchase.  No regrets.  Just need more walkthroughs and guides for it.  Too few of it.  Edit:  I just beat the game and it does not have any replay value.  The game is hard and challenging and that is one of the great things about it.  Also the ability to customize/craft your armor and weapons with stuff is pretty cool, but the game sells you short on the replay value and story.  Towards the end I just skipped the dialogue and went straight into the game.			"

												A very underrated game. I did not finish the main story yet, but, already fell in love with this game. It bfings back the memories of good old days of Bioware's glory, when their goal was making an interesting story, not trying to please everyone with politically correct, PG ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. And a first chapter brought back memories about Escape from Butcher Bay. But to be fair, this game has a bunch of flaws, 1) The graphics, I didn't mind them much, but they are definetely dated. 2) Rather generic setting, I myself am a fan of Dune-like postapocalypticish atmosphere, but I understand that some people may find it to be unoriginal. 3) Voice acting, and this is a big one, some voiceovers are decent, but other are very-very bad, to the point that sometimes it almost ruins the atmosphere. But despite all that I would recommend this game who wants to play a good story-driven, third person RPG, there's a few nowadays.			"

												If you liked Mass Effect and the Witcher 2, this a nice game to try out. The combat is fast, fluid, and fun. This game is very enjoyable because it seems to barrow some elements from a few different games like the combat wheel from Mass Effect and the skill tree and combat from the witcher.      The only things I see wrong about this game is that the campaign was way too short, the voice acting needs a little more work, and please, for the love of Steam, FIX THE STUPID COMPANIONS!!!! Their ONLY job in this game is to take a brutal beating in a corner while you handle all the bad guys. lol sitll though, this game is great for an action/RPG.

												Mars: War Logs was a pretty interesting game. I purchased this during it's 75% off sale and I can say that it was worth the money spent, but had I bought this game for full price, even at the low price it is already at, I would have felt a little bummed out, but not enough to really regret the purchase.The flaws in this game are few, but affect the immersion and gameplay pretty heavily. For starters, we have the most obvious issue of poor lip synching for the voice overs and poor voice actors. Now, I don't know about you, but when it comes to a game made in 2013, you'd think that you could at least have proper lip synching so that your game characters don't look like a bunch of puppets when they talk.The voice acting side of things in this game also comes with another tag along flaw of horribly bad dialog and just general sloppyness of a story. It has a nice twist in the beginning which is refreshing when it comes to your main character, but that is about it. The voice actors in this game were not refreshing however...and at times, even right off in the beginning they showed their lack of skill at voice acting. This could have also been a result of poor direction as well, which would be understandable, but it's still significant enough that on my first playthrough I was skipping the dialog just so I didn't have to suffer.Companion choices are obvious enough that you won't be surprised at all and the game does have you do a fair bit of running around for quests, which gets annoying at times, but not so much as to detract from the gameplay a whole lot. The game is extremely linear and I also felt that your reputation in the game meant all of♥♥♥♥♥♥when it comes down to it. My reputation was bad the entire time and it didn't affect anything I could percieve to be a detriment to my gameplay when it came to companion interaction or affecting the story. The only thing it did affect was that I couldn't get the companion bonus feat or the merchant price reduction, but that wasn't a big deal considering my companion was only good for distracting an enemy or two and that the game gives you everything in the game that you need. Vendors were pretty much pointless as a whole and the crafting system, while neat, was generally pointless as well as once you obtain the copper tube and leather outfit in the 2nd chapter you effectively have the best weapon and armor in the game.Combat is frustrating but fun, and stealth is a broken mechanic allowing you to typically take out 1-2 baddies before they notice you. Explosives are your friend and the blast power with the cone effect is really the only power I ever used since the shield and weapon powers take forever to cast.The best thing about this game is the detail in the environments. This game looks gritty and dirty and it's great. I was expecting more, but for the price I paid I knew that I wasn't going to be super impressed with it, however I didn't hate it and if you are looking for a cheap game to beat then pick this one up during a sale.

												When I first heard of Mars: War Logs, I was... skeptical. Not that the idea of a cyberpunk RPG set on Mars didn't appeal to me. And other reviews had made it sound sort of average at best. Yet I'm not one to reject new ideas and so I decided to give it a shot. And it was only around twenty bucks.To put it bluntly: money well spent.Mars: War Logs is a pretty intense game, with a tight storyline and at least decent gameplay. Sure, its graphics don't have a prayer against the latest incarnation of CoD and the like, but they are pretty impressive on their own for an indie game.You play as Roy Temperance, prisoner in a POW camp on Mars, in the aftermath of a war between two rival factions veering for dominance over the planet. The game begins with you saving a young man named Innocence from becoming a 'punk' and from thereon planning your escape from the camp. (For some reason I have yet to discern, every man in this setting is named after a virtue, Innocence, Temperance, Constance, Prudence... weird. But not bad. Roy is actually the odd man out in this scenario.)This is an action-rpg, meaning your character, Roy, is already a somewhat badass mofo, and the rpg-elements only serve to give you a choice what kind of badass mofo you're going to be. It follows the standard fighter-mage-thief trinity, with fighter being self explanatory, thief being labeled stealth and covering also things like fast-talking and bartering, and magic being called technomancy. I don't want to spoil anything but you have to progress a while in the game to acquire the technomancy abilities.There is a karma meter that influences what kind of perks you get, which influence your style of badass mofo-ery. You in turn influence the karma meter (or reputation) by your actions, specifically whether or not you extract water units from dead bodies. Extracting the water is bad, by the way.There is also a crafting system that allows you to create health or mana potions, or to upgrade your weapons and armor. What I actually like is that the upgrades also have a visual effect on Roy. You only fight with melee weapons for most of time, but in best prison tradition you can turn a simple rod into the shiv to end all shivs.One thing I have to say though: I think cyberpunk is not really the best way to describe the game. For me the game was more like a dirtier, grittier version of the Dune novels and the David Lynch movie. But maybe that's just me.Okay, bottom line: for an indie game, Mars: War Logs is pretty damn good. Sure, it cannot compare to the works of Bioware, Obsidian and Bethesda, but that is not the point. On its own merits, it works perfectly. I really recommend checking it out, because for twenty bucks you will get a lot more bang, so to speak.			"

												I am loving this game so far, despite having only bought it one day ago. The graphics and voice acting are great, and the story is not bad either, if not completely original in nature.One thing which stuck out for me is the accents. Not everybody sounds alike, which makes sense to me even if the colonists all landed a century ago or more. They would have come from diverse backgrounds, and some of that would have stuck, including how they talked.I did notice the faction running the POW camp has possible touches of ""evil for evil's sake,"" which is making me nervous, but it's not an issue thus far, and so I hold out hope.Here's hoping the rest of the game is as enjoyable as what I've seen.

												The thing I love about this game is also it's primary drawback: you're constantly thinking ""if they had double their budget and another year of dev time this could be one of the best action RPGs in a decade.""While the things you wish were there sometimes bum you out (not that many levels, outfits, weapons, etc) the care and devotion to story evident even in the english translation of this game is constantly present. Despite the limited number of options compared to something like Borderlands or Arkham Asylum (the two games with the most similar gameplay styles IMO) most of them actuallly make you care and feel like genuine (if occasionally slighlty clichee) progressions in a compelling story.Just remember: this is a ""solidly medium sized"" mid buget game with a lot of love on the part of the devs clearly driving the experience. Don't buy it if you expect a Mass Effect or Fallout or Borderlands. But if you like sci fi, story driven, action RPGs this one is worth giving a shot at full price. If you can get it on sale... this game is one of the nicest surprises I've ever had from an impulse buy.			"

												Easily one of the most underrated RPGs on Steam. The lore to this is pretty deep for a game that lasts for only a short period of time. It has serious potential and could pave the way for an epic series, but unfortunately that's likely to never happen.  Only two issues I have with it are the length and the voice acting. The game can be beaten in 6 or 7 hours. For an RPG that's simply not enough, but it manages to squeeze out as much plot and character development as it can. And the voice acting is downright cringe-worthy in some places. This bearded fellow Tenacity Williams in particular just bothered me. His voice sounds nothing like the way he looks and it was really distracting. Other places it's pretty decent. The combat system is fun and reactive, clearly taking notes from the Witcher 2. Hitting someone in the face with a pipe or shooting electricity out of your gauntlet is extremely satisfying.I say this game is worth it, if you are willing to look around the rough edges and approach it with an open mind.

It is not very polished in some aspects, but overall the fights are always challenging (you never become too powerful, if you make mistakes you can die very quickly), the story is interesting with the second half of the game changing based on your faction choice (although other choices you make don't seem to impact the game on such a wide scale), the dialogs are good (although the voice acting quality is not always as good), the pace is consistent throughout the game. The game is not too short, either. So, all in all, I would define it genuinely good and very enjoyable.			"

												Worth playing. Decent. That word probably describes the game best. The setting is interesting, but the story is a little dry, it definitely has a potential to be so much more. It's mostly linear, but I don't see it as a flaw. The game mechanically resembles KotOR, Jade Empire, Witcher, etc. Graphics are not stunning but they are Ok. RPG system is very simple. Combat is more action that tactics. I haven't found any bugs that affect the gameplay. Probably the main weakness of the game is that it lacks polish. Overall it's a good effort and I wasn't disappointed.			"

												Despite the fact that there are definitely bugs in the game and the enemies tend to swarm you making tactics difficult, I really did enjoy the game and story. The game does have a bit of the Mass Effect feel to it, and the world and characters created were unique and engaging. I hope the developers work on the game engine some more and come out with a more solid sequel. I probably wouldn't replay this game having played through it once, but I would play a sequel if it comes out.Overall I would rate it a 6.75 out of 10.			"

												Somewhat clunky but fun and imaginative game/setting. Not a AAA game but a solid buy on a deal/ discount.A decrepit mars colonial feel is a nice mix of settings and the lore is quite nice. Technomancy is a nice take on cyberpunk magic. Combat is not like most games and requires you to set up with grenades, mines, and nail shots.Story is quite strait forward but above average. Voice acting sounds like non English people speaking English but plays well with the setting.Gear can be customized and adds a nice bet of looks/use/variety. "

												WARNING: You need a RECENT VIDEO CARD in order to use the shaders and such used for this game!In my case, I use an ATI, and that has to be at least in the 4800 series.Having a lot of fun with this game so far.The voice acting is pretty poor, but the story line is decent enough, and the combat is unique. Both controller and keyboard controls work, albeit the controller makes it a lot less complex for those who don't like having over 10 buttons to deal with/remember, and the landscaping is gorgeous.

												It would be quite a stretch to call Mars: War Logs  cyperpunk; though, that is what it is billed as. Once you get passed that and the voice acting (which vascillates between pretty decent and far less than stellar), you will find a very solid story about a hard♥♥♥♥♥that gains a following of broken people. Unlike many so-called RPGs and like many of the greats, your actions actually have meaningful impact on the story, not just in the way merchants may react to you, but in what quests will be open and who survives.The character growth is full of fiddly bits very similar to the Witcher series, but you can usually get a grasp on it. The combat has issues in terms of targetting, but the other mechanics they give you to work with play out quite well. Learn to evade and throw dirt, and you will likely do alright.			"

												I like this game on the first place, because it doesn't want to overexplain the story. You'll get the background of the main characters by conversations or the storyline. One of my favourite thing is that they introduced us by the story of our young follower.Well, it needs some patches, of course. You might find smaller bugs here and there. It can be nerve-racking that it is not that open as it should be, at least for the first hour. Sometimes it feels like you're only travelling from locations to another and back to earn XP.

So there are pros and cons, as always.I have a lame 1.5GHz oldgen dualcore laptop with integrated graphics, but it is still running on low settings.

												I spent a lot of time during combat in this game rolling on the ground ocassionally getting up to whack someone with a pipe or stick...after a while I could zap them!...and everything was rusty, grimey, and rusty-orange. Those were my major memories of Mars:War Logs. The name is not quite apt...Mars:Rusty and Grimey perhaps. If it was a movie the  word to describe Mars:War Logs would be ""slight"" and reviewers would be politely disparaging if they only watched Holywood blockbusters. Not to be too negative though- the game is a primarily fun with a reasonably interesting if short and slightly predictable story. Character development and voice acting are decent for a video game. The RPG elements are rather of the ""Witcher"" variety but the game lacks  the ""Witcher"" depth and polish. But it isn't bad just short and ordinary. Replayability is limited in my opinion but given the cost what does one expect.			"

												As an indie game, I find the rating of Mars: War Logs unfair.I admit I played the game just now, as of January 2015. I have no idea of how bugged it was - apparently it was, according to other reviewers - but in my hands ran just smoothly.Based on such remarks, here are my opinions on the game:The setting and the artwork are nice, with a flavour of steam-punk style. After all, Mars is the red planet.Dungeons, caves, and maps in general are a bit repetitive.Dialogues are just fine. Perhaps they lack a bit of depth, though they are just enjoyable as such. The story is nice and leaves plenty of room for other episodes.Animations are well made. It is nice the way it slows time down when opening the wheel menu or while counter-attacking.It is a pity that jumping is not available, although it would be useless considering the game mechanics.RPG mechanics are OK; the characters evolves by spending points in the three branches or potentiating already unlocked skills.Combat may be the weak element of the game. After getting acquainted with the commands and the combat mechanics, the most successful way is to evade all the time, hit'n'run. If AoE skills from the Technomancer's branch, that becomes even easier.Equipment is also lacking depth. There is a lot of different weapon and armour upgrades, though it is rather difficult to find upgradable pieces during the game. The nice point here, is that you can adjust your gameplay by choosing the desired upgrades - which, by the way, also change parts of the look of the upgraded item according to their stats.Crafting also appears to be incomplete and could be improved a lot.Overall, I believe this is not a ""< 60 game"". As already state, based on the opening remarks, I would rate this as a 65, at least.			"

												Honestly, this is a superb game. The best features are the story and narrative which is mature, dark and most often grim since I took the ""evil"" character route but it does let you still make positive choices and help out those you like. The combat is great, reminds me of The Witcher 2 and Dark Souls mixed in a way because you block, counter and roll dodge around most of the time killing fools with melee attacks because ranged combat is limited due to scarcity of ammo for your makeshift nailgun. Its not too long, I beat it in 12 hours and missed some quests and killed off a few annoying key characters but had a blast the whole way through once I mastered the combat.			"

												I absolutely loved this game. I am a sucker for anything sci-fi, and the concept and story were extremely intriguing to me.Are there a couple of rough edges to the game? Yes. Should you be impressed nonetheless considering this was made by such a small studio? I think so.I feel I've read some reviews claiming this is just a boring, linear hack and slash. I have no idea what they are talking about. I just beat it on Extreme difficulty, and I constantly had to plan out what enemy among the group I would need to take down first, throwing dust in one's eyes, wounding one of their melee fighters with a nailgun to slow him down, and then pound on their technomancer so I wouldn't be turned into fried chicken. Some of the battles I won almost soley out of luck.Anyway, I think the game is great. As I write this, it's only $3.74 on Steam. This may be one of the best valued purchases I've made this year.			"

												I was hesitant at first about this game. It's worth every penny.The game is a mix of gameplay from Dragon Age and any MMORPG. It takes place on Mars, with 3 long chapters, and allows you to have one party member at one time. You only focus on your characters items and skills, the game handles the rest.The game takes roughly 8 hours, including all side quests. This has a moderate replay value so you definitely find yourself wanting to change your choices the second time around. There are minor kinks that need to be worked out, but not very noticeable.4/5. Great game.			"

												Mars: War Logs was a pretty charming play.  I really liked it.  It's a somewhat short game but loaded with character.  It's pretty clear that the designers took a lot of inspiration from the classic Neverwinter Nights game elements and quest design.  Main quest with side quests, get to know your companions, make moral choices that shape the story outcome, level skills.  You play Roy, consummate badass, who begins finding himself locked away in an internment camp.  It's worth a discount buy.  Due to finishing it in, I think, three or four solid sessions, I wouldn't pay a pile for it but it's still awesome.			"

Score: 6.5/10Similar GamesRed Faction Guerrilla, Demonicon, E.Y.E Devine CybermancySummaryYou are Roy. A prisoner of a war that is just about to be over. After coming to the aid of a boy named Innoscence you begin to gather up forces for an escape. The game has a reputation system and some perks are based off reputation. Besides the perks you also have access to three different skill trees. Gather up scrap to upgrade armor and weapons. You will also be creating nail gun ammo and kits. The real reason Roy wishes to escape he keeps to himself until the time is right.The GoodThe combat is actually good. Just remember that if you kill enemies to get serum they respawn depending on the area and enemy. I never tested sneak in the game so I can't speak on if that works well or not. The guns, weapons, and technomancer combos are pretty fun and very solidly implemented. The armor & weapon upgrade system looks freakin awesome and allows for quite a bit of a custom look even if there is essentially only two base armor looks to start from. The backstory on the world is pretty interesting.The BadBack and forth...back and forth.... back and forth... back and forth... The game makes you travel like constantly and when you reach the end of the first city you will be utterly sick of it. The loads tend to freeze up a little bit from time to time in the city area. The only monster enemies is the moles, and other then that its basically three types of human enemies. The game does endlessly reuse tiles, but that is a minor problem since they reuse them smartly. The story in the game doesn't really stand up to the awesome backstory of the world.ConclusionHonestly this game was probably a bit to ambitious for such a low budget small studio, but the games got a good heart to it. The Mad Max without the vehicles feel the game presents is pretty awesome to boot.ValueThe game by default is only $15, but I'd probably suggest waiting until its 50% off before going for it.			"

Along the way you meet the rag-tags of the slum, the underground resistance fighting for freedom and a power crazed group called the technomancers.Very enjoyable game, despite some of the voice acting being on the odd side.

												Very happily surprised with this game, I was expecting a generic action-RPG and instead got a compelling role playing experience. The world design that went into the script, environments and quests is rock solid and believable, I very much enjoyed my hours on war-torn Mars.			"

												World building and backstory is superb.It's about as ""open world"" as Dragon Age - technically lot, but quite big nonetheless.A solid action/rpg with a lot of polish.If I'd paid £30 for this game I would not be disappointed, but I would grumble about the smoothness of the gameplay (short delays for animation and so on).But I didn't, I paid the full price of £12 and for that I'm very happy.

												I have no idea why the description says its a cyberpunk rpg, there is not a single cyberpunk element to be found here, other than the desolated society. All in all, it is a rather mediocre action rpg, with interesting setting and background, which is sadly not explored enough to do justice. Story could do a bit of fleshing out and the characters failed to grow on me. Still, it was fairly fun while it lasted, combat is a bit on the clunky side but enjoyable. There is a laughable attempt at stealth, but dont bother... just dont... I would recommend this title only when you see it discounted. You can treat it as a warm-up for upcoming Technomancer which will hopefully be everything War Logs wasnt.			"

												I am enjoying this game a whole lot so far. I have read some bad reviews about this game which I feel are unfair. The only gripe is that the animations are a bit clunky and some of the dialog doesn't always make complete sense; however this has been on rare occassions.  Once you can see past that this is a very indepth story driven game with some very cool features. The graphics and sound are good. The combat system is very strategic. All in all this is a very good game. If you are unsure wait until it is in the sale. If you like indepth RPGS and are not expecting AAA then you will probably really enjoy this game. I think it is very polished except for the animations and the odd camera issue. Nothing terrible here. Pros outway the cons by a long shot. 8/10.			"

												Hi everyone, this is my first review, I hope it helps.PROS: 1) the combat system has some strategical depth. You can choose between shooting (and letting your guard down), using powers (which requires so precious time), or just bash in with your ""almighty custom made pipe of destruction"". Do not expect much more than this (which is enough for my tastes), so do not expect to lose hours in micro management about every single move.2) The story is nice. OK, it's not going to attract Hollywood movie makers (even though, given the high quality standards set by the latest Fantastic Four movie … *SPOILER ALERT sarcasm sarcasm*) or win an Academy award, but the game is short enough to keep up its momentum until it's over. You read the end credits before you get bored, that is.3) Being a huge gdr fan (both paper and PC versions), I really like the ""leveling up"" mechanism.4) The idea of mixing together some scraps of metal, pieces of cloth and electrical wire with a steel pipe or a worker's suite may sound odd. Even more so when you realize that, in this way, you turn your beggar-look-like hero into some sort of space mar...(ops copyright alert) futuristic soldier in impenetrable armor with a planet - killer weapon. I think it brings some character to the game and adds some ever-welcomed variety as well.CONS: 1) graphic ... OK, it does its job, but a little improvement would not hurt. Make it a big improvement and you'll get a really, really good game.2) Soundtrack. It could be improved. Definitively.3)Technomancer powers. Why should a post apocalyptic future need some sort of weird magic? Mad Max has no such things and it rocks.NOT SURE IF PRO OR CON: the game is linear. Fullstop. You have a main quest and you go from A to B and reverse, sometimes calling at C to do some side questing. Fullstop. Perfect for killing time without turning your brain on.All in all, I rate it 7 / 10, raising to 8 because I've bought my copy with a huge discount (12,50€ got me all 4 Focus gdrs).For comparison sake, I rate 10+/10 Baldur's Gate 2, Torment and Borderlands 2. I'd rate 1/10 Kerbal Space Program … OK, it's a masterpiece and I know it, but I just don't like this kind of games.Thanks for reading. I apologize if it was too long.			"

												No its not the most impressive game in the world but I really enjoyed it. I am a huge fan of RPG's as they are my favorite game franchise. Not all small time devolopers can make huge worlds like bioware can but this one is really good. No they have to constantly reuse skins and areas but then again so did the original mass effect and dragon age 2. For a small company, this game is really well done. It has a littl bit of everything but not so big as to be cumbersome. A little crafting, a combat design, character devolopment and it does a unique job to portray mars. I just wish it had a better title, Mars: War Logs is not a great title idea I'm afraid lol. This game is great for what the creators had to work with but if your a fan of RPG's I know you'll enjoy it too! A great game for someone with a little money and alot of fun.			"

The combat system and leveling system was very thought out. If you don’t rush through the content and complete most of the side quests you can get 20 hours of play time in to complete the game. Over all I would give it a 7.5 out of 10. Don’t overlook this hidden gem.			"

												If you don't mind some mid-quality voice acting, some stiff animations, and a bit of odd lighting, there is an enjoyable, tacticle, hack'n'slash RPG here.  Clocking at about 12 hours, MWL is a game full of action, loot, upgrades, crafting, exploration, and dialog choices that affect the outcome of the story.  It maddens me that games like this get dumped on in the reviews.  It's clearly made by people who love what they do, and their aim is to entertain.  Not every movie is Star Wars, people.  Not every band is Pink Floyd.  Not every video game is Fallout 3 or Mass Effect.  This game's rough edges give it that charming underground indie band feeling, and I loved just about every minute of it.  Give me fifty titles just like this before giving me ONE Call of Duty.  Could this game have somehow possibly been better?  Sure, but so could your mom last night, but she's still worth paying for.  ZING!			"

												Mars: War Logs is quite an interesting play. The gameplay reminded me of KOTOR, while the overall story was unique and a bit refreshing. The equipment in the game is fitting, if limited. However, the upgrades are what makes the gear. I felt a bit limited by the linear story, but there was enough detail in the extra info to help flush out the story some. The dialogue was probably the worst part of the game, which did limit me from really -liking- any particular character. I also didn't feel that following a good/bad path really affected the game all that much.Overall, Mars: War Logs just missed the bar from being an excellent game. However, if you are a scifi/rpg fan, I highly recommend giving it a playthrough.			"

												Ok.... so this game is  a mixture of bad and good elements. Lore is interesting.Story is good but ends abruptly.Fights are good, though not much of it in the first 1/3 of the game.There is def some textureing issues that could have been smoothed over.Intteraction with NPC's... heart is in the right place but def some stuff lost in translation. Makes for some unexpected entertaiment. My main beef with the game is that just as you acheve your powers and realy learn house to use them in real time the game is over. I bought the ""steam key"" for it for like $6 At ""♥♥♥♥♥♥♥quot; {LINK REMOVED}https://www♥♥♥♥♥com/r/puffsplusClick the link to chek it out!

												My recommendation says yes, but read it as a ""Maybe"".  If you go into ""Mars War Logs"" it expecting a polished game, captivating story, or any real emotional weight; it will leave much to be desired.... walk away.  However, there is something interesting going on here that is worth a look for fans of Knights of the Old Republic I & II and similar games.  If you go in with a low price and low expectations it can help tide you over until the next good CRPG comes along.  While unpolished is the word of the day, there's something valuable under the ugly surface.  This game does not have intricate character leveling, crafting, or combat systems.  It's world is not fleshed out, and it's characters are not compelling.  However, in each of these elements there exists a good idea heading in an interesting direction.  It's just not there yet.  In truth this game could have used a year or more of development.  Here's to hoping they sell enough to put more money and man-hours in to MWL 2.PS. if you buy this game, fair warning, virtue names are REDICULOUS.			"

												Granted, I only have a few hours into this game.  So I may be smitten with the shiny newness of it all.  But this game was a breath of fresh air out of the norm for me.  It reminds me of rpg's from the 90's with some of the newer features from current rpgs.  Unless it takes a drastic turn for the worse, I will play this game all the way through and am already telling people I know to buy it.  There is a slight learing curve to the controls, but thats every game.  The voice acting is lackluster, but it doesn't take away from the experience.  The ideas are fresh and the story is original enough to keep you interested.  The upgrade crafting is great and makes you think about what you want on your gear.  All in all, this game delivers everywhere it should, gives surprises where you least expect and doesn't fail to make you feel like a badass when needed.			"

The story is interesting, and it makes me wants more of it -  actually, this game feels a bit like a prequel to a longer, 60+ hours final fantasy-ish adventure. I hope the dev makes a sequel! Also, it has rocking industrial music soundtrack, fits the game perfectly and one of the few OST that I listen to even when I don't play the game.			"

												My recommendation comes with a qualification:  the metascore is pretty close to what I'd give it, so don't buy it for more than $15.Overall, this is not a bad game.  Graphics and sound are both pretty good.  The story isn't groundbreaking, but it's far from horrible.  My only real gripes are about the controls and dialog / voice acting.From the beginning of the first chapter, this seemed like a promising effort from what I thought was an indie developer.  A few minor things, like stilted dialog, oddly-paced voice acting, and some weird collision issues niggled at me, but I was willing to overlook those as necessary evils of an indie game.  Then the second chapter started.  A single scene at the beginning displays possibly the worst voice acting I've seen in a video game -- you'll know it when you see it.  From that point on, I couldn't help but be painfully aware of every weird turn of phrase and every moment of odd prosody.Fortunately, the mechanics and combat are fairly solid -- the game never actively prevented me from enjoying it.It never quite rises out of the hole of mediocrity that it starts in, though:-Controls seem slightly non-standard to me.  For example, 'E' is only used to extract serum from and kill people.  In most other games that I play, it's used generically for object interaction.  The LMB does multiple-duty as initiating combat, attacking, object interaction, and NPC interaction.-With the exception of buying medkits, the economy is pretty useless.  Even at extreme difficulty, I never found a need to buy anything else.  Weapon and armor upgrades were always a side-quest or two away.-NPC followers are next to useless, so don't count on them to aid you in combat much.  They only seem to be good at distracting a single enemy for a few seconds before they're downed.After finishing the game, I learned that Spiders isn't an indie developer at all, but a French studio.  Which simultaneously deepened my disappointment in the lack of polish and explained my major problems with the game.  Whatever their budget for developing Mars: War Logs, the internationalization portion was inadequate.			"

												I'll give the short version first. :)The best way to describe this game is: Imagine the spawn of a brief torrid threesome affair between The Witcher (the gameplay/combat), Fallout 3 (the atmosphere) and Mass Effect (the story setting). Take out a bit of awesomeness from it. Add the russian guy from GTA IV (on acid) as the protagonist aaaaaand...Congratulations!... It's a ""Mars: War Logs""! :DSo, this is a ""safe"" game... It picks up on stuff used succesfully countless times on other games of the same genre and repeats them competently. It doesnt have any ""great new features"", the maps or the history arent huge master pieces. Actually the questline that goes along with the story is pretty straightforward and the maps are short and simple.But the graphics are pretty great, the game is well built all arround and it's fun! I mean.. Werent you furstrated when you ended The Witcher, or Fallout 3, or Mass Effect? I admit i got lost and purposeless! I was loving the games and they ended... So, i know it's not the same, but with this game you can pick up from that ""orphan"" feeling those great games left you with and keep the fun going a little while.And for the money it costs... It's worth it!7/10Now, the boring and long version.So, this is the tipical 3rd person action RPG that takes role in an improbable future where mars was colonized and, naturally, there's conflict because every ""major power"" wants a piece of it. You start as a POW, inprisoned far behind enemy lines. As you work your way out of the prison, and after, running from your former cagers, you start unfolding a deeper plot concerning older inhabitants and their powerfull knowledge... Bla bla... Cliche... De ja vu... And ""play it yourself to find out"". ;)You'd expect that a game happening in a future far planet has all sort of advanced weapons, rayguns, guided missiles and stuff but.... no... Its more like ""Post apocaliptic future in mars"", so you'll use mostly pipes, hachets, bones and such as weapons. Combat is mainly melee, ranged weapons are used more like a complement in combat and later in game you'll develop some ""technomancer"" powers. These are basicaly ""Sorcerer's magic"" but based on technology.I think the rate this game got with the critics is unfair. The game is not ""epic"" (as the graphics might suggest) but is very decent entertainment.The story is engaging. The character leveling up keeps gameplay fresh and interesting. New skill and abilities are meaningfull and will keep you focused. As gameplay is concerned, you'll find it very familiar overall and will constantly relate to similar features in other games.The characters are built well enough, although i confess i hasnt able to create any ""deep emotional connection"" to them. It was hard to feel empathy and maybe because of that i never really connected to the game atmosphere.Concluding, the game has all elements to keep you interested for a while (if you are into this kind of game). But you must be carefull and dont fall to the tempation of comparing this games to the ""giants"" of the genre or you might end up feeling and thinking the same as the critics that rated this game with a 5/10.As mentioned earlier: a solid 7/10			"

												The story is solid and offers several endings. Characters are not numerous but each one is so clearly identifiable you'll grow fond of them - big-eyed Innocence, candid Mary, general Honor, each one has a unique voice actor. Voice acting has been redone, and this is one of the best performances I've witnessed in a game.Combat needs some getting used to. At the beginning it's quite frustrating, but once your character has enough experience, it becomes much better. You have a melee weapon, a nail gun and technopowers, which are plenty enough IMHO, each one becomes stronger and stronger which is better than having numerous weapons just slightly or not different at all.I liked the post-apocalyptic atmosphere. The characters' faces and mouvements are really well done.An Indie RPG worth every single penny, kudos to a small developer.			"

												This game is awesome! It's a focus on melee combat and ""technomancy""(Think of Plasmids, as that's the closest I can think of). It's not exactly Game of the Year material, but it has a solid story line, the voice acting is a lot better then you'd expect(Even if the animations aren't as great), but it's a pretty decent game for 20 bucks. I'm 6 hours in and I just hit the telltale point of, ""You're half way through the game!"" So it seems to have some amount of time you can put into it. Also, the sneaking sucks, but I suck at sneaking anyways so no negatives there.			"

												The setting for this title is fresh and original. It blends fantasy tropes with a dystopian sci-fi world.  There are a lot of really cool ideas here.

Don't dismiss it because of bad reviews, the only thing this game is guilty of is not trying to hide it's limitations with retro graphics.			"

												A suprising gem.  It has it's flaws but its not a terrible game by any stretch.  It's a linear RPG with an enjoyable combat system and a very entertaining story.  The game isn't very long but for the price I think it's appropriate.  I say check it out.  The game has a lot of ""potential"" but I doubt we'll be seeing any more of it (even though I would love a sequel).  You make choices throughout the game but really only one of them, in my opinion, really mattered.  There's some romance companions if you're into that even though you never really get to feel all that close to any of them.  The protagonist is a bad♥♥♥♥♥as well, even if you make the ""good"" decisions.  Don't go into it expecting Mass Effect and you'll come out of it quite satisfied.			"

												Nice, solid, little rough round the edges RPG.It's like one of those hidden jems you pick up at the book exchange. You read the back cover and decide its worth a dollar or two but dont expect much. What you end up getting is a fantastic story, great characters and fantastic atmosphere. Sure the books pretty short and the cover and spine (gameplay) is barely held together but by the end you're glad you found it. You might even recommend it to someone down the track.That is what Mars: War Logs felt to me. Also bonus points for a sandworm bossfight.			"

												I spent a lot of time during combat in this game rolling on the ground ocassionally getting up to whack someone with a pipe or stick...after a while I could zap them!...and everything was rusty, grimey, and rusty-orange. Those were my major memories of Mars:War Logs. The name is not quite apt...Mars:Rusty and Grimey perhaps. If it was a movie the  word to describe Mars:War Logs would be ""slight"" and reviewers would be politely disparaging if they only watched Holywood blockbusters. Not to be too negative though- the game is a primarily fun with a reasonably interesting if short and slightly predictable story. Character development and voice acting are decent for a video game. The RPG elements are rather of the ""Witcher"" variety but the game lacks  the ""Witcher"" depth and polish. But it isn't bad just short and ordinary. Replayability is limited in my opinion but given the cost what does one expect.			"

												Honestly, this is a superb game. The best features are the story and narrative which is mature, dark and most often grim since I took the ""evil"" character route but it does let you still make positive choices and help out those you like. The combat is great, reminds me of The Witcher 2 and Dark Souls mixed in a way because you block, counter and roll dodge around most of the time killing fools with melee attacks because ranged combat is limited due to scarcity of ammo for your makeshift nailgun. Its not too long, I beat it in 12 hours and missed some quests and killed off a few annoying key characters but had a blast the whole way through once I mastered the combat.			"

												As an indie game, I find the rating of Mars: War Logs unfair.I admit I played the game just now, as of January 2015. I have no idea of how bugged it was - apparently it was, according to other reviewers - but in my hands ran just smoothly.Based on such remarks, here are my opinions on the game:The setting and the artwork are nice, with a flavour of steam-punk style. After all, Mars is the red planet.Dungeons, caves, and maps in general are a bit repetitive.Dialogues are just fine. Perhaps they lack a bit of depth, though they are just enjoyable as such. The story is nice and leaves plenty of room for other episodes.Animations are well made. It is nice the way it slows time down when opening the wheel menu or while counter-attacking.It is a pity that jumping is not available, although it would be useless considering the game mechanics.RPG mechanics are OK; the characters evolves by spending points in the three branches or potentiating already unlocked skills.Combat may be the weak element of the game. After getting acquainted with the commands and the combat mechanics, the most successful way is to evade all the time, hit'n'run. If AoE skills from the Technomancer's branch, that becomes even easier.Equipment is also lacking depth. There is a lot of different weapon and armour upgrades, though it is rather difficult to find upgradable pieces during the game. The nice point here, is that you can adjust your gameplay by choosing the desired upgrades - which, by the way, also change parts of the look of the upgraded item according to their stats.Crafting also appears to be incomplete and could be improved a lot.Overall, I believe this is not a ""< 60 game"". As already state, based on the opening remarks, I would rate this as a 65, at least.			"

The feeling that this is going to take FOREVER to get through. There are your typical fetch quests and needless backtracking, but the three main hubs are smallish and easy to navigate.The current translation and VO is perfectly acceptable. Then again, I thought E.Y.E's translation was serviceable.The atmosphere in this game is wonderful. There is also some great model work and texture work.For a cheap price, a taught little aRPG that can be knocked out in a weekend.			"

So minus 1 point for this stuff.Minus 0.5 for graphics- not modern, but still not bad.I somehow wanted to play game like this, where story occur on Mars, because of TV-hype about travel-to-Mars and that.If your goals is like mine- then I recommend this game to you, dear reader.

												First off I'll get the problems out of the way. The game can be a little buggy but nothing show stopping. The mechanics of the game, how the fighting system works and so on, not perfect but I'm not all about game mechanics. Take a game like Jade Empire, it's flawed mechanically but there's so much more to that game, it's great fun. This game is very much like that too. Jade Empire, Remember me, games like that are more about telling a story and the RPG elements and game mechanics are there to keep you interested while that story plays out.I don't like Mars: War Logs, I absolutely love it. Good science fiction tales are hard to come by in PC gaming and this is very much one of them. I'm also gobsmacked that such a small developer was able to pull off so much. So for me it helped a lot that I went into this game knowing a fair bit about the developers, what they were trying to do and forgave the problems the game has because of that. Take a game like Skyrim. A truly epic game with a massive budget and huge team of programmers  and artists. Even that game has many problems but I adore that game despite its problems. I love that they were trying to create a huge open world and fill that world with enough content, that at times it felt like I was in a real place, really role playing my way through it. Mars: War Logs is trying to do the same but with a tiny fraction of the budget of Skyrim. The fact there were plenty of times I also felt I was in another place, really role playing my way through it is quite astounding to me.Bottom line, if you love a good Sci-Fi tale and want to be immersed into it, this game will give you that. On sale it's an absolute steal and a must have. At full price, I'd say you probably should avoid if this is going into a backlog to be played later as it will go on sale again. If you want to play it right now, the full price which is £11.99 as of writing this, I'd pay that.			"

												Mars War Logs is what you would get if you made Fallout using the the game mechanics of Knights of the Old Republic. The game is fun, and has a few moments of really well done story. The Dialog is both really good and really bad, depending on the character. Innocence (strange heavy handied naming convention asside) Is a great character and the airy voice acting does wonders to enhance the character. The main character however is totally hit or miss, mostly because it's obvious the lines weren't read in order, so he reacts strangly or puts odd emphasis on lines.If you need a TLDR, the worst thing I could say for this game is it's a bit unpollished. There are no big bugs that I've seen, but the game's a bit short, thin, and mediocre, when compared to the Bethesda and Bioware counteparts that are the obvious influences. All that said It's a good game, with a good story, and I'm enjoying it.			"

Mars: Wars LogsDescription: An indie/rpg style game. Set on a post-apocalyptic Mars, your character is thrown into a power struggle between factions. The atmosphere sort of reminds me of a steampunky dune, complete with electric magic, sneaky face-whacking, political backstabbing, a bit of romance, and even a sandworm!Pros:The atmosphere is interesting. Drab, desert-ish industrial themes, with little splashes of color or variation. The commerce system is simple, but effective. You can buy ingredients to construct upgrades to weapons and armor, or scavenge them from the environment.The combat system is different from anything else I've used, but easy to get the hang of. The first chapter is a bit slow, and gives you plenty of time to get your bearings before throwing you into the thick of it.The general plot and main characters are interesting enough, but some of the voice acting (especially for minor characters) is less than stellar, and in a few cases, downright bad.The perk trees are nicely done. Basic, but they allow you to tailor your approach to combat to suit your style of play. The perks come in three trees, Stealth, Ranged Attacks and Healing, Manual Combat, or Technomancy (magic). Each tree has a few tiers of perks that unlock as you purchase items in that string, and each perk has three upgradeable layers of effectiveness.Cons:The visuals are drab, and this can make it a bit hard to navigate, simply because you're visually bored. The side quests can be too vague. I had to resort to a walk-through for one in particular...turned out I had already missed my opportunity to complete the task. It's a damn short game. I took my time, and it only took me 10 hours to complete.The alignment system is janky. It makes some actions (ex. harvesting serum from downed enemies) obviously ""bad"", but it doesn't give you any direction or input as to how to navigate these choices or check your progress. I made ""good"" choices all the way through, and still finished the game with a ""neutral"" alignment, preventing me from taking advantage of the various perks attached to either of the divergent character paths.Overall, a good diversion RPG game, to play in between titles like Skyrim and Mass Effect. Maybe not worth $15, but I'd recommend buying it when it's on sale. "

												Enjoyed the game. Purchased it at the regular price and don't regret it, only wish it would be a tad longer and perhaps allow somewhat greater freedom of exploration (though the most of the areas that appear throughout Chapter 2 are explorable from the get go).One of the common gripes I can see in other reviews is the combat system. It's much different from what I have seen in most other RPGs, and I would say that it's challenging to master. In fact the difficulty level of some battles seems to be quite inconsistent, as I don't remember having many problems fighting my enemies in latter stages of the game (except for a boss fight in the latter portion of the game, which featured a completely unique type of enemy), but some battles in the beginning were frustrating and at times overwhelmingly difficult. Groups of enemies are really, really hard to dispatch at first, and the companions that we have available serve as little else than a distraction. They don't ever seem to get any better as well.Character developement is fairly straightforward, featuring three skill trees - Combat (meaning melee combat); Renegade (ranged weapons and explosives, stealth, healing and a very useful ""blinding skill""); Technomancy (magic, sort of - this tree becomes available after the first chapter). I'm not entirely sure if they are well balanced, as a full focus on Combat with a few points here and there in the other two trees allowed me to be nigh invincible towards the end of the game. Combat is, in general, fast-paced and rather dynamic.What I liked most, however, is the way that the player improves their equipment. Crafting is possibly the only real means of improving ones gear, as both armours and weapons in their basic versions provide little improvement over each other. Their full potential is unlocked only by craftable upgrades. In fact, the main reason to acquire new armour or melee weapons is to get the ability to craft more advanced upgrades.Voice acting ranges from fine to downright terrible. I hear that the dialogue quality has lost a lot in translation from original French, and it does sound a bit odd at times, and some sentences actually don't make sense. Not a lot of that however, at least after the patch that actually included improved voice acting for some characters.The story is so-so, although hardly groundbreaking or surprising. That said, it had one or two unexpected twists before getting to a rather predictable ending.The general theme of the game is described as 'cyberpunk'. I would call it 'cyberpunk-ish' at best. There is little to no advanced/futuristic tech to be experienced, it just seems more like a dystopian vision of a forgotten space colony, whose inhabitants have slowly devolved.To sum up: I would recommend this game to patient people, who would like to try their hand at something a bit different. A pretty solid indie game, which you just might want to buy when it's on sale...			"

												Easy 8/10Pretty solid story line. No real Plot Holes. Boss fights weren't exactly easy, nor were some regular encounters. Overall it was exactly what I was looking for. It wasn't terribly long, but I could've made it longer had I done all the side quests. I imagine I missed quite a few because I suspect you could level your character up all the way and my guess was missing more than a handful of skills, let alone maxed out skills. Like I said, the devs did a great job.			"

												So far I have only played an hour and a half of the game. What I can tell you is that the combat feels like a less polished version of the Batman games. You are given multiple dialog choices, that do not clearly show you weather they are ""good"" or ""evil"" things to say. Once I find a workbench I think the crafting will resemble that of games like Dead Island and Fallout.I am ok with these aspects of the game not being original because they are effective and audiences already understand them. I've been anticipating a game in this setting, I'm looking forward to seeing what else the game has in store.			"

												The plot in the game isn't exactly captivating, and I found myself skipping the dialogue before too long; but the gameplay is top notch, as is the character customizability, the combat, and the difficulty.Your companion does have a bit of a glass jaw, and can cause some unfortunate friendly fire incidents, but the difficulty was relatively on par with a slight edge to it being ""too difficult.""Grab it if it's on sale, but don't pay full price for it; and do yourself a favor:  play it with a gamepad.

												This game is definitely worth the try (and the money). It's not long (but longer then some new COD games), there are some sinor bugs, yes (which game is bugfree anyway?), but for an indie game it's rly good. I liked the story, the surroundings, the music (also there's one type of follower i haven't found in games so far)... Main hero dubbing sounded funny to me at the first time, but i've got used to it and it's not that bad. The main problem here is that you CANNOT rebind controls, but it's not that hard to play with them. 7,5/10 for me, it's way better then some more popular games. Recommended.			"

												In the distant future, mankind has finally colonized the red planet that is Mars.But something happened that threw the entire planet along with the colonists into chaos and now water has become the most valuable and sought after resource, a few companies are starting wars over this resource.Now it is nearly a century after the cataclysmic event and you play as Roy, a renegade who has spent some time at a prisoner of war camp when the arrival of a new prisoner by the name of Innocence changes everything for him.After saving Innocence from a rather nasty fate in the showers, he agrees to help Roy with escaping the camp and so begins the tale of Mars: War Logs.The combat in this game is really good, it is in some ways similar to The Witcher's combat system and feels fluid.You can also gather various materials from crates, heaps of junk and more that you can use to craft new armor and attachments to any of your moddable weapons.A must have for those who enjoy a good cyberpunk RPG.

												If Mass Effect went cyberpunk. Awesome level progression and combat, basically everything I wish the Dragon Age series was, and it was done from a developer with half the budget. On the downside, I do have to admit that the 3rd act seems a little rushed and all the romance subplots of the story are basically forgotten near the finale.			"

												This game is a real game. It has been overlooked by many I'm sure, but it is a Martian based third person RPG with NPC interaction and a venacular that would make a bikey blush. 5 minutes into the game and you feel like you're watching the latest and best HBO TV Series. The fighting is smooth and arcade based, much like the Batman games and the graphics achieve that rusty Apocalyptic Martian atmosphere that just completely immerses you. It's also completely controller friendly so you can sit back on the couch playing it on you're 42"" LED LCD screen with full stereo 5.1 surround sound, if you have that kind of setup. Fortunately I do. :)Just don't play it if their are any kids around, or you may end up going over budget with the soup. Haha.			"

												Mars: War Logs is a game which truly represents the Icarian myth of aiming high but falling because of it’s ambitions. This isn’t to say this game is a complete write-off as I’m still playing it and enjoying it… most of the time. As I play it, I feel that the developers have taken great ideas from other games and then mashed them together, without fully developing any of them. The leveling up is based on experience gain and allows you to spent points on perks (like Fallout), and separate points on skills with a skill tree reminiscent of The Witcher 2. Though unlike The Witcher 2, there’s not real room for focus on one particular skill set as you need to utilise everything at your disposal such as dodging, blocking, attacking, traps, bombs, guns, technomancy (magic), healing and other party members to be able to survive through most combats. Because you need all of these, you need to spread your skill points evenly across the board. Though I will say that the skills have significant effects on what your character can do, as do the perks, meaning that your choice in either do matter.Mars: War Logs aspires to be a lot of things, though doesn’t quite reach any of them. This all being said, this blog is called Icarus Reviews and I cannot fault a game too much for aiming high, even if it doesn’t succeed.For full review, visit:http://icarusreviews.net/2014/03/14/mars-war-logs/ "

Level design and quests are from 1990 - but still good for a low budget title. The beginning is a bit of ""guess where we placed this tiny object in this huge level"" - but the upcoming zones are more straight forward and the quests get better. Issues: none. Fun: Good. Lasts a playthrough: yes. Go buy if it's on sale, it's worth a few bucks.			"

												A 3rd person, post apocalyptic, sci-fi, modern RPG, only second to tittles such as The Witcher series and Mass Effect(back when it still was good). It has a similar combat feeling to that of The Witcher 2, the map design on the other hand is more linear and maze-like.The only real flaws this game has are its not so good voice acting and the story sadly feels a little short/rushed towards the end. But taking in consideration it is a budget game and not an AAA title, it is more than well done! It's few flaws are easily shadowed by a good story overall, solid and refreshing lore, interesting character development, and a high variety of customization and upgrades for both weapons and armors alike. For only 20 bucks(release price) is solid investment! And at a discount pirce it is a steal!			"

												Horrible game, didn't even bother finishing, barely played it for a few hours and glad to NOT go back to it. The bad combat system is the worst part. I kept finding myself facing the wrong way when trying to attack an opponent and can't get turned around quickly enough. When in combat, the sprint get changed for a roll button which limits your movement. The two together means I kept rolling to behind my opponent, then standing up and swinging into the air, while he turns around and attacks me from behind. When you are using projectile weapons, you can't actually aim; instead you set a ""target"" with your mouse wheel. Not a fan of that. Granted I am a FPS fan but have played a couple in the style of this game without having the urge to slam my mouse through the monitor. If your are a FPS person, don't bother. Go play Borderlands(s) or Fallout(s) or Bioshock(s) or Far Cry(s) if you like ""RPG"", or even Mass Effect if you are not into FPS. And to add to the sins of War Logs, you can't remap the keys; what ""modern"" game can't you remap the keys??? And the micro cut scenes everytime you open a door??? Enough already. This waste of money has already taken up too much of my time...			"

Their is a bit of a learning curve to the game as their is with any new game one try's. The crafting side of things seemed wired at first but with just jumping in and playing about, I have the basic understandings of it. The story is pretty good, I like the idea of you being a POW on Mars. I also like how everything is tainted red with the Martian dust. All in all not a bad game to whine away the hours while the weather turns nasty outside. They say the big freeze is coming, not on Mars.			"

I have problem with defending and counter attacks, mostly attackers fights in bunchs so if you cover one attack and try to counter-attack another enemy will hit you. So I end up with dodging all the time. I appreciate of choices you can make and changing the story (no extreme but there are big differences). One thing that annoyed me was side quest and main quest and there locations. If you pick up quest his locations was always on the other side of map and than go back with complete mission and again another mission and where you think this mission will start ??? yes on the other side of map.

												This game is not with out its flaws but once you get into it it is a fun experience. The flaws are as follows:            Unreliable hit detection (more than once I died because a hit i clearly landed did no damage.)           The voice acting is kind of atrocious (there are time it seems that the voice actors where just going through the motions and other time where they clearly didn't want to show up for work that day.)           There is no real drive for the charterers to change motivation other than the script tells them to leaving you wondering just what is going on.           There are side stories that go no where and you kind of wish they would or otherwise not be brought up.           Some characters are amazingly well thought out but are poorly developed while others seem as if they where thrown together at the last minute to fill space.There are very few incentives to buy this game other than its kind of fun it really doesn't offer a whole lot but was worth  what I paid for it. I really wouldn't recommend this game for more than ten dollars. There is just to much that leaves this game feeling unfinished. If you are planning in purchasing and are wanting to know if it is fun, I can tell you that it is. I hope I have been helpful. "

												The game is so boring that I've been forcing myself to play it for 1 hour at a time just to see how it will end and I have a feeling I won't be done for months. The voice acting is pretty bad and 3D work on par with games made in 2006-2007 with a lot of repeated assets (characters, textures, etc.). If the plot or environments don't start getting good soon, I don't plan on finishing.			"

												This game is not with out its flaws but once you get into it it is a fun experience. The flaws are as follows:            Unreliable hit detection (more than once I died because a hit i clearly landed did no damage.)           The voice acting is kind of atrocious (there are time it seems that the voice actors where just going through the motions and other time where they clearly didn't want to show up for work that day.)           There is no real drive for the charterers to change motivation other than the script tells them to leaving you wondering just what is going on.           There are side stories that go no where and you kind of wish they would or otherwise not be brought up.           Some characters are amazingly well thought out but are poorly developed while others seem as if they where thrown together at the last minute to fill space.There are very few incentives to buy this game other than its kind of fun it really doesn't offer a whole lot but was worth  what I paid for it. I really wouldn't recommend this game for more than ten dollars. There is just to much that leaves this game feeling unfinished. If you are planning in purchasing and are wanting to know if it is fun, I can tell you that it is. I hope I have been helpful. "

												I got it for pennies in a 20-game bundle, and its actually better than some of the games I was really after, but still one to doubt.  At normal price I'd draw a breath and suggest its not worth wasting time on.  It may keep you occupied, but it doesn't amuse or entertain. It's a bit clunky, there's a lot of scenery repetition, and only a shallow assortment of NPC faces, and uses a non-standard distribution of key assigments that makes learning it a matter of frustration.  But you do get used it its quirks after a trime, enough to realise its a simple, basic story that could do with a deal of creative input.  The game engine is used in many similar games, so its a bit like the Spiders company can turn these out at whim.  Once you have a game's coding set in stone, all you need do is change the graphics and presto, a brand new game.  Looks like that's what they've done here.  A game made for the sake of making a game methinks.			"

												Mars: War Logs is somehow strange. I tried to play it and managed one hour of gameplay until I had leave it. This game is strange, the story slow and boring, the controls not the best (using a controller). It tries too hard to be Mass Effect in a martian setting.However, this game might suit other people not spoiled by ever green titles with a multiple million dollar budget.			"

												Purchased while on sale for less than $5.  It is a rather quick game, only took me about 10 hours of game play to get through the game.  Heck, I did not even develop the Technomancy side of the game play, was pointless as it takes too long to cast anything.  The graphics reminds me of the game Rage.  If you are looking for a quick game to play through, then this is a game for you.  Otherwise, pick it up while on sale, as it is not worth full price in my opinion.			"

												Horrible game, didn't even bother finishing, barely played it for a few hours and glad to NOT go back to it. The bad combat system is the worst part. I kept finding myself facing the wrong way when trying to attack an opponent and can't get turned around quickly enough. When in combat, the sprint get changed for a roll button which limits your movement. The two together means I kept rolling to behind my opponent, then standing up and swinging into the air, while he turns around and attacks me from behind. When you are using projectile weapons, you can't actually aim; instead you set a ""target"" with your mouse wheel. Not a fan of that. Granted I am a FPS fan but have played a couple in the style of this game without having the urge to slam my mouse through the monitor. If your are a FPS person, don't bother. Go play Borderlands(s) or Fallout(s) or Bioshock(s) or Far Cry(s) if you like ""RPG"", or even Mass Effect if you are not into FPS. And to add to the sins of War Logs, you can't remap the keys; what ""modern"" game can't you remap the keys??? And the micro cut scenes everytime you open a door??? Enough already. This waste of money has already taken up too much of my time...			"

												It says I have 39 minutes on record of playing this game, so I guess 39 minutes is how long I lasted before I absolutely cracked up at the utterly ridiculously excessive amounts of macho in this game. The story and characters feel like they're written by twelve year old boys who haven't learnt to emphasize with other people yet and thereby percieve the whole world in soap opera-level extreme stereotypes. Posturing does not make you look cool, guys! It makes you look pathetic and terribly childish. Nothing about this game can make up for the meager story and gaudy characters. Fortunately I bought the game on sale and paid a suitably paltry sum for it.			"

It is painful to sit through the cutscenes(They havel ike 6 within the first 20 minutes of the game). The intro of the game is super long and slightly misleading. The voice acting is mediocre and the animation is very very good.

												A 3rd person, post apocalyptic, sci-fi, modern RPG, only second to tittles such as The Witcher series and Mass Effect(back when it still was good). It has a similar combat feeling to that of The Witcher 2, the map design on the other hand is more linear and maze-like.The only real flaws this game has are its not so good voice acting and the story sadly feels a little short/rushed towards the end. But taking in consideration it is a budget game and not an AAA title, it is more than well done! It's few flaws are easily shadowed by a good story overall, solid and refreshing lore, interesting character development, and a high variety of customization and upgrades for both weapons and armors alike. For only 20 bucks(release price) is solid investment! And at a discount pirce it is a steal!			"

YouTube™ Video: Analog Reviews: Mars: War Logs 

			Views: 4,851		

			We take a look at Spider's downloadable title Mars War Logs. Is this ambitious budget title a gold nugget or merely another fool's gold?		

War Logs takes place in the midst of a war between two guilds on a terraformed Mars who are trying to control water on the red planet. It opens with Innocence Smith being taken into a POW camp where he is nearly molested by revolting Butterbean impersonator. Another prisoner named Roy steps in and defends Innocence. As the player you take control of Roy and attempt to escape the POW camp with your new buddy Innocence. From there the plot meanders until Roy and company expose a technomancer threat that must be dealt with. War logs offers two different paths to it's conclusion and aside from Innocence there are a few other companions that fight at your side.It doesn't take long before it becomes clear that War Logs is one of the most poorly written RPGs to be released in the past decade. While most RPGs do a commendable job of integrating their lore into the narrative and supplement the details with an in game encyclopedia. The dialogue itself is coarse and attempts to paint the game world as pulpy and nihilistic but instead provides some juvenile shock value, copious groan-worthy lines and chest puffing macho posturing. Also plaguing the experience is the lack of a well developed antagonist and clear motivations and goals for the characters. The plot just meanders on in an entirely directionless manner until you reach the abrupt and cobbled together conclusion.Borrowing heavily from The Witcher 2, combat is involves a mixture of attacks, blocks, parries, dodge rools, special abilities, traps and items. Split second blocks result in parries which open enemies up for combos and mixing up your attack strings is necessary to prevent enemies from repelling your blows. Special attacks, like using your nail gun or techromancer abilities, can be set to hotkeys or accessed from a tactical menu that slows time and allows you to change your companion's combat behavior.  You rarely fight a single enemy so learning to mix your abilities and attacks to handle multiple foes is key. Early on this is a rather frustrating design however since you have a very limited tool set to engage groups of enemies with. Also frustrating is the camera which can become ensnared in tight spots. Companions also help keep the heat off of your character but they are not terribly effective in combat, often dying. All in all the combat in War Logs is the most engaging thing it offers though not the most original.Running on the Silk engine, War Logs is far more reminiscent of burlap in terms of it's visual appeal. The settlements of Mars are a homogenous blend of metal scraps and red dirt. Few areas offer distinct visuals and interiors are sparse. Three quarters of the residents of Mars are bald and scars are their only distinct features. Art direction is also miserable, one of the characters looks like an extra from Little House on the Prairie that managed to fall into an electrician's toolbox. The moles in the game look like uncircumcised quadruped phalluses with beaver teeth.  Many of the interesting features of the martian settlements are above the camera's eye level and will most likely be missed by many players. Shadows are grainy and clothing textures have a dreadfully low resolution. Lip syncing is terrible and racial animations are limited to mouth movements resulting in unexpressive characters. Every now and then you will run into an area where the warm martian color pallete contrasts with cool green and blue hues creating an attractive setting. These areas are two few and far between to salvage the visual experience. Fortunately the music is inoffensive though not exactly memorable. Voice acting is much improved after a major patch which features a revised script and new vocal performances that amend what was one of the most atrocious voice overs since the Playstation era. Even still the characters fail to bring the shoddy script to life—a feat that is probably impossible anyway.			"

												this is a good game.ill start with that. the combat is reminiscent of assassins creed though it has the difference that instead of group 1v1 anyone can attack you whenever they like which allows the game to be more challenging. there is a basic crafting and upgrade system in the game which allows for a variety of different armors and weapons to be used though there are really just one set that can be chosen for the endgame as they are just better then the others.the story i wont say is the most original, war prisoner leads rebelion against oppresive government with different paths to take to lead to that ultimate end. you will also have choices within each section that will affect how the story is told in the cutscenes and at the ending.the game has an interesting art style and while it does look good at times it is inconsistant. most character based items and cloths have good textures with a good deal of detail. however some environmental textures are rather low res so they dont look good.the total game time is around 8 hours and personally i cant replay the game but i do know people that would be able to make different choices for different outcomes.if i could get 8 hours out of cod for 20 bucks just singleplayer i would multiplayer doesnt matter to me so thats my choice.

												My 4 hours of gametime taught me the following about this game :Terrible combatTerrible voice actingTerrible dialoguesTerrible questsTerrible cameraThat may seem a bit simplistic, but let me say a thing about each of those points to underline my stunning opinion.Terrible combat = I actually like the concept of how it probably was supposed to play out, with guard breaks, countering, blocking and all, but the actual execution is just bad. Best example would be you fighting 2 guys while your party member gets stunlocked by 2 other guys (My party member died in every fight btw...I am not sure what I was doing wrong, but they already have major troubles with a single opponent, let alone fighting 2 guys at once, while I battle 3 or 4 at the same time ). If one of the 2 guys blocks, you get thrown back and the other guy won't get hit, even if he didn't block. In return his attack goes through and hits you, since you can't block or evade. Another problem is that your character is staggering like a drunk hobo after each hit, which makes you exceptionally vulnerable to other enemies stunlocking you into death. You have an evade, but that still lets you receive damage, even if you roll through an attack. Enemies have way less trouble, after all you're just one guy and can't abuse the mechanics like they do. My combat was mostly me hitting guys and then running in a circle while my health slowly recovered and repeat :l11 hr edit : Companions are still useless, but I realized that you have to set them to ""defend"" for them to survive 30-45 seconds and hold off a few enemies while you quickly try to dispose of the others. You also get Technomancer skills after chapter 1, which allow you to use a few magical things, which (other than the shield) never really did much for me. I will praise the game for making you feel an effect on levelling up your skills though. That really makes your character feel more powerful in combat, even though sometimes it still ends in a 50/50 win/lose luck draw.Terrible voice acting/dialogue = ""♥♥♥♥♥♥♥quot; seems a very popular word in France and it shows in this game. Sure, it's prison but do you really need a ""♥♥♥♥♥♥quot; in every second sentence you hear  and sometimes even 3 times in one sentence ? The game also opens with a fat guy wanting to♥♥♥♥♥♥a new prisoner called ""Innocence"" (you couldn't make that up..) and the hero stopping him, by standing in the entrance and staring, while occasionally clanging his bracers (or whatever the hell he was clanging). What follows is one of the most insanely scripted monologues I've ever witnessed, which gently dismisses you into the magical world of Mars : War Logs. It doesn't get better from then on as you'll just slowly die while listening to all the other guys sharing their colourful expressions with you.11 hr edit : Same thing.. Less horrible than chapter 1, but the dreadful voice acting remains and the way people say things just does not sound natural at all.Terrible quests : Alright, sure, I haven't done that many, but the fact that annoyed me the most was, that you always had to double and triple check locations you've already been at, just because you got a new quest and now you can look at that box which wasn't interactive before. The game even does that multiple times. Some guy will give you a quest to find 5 pieces of whatever and you'll have to run all around the camp again to check which barrel or metal heap is made interactive now. After that another guy will want 3 whatevers and you'll run all over the camp AGAIN looking for WHATEVER IS GLOWING NOW. I can not say how much that ticked me off and how much time it's wasting, especially since the locations aren't even marked on the map. Yep, sure, just let me run around the starting area for another 15 minutes, after I've already fully explored it twice...Even the quest to get samples from sick dogs requires you to run all over the camp again and search for the dogs who now conveniently spawned GOD KNOWS WHERE. You even had to kill 2 or 3 dogs before that quest, which are still dead by that time, but you can't loot those...hah...why would you...haha...nah...11 hr edit : Thank God that was exclusive to Chapter 1. The other chapters offer your normal fetch/kill/deliver quests, but no more random running around to try to find Waldo. Acceptable.Terrible camera = That's mostly a problem in combat, since it's hard to keep enemy groups of 4 or 5 guys in focus during a fight and you're also often fighting in enclosed spaces. At times I couldn't even see where to dodge and who to hit, just because the camera basically looked down on the ground while I was frantically trying to avoid getting♥♥♥♥♥♥♥to death again. Joy joy..11 hr edit : Still the same..The camera in combat can be your worst enemy at times, They should have pulled it further back for a better overview to allow their ""tactical"" (cough cough) combat to play out better.Anyways..You might be asking yourself ""Hey, you're telling me so much about how you're bad at this game, but what exactly IS THIS GAME ? I WANNA KNOW WHAT IT'S ABOUT, THE GAMEPLAY, CAN YOU CRAFT ? IS THERE ROMANCE ?""It's basically an action rpg on Mars, you being some guy called Roy, fighting evil with a steel pipe or a similar weapon (or, if you're lucky and have enough ammo, a nailgun). Gamepad controls are alright, graphics are rather...meh..You will get xp to put into skills, you can upgrade your weapons and armor and so on and so forth..pretty standard fare and I was trying to give it a shot after reading a few reviews, but in the end I can't recommend it at all, unless you can stomach all the problems or are just a  better player than me. It has a distinct B-Movie charm, but you also need to accept the B-Movie gameplay and I can not :p11 hr edit : If you manage to somehow slog through Chapter 1, which is one of the most dreadful and terrible experiences in any rpg I've ever played, you should be okay with the rest of the game. The other chapters offer the things which you can expect from any action rpg and doesn't do them neither terribly well nor bad. I wish the loot was a bit more varied and the currency seems rather useless, seeing as how I haven't bought a single item from a shop during the whole game. You will also only encounter 5 different weapons (all of them being pipes or bars) and maybe 6 different clothes. Enemy variety is also pretty sparse (dogs, moles, soldiers, soldiers with shields, technomancers), but by now you certainly know what to expect anyways..Edit : After 11 hours, I feel qualified to make some changes to my disliked review.I also just realized what a mess this review is and will leave it like that to fit the game, thank you very much :p			"

												Enjoyable so long as the setting appeals to you. Not the most extensive RPG but the closest thing you'll get to a technomage game with a good amount of player choice and control. Combat is servicable and writing is solid. Well worth picking up on sale if you think it looks appealing. Doesn't overstay its welcome or force grinding at any point.			"

												Mars War Logs starts with promise but goes nowhere. It seems for the first couple of hours that it will turn into 'Red Faction Witcher' but after those first couple hours you've seen most everything the game has to offer and nothing special ever develops. Quests are extremely basic 'fetch item and come back' for the most part, and the story simply doesn't get interesting. The voice acting is a combination of ""poor"" and ""absolutely terrible"". The combat is tedious no matter what difficulty you play at. I got bored and quit several hours before the end of the game and I rarely do that with story based RPGs. A very linear, copycat, mediocre RPG with very little to offer and not a single memorable moment.			"

												Surely an easily over-looked and/or underrated game. Mars: War Logs offers everything an open-world/RPG gamer can want in a game. From customizing clothing, weapons, and fighting style to dialog choices that effect your outcomes in the game. If I were to rank this game I would give it 4.5/5 stars, the .5 being for less open space exploring and more like the feeling of a series of hallways you must run through, but despite the maps everything else in the game picks up the slack. What sells me personally the most is this game offers force powers in a post-apocalyptic theme, I couldn't ask for more.			"

This thing is so overpriced, slow moving and buggy, that reminds me of the Gothic games. The difference being you could forgive Gothic its flaws, since it was actually an otherwise pretty decent game. This just isn't and especially not at the current price tag of 14.99 euros.

												I can't take this anymore. Slow and uncomfortable fighting mechanism, and frigid Innocence(I hate this guy so much, I wish there were possibility to murder him) ruined my experience.I'll probably take some time to murder someone in other game I am comfortable with, and lower my anger about this game, then try again with it. I wanted to play it because before release it looked promising and I watched video and read a lot about it. After trying the game first time I was disappointed and decided to wait for some patches or something.If you want to play this game, be prepared for* People on streets stearing at one place for hours, freezed in one pose without any movement.* Small boulders on the ground normal people can walk through, but in this game you cannot.* Any furniture or crates are bound to eachother and to ground/walls with some god powers, you will never be able to move them.* Walking NPC(Any NPC, actually) will never notice you and will always try to walk through. Also you will not be able to interrupt their stearing contest.* Your hero is not able to go on any stairs with very rare exceptions(quest or crossroads). So you cannot use crates or stairs in fight.To sum up, this game is dead and feels scipted, not alive it pretends to be. Killing someone you will never feel you killed a bad guy or saved good guy, it will be another scripted thing you indifferent to.			"

												A gem in the rough is the best description of the game I have - I am roughly halfway through the game as far as I can tell and feel the need to make the review at this point. The game has a lot of flaws, but none are enough to make the experience unenjoyable, the cut scenes are odd, with sudden silences, some poor voice acting and some jarring story leaps, but I never felt truly pulled out of the experience. The landscapes are very linear from what I have seen so far, with little true open world exploration, though the game does reward you for what little exploration you can do.Now onto the positives and it has some strong elements, firstly, Graphically it is quite pleasant to look upon, giving the environment quite a pleasing look, from the starting prison to the city later on, both are enjoyable enough to look over, even in 2015. Next the story has some intriguing elements and original concepts to them with some genuinely interesting characters, they do have their flaws in design, but again, it doesn't ruin the experience.The Combat system, I found to be challenging to use to begin with, but after some experience it becomes quite useable and isn't simply a case of mashing the buttons.Ultimately, I feel that if you are a fan of the Sci Fi Universe, especially those to do with Mars and Dystopian futures then the game has a lot to offer, dont expect perfection as it isn't here, but the game shines despite its flaws and it isn't like anything else on the market.So for a unique experience and to support a company with original idea's I recommend this game.For me its a solid 6.5/10 Not Great, but an enjoyable experience none the less.

												This is only a slight negative rating, but lands on the not recommended side because I don't really think this is worth picking up, even in a sale. There are many much better examples in this genre. I got the game in a bundle, so I can't moan too much, but would not buy it outright. I recall many games that looked a bit like this from my youth. Linear, slightly blocky textures, lots of running about and terse dialogue. Even the voice acting reminds me of those games, and the 8 hours of this I played reflect the nostalgia trip I was on. However, the lack of any real depth just had too great an impact, and I found myself dreading loading it up. That's when you know it's time to move this from the pile of shame in to plain old ""not interested"" category. The story and characters are crudely drawn stereotypes, possibly done in crayon on the back of a happy meal napkin. That would actually be ok if the quest design was decent (again, like the golden era games I remember), but there is nothing but grind...run here, give this, kill that, run back. Another quest, and oh look, it's over where I just was, 15 minutes away through a maze of tunnels and streets. I found myself not caring enough about any of the people, or the world itself, to want to slog through this to find out what happens. The dialogue and quest branches are highly misleading, as are the on-screen dialogue prompts, so in as much as you have a choice about anything it is frequently routed in a direction you did not intend. Unfortunately, the potentially very cool technomancy and martian survival story (warring water companies are an interesting twist on an old formula) are left to the back seat in favour of following the personal stories of two of the most boring characters ever invented. ""Roy"", a possibly bipolar schizophrenic with violent tendancies and an inability to explain even his basic thoughts without a drawn out monologue (""Hmm, there's a door here. I think it's closed...yep, locked. Darn! Maybe later I can pick it or get someone to open it. Then I could go through, hmm, see what's in there. Because now it's locked, and won't open.""). And then there's ""Innocence"", which is so on-the-nose it's silly...he's about to be♥♥♥♥♥♥♥in prison when Roy comes in and saves him (by beating everything to death with a heavy pipe). Innocence is the reflection of his name, and we're supposed to go on the journey with him more than Roy, though Roy is the player character, as he gradually becomes more grown up, whilst still anchoring Roy to his humanity. It makes for terrible, terrible dialogue, and really, they probably both deserve to perish in the wastes. Technically, the game is very average, with a dodgy-ish but functional combat system, limited enemy variation, a dull skill progression tree, and extremely linear environments (after the first prison level, everything is quite small as well, possibly rushed out given the number of invisible walls and empty dead ends. The crafting is menu driven, and depends on random pick ups. It's finicky, but ok functionally...but again, essentially pretty boring and tacked-on so they could put ""crafting"" down as a tag for the game. So overall, a disappointing experience. It seems the developer is launching a new game about post-apocalyptic Mars and Technomancers...seems basically identical in the premise. I would research it carefully before picking it up...and not bother at all with this one.			"

												I definitely recommend the game. I got it on sale for $5, and after 1.5 hours I already feel I got enough fun for the money—and the game has only just begun. So, I think even the $17 for the game is well worth the price.If you go in with right expectatoions into this game, you can definitely enjoy it. It delivers just what a $17 game should deliver; don't compare it to those that go for $40-$60.There's no jumping in the game and you do occasionally bump into an invisible wall. There are some really grotesque looking people and I often want to find out what had happened to them, but alas, they just ignore you and there's no option to talk to them. Some characters stand in your way, [intentionally?] blocking your way. They're like furniture—no interaction with you at all—which feels lazy and lame on the part of developers.What irks me the most is the UI. Every time you pick up loot or ransack a corpse, you get a popup message telling you what you found, and you gotta click ""OK"" to close it. This really should've been a brief message at the bottom instead. Quests, on the other hand, flash by so quickly, you don't get a chance to read what you have to do, so sometimes you gotta navigate into your quest journal to read them.If you don't have your weapon out, SHIFT makes you sprint. If you do, SHIFT makes you roll. The problem is if you have to go up/down a cliff or ladder, you have to position yourself in front of it and click your mouse. The area where that click actually makes you climb is small, so you often miss it, and get your weapon out instead. There's no button to hide it, so then you just wait for it to be put away just so you could sprint again. Annoying.Voice acting is mediocre in places, but the dialog is very well written.The setting, story, and writing shine. I'm enjoying them so far. Combat system seems good too. It isn't a ""click-until-they-die"" stupidity, like in Skyrim. If you hit your enemy with the same thing repeatedly, they'll start blocking it. Dogs can't be damaged in the head, so you gotta try to get them from the back. There are stealth combat attacks, blinding sand throws, guns (though you don't aim to shoot them), and seems like a bunch of other ""magic""-like attacks that you unlock later on. So I'm enjoying the combat.A few other reviewers dissed the graphics, but they look fine to me. You get an occasional model that seems to bob a bit too much when idly chatting, but that's minor.In summation, this isn't a $50 top-shelf title; don't go into this game expecting it to compare to such games. It's a $17 game and it's worth every penny. Voice acting and user interface are the the weak points, graphics are fine, and combat, setting, and writing are the strong points.I definitely recommend this.			"

												Good ideas, bad implementation.  Not very pc friendly on the controls. Graphically, the game is moderately appealling but thats about where it ends.  The combat is sluggish and the story seems to be missing something.  Overall, the game didn't leave much of a good impression on me personally, hence the little play time I did put into it. I may go back and trudge through it some more to see if it does get better, but there are so many better gaming options out there for the same price, I just don't think that will happen.  I would recommend passing on this one for now, but maybe down the road, the devs can actually put something better out there for this game, making it worth the price of admission.			"

												On the surface, and after a first impression, this game does not seem to stand out all that magnificently. However, it is still a very well put together game and fun to play, once you get the hang of it. Lots of good elements from other games of the past, reminds me in many ways of Knights of the Old Republic. Not an 'open-world' game but you still have some freedom to poke around in the corners a little bit, and there is more to do than strictly follow the story. This game also had more RPG depth than I had anticipated. There is quite a vast skill tree and many different approaches to how one plays the game. In addition there is a good variety of equipments, many of which can be modified in various ways to become more powerful.The story and the writing itself is not exactly too wild or interesting, but it isn't overly shallow or lacking either. And once you get a little ways into the game the combat picks up quite a bit too. Overall this game is a great game to buy and to play, perhaps not one to buy at full price but still one to consider and definitely worth the cost			"

												Simply looking at Mars: War Logs for what it is, I found a very enjoyable, fun and slightly different RPG that has a really interesting world and some promising game concepts. I really enjoyed my time with the game and played it twice to try different builds, difficulties and to see all of the story. I do recognise that there are limitations in things like the size and variety of the game world, limited weapon and armor choices, some voice acting etc but this is also a title by an indie developer so you expect some compromises compared to big devs. As a first effort in a new game universe I think it has potential for a sequel where the good parts of the game like the combat, character development, quest choices, crafting and the world itself could be fleshed out some more to make a top notch title.

												This game is an interesting concept, trying to escape from a prison on Mars. Too bad that when i got this, it was obviously not finished. The camera controls are lacking, and the combat system can at times be very non-intuitive. I got stuck in a combat before ending chapter 1, as i kept getting killed by the same gang, after they killed my companion. This might have been fixed by now, but i have not played it since.			"

												Everything is fine about the game except for the combat system. Generic characters, graphics, skill trees, and storyline.. The combat system is dismal. I can't really expresses how frustrating it becomes. All you do is roll around and hope that you aren't hit - because getting hit interrupts anything you're trying to do (including rolling away) and stuns you for a short period of time. As the game progresses they scale the difficulty by by adding more enemies in tighter chokepoints which just adds to the pain.The combat system is so bad that I will never knowingly purchase anything from this group again.

												The gameplay in this game basically consists of wading through a leper colony whacking people with a lead pipe. There are guns, bombs and mines in the game, but they are inferior to THE PIPE. There is electric magic, but the pipe still wins.The typical gameplay: you go through a corridor, ugly crippled people sit by the wall and look at you, a enemy soldier appears at the other end, you rush to him and beat him down with your trusty pipe. Then go to the next corridor and repeat.There is a crafting system too, you can add a leather grip to your pipe, and tape a tooth of giant lizard to the other end to increase its DPS.The graphics is ugly, but this meshes well with the general atmosphere of lost war, ecologic disaster and general desperation, and almost seems intentional.The game works, there are no bugs, you can complete the quests and advance along the plot line, but ... you know... this endless pipe fencing is just not fun.

												Terrible. Well, no, but boring. The voice acting is worse than what anyone reading this could do and the combat is just bad. It's hard, I guess, but just because the skills you have are a couple bee sting lightning attacks (Or take a couple out) while you pepper them with your weapon. It's like the Witcher, but slower, and a dodge button that doesn't work well. The story itself is alright but you won't get invested because you care about no one in the game. In the beginning you kill this girl's boyfriend, or something idk I barely remember it at this point, and her reaction is like she didn't have any milk for her cereal. Actually it's less of a reaction than that. Anyways, the point is that you shouldn't buy this game.			"

												Mars: War Logs is a cyberpunk rpg in which you fight the a corporation (or is a government?) called Abundance because they are the people that attack you.  Also you fight thugs and mole-things.Gameplay - It's pretty lacking.  The only time you interact with the world is when you dig through the trash or talk to a merchant.  There are also side quests to do, but they're not interesting and don't really have any affect on the environment.  It's like played bioware games, thought they ROCKED, and then didn't realize what they liked about them.  The combat's also pretty underwhelming.  It's a brawler (in the vein of Sleeping Dogs, just without the combos or useful interface) which would be fine, except for this terrible ability every enemy has; the ability to not take damage. Every so often, usually when you're doing well, they'll choose to jump back and avoid all of your damage.  This is a pretty big deal since there's no way to counter it (even if they're already against a wall) and you're usually against a large group of competant enemies.  Choosing to attack an enemy is a risky decision since they can all suddenly start tearing through you at any moment.  It's not even an issue of difficulty, it's an issue of poor design.  You're forced to spend most of each encounter rolling around waiting for your technopowers to rechargeStory - I feel like there could have been a really cool story here.  From what I gathered, it's based on a cool idea of corporate warfare on an unforgiving planet and the effects that can have on a population.  The problem is that the game does NOTHING with any of this.  It's like they start the game right after the end of a really cool game.  No part of the story is really explained beyond ""these are the bad guys because just trust me"" moments.  I mean, the whole first act of the game seems to only happen because of the main character's impatience.   I actually had to stop playing at the end of the second act because I was given a choice to make and realized that I had NO idea what anyone was talking about or trying to accomplish.Acting - I feel like it's important to be forgiving here; how many indie studios could talented voice actors? It's entirely possible that it was just the developers.  To their credit, there are some characters that are voiced in a perfectly acceptable fashion.  They're even able to give emotion!  The problem is that most of those characters are pretty throwaway.  The MAIN cast, on the other hand, all sound ridiculous.  Either they're ""bad♥♥♥♥♥female roles"" that sound like 7 year olds or they're the protagonist who, oh my god, has not changed his tone once through the entire game.World Design - Like I said before, they really could have done a lot here. I mean, a dystopian, cyberpunk world set on MARS?  Instead they just made everything orange and dirty.  I actually had to rely on my map to get anywhere because the areas were so confusing and samey.  I also said this before, but nothing you do changes anything and there are only like ten characters that say anything in the whole game.RPG Elements - Pretty lack luster.  The progression trees mostly just boost damage or give uninteresting boosts like being able to react faster after being hit.  Then there's the feat system that gives four types of boosts; increased xp from enemies, increased loot from enemies, more crafting options (crafting's mostly just for upgrading your gear), and better stuff from recycling gear.  There are also some perks from the morality system but the only ones that are useful come from being a bad guy (the good guy perks involve slightly decreased prices from merchants which you NEVER use and increased damage/health for your companion, which is probably just going to stand there being hit anyway).Achievements - Nothing too hard, but it's worth mentioning that there's an achievement for doing all the side quests.  They're pretty finicky and will actually become unavailable if you do them in the wrong order.Final Thoughts - I love when indie devs take on something that's probably more than they can chew; it shows they're driven!  So, for the first four hours I managed to ignore a bunch of the flaws with the game.  It wasn't until the end of the first act when a character who had no reason to die was killed purely to create dramatic tension (and failed to do so, by the way) that it really clicked with me that there was something actually WRONG with the game.  I can't really recommend this game, but I'd suggest you keep an eye on this development team; this game was bad, but it seems like a step in the right direction.			"

												Hmm where to start.  Biggest sleeper hit of the year?  I think so.  Haven't been pleasantly surprised by a game from a dev I'd not played before.  This game has everything.  Awesome Sci-fi setting somewhere inbetween cyberpunk and post-apocolyptic.  It not pure polish, but its pure heart.  No crashes and nothing really broken in it.  The quests are enjoyable as is the main story.  Lots of side quests and like the main ones you have actual choices that not only affect the games outcome but also the NPCs in the game as well as your companions.  The later plays a good size role in the game and you can have one with you nearly the entire time who help you in combat (no control over their actions though).  And the combat--Awesome.  If Dragon Age 2 had used this combat system it would have been way better.  There's no combo system in combat but you have to use a combination of your melee attack, dodge, counter-attack, kick etc.  you get powers later in the game which are also key especially the shield.  the only ranged combat in the game besides your powers is a nail gun and grenades.  both of which are not used to often though as their supply is limited though they can be bought or crafted.  and crafting this is also something that this game is superb at. you collect lots of items which are used in crafting either supplys and or upgrades to your two equipment slots, your melee weapon and your armor.  both have a lot of customizable options and you can even recycle your stuff to get back some crafting supplies.  the skill tree is also highly customizable but not overly complicated.  and you wont be able to unlock even close to it all so that is nice unlike other games.  stealth build is an option though their were really only a couple instances that it seemed highly viable and worth the points in it.  this game has all the hallmarks of a great RPG while also being a enjoyable melding between an engaing sci-fi story/world and a highly rewarding combat experience.

												It was difficult to decide whether to recommend this game or not. As a summary, I would say this is a game for sci-fi fans that prioritize story over game play and are not afraid to sacrifise game-play and graphic looks to delve into a slightly unusual universe and an OK story.What was good in this game: a) The story was in addition to dialogue and cut scenes told through diary entries, which helped keep up with what is going on. b) Good character and location descriptions. c) Technomancy replaced magic here, which is an interesting skill to master and play with.What could have been better: a) The game's graphics are very outdated, there are not many details to look at both when it comes to pure graphical looks, and immersive details. b) Almost all side-quests involve doing something and returning for reward: there is simply too much running from A to B, back to A and B again. If the world was more immersive, it might be more fun this way, but now it can be a little bit boring. A good thing is it doesn't take too much time to run like that. c) Voice acting could have been better in certain places to make the story more immersive.Neutral points to note: a) The game is majorly linnear, with a few exceptions. b) Fighting is basic and not very complex, but made more fun through Technomancy skill tree. c) The world is limited to the player, there are invisible borders here and there, but mostly there is walking in corridors between structures and rock walls.I chose to recommend this game, mostly because of the story and the way it was presented through diary entries and descriptions. Although the story itself isn't very immersive or more than averagely engaging, it kept me interested enough to finish the game. However, I would like to note that the story and universe they built in this game had several parts which would have been very interesting to learn more about. Simply put, there are some pretty interesting ideas, but it is a pity the game never explores them (more deeply). So try this if you aren't bothered by above mentioned negative and neutral points.

												I really like this game :) and I recommend it to all who loves sci-fi and GDR. The plot is awesome but underdeveloped, the developers could make a bigger game it lasts a few hours, the story is linear going straight on without much details. By the way in my opinion that's a ""must have"" and I hope there could be soon some DLC or a sequel with more details. The gameplay is a little complex I ask one more hand to Santa last Christmas...but he didn't realized me so I get used to it and at the end it wasn't nothing I can't put up with. The story is cold in a reality where only those who have not scruples survives, and where the strongest rule the weaker...it looks like the evil counterparty of a paralel universe of Mass Effect. So...enjoy the game :3 Hope to be helpful <3 See ya !Ho apprezzato molto questo gioco :) e lo consiglio a tutti quelli che amano il genere sci-fi e GDR. La trama è bellissima ma poco sviluppata, i creatori avrebbero potuto fare un gioco più grande, dura poche ore, la storia è lineare e tirata a dritto senza molti dettagli. Comunque secondo me è un ""must have"" e spero che ci possano essere presto delle DLC o un sequel con più dettagli. Il gameplay è un po' complesso...ho chiesto a Babbo Natale una mano in più lo scorso Natale ma non mi ha esaudita...alla fine ci ho dovuto fare l'abitudine e ho scoperto che non era niente che non potessi sopportare. La storia è fredda in una realtà dove solo quelli che non hanno scrupoli sopravvivono, e dove i più forti comandano i più deboli...somiglia alla controparte malvagia di un universo parallelo di Mass Effect. Insomma...godetevi il gioco :3 Spero di essere stata utile <3 Ci si vede!			"

												I've played through to completion in 3 days. I really enjoyed it.I'm one of those people that happily play old games, so maybe that's why the graphics didn't bother me like some people.Combat wasn't great, though, I'll admit. There were times that I could storm through a group of enemies with no issues, and others where they just seemed to destroy me. I don't really know why. Stealth isn't terribly useful, and blocking seemed slower than it should be. It should come as no surprise that Technomancy becomes very very useful.The story was good. It wasn't amazing, but I'd enjoy some sort of sequel or spin-off, if one ever came out. There were a few different options to the storyline, too. I will say that I was annoyed that I couldn't finish Devotion's quest, and I never did figure out why (I'd even turned the other one down completely), but honestly, the relationship quests weren't anything amazing anyway, and the idea of being with either on the General's side made me feel a little squiffy, since they both seem so brainwashed. The only other issue I had the occasional clipping of dead bodies and a missing achievement (Got Ch 2 and 3, no Ch 1, probably Steam's fault, really). Nothing even slightly game breaking.Overall, I thought it was really good, and I'd recommend it, if you like Mass Effect or any other sort of game like this. It's not as good, but I think the developer could really get somewhere with a little support.			"

												What a great game!  Not perfect mind you, but great!  Finally a company truly sees how great a game like Mass Effect can be, and the need for more games like that inspired by its mechanics.  Mars War Logs is that game!  A great sci-fi adventure where your decisions shape the story and truly matter!!!  I hope more companies see this, and make more games like this.  Here are the pros:Pros:- Branching decisions that make you truly feel like a hero who shapes his destiny- Great story with interesting characters- Stunning and Gorgeous graphics- A short but satisfying inclusion of a love interest- Combat that's really fun and reminiscent of the Batman Arkham games (Asylum, City, and Origins)!Like I said before, the game's not perfect.  There are some serious cons that can't be overlooked.  Despite an annoying camera that you have to fight with during every fight scene, the biggest cons come from artificially padding the game's length.  In fact, I think this game could've been cut down to a respectable 8 to 10 hours runtime if the developers took care in tightening up the experience.  Here are the cons: Cons:- The game's built around fetch quests.  In fact, that along with repetitive battles make up 90% of the experience.  These fetch quests are so overly abundant that you're constantly going from point A, to point B, then back to point A, then back again to point B, and yet again back to point A, and so on...  You get the picture.  The first chapter alone made me quit for awhile, because I thought this was it.  I'm glad I stuck it through.- Overuse of respawning fights.  Holy crap!  You finish the first chapter, which is a myriad of fetch quests, and then the second chapter greets you with a never ending barrage of respawning enemies.  You win a fight getting to your first fetch quest objective, then you're told to go back to the area where the fetch quest began, and on your way back, all the guys you've just killed have come back to life in the same positions they were in when you first fought them.  Like I said before, I love the game's battle system, but when you have to tread a same area 20+ times, and fight the same enemies each time, it gets tiresome.  The use of this tired JRPG trope has never been fun.    Conclusion:Even with its glaring cons, Mars War Logs is worth playing all the way to the end.  It even succeeds where Mass Effect failed at the end of its trilogy; a satisfying ending based upon all the choices you've made.  Developer Spiders knows how to treat its customers with respect by offering a complete RPG package without holding parts of the game (story DLC) behind pay walls like Electronic Arts/Bioware (you still can't buy the complete Mass Effect Trilogy with all its story content in a complete collection).  I hope more companies like Spiders take the approach of offering the complete story/side stories in game, and avoid big corporation BS of nickel and diming their customers, and never letting them own their copy of the content.  [Note:  Not speaking bad about DLC, actually I like some forms of DLC, just not the way some companies handle, distribute, or manage it; see said example above.]Sadly, I can't recommend Mars War Logs at full price, because of its cumbersome experience, but it is a game everyone who likes these types of games should play.  There have been several 75% off sales and the game is well worth it at that price.   "

												Mars: War Logs is an odd chimera. The graphics aren't bad for an indie game, and the concepts behind it are fairly solid and intriguing. Unfortunately, there are a lot of technical details that mar the experience, but overall it's a game worth buying - if you're getting it cheap.Combat can (and likely will) be frustrating until you learn all the right tricks. You'll always be outnumbered, often four or five to one, and most foes need to be hit a dozen times before they'll fall - while just five or six hits will often kill you. Expect to spend a lot of time manically rolling from side to side as you try to evade them, or invest heavily in explosives to end combat as quickly as possible.The voice acting is passable, but crude. A number of the voice actors adopt 'silly' voices as they leapfrog from character to character, and several of the actors actually say something entirely different from what the subtitles are saying. Although the main character's voice is decent enough, I found myself often skipping through awkwardly delivered (and profanity-riddled) lines with greater regularity as the game progressed.There are moral choices present in the game, but they're generally very basic. Do you want to murder these people for a few extra dollar? Well then that's evil, and it will be reflected in your reputation. Do you NOT want to murder these people? Oh, well then you're a decent guy. Congrats. It rarely gets much more in-depth then that, though.On the plus side, though, both the skills and the crafting system are fairly well done. Every skill you unlock gives you a very tangible benefit or ability, making it difficult to choose which one you want. Crafting is almost required to progress, and acts as an invaluable aid, both for crafting 'one-use' items like grenades or health injectors and for modifying your basic weapons and armor.All in all, I'd give Mars: War Logs a 7 out of 10. Worth the buy, if you're getting it for ten dollars or less.			"

												Clearly a low budget game, but I thoroughly enjoyed it nonetheless. The story was very interesting and kept me playing through somewhat tedious quests. The voice acting could have been better in some places and often didn't match the on-screen text, but it didn't detract from the playability or enjoyment, in my opinion. I liked the variety of melee weaponry and wardrobe, as well as the crafting aspects and skill trees. I would have liked at least one more type of gun, however, since there was only one (that I could find). Also love that it offered full controller support, always a big plus for me. I think a DLC or two could add a lot to this game and I would buy in a heartbeat. Overall, I really enjoyed Mars: War Logs and I hope to see more polished games from this dev.			"

There are some serious cons that can't be overlooked.  Despite an annoying camera that you have to fight with during every fight scene, the biggest cons come from artificially padding the game's length.  In fact, I think this game could've been cut down to a respectable 8 to 10 hours runtime if the developers took care in tightening up the experience.  Here are the cons: Cons:- The game's built around fetch quests.  In fact, that along with repetitive battles make up 90% of the experience.  These fetch quests are so overly abundant that you're constantly going from point A, to point B, then back to point A, then back again to point B, and yet again back to point A, and so on...  You get the picture.  The first chapter alone made me quit for awhile, because I thought this was it.  I'm glad I stuck it through.- Overuse of respawning fights.  Holy crap!  You finish the first chapter, which is a myriad of fetch quests, and then the second chapter greets you with a never ending barrage of respawning enemies.  You win a fight getting to your first fetch quest objective, then you're told to go back to the area where the fetch quest began, and on your way back, all the guys you've just killed have come back to life in the same positions they were in when you first fought them.  Like I said before, I love the game's battle system, but when you have to tread a same area 20+ times, and fight the same enemies each time, it gets tiresome.  The use of this tired JRPG trope has never been fun.    Conclusion:Even with its glaring cons, Mars War Logs is worth playing all the way to the end.  It even succeeds where Mass Effect failed at the end of its trilogy; a satisfying ending based upon all the choices you've made.  Developer Spiders knows how to treat its customers with respect by offering a complete RPG package without holding parts of the game (story DLC) behind pay walls like Electronic Arts/Bioware (you still can't buy the complete Mass Effect Trilogy with all its story content in a complete collection).  I hope more companies like Spiders take the approach of offering the complete story/side stories in game, and avoid big corporation BS of nickel and diming their customers, and never letting them own their copy of the content.  [Note:  Not speaking bad about DLC, actually I like some forms of DLC, just not the way some companies handle, distribute, or manage it; see said example above.]Sadly, I can't recommend Mars War Logs at full price, because of its cumbersome experience, but it is a game everyone who likes these types of games should play.  There have been several 75% off sales and the game is well worth it at that price.   "

												Clearly a low budget game, but I thoroughly enjoyed it nonetheless. The story was very interesting and kept me playing through somewhat tedious quests. The voice acting could have been better in some places and often didn't match the on-screen text, but it didn't detract from the playability or enjoyment, in my opinion. I liked the variety of melee weaponry and wardrobe, as well as the crafting aspects and skill trees. I would have liked at least one more type of gun, however, since there was only one (that I could find). Also love that it offered full controller support, always a big plus for me. I think a DLC or two could add a lot to this game and I would buy in a heartbeat. Overall, I really enjoyed Mars: War Logs and I hope to see more polished games from this dev.			"

												Mars: War Logs is an odd chimera. The graphics aren't bad for an indie game, and the concepts behind it are fairly solid and intriguing. Unfortunately, there are a lot of technical details that mar the experience, but overall it's a game worth buying - if you're getting it cheap.Combat can (and likely will) be frustrating until you learn all the right tricks. You'll always be outnumbered, often four or five to one, and most foes need to be hit a dozen times before they'll fall - while just five or six hits will often kill you. Expect to spend a lot of time manically rolling from side to side as you try to evade them, or invest heavily in explosives to end combat as quickly as possible.The voice acting is passable, but crude. A number of the voice actors adopt 'silly' voices as they leapfrog from character to character, and several of the actors actually say something entirely different from what the subtitles are saying. Although the main character's voice is decent enough, I found myself often skipping through awkwardly delivered (and profanity-riddled) lines with greater regularity as the game progressed.There are moral choices present in the game, but they're generally very basic. Do you want to murder these people for a few extra dollar? Well then that's evil, and it will be reflected in your reputation. Do you NOT want to murder these people? Oh, well then you're a decent guy. Congrats. It rarely gets much more in-depth then that, though.On the plus side, though, both the skills and the crafting system are fairly well done. Every skill you unlock gives you a very tangible benefit or ability, making it difficult to choose which one you want. Crafting is almost required to progress, and acts as an invaluable aid, both for crafting 'one-use' items like grenades or health injectors and for modifying your basic weapons and armor.All in all, I'd give Mars: War Logs a 7 out of 10. Worth the buy, if you're getting it for ten dollars or less.			"

Then the next instance the game is laughably easy.-The boss mobs in the game are basically just tanks that take more time, and less though to beat. Hit them, then evade.

												Despite many negative reviews from critics, and despite some flaws, for the most part I enjoyed this game and thought it was solid. The story takes place in a gritty, dystopian, almost post-apoc setting and spans 3 chapters. There are a lot of sidequests and character interactions, and the game tends to alternate between big open areas and linear levels, which in my opinion provided a nice change pace.Perhaps what I liked the most was the levelling and the combat. The fighting was incredibly fun, a little awkward at first, but easy to get used to. And the customization of your weapon and armour is great. You get to find various tools and crafting parts that you can use on your gear to give it additional bonuses of your choice. The levelling had 3 different mastery trees - combat, renegade (support abilities like healing and stealth), and technomancy (electrical powers). The levelling happened very frequently, which was great too, since you didn't have to wait for ages to get to the skills you've had your eyes on.The story and setting are pretty interesting. I personally found chapters 1 and 2 to be brilliant, but chapter 3 fell flat on its face. It almost felt as though the game was rushed at the end. What was most interesting perhaps is how at the end of chapter 2 you get a choice of split paths to join one of the 2 factions, which changes some things in chapter 3, but ultimately you end up visiting the exact same locations regardless of which faction you go with. The premise of split paths for the final chapter is fantastic, but the execution resulted in a diluted experience. Going with the Resistance at least was a half-decent attempt at a conclusion that presented some more moral choices down the line. But going with the general felt like it was added into the game at the very last minute just for the sake of having this split path feature.The game also had 3 romance options in it, but this too felt rather lacking and devoid of much dialogue. A few other NPCs felt like they should've gotten more screen time than they actually did, like the bounty hunter friend of the main character. But apart from that, most characters were rather interesting.Overall I'd recommend this game. It's a decent sci-fi cyberpunk RPG and I was immersed for the duration of playing it, even going as far as trying out both story paths for its somewhat disappointing conclusion.			"

												Everything about this game is a good effort, but nothing more than 6/10. The combat is OK, but you don't really get to use all of the skills effectively because the ""magic"" type skills take so long to cast that enemies have time to hit you and interrupt the casting and you can only use them to buff if you get a chance before the fight starts.The last battle is very underwhelming and you expect there's going to be a grand finale, but there isn't.Equipment and crafting is OK, but the weapons are all variations on clubs with different stats. None of them perform differently or have any character.The universe they have created is OK, level design is very linear, and the story is again, just OK; neither the main plot line or the characters really draw you in. Mars:War Logs isn't atrocious, but you could be spending your time on a game that's more fun...			"

												I cant really say that there was to much that stood out to me in Mars War Logs. I had hoped this game would fill a small chunk of time with a decent RPG, and I wasn't expecting much really. However, I was expecting something better than this. The game itself doesn't look all too pretty, even on highest settings. The voice acting is really, really bad, and the characters themselves are really hard to take seriously (Of course the kid named Innocence has to almost get♥♥♥♥♥♥♥by a guy named Fatty...). When you have a character that is so driven to kill you that she abandoned her order, almost get herself killed, then gets saved by you and realizing you're not the monster she thought (with little to no insistence from yourself) you may think that yes, she may decide to join with you. What I don't expect is for her to wake up, spend 30 seconds in your presence (that's not an exaggeration), then offer to paint the taint with you since you are her new mentor. It wholeheartedly broke any respect for future character development I had for this game. Moving on, the back story is very poorly conveyed, the description states that water is scarce and wars are being fought over it, but I never heard mention of water once. The crafting system seems minimal, and the levels themselves feel like they are empty, even though NPC's meander about before you. I will say the combat system does feel similar to the Witcher, but isn't nearly as fluid or responsive. All in all I wasn't impressed. It's not a terrible, mind numbing experience, but it didn't hold my attention long enough to finish it. And to be honest that rarely happens.			"

												Mars: War Logs is a game I really wanted to like.But it just fails to come together as a cohesive whole.And that's the tragic part, this game has so many parts that should be amazing but every step of the way there are little hiccups that bring it down.The game, for me, felt drawn out by bad loading screens as I climbed up or down from items, cringed at horrible dialog, wondered as recruitable NPCs went from bloody vengance to being my friend after a single line of dialog, was gobsmacked as the game forgot to tell me crucial plot important details, and the combat never gained the depth one would have liked.I wanted to like this game, I wanted it to succeed, but it didn't.I hold the greatest hope that these people will try again and their next product will be a polished RPG worthy of great praise from all the lessons learned from this one.But I'm afraid I can't recommend it to anybody.

												This game... where do i start? Well this game is amazing ... alright great start now i just got to keep it going.this game made by Spider Company is amazing, now it does have its flaws, because it was made by a small company on a small budget its lacking in some aspects like seeing the same generic people modles with the same idle animations so for me that kind of wrecks it but if you get past that your golden.Combat is so good i love it, the tech tree? Amazing, crafting? hell yeah crafting, voice acting... lets skip that (because it was pretty terrible to be honest.)If you love walking and bound by flame you will love this. 3 an a half stars from me.

												It was very boring the combat was sloppy and the camera controls were nonexistent. I am not sure what kind of game it was trying to be because the story was a bit confusing but it seems to me it tried too hard and failed. Granted, I didn't get too far into it but it didn't try to suck me in like other story based games but with that voice acting it could not be done. I would personally rate it 4 out of 10.			"

The sidequest are done quite nicely and actually has link to the story.The story is really interesting for such small game it is not vast but it is well written. I didn't face any bugs but I have few problems with some of the games design choices like the NPC dies very easily so you have to work hard to keep them.So for a 20$ price point it is WORTH IT.Please if you like Witcher type games get this game.

												Mars war logs isnt the greatest or longest game, but it is an enjoyable experience. The combat is decently balanced with a slight learning curve at the start to get blocking and dodging right, but after that the experience becomes one of moderate challenge and interesting plot. While the game won't chew up your time like other rpg's, it is just enough enjoyment for the price it's asking. One caveat that you may wish to consider is the ending, without spoiling anything, while it resolves the plot nicely it also feels as if there is so much more out there that you could do beyond the end which may lead to dissapointment in some.

												At first I really liked this game... but after awhile I couldn't stand the combat system. I basically got out of the first area and then restarted, and tried a new character build. But it's actually the combat system that I can't stand, so I can't play it.It uses a similar combat system to the Witcher 2 (attack, block, evade). The problem is that the AI of your companions is useless, if you have any companions, and that if you are fighting two opponents you're guaranteed to lose at rock paper scissors, since one of the two will be countering you, and the other will kill you. That means you're constantly trying to evade and get occasional hits in, in really cramped quarters. It's just not fun combat, at all.			"

Things you can do in Mars: War Logs, listed by frequency:Sick Rolls: You will die almost immediately without them. 90% of your battle strategy will be somersaults, side rolls, and back rolls).Getting things for apparent invalids: Everyone needs something, and, yes, it is on the other side of the bland and lifeless map.Listen to mind-numbing dialog and fifth-rate voice acting: The mish mash of accents and hammed-up acting is intense.Sell all your items one by one: You know how most games allow you to sell items two, or even three, at a time? Not Mars: War Logs. You must sell everything one by one, even if you have fifty of them. Enjoy!Crafting objects that are way more expensive then just buying them: To craft a health injection costs 20 serum, to buy one costs 8. Do the math.Putting sick plates on your dusty clothes: Now you can look like an awesome post-apocalyptic warrior, or maybe you can look like Kevin Costner in The Postman.Actually fighting: When you aren't busy gophering, crafting, and getting lulled into a rage-coma by the silly acting and storytelling, you can beat enemies with improvised weapons. Yes, we are far into the future, but due to apparent reason guns, laser swords, and fun weapons don't exist in this sparse world. You get to beat up on your enemy with light fixtures and mole creature bones.Pros of Mars: War Logs: You will be momentarily distracted from all the evil in this world by this catastrophe. You will get to practice your digital gymnastic skills (except for jumping, because why jump over things when you can roll right past them?).Cons: Playing Mars: War Logs is a lot like playing Solitare. It's basically a way to tell your friends and family that you are exceptionally bored and have nothing on your plate at the moment. It's inviting people to give you a menial task to do, much like the NPCs in Mars: War Logs. Don't let it happen. "

												Absolutely dreadful game. Terrible camera that can be quite nauseating in smaller areas, as you try to navigate your way around, but even worse in combat situations when you cant see what you need to target.The controls are beyond stupid, who ever decided on the layout should be taken outside and,,,,given a very stern talking to, Right Stick turns the camera, if you press it, it locks onto an enemy, so in a confined space, as you try to get the camera into a decent position whilst in combat, you will wind up inadvertently changing target lock onto an enemy you cannot see. The Left Stick controls movement, it also makes you go into a stealth crouch, in combat, when you are trying to dodge around enemies, you sometimes wind up motionless in a stealth crouch, while the enemies beat up on you and you cannot respond.Alot of combat revolves around dodging behind enemies to hit their weak spot, but oftentimes the dodge is slow to react or you dodge in the completely opposite way to the direction in which you intended to dodge.The camera, while being quite jerky also seems quite close to your characters back, so it inhibits you from having a decent view of your surroundings, so when you are trying to follow the really childish and useless map, you spend alot of time trying to find a decent view of the area to see where you need to go.Graphics are servicable, but they can be quite bland, which at times makes differentiating where you can and cannot go a bit of a chore.Story is pretty decent, but the voice acting robs it of any intensity, the characters dont seem to care, which kind of rubs on to you after awhile, so you dont really care either. The characters names are quite bizarrre, but the main bad guy being called Sean doesnt tend to instill any sense of dread, but I guess it's not as bad as the names of the rest of the characters.I had to stop playing, I got sick of fighting the camera and the controls, the story gave me no motivation to ignore these factors, I got the game really cheap, (maybe 3-4 quid) and I still feel cheated.

												This game seems to be criticized for the so-so quality of the plot and the graphics. However, i wouldn't recommend buying this game because of the horrible combat system. It's unpleasant to play and at times damn near impossible to complete. This game gave me nothing but greif, and i recommend you save yourself a migraine and stay away from this game.			"

												While the groundwork for an interesting game with an interesting story is present, the game falls short in almost every aspect.The combat is all over the place, the story is missing important parts and important information, and the environments are all pretty samey. Easily the most promising feature is the crafting system that enables you so mix and match your equipment to fit your play-style.All in all I can't really recommend this game.Also I found it very interesting to pretend that this game takes place in the distant past of Warhammer 40.000 before the Adeptus Mechanicus was established.

												This is a rough one to thumbs up or down, I wish there was a neutral option (pay attention Steam!).  The game is pretty decent, and once you figure out the combat problems and techniques (yes, problems), it's a decent play.  However, the ovewhelmingly big issue is technomancy.  Everyone in the game world talks about technomancers like they are gods.  You turn out to be one and can use these powers.  Except you will NEVER be able to use these powers.  They are amazingly slow, so there is no way you can ever use them in a fight, other than if there is a single opponent who is focused on your companion, and at that point you may as well just club them instead.  They missed a huge opportunity with this massive design flaw to allow you to play different styles of character.  This continues through the other combat options as well, they simply are not designe well enough to allow for anything other than one style of play, when there could be 3 easily.  So, if you ignore technomacny entirely, never waste skill points on it, never try to use it, just focus on grenades, sneaking, and melee as your main points of combat (the occaisional trap and nail gun attack are fine too), then it's a decent play.  Unfortunately the other major flaw is that side quests never show objective markers like main quests, so that's pretty frustrating as well.  Get it on 60% off or more sale, it's not worth paying full price, and there are probably more enjoyable games to blow time on.			"

												It's like a bioware rpg (jade Empire mostly) with a 10th of the budget, a 20th of the charm and none of the redeeming qualities.To elaborate (or basically repeat myself), it has what you would expect from an rpg in 2013: a story, a real-time combat system, some companions, some choices and a few consequences, but the game never excels in any of these or gives you any reason why you would want to play this over any bioware games (yes, even those ones).Wait until The Witcher 2 is cheaper than a fast food boxed meal again if you're one of those weirdos who doesn't have it yet (assuming you want a game containing a story, a real-time combat system, some choices and some consequences).

												Rating: 7/10A well made RPG on a seemingly tight budget...So expect some shortcomings but an overall pleasant RPG experience. Combat mechanics are tight and so is the inventory management. The game falls flat when it comes to voice acting, and the story is not something that will win awards. Graphics are rather average and the environments are bland - But seeing this is a game set in Mars, it feels justified. Certainly worth the price for those who are into RPG's.			"

												Spoiler tags used where necessary.Quick Review:Mars: War Logs may have had a very rough start, but the patches and English dialogue overhaul make it a great experience for anyone who enjoys meaningful quests, a believable world, and realistic characters. I clocked in 30 hours before being completely finished with my first playthrough. My only recommendation for anyone considering purchasing it is to watch a gameplay video showing the combat, because it's likely to turn certain people away immediately. Try to play it like a hack & slash and you will die endlessly.Currently, it has its share of tiny errors that can be easily missed if players aren't looking for them.To avoid bugs/glitches, update your computer's graphics controller, audio controller, and verify the integrity of game cache before playing.Computer: Compaq Presario CQ57-439WM Notebook PCOperating System: Windows 7 Home Premium 64bitGamepad: Logitech Dual Action w/Logitech ProfilerIn-Depth Review://Level DesignThe level design is so well thought out that the entire world feels expansive and every location feels like what it is. Mole caves feel like enclosed spaces with only one exit. Shadowlair feels like a city full of life and people going about their lives even if they aren't happy to be alive. The structures above Roy and the paths he isn't allowed to take, even though they are right in front of him, all make the world feel existent.An hour into the game, the level design reminded me of Phantom Dust. Fourteen hours later, it still did. This isn't a negative trait in the slightest.//CombatCombat is challenging, but simple. Attack, guard-break, block, counter, and dodge make up the basic maneuvers. What players spend their skill points on after leveling-up make up the fun part.Excluding boss fights, players can flee to the next area of a level to skip combat altogether. This could lead to a need for grinding as the game progresses, unfortunately.The response time prevents button mashing since doing so will prevent players from making the quick decisions that are a constant part of combat. There's basically a half-second delay for every movement Roy makes.Party members can hold their own, but not for very long. Their main purpose is to distract enemies while the Roy eliminates as many as he can before they inevitably fall unconscious. They cannot be healed by the player, but their health is fully restored at the end of every battle. This system forces players to engage in combat rather than hide and adds an invisible timer set to how long they have until every conscious enemy gangs up on them. Yep. >TechnomancyThe Technomancer skill tree is a worthy investment due to how fun and powerful it is. Too many enemies? Electric Arc. A single enemy with a high armor rating? Charged Weapon. Feeling overwhelmed? Energy Shield. The more you experiment, the more fun you'll have.>StealthStealth is worth investing in for players who prefer not to go on all-out frontal assaults and enjoy thinning out the enemy first. There are some very tricky levels where playing as a stealth-based character becomes a challenge, but figuring out who to eliminate first and when to do so is part of the fun. Enemies are alerted by fallen comrades and will alert others if players don't quiet them quickly enough. Only further down the Renegade skill tree can players invest in hiding fallen enemies from sight.Party members stay in place and out the way until Roy exits from stealth mode. Since a patrolling enemy can still spot them, players can push party members wherever they want by running into them.//Boss FightsTo my recollection, there are six challenging boss fights in the game. None felt misplaced or thrown in.My only complaint is that, at the final level of the game, there should have been an actual boss fight before the endscene. One or two powerful technomancers that Roy and/or Mary knew from their past would have done the trick.//QuestsThere are more than enough non-mandatory side quests that get players more engulfed in the game world. Not a single quest is dull and pointless. All bring the world together and add character to its many inhabitants.Quest can go anywhere from helping ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s and mutants to stopping serial killers and spying on a political figure. Get ready for some odd situations you may not have been prepared for.//Party MembersThe party members are interesting characters with their own motives, back-stories, and personalities. Personal favorite: Mary. She will say the darnest, hilarious, and most sad things.Players get a choice between three female love interests and gain five party members total. Only four of these five are available for each playthrough, however, and only one is allowed to accompany Roy at a time.Party members actually comment on Roy's decisions (serum extraction and dialogue) every now and then. Those moments help breath life into his character and theirs.//DialogueConversations are well written and funny. There are even references here and there.Players get different options of what to say to NPC's. Some choices will cause Roy to engage in combat and others will cause him to evade it.Get ready for some hilarious conversations.Thanks to the dialogue, I've found myself caring about the characters I met throughout the game. This really backfired when people died.//EndingI enjoyed the Aurora ending cutscenes I got, especially the last one.The endlevel, on the other hand, was lacking in impact. I may have gotten the impression that this was it, but the lack of dialogue during the entire level made it similar to a non-boring grind without the need to level up.I'll give Spiders this much, they were successful in making a grinding level that was entertaining and barely felt like a grind. Unfortunately, they did not give it thrill, impact, or emotion.The dialogue between Roy and his follower at the end was great, though. Just one more moment like or leading up to that beforehand would have done the trick for me.Even having Honour	 speaking out loud about the 'endboss', and adding backstory in the process, would have tremendously helped players care about what happened next. It would have also helped us understand the choice that was made in the first endscene.It's a matter of character depth. More was given in the endscene for Honour and the 'endboss', but not quite enough. For me, the 'endboss' was the only character who lacked depth. All we really got were the reasons for said character's actions, which make sense and explain his/her villainy.Other than the lack of impact and a boss, the endlevel was perfectly fine.//OthersPlayers must choose one of two factions (Resistance or Aurora) two-thirds of the way through the game. Both come with their own female party member / love interest.There are multiple opportunities to end some NPC's lives outside of extracting Serum from defeated foes. This includes resolving conflicts for quests and actually killing one of the potential party members either directly or by abandonment.Serum extracting isn't necessary unless players want to do a 'Dark Side' playthrough, which affects the merchants' prices, intimidation skills of the player, and reactions of party members.The actual war logs used in the game is a nice touch. It adds first person perspective immersion for those who are interested. Think of the journal from the Elder Scrolls series or, more accurately, Arcanum: Of Steamworks & Magick Obscura.There's even a bestiary that includes NPCs and locations.The main menu and combat menu are both very well designed. It took me some time to remember which menu tab (equipment, stats, etc) had what, though.Weapon, armor, item, and component crafting adds an extra layer of strategy to the game. There are no wrong combinations. It all comes down to what works best for your play style.			"

												This game is a great example of what happens when a developer sets his ambition way too high, and creates something that he is not capable of creating. He might have had great ideas, but because his skill was not that great, he ended up creating something of mediocre worth rather than a grand masterpiece. And what a shame it is, because this game did indeed have some potential. Gameplay wise, it is essentially Witcher 2 combined with Mass Effect, but without any of the things that made both games great. Much of the choices that you make don't really matter, and the morality system is pretty ♥♥♥♥♥♥, as all the bonuses that it gives you don't really help at all, nor does the morality system majorly change the way people look at you. The bonus that you get for being a man with an excellent reputation doesn't help due to how useless your NPC party members are, thanks to the fact that the AI in the game for party members sucks♥♥♥♥♥and due to how quickly they die. Merchants are pretty useless unless you are trying to complete certain plot related quests that involve giving serum (money) to NPCs by selling off♥♥♥♥♥♥you don't need or are in need of serum for making meds to use in combat. You can pretty much get a lot of the items you need by looting enemies or by finding some junk piles or crates that are put across the map. Speaking of serum, it is admittedly an interesting kind of currency, but as mentioned before, it's only really useful for those two things, and just like most items, you loot it from crates and enemies. The way you loot it from enemies though is usually through a serum extractor, which apparently kills some guy who should already be dead after being beaten mercilessly by a pipe with a cleaver, and using the serum extractor on a guy who should have already been dead by now also lowers your reputation. Like that totally makes any sense. Had it not been for the skill level cap of three instead of two, it would have been safe to say that the game's skill tree system is an exact rip off of Witcher 2's skill tree. Now, character building is one of the better things about this game, but sadly there still are a couple of problems. For instance, the renegade skill tree has skills that suppossedly help improve the stealth in this game, but stealth is pretty ♥♥♥♥ing useless thanks to how poorly it's implemented. I know Witcher 2 has some questionable stealth as well, but at least that game didn't have you go out of stealth mode after attempting to knock out an enemy or had skills in the skill tree related to a mechanic that was pretty much pointless. The perk system is also pretty stupid. Do X amount of things several times and you can then wait till you level up a few times in order to get X amount of Character Perk Points just to purchase X perk. Why not give the perk after doing X thing several times, or do what the Fallout series does, and give out a perk every few levels. Some perks are also tied to your morality level, which is something that I find to be really stupid. Not being able to use charismatic and intimidative dialogue choices unless your character is (or was at one point) with a good or bad rep shows that the game's view on morality is worse than that of an elementary schooler. Of course, as mentioned before, most of your choices do jack♥♥♥♥♥♥ so what's the point anyways? Combat is pretty much ripped straight from Witcher 2. Everything from the ability to slow down time and switch your skills to the roll n' doge - stab - block gameplay of Witcher 2, with the exception that you can actually heal during combat. It's too bad that the camera can cause you to ♥♥♥♥ up, and although not at the teir of Kingdom Hearts Camera Bad, it still is pretty shoddy. There are also bombs, traps and ranged weapons just like the ones from Witcher 2, but the variety is quite lacking. In fact, you only get one type of trap, one type of gun (a nail gun, which makes me question how they could only have those and not♥♥♥♥♥♥like machine guns and laser pistols), and one type or bomb. The game also allows you one AI-controlled party member (this is where the Mass Effect elements come in), though you might as well be playing without the AI, because about 95% of the time, I found the AI for party members to be one of the most incompetent things ever, as it dies faster than a still-born baby in the womb, and that's even when you tell it to focus on defense. Not being able to go through your party member's equipment in order to give them better weapons and armor doesn't make it any better. The game is also full of stupid invisible walls, and the enviorments are a bore to explore, as you can only enter places that the game deems important. You cannot even enter a single house that belongs to some random person. The civillian NPCs in the game must be the most ballin' people in the universe, because they don't get scared if you pull out your weapon in front of them! Side quests ♥♥♥♥ing suck, as they are primarilly the same boring fetch quests found in plenty of other RPGs, and their rewards usually aren't worth it. Finally, there's crafting, and cliche as it sounds, crafting is perhaps the game's best feature, though I do find it stupid that you can access the craft screen during battle.Before I talk about the story, I would like to say that I wouldn't call the setting a cyberpunk one, as it looks more like an apocalyptic low-tech wasteland with some minor cyberpunk and space opera elements rather than a cyberpunk world full of men with cyberarms that act as weapons mowing down corparates from the local mega-corp. Having hi-tech gloves that let you shoot beams of electricity doesn't make it a cyberpunk game either. The game does however have an interesting setting, despite how generic of a setting Mars tends to be. Of course, the game has to have poorly explained lore that is extremely hard to follow, and this is despite the patch that was suppossed to fix a lot of the problems with the script. The characters? I didn't really like any of them, and the way the characters act is so unreal that I highly doubt that anyone could truly care for them. My least favorite charcters would have to either be Roy or Mary. Roy because he's the typical man with a mysterious past type of character, and Mary because she suddenly goes from being this ♥♥♥♥♥ who wants to kill you and hates your guts to this ♥♥♥♥♥ who wants to ♥♥♥♥ you just because you saved her, and she doesn't even have a hint of suspicion about you afterwards. Presentation wise, the game is what you would expect from a small studio. Not too bad, but there could have been way more colours than just orange, red, black and grey. Character designs range from okay to ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ looking, Mary included. Enviorments tend to be boring as hell, and as mentioned before, are not very explorable due to how many invisible walls there are. The music is pretty forgettable as well. Finally, there's the voice acting, and holy♥♥♥♥♥♥is it bad most of the time. Sometimes, it's actually quite funny, while other times it's cringe worthy, and of course there's always the mixture of the two. Now, I should note that it is better than the voice acting that was in the game at launch, but it still is a long way from being good. In conclusion, Mars War Logs is average at its best, and mediocre at its worst, and, at least in my opinion, is not worth its current price tag, nor is it an RPG that I would recommend to people looking for a great RPG experience. If, however, you still want to give the game a go, do what I did, and buy it on sale for really cheap. If I had to give it a rating, the most I would give it would be a 5/10.			"

												I rarely stop playing a game after such a short time, but honestly this is really bad. I don't know if it's having to use the game controller without strafing a-la 1990s gaming or if it's the bad male-prison almost♥♥♥♥♥♥in the first scene, or the bad acting, or the bad combat made worse by having to move the camera slowly with the other controller - although perhaps there's a setting to make that faster or change that - or maybe it's the painful opening of doors or climbing ladders with an option to skip that is more jarring than waiting for the open-door/climb ladder cut scene, or maybe it's just really an amazing game and I should givie it more than 30 minutes but really I don't have time for this♥♥♥♥♥♥ I bothered to write this negative review, that's more than it deserves. Apologies to the devs and all their hard work. Maybe it's a great game later on but I just feel like I am grinding already and the story is pure cheese tropes, maybe it gets better later I can't be arsed playing on to find out bye bye			"

												Really tried to like this game....but after 6+ hours I just could not do it anymore and uninstalled. Voice acting is some of the worst I have ever heard, very repetitive, and just down right boring. I appreciate what they developer tried to do but this game is a no go in my books. Please spend your hard earned money somewhere else!			"

												Probably one of the most frustrating yet uninteresting combat systems I've encountered.  Granted, I'm only a couple hours into the game but it's already lost me.  Your companions are next to useless, walking pylons at best, and you spend the majority of most battles leaping around the battlefield or blocking a flurry of blows in order not to get stunlocked.  I don't mind a challenge, Darksouls/Demonsouls are difficult games but there you at least feel like you lost a fair fight.  This game is just tedious.I'm going to refrain from commenting on the story, haven't experienced enough to give it a fair shake.  However, so far the majority of the quests have been fairly bland in nature (talk to person A or find enough of part B) which are usually solved by walking around talking/clicking on everything until it says you did what you're supposed to.  A few of the quests appear to have some branching paths, which I regard as a good effort, but ultimately aren't really used that effectively and end up being fairly bland.I might go back and give it another shot at some point, but at the moment I'm glad I only spend $5 on this.

												I played the game and had the problem a quest was broken. A companion quest. Anyone who played games like Mass Effect or Dragon Age knows companion quests are something you really want to do.I posted on their forums about the broken quest and got a standard-reply like I should reinstall (or whatever it was). When I posted this is no help because I already did this before I posted I never got any other answer.I haven't ever finished the game because I refused to abandon my companion quest. This really sucks. A simple ""sorry, the quest is broken"" or ANY answer related to my post would have been enough.I will never buy any game from this company as they are not even helping out once THEIR game has bugged quests which even influences the story. The Mars: War Logs forums were quite dead at that moment so it was impossible to oversee my answer.			"

												It's not that this game is bad, per say. It's just...okay. I picked this up really cheap and beat it. It's not something I really regret, just nothing I can recommend to anyone looking for a good RPG. It's got issues with game balance (you always feel underpowered and the only abilities really worth using are the nailgun, grenades and energy shield.), the final area can bug out near the end if you use stealth and companions are only useful as a distraction.To be fair, the voice work isn't too bad, the story is actually not that bad, everything looks decent and I like the weapon and armour customisation. It seems like this could have been a lot better than it ended up being. I chalk it up to inexperience on the developer's part. If it's on sale again, you could certainly do worse but don't buy full price.			"

												3/10 - This game is absolute not to buy! This game is never get finished. the whole time you stupidly run again and again in nice designed but boring maps. you dont have alternativ ways to solve quest. its nearly always Kill-them-all or run trough and get some timewasting other stuff. The combat engine maybe would be nice, if the skills are where more balanced and the the fights where more interessting. If you played the first 3-5 fights you nearly see them all. very very boring! Stealth-kills are a nice idea but nearly never rougelike skills can be used to solve or evade fights. The complete camera is absolut crap and very anyoing. One of the realy good parts are the characters, the are very nice designed and emotional. The story is OK, not more not less. One of the most frustrating things in my opion is the loot system. you can loot enemys after you won the fight, but for what? The crafting of items are very very depressiv und quit useless. You nearly always get the same things - leather, scraps, ammo,... and than after you loot it, you can loot it again to gain some money/potions for trading. should be a good-bad thing with impression of the people, i dont see any of them any time. very very sad.

												Mars: War Logs is video games' answer to a crappy B-movie. It's entertaining for the way it tries to be serious, but it utterly fails on so many levels. There are hints of something decent there and the game isn't actively bad, even if there are moments where you'd think that was what they were going for, but I can't recommend it. It's worthwhile B-game material for those who like that sort, and Aurora the Technomancer is like Russ Meyer's version of a Bene Gesserit.			"

												This game is a mixed bag.The combat is decent enough, you can acquire a pretty large variety of skills to make unique playstyles.  The enemy's attacks have unusual hitoxes and will whiff if you're too close.  When an enemy takes too much damage at one time, they'll have a kind of ""dodge timer"" where they will dodge out of the majority of player attacks for set amount of time.  This feels like a lazy way to prevent infinite hitstun from player attacks and can sometimes punish the player for no real reason.Difficulty scaling is poorly done, enemy's health and damage increases dramatically and possibly activates dodge time more quickly.  Beginning game becomes rather brutal.Plot takes quite a while to actually develop.  More like 2 plotlines that are loosely connected.The hub worlds are alright, although they start to feel more like a chore as the game goes on.The equipment and skill management is where this game shines.  Each skill feels like it adds something major to your gameplan without making it feel like you simply ""outlevel"" encounters.  The equipment modification system is really nice and helps completement your skill build.  But, unfortunately your options are very limited until roughly halfway through the game.			"

												It really pains me to give this game a thumbs down. We all want to see indie developers with nothing but guts and ambition show the big studios what-for. In this case however, it was just too ambitious for a small team. There's nothing outright offensive about the title, (other than the voice acting... Good God...) but neither is there anything noteworthy. The combat is a bad version of The Witcher 2 with only a few enemy types, the story is a bad version of Red Faction with little nuance and the dialog is... Awful in every way. There's no reason to play this game over the games that inspired it. Then you factor in a forgettable soundtrack, muddy graphics, awkward animations, and limited itemization and I can't really recommend Mars: War Logs to anyone. The highest praise I can give is that the crafting system is unique and highly customizable, but the itemization and combat are so bad that you'd rather just end the game quicker. Here's hoping that Spiders's next game is a hit!			"

												As much as i wanted to enjoy this game, the awful combat makes this game near unplayable. You will routinely die after being repetitively teamed up on by enemies. You have mines, grenades, nail guns etc to try to break up the group attacks but it rarely works and you will be over powered again and again by unfair groups of enemies. Your companion, Innocence, is useless, and the character animations used to do something simple like place a mine or throw a grenade are painfully slow and leave you open to attacks that you can't roll away from. I would not waste your money on this frusteration.			"

												Mars: War Logs is an indie rpg developed by Spiders who recently brought us Bound by Flame. Both games look exciting first, but suffer from certain problems which break the gameplay.Pros:There are still a few parts of the game, that may persuade the player to give a chance to the product. The graphics are okay, there is not much to see, but overall the places and people are believable, however do not expect anything fancy. The game kicks off better as it progresses later. I liked the soundtrack in the main menu, which gives the mood. In the early fights also the combat feels good, I had the feeling that something good will come. There are customization options also, which are somewhat in-depth. You can reinforce your gear, both weapons and armor for example with different materials. There are also options to make things out of junk, like medpacks, ammo, etc. The story and dialogues are consumable, nothing really poetic or anything, but it is still one of the better parts of the overall experience. You also have some optional choices which will influence your reputation.Cons:And, here comes the cons, because the game has a lot of them. As I got involved into bigger and harder fights I started to see clearly how the combat system cannot handle them. When you face more than 3 enemies at the same time it is starting to get difficult to plan your moves. The target system is not working as intended, and without it you can hardly keep track the movement of the enemy. Usually I get about half a minute before Innocence is incapacitated and all the enemies rush at me. The best tactic is to flee, but there is simply not enough room to do so. The skills also need time to activate, and as the opposite fighters are moving fast, it is almost impossible to use them due to interruption. Overall combat is a mess, nothing more. Also the are problems with the corpses. After some fights I needed to search after the bodies, because they stuck into the wall, and cannot be seen right away. The places looks tiny, corridor-like and they feels alike. The theme itself is not that bad, but is not a rule that each of the sections need to look almost the same.Overall, I can recommend this title only to those who are really die-hard fans of the rpg genre and have the patience for this.MY OPINION: 6.5/10 (AVERAGE)Graphics: 7/10World Design: 7/10Gameplay: 6/10Sound: 7/10Replay Value: 6/10			"

The game starts out a bit rough for combat but gets much easier as you go. It's just a clunky janky mess.The writing is pretty terrible and the characters are just laughably bad. They try to make it seem like you have a choice in how things go, but you really don't. Basically everything you say or do is inconsequential with the exception of the fates of two or three npcs.I really can't think of any positives that make the game worth the purchase.

And They do have a different type of gameplay and the Storyline is Unique. It takes place in Mars who doesnt want to go to Mars, Well I do and I like to explore other Planets. I thought they would have new technology to play with, in the game. I mean come on there on Mars and they can spend a better prison. The thing Is the gameplay Is very Rigid. In the Gameplay There Is a constane frame adjustment which Is annoying for my eyes, for Example (Lag) CONSTANLY and Is to much to bare.  I feel lost in the story because Im not understanding my own character. I dont feel very immerse in this game at all. I read in the Internet this game suppose to speak in France Dialogue. Im playing it in English but there are no feeling toward the characters, feels plain.I am definitely not use to how this game plays, looks, and feel. Because I know that we already overcome this type of problems to enjoy the game not feeling DULL. I definitely think that this game could be better.  "

												Bad writing, HORRIBLE voice acting, and overall bad gameplay. I stopped playing VERY early into the story mostly because it gets very uncomfortable to watch. And not in a thought provoking way either. Let's just say they bring up sexual assault in the tutorial. That and other weird♥♥♥♥♥♥didn't make me think. It didn't make me invested in the characters. It just made me go ""yikes."" and put down the game.			"

												This is an average game, it borrows the core mechanics from games like 'Witcher 2' and 'Mass Effect', it runs short on graphics and has some of the worst voice acting in a game i have ever heard! EVER. The fighting is good and feels smooth but lacking challenge and depth. I would give this 6/10!			"

												Where to start this review of 'Mars: War Logs'. I understand that I have only play just under 20minets. But just hear me out.This game was Relese in 2013. Expectations where high. But i do under stand the RPGs are really big games to buildAs a pc gamer, I was expecting this game to be good from that trailer that Spiders Studios release. But this is where it has taken as complete U-Turn. Play with as mouse and keybourd like that majoraty of PC plays. We began this game with as avrage cut scene to get some back story, befoer handed the controls. After going through 5mins of base story that explains who this character taht you will be getting the story through. We meet the character that you play. Starting out where i can now move it began to fall apart. I can see veay clearly that this game was 100% desihned for a controler not keybourd and mouse. normal that is not a really big problem for me but this game just felt really clunky through all the animation blending and hot the character respoind to the commands.Combat was very basic only need about 3 keys to fight Strick, Block and Block Breaking. A very simple fighting game style, but I felt it need something more something to stand alone from other RPG's. But saddly i had to stop after finishing of the first guy.After completeing just the little bit I was done.Texture where very low even on high I can see all the detail in the 512X512 maps. I was hopeing that they would have pushed it a little more.Animations Felt like it was on the second pass of the Animation stage and need more time spent on. Considering there are lot of closes ups on faces and the lip sinking was off.Controls really clunky, if going to play it controler you may get better game play.Over all if your RPG fan maybe try it if you have finished all other games from AAA companys. If your looking to buy it there are a lot better RPGs out there than this one. That is why i would NOT Recommend this on PC.			"

 Mars: War Logs In the masterfully crafted ""Mars: War Logs"" (which is in fact a war-diary), we are transported to a martian ""anti reality"", where societal norms regarding sexual orientation are questioned and examined in series of autisticly voice-acted scenes populated with uncanny-valley robo-people. ""The War"", (referenced in the title), is actually culture-war being fought not only on the Martian landscape, but within ourselves.  Story 10/10   Gameplay 10/10   Graphics 9/10   Overall Like a million/10 Story 10/10: In this game, you play  a man metaphorically questioning his own sexuality whilst constantly being thrust into combat scenarios  where the only way to survive is to forcefully bludgeon others with handcrafted electro-phalluses.  Our  protagonist hails from a martian colony called ""Aurora"";  a symbol of cis-genedered norms. Aurora issues ""virtue-names"" to each inhabitant  like ""temprance"", ""honesty"", ""morality"", ""steely-dan"" and ""jazz-organ"" as if to imply a life of freedomless societal predestination. Our doucheburn-wearing antihero held rank in ""The Source"". ""The Source"" is a guild of ""technomancers"", a group of pick-up artists who have dedicated a lifetime of hot-gluing wires and glowsticks to their bodies in a misguided attempt at peacocking. Rejecting this worldview, he is cast down into a dirty man-prison festering with debauchery. It is in this gay-underworld that our protagonist takes his first steps in breaking away from breeder-culture and changes from his assigned name ""Temperance"" to ""Roy"", the name of a gay space-cowboy.All is well in the Brokeback Mars Mountain-Prison until one day a strapping young bronco named ""Innocence"" appears one day, in the shower room. After defending him from an attempted♥♥♥♥♥♥(yes that's what happens), ""Innocence"" thanks you and becomes your new buckaroo-boyfriend. Innocence then keeps a scrapbook, where he draws fanart about the main character, and talks about his feelings. (This is where the game gets its name, by the way.)After bonding with Innocence by digging through trash bins, rubble heaps and rotten mushroom patches for a few hours, Roy and his young buck decide to ""break out of the closet"" by stealing a train, and returning to Aurora. Ideally, this is where where they will organize a ""resistance"" that will pridefully march in the streets and overturn societal norms.Gameplay 10/10:The gameplay consists primarily of combat and dialogue. The dialog feels largely forced, much like the expectation our protagonist feels to conform to society. Your character is almost entirely sent on errands, in an effort to highlight the meaninglessness of life without freedom. You are both figuratively and literally wasting away in a prison! This nihilist gesture is surely to underscore the overarching theme of resisting cultural assimilation and cisexual assumptions.In a bold move, the extended metaphor of sexual discovery is manifest in akward camera angles during combat. The audience is constantly asking questions like ""what am I really trying to see?"" and ""who am I, in all of this?"". The camera encourages you to explore new ways of seeing reality.  The enemies you fight during combat consist of your sexual rivals in the prison, cave dwelling testicle-mutants and pick up artists wearing rave-gloves. Despite the fact humans have clearly terraformed Mars, you are restricted to fighting with nailguns and crude batons. You must therefore ""assert dominance"" over your foes by forcefully employing these erotically-shaped instruments in a symbolic display of fertility and potency.

A Screenshot of Mars: War Logs
By: BigDen




This half-man half-testicle is a visceral manifestation of your latent sexual urges.However, with the slow response speed and erratic camera movements, much like the theme of the game, the real enemy is yourself, thus highlighting the thematic motifs present in the story.Graphics 9/10:In another bold artistic gesture, the developers decided to maek every mesh appear as robotic and lifeless as possible during the dialogue. This is clearly an allusion to a dystopian reality, where ""every cog has its place"" and personal freedom is stifled. Every landscape is a exercise in monotony and every texture is visual litter.  Everything, (even your clothing), is covered with the same blurry rust, soot and grunge; a clear attempt to give Mars a literal and figurative sense of 'uncanny valley', a fitting location for our symbolic tale. I feel like this Idea could have been explored more throughly, hence the 9.Overall integer-overflow/10:If you're the right kind of player, itching for a game to make you question yourself, social norms, and why you spend money on Mars: War Logs, this is a game that will raise the right questions. I have never seen a game so experimentally break the 4th wall by intentionally crippling core gaming features in service to a noble theme. Bravo!Sadly however; I cannot recommend this game. I don't think most people are ready for this. Mars logs is simply ahead of its time.

												It is okay if you are not easily offended by all of the foul language.  There ought to be some type of warning in the rating (It is not clearly listed on the steam store page like many games).Combat is so-so.  It suffers from bad camera angles that make it a bit clunky.  The crafting offers some options to customize armor and weapons, but is kind of shallow.Graphics are ok, but definately several years old.Voice-overs are missing a little something, but help to move the story along.All in all it just didn't have anything that really grabbed me and wanted to make me keep playing.

												After reading some reviews I decided to give M:WL a chance.That said, I played for a couple of minutes, took a look at the skill system, watched some cut sequences and engaged in some conversations.Solution: M:WL feels and plays like a consoleport with crappy cutscenes, more crappy dialogues and most crappy voice acting. Sadly, this is topped by that terrible combat mechanics: it is just a bad done clone of hack&slash (not that I've ever liked that genre). I want my money back. Now.			"

												Your first impression will be that this game was made on an extremely tight budget.  The voice acting was pretty bad, the animations were anything but smooth, and while the graphics aren't bad, they're not good either. All that being said, this is a satisfying game as long as you're not expecting a mind-blowing experience.  You can genuinely feel for some of the characters and the story is very interesting, even though its rather simple. It is apparrent that the developers put all of what they had into this game, it just wasn't enough to make it great. Also as a side note, the combat system is rather frusterating at times but it doea have a satisfying punch behind it.			"

												First: it's a fun game. It's worth $5 and 15 hours, but don't buy it unless it's on sale.This is a case of a game not having the resources required to meet its vision.  The core idea behind the game is good, if not entirely gripping:  you take the role of a typical hero on Mars, deciding the fate of its people and factions.  The area design is decent: combats are interesting and there's a certain limited amount of exploring to do.  The environments and character models are visually appealing, but there are far too few of them. The entire game, apart from one area at the end, uses almost all the same object models (doors, walls, boxes, piles of junk, etc).The skill design is decent: there are actual choices to be made that affect how your character approaches combat.  There are a few choices to be made, story-wise, but it never feels like they really have an impact.If you're looking for another Mass Effect, this isn't it, although it tries to be.  If you're looking for 15-20 hours of solid gameplay, go for it.			"

												This game is no Triple AAA title, but I think this game is pretty decent. You will see that world maps(diffrent areas) is pretty dead, and NPC are quite unalive too, but RPG elements are pretty good, you can choose your gaming style, which affects your reputation, and that will affect your dialoge options, which should affect your ending a little bit. Olny one thing, what i did not like about this game is that in combat you are allways fustratingly undernumberd, and companinons are good for decoys for some soilders, so you could kill off some before you have to deal with whole army. If you like RPG/little action wait for sale and you will be set off for 10-12 hours.			"

												Many people who review this indie games would come up with a conclusion of ""This game is great for an indie developer"".While that's very true, I believe that this isn't just great for an indie game - but instead, this game is AMAIZING! Full stop.""Why?"" you might ask.Well...I like this think this game captures enough of how a lot games used to be: focusing just the right amount of time on each part of the game; story, world, environment (visuals), characters and gameplay. Can't say that about many games that get released these days.The game introduces you to the concept quickly, yet efficiently. There's just enough said so that not too much is told and it makes you want to go explore and learn about the world around you, and characters.The combat isn't perfect, I have to admit. There are a couple of faults and bugs here and there. But it's on of those combat models which is challanging - and requires quite a few tries until you get used to it. Especially when you're trying to complete the game on hardcore difficulty...The best part of the game is the story. There is no ""right or wrong"" or ""good or bad"". It's a story, with complications and twists round every corner. I won't spoil too much...It provides a good 10-15 hours depending on how many side missions you take on and how much time you invest in conversations. Usually, I would say it's too short - but it didn't cost a lot (I got it when released - not on a sale).So yeh. Get this game - it is simply amaizing! I'd really recommend it!			"

												Its a pretty good game, not disimilar to start wars knights of the old repbulic and mass effect.It has a nice resource system, scavenging parts, and upgrading weapons and armour. Equally it has a choice driven story with actions changing the game progression. The combat is pretty fun, although once you have the mechanics down it feels the same every time. Theres also a leveling system although its not as intuitive as it could easily have been, and the explanations of how it works are fairely poor.The game suffers from some very basic visuals, and poor oversight in its development, such as when I spared some people and it stated id killed them in the diary.Equally, some points of the plot are very poorly written, to the extent that on the spot you could come up with more feasible dialogue.During cutscenes or dialogue exchanges you can also notice the seams where bits are played based on your choices, which kind of kills the atmosphere. And the dialogue is very limited, with very few available exchanges or choices.Perhaps the most damning fact is the game is brutally short. For the time iv played it i would expect to be no more than a quarter of the way through it. It feels like it could have been so good, and at times you actually become interested in whats going on, but the development is so shallow, and as soon as you find something interesting the game rushes onto something else.Had I paid full price, this would be a down vote and id be pretty angry. But given I got it cheap on sale, and that it is a pretty small publisher im pretty happy with it.If you can get it cheap, go for it. Otherwise id avoid it.			"

												When a RPG or action-RPG is smaller, simpler and humbler than ""monsters"" as Morrowind or Mass Effect it doesn't mean that it's a bad game; it depends of their potential and the better or worse development of its own scope and capabilities. The stealth subject is, by far, the worst implemented part of the game. You cannot exploit all of its hidden potential despite you upgrade al your stealh related skills (for not mentioning that you're the one alerting a gang of idle/patrolling foes, but your partners are blessed with ""feather feet"" and won't alert them even when they run in front of them -that makes a bad and very ugly impression-). But the rest of the game features goes from the good implemented to the very well implemented. All the RPG part in this game is very simple, but you won't find any lack of fun for it. Visuals in this game are always good and, sometimes, they're stunning. Its atmosphere is well implemented (in the line of Mad Max, Chronichles of Riddick or Borderlands).Combats are tremendous, almost a matter of button twitching but, again, fun and addictive (the fact of almost stopping the time -but not completely- for determining an action or give an order to your partner gives a chance for you to not think only about twitching).Sounds and ambient music make its role, and voice are pretty well (at least the voices in english, I can't understand some comments regarding to the awful voice acting but to refering to other languages, or it's me that I ain't so demanding on this term -but I don't think so-). :PThrowing sand to the eyes of human enemies not protected with Riddick-style-sunglasses is a feature I'd never seen before in a game, and useful a lot.History is fragmented, there's not a clearly central plot involved as their tittle (""War Logs"") suggests, and mainly focused in the friendship between the two protagonists and their fight for survival.In resume, a well planned game (and well executed almost all the time) that is absolutely worthing of a try. Just don't expect a complex and big ""monster"" as the above mentioned (which they're not games, they're UNIVERSES) with a rich amount of player statistics.			"

												Mars: War Logs piqued my interest right from the start. This indie role-playing game boasts a unique setting and world to explore. The game has plenty of action, but also provides customization through skill trees and crafting.Both of those aspects are nice, but don't feel like fully fleshed-out concepts. I find myself wishing the game was longer, not only because it's a bit on the short side, but because I want to learn more about the fascinating places and characters introduced in the story. This game feels like a great introduction to this universe and I hope to see more.  It could use a bit more polish and variety, but the game remains fun depsite the rough edges and is certainly worth playing.			"

												Why do I like this game? Probably just because I love games that allow you to be the one to make the main character's moral decisions and influence the game's final ending. I beat the game pretty quickly despite the fact that I had to replay multiple parts, and I didn't love the combat, though it was still fun. I found the few characters that were actually developed to some degree to be quite interesting, and the ability to influence the final outcome, and who lives and dies is just something I always enjoy in an rpg.What's wrong with it? For one dialog is confusing, it's not like in mass effect which gives you, good bad and neutral, in fact it makes little distinction obvious, at times I felt like there was no difference in the choices I was given, and what irrirated me the most was when I clicked an option, but what the character said seemed to be nothing like what the option said. Also as I said before, combat was relatively fun and challenging but nothing to write home about.			"

												Its a pretty good game, not disimilar to start wars knights of the old repbulic and mass effect.It has a nice resource system, scavenging parts, and upgrading weapons and armour. Equally it has a choice driven story with actions changing the game progression. The combat is pretty fun, although once you have the mechanics down it feels the same every time. Theres also a leveling system although its not as intuitive as it could easily have been, and the explanations of how it works are fairely poor.The game suffers from some very basic visuals, and poor oversight in its development, such as when I spared some people and it stated id killed them in the diary.Equally, some points of the plot are very poorly written, to the extent that on the spot you could come up with more feasible dialogue.During cutscenes or dialogue exchanges you can also notice the seams where bits are played based on your choices, which kind of kills the atmosphere. And the dialogue is very limited, with very few available exchanges or choices.Perhaps the most damning fact is the game is brutally short. For the time iv played it i would expect to be no more than a quarter of the way through it. It feels like it could have been so good, and at times you actually become interested in whats going on, but the development is so shallow, and as soon as you find something interesting the game rushes onto something else.Had I paid full price, this would be a down vote and id be pretty angry. But given I got it cheap on sale, and that it is a pretty small publisher im pretty happy with it.If you can get it cheap, go for it. Otherwise id avoid it.			"

												So just finished this game (only 18 hours start to finish so short game) and its a bag of mixed feelings on it.The Good:The idea, premise, and even setting of game is spectacular and draws you in. You want to like this gameThe story is good but also bad (thats explained in the bed section)The Bad:The combat in this game sucks huge. The timing is off and the UI is clunky. Many time syou will enter combat to find out you have no companion because he/she is stuck in the entrace still.-As said above, story is mixed bag of good and bad. Why its that is it makes these huge leaps forward in time with no warning or exlaination. One character literally went from hating me and wanting to kill me, to questioning her faith, to being in love with me, IN ONE CONVERSATION. So you end up doing adouble take and wondering what the hell just happened.-Thats the problem, the writers knew where they wanted to take the story, and its a good story, but instead of flowing from start to finish its jump jump jump and often in those juumps your left wondering how such a huge change happened.-Maps/zones are quit small in size and because of that you find yourself loading into combat befor eyour compaion joins inOver all I would give this game a 9/10 on potential but a 5/10 on delivering and meeting potentialThe concept is sound and appealingThey just needed better writers and more back story and lore to discover			"

												--Updated--Mars War Logs is a third person RPG with a not so bad story settled in an intresting environment, actually the background had a lot of potential, enought for a prequel/sequel/whatever without the risk o being repetitive.Because of the potential of this environment I expected a little bit more details in the story and side characters development, more than often the characters move in a world that they undestand pefectly (well, it's actually their world, you know) and the player is left wondering about how the plot twist and turn, not knowing much of the background details that may help to get a better grasp of the story and it's meaning.Of course is not like you have no idea of what are you doing, mostly you have to fight for your skin, like in 90% of games out there, and the story is pretty straightforward, maybe just a little bit too straightforward. (mind peolpe, I'm the kind of person that read every single page of a diary, piece of codex, random book, signs and talk to everyone, even if my character is on fire and the NPC is an anvil, so try to take the critique about the story by the point of viev of a details lover)Switching to a more technical side, MWL is a normal RPG, you gain experience by kicking butts, level up and then build you character choosing freely among three branches of specialization.There is also a nice upgrading and crafting system for armor and weapons.The gameplay is actually good when you learn not to freak out because of the game controls, it is similar to what I experienced with The Witcher, when you learn when you are suppose to hit, it goes all nice and smooth.In the end I really liked this game, even if some potential on story, lenght and character development was wasted, it offer a nice min10-max15 hours of gaming and some intresting story and characters.I actually won't mind if Spiders would pop out a more detailed and longer sequel, the lore they have built is worth further depening.-Please don't mind my ""monkey on acid"" english-			"

												A sudden game to show up on Steam, and their trailer really sold me into buying the game.Overall the game can be completed over 2 days, but less if you decide to skip side mission.The odd story is actually that another person is telling the beginning, but this will ultimately change depending on what side you chose later in the game.There is a good difficulty in the game, and you need to be choseful into combat depending on what ""spec"" you go with. Renegade being the rogue is very useful compared to many other games. Later on you unlock the Technomancer ability, which is sort of a caster style with lightning. It's pretty steam punk'ish.In term of quality, then I'd compare this game with Of Orcs and Men. The graphics, sound etc. are fluid and run extremely well. When starting Mars: War Logs you more or less instantly pop into the menu. The only difference is that this game is somewhat more short, yet quite entertaining.			"

												Mars: War Logs is like a mini FO3, but on Mars.  It has the crafting (which I'd love to see more usage of, I had an insane amount of mats left over, and no new items in Chapter 3), the skill tree, and tacticts aspects that I'd expect from this kind of RPG.  There is definite replayability based on the skill tree and ""good vs. evil"" personality aspects, but little else.The story was interesting, but the companions were either disturbingly 2d or just not developed at all, regardless of the dialogue available. Given its replay aspect, I'd give it a thumbs up, but up against other games of similar cost, I'd give it a pass.  It does make me want to dig into FO3 though, which has been sitting idle in my account for a long time...			"

												When a RPG or action-RPG is smaller, simpler and humbler than ""monsters"" as Morrowind or Mass Effect it doesn't mean that it's a bad game; it depends of their potential and the better or worse development of its own scope and capabilities. The stealth subject is, by far, the worst implemented part of the game. You cannot exploit all of its hidden potential despite you upgrade al your stealh related skills (for not mentioning that you're the one alerting a gang of idle/patrolling foes, but your partners are blessed with ""feather feet"" and won't alert them even when they run in front of them -that makes a bad and very ugly impression-). But the rest of the game features goes from the good implemented to the very well implemented. All the RPG part in this game is very simple, but you won't find any lack of fun for it. Visuals in this game are always good and, sometimes, they're stunning. Its atmosphere is well implemented (in the line of Mad Max, Chronichles of Riddick or Borderlands).Combats are tremendous, almost a matter of button twitching but, again, fun and addictive (the fact of almost stopping the time -but not completely- for determining an action or give an order to your partner gives a chance for you to not think only about twitching).Sounds and ambient music make its role, and voice are pretty well (at least the voices in english, I can't understand some comments regarding to the awful voice acting but to refering to other languages, or it's me that I ain't so demanding on this term -but I don't think so-). :PThrowing sand to the eyes of human enemies not protected with Riddick-style-sunglasses is a feature I'd never seen before in a game, and useful a lot.History is fragmented, there's not a clearly central plot involved as their tittle (""War Logs"") suggests, and mainly focused in the friendship between the two protagonists and their fight for survival.In resume, a well planned game (and well executed almost all the time) that is absolutely worthing of a try.

												First: it's a fun game. It's worth $5 and 15 hours, but don't buy it unless it's on sale.This is a case of a game not having the resources required to meet its vision.  The core idea behind the game is good, if not entirely gripping:  you take the role of a typical hero on Mars, deciding the fate of its people and factions.  The area design is decent: combats are interesting and there's a certain limited amount of exploring to do.  The environments and character models are visually appealing, but there are far too few of them. The entire game, apart from one area at the end, uses almost all the same object models (doors, walls, boxes, piles of junk, etc).The skill design is decent: there are actual choices to be made that affect how your character approaches combat.  There are a few choices to be made, story-wise, but it never feels like they really have an impact.If you're looking for another Mass Effect, this isn't it, although it tries to be.  If you're looking for 15-20 hours of solid gameplay, go for it.			"

												Many people who review this indie games would come up with a conclusion of ""This game is great for an indie developer"".While that's very true, I believe that this isn't just great for an indie game - but instead, this game is AMAIZING! Full stop.""Why?"" you might ask.Well...I like this think this game captures enough of how a lot games used to be: focusing just the right amount of time on each part of the game; story, world, environment (visuals), characters and gameplay. Can't say that about many games that get released these days.The game introduces you to the concept quickly, yet efficiently. There's just enough said so that not too much is told and it makes you want to go explore and learn about the world around you, and characters.The combat isn't perfect, I have to admit. There are a couple of faults and bugs here and there. But it's on of those combat models which is challanging - and requires quite a few tries until you get used to it. Especially when you're trying to complete the game on hardcore difficulty...The best part of the game is the story. There is no ""right or wrong"" or ""good or bad"". It's a story, with complications and twists round every corner. I won't spoil too much...It provides a good 10-15 hours depending on how many side missions you take on and how much time you invest in conversations. Usually, I would say it's too short - but it didn't cost a lot (I got it when released - not on a sale).So yeh. Get this game - it is simply amaizing! I'd really recommend it!			"

The crafting system is actually really cool, the story is already compelling and I am only about an hour and a half in, Good game thus far. Combat is a little clunky but the full controller support is a big plus. If you have $20 and looking for something new, this game might be right for you.			"

												This is low key the most under rated RPG ever. Yes the budget may have been like 2 cents and it may have been way too ambitious of a project but the end result is still very much worth checking out. If you are like me and don't really care about all the fluff Bioware has been adding to their games recently, but still like their stories and characters, this game is for you.  Important note: They got a lot of new voice actors and re did a lot of the bad voice overs. So the annoying voices in the trailers are not actually in the game (although LOL@ Innocence randomly getting a British accent)Pros+Story very enjoyable. Not a huge grand adventure but still I found it interesting, and found most characters to actually be pretty good. +The setting is amazing and I hope at some point it can be revisited. +Visually very beautiful. (Design wise, graphics themselves are ok if you care about that lol)+The combat actually has a lot of fun elements to it, and I also enjoyed the character custimization. It doesn't play like most other WRPGs, but I didn't really mind although I know some do.+Roy is a preset character whose pretty defined but you still have a lot of flexibility with how he acts in conversations. Compare to auto dialogue mess Shepard from ME3? I'll take Roy/Temperance any day. +So many good ideas LOL normally I would not suggest this but a bigger company needs to buy Spiders and give them some $$$ and direction. Once they have those 2 things they could honestly be the new Bioware. Cons-The game is small scale. There won't be a billion items to collect or places to explore. A lot of simplified elements but honestly who actually cares? I don't get much out of endlessly exploring desolate areas (Thanks Skyrim for bringing this awful trend back) -Combat can be wonky and annoying at times -Level design is... not the best. A lot of backtracking around the Jail/City/Other city depending on what act you are inThe game is pretty short which could be a pro or a con. Also I still don't know if I find the virtue names cliche or really interesting. Maybe its best there probably won't be a sequal, I can't imagine there are that many virtues left for them to pick from for new characters lolEDIT: I LIED A SEQUEL IS COMING LMAO. MY BODY IS READY !!tl;dr this game is good if you are willing to overlook some things			"

												--Updated--Mars War Logs is a third person RPG with a not so bad story settled in an intresting environment, actually the background had a lot of potential, enought for a prequel/sequel/whatever without the risk o being repetitive.Because of the potential of this environment I expected a little bit more details in the story and side characters development, more than often the characters move in a world that they undestand pefectly (well, it's actually their world, you know) and the player is left wondering about how the plot twist and turn, not knowing much of the background details that may help to get a better grasp of the story and it's meaning.Of course is not like you have no idea of what are you doing, mostly you have to fight for your skin, like in 90% of games out there, and the story is pretty straightforward, maybe just a little bit too straightforward. (mind peolpe, I'm the kind of person that read every single page of a diary, piece of codex, random book, signs and talk to everyone, even if my character is on fire and the NPC is an anvil, so try to take the critique about the story by the point of viev of a details lover)Switching to a more technical side, MWL is a normal RPG, you gain experience by kicking butts, level up and then build you character choosing freely among three branches of specialization.There is also a nice upgrading and crafting system for armor and weapons.The gameplay is actually good when you learn not to freak out because of the game controls, it is similar to what I experienced with The Witcher, when you learn when you are suppose to hit, it goes all nice and smooth.In the end I really liked this game, even if some potential on story, lenght and character development was wasted, it offer a nice min10-max15 hours of gaming and some intresting story and characters.I actually won't mind if Spiders would pop out a more detailed and longer sequel, the lore they have built is worth further depening.-Please don't mind my ""monkey on acid"" english-			"

												I wanted to like this game. The story sounded pretty cool. I think this could have made a great graphic novel. As a game, well this particular iteration is a bit lacking. Combat is repetitive and gets quite boring. I found myself running around talking to everyone to learn more about the game world and story but getting bored with the grind of combat. After awhile I just didn't enjoy playing anymore so despite the developing story I had to quit before finishing the game. Graphics were not bad but again nothing spectacular. I suppose my most constructive critique is that I feels like the writer has an awesome story to tell, I could see the seeds there, but there was some sort of failure in translation. The ideas start off so great in their mind but when it is transcribed to a game it feels like parts, and probably important ones, were left out due to time constraints and technical limitations. Hopefulthis gives the devs the encouragement to keep at it and realize their vision and maybe branch out and put together a graphic novel.			"

												I liked it. The game has its flaws sure but honestly the game has a neat feel to it. More than one way to approach most situations in this game. Nearly every quest has multiple options on how to handle things. The skill trees are pretty fun especially technomancer. I would go as far to say that it sorta reminds me of kotor with the way its designed. Its not as good as kotor so dont buy this thinking its the best thing ever but it reminds me of a time in gaming where less is more. The armor and Weapon customization is cool. The story and lore is fairly original (Think boarderlands meets fallout) and you need to remember that the developers here arent Activision or Ubisoft. Even the staff roll at the end was pretty short so all that considered they did a great job with what they had to work with. All in all id say that if you enjoy the occasional rpg thats not typical then I say its more than worth a try.Definitley recomend it!			"

												Mars:  War Logs really deserves a neutral rating, and I once again find myself regretting that Steam doesn’t offer the option to rate a game that way.  It takes about 10 hours to finish the game (including all the side quests).  The big complaint everyone seems to have is that the combat system sucks.  The controls do take some getting used to (I elected to play without a controller based on complaints about shoddy controller support), but you start to get a feel for it after a few battles.  The combat system demands that you constantly kite around enemies by rolling to get in solid blows and avoid taking damage.  Unfortunately, some battle take place in cramped spaces that make battles a pain.  It is also unfortunate that all of your Technomancer powers have a slight delay before they are used, which leaves you open to having the move cancelled.  The camera sometimes glitches during battles, and the game isn’t shy about sending huge numbers of enemies at you.  It’s fine if you are playing on easy, but I think harder difficulties would prove to be unpleasant.  You should be able to tell after a few battles if it’s going to be a deal-breaker or not for you, and that is well within the refund window.Let’s talk about the rest of the game.  Spiders is a small studio, and the fact that Mars:  War Logs is a budget title does show.  You’ll see the same character models over and over again and the environments are very stale.  Some of the dialog is poorly written, but overall, I think both the setting and the story are enjoyable.  The game does manage to tell a cohesive story in 10 hours or so, but I couldn’t help feeling like something was missing while I was playing the game.  The main character is awesome, but the morality system is underdeveloped:  nobody cares how evil you are most of the time, and being good seems to come with comparatively fewer rewards.  The three romance choices were very shallow (almost an afterthought, really).  I can’t stress enough how the stale environments are, though the background art is generally good.Overall, I liked the game, but it won’t be for everyone.  I was actually ready for the game to be done when it ended despite the short length, and I don’t see it being an RPG I’ll play through again.  If you are interested in the game, pick it up on sale.  If you aren’t enjoying the game by about an hour in, or if the combat seems like an aberration to you, go ahead and refund the game.  The Technomancer powers you get at the end of the first chapter don’t significantly change the combat, and I felt the first chapter of the game was actually the strongest. "

												At 12 hours of play time and a sale price, I found this game worth it. Twelve hours of gameplay was nice, because the clunkiness of the game overall might have outworn its welcome past that. The clunkiness includes voice acting, set design, and combat. Sadly, this short play time also means that the characterization of characters was pretty rushed, especially the companion Mary. So, the game could have been longer with better story and characterization or better gameplay, and I'd likely recommend it at full price if that were the case.What I did like was the setting and overall story, which means I'm looking forward to the sort of sequel in the works, Technomancer.  I did have fun with the gameplay more when I got into the full swing of the Techromancer powers. I liked the ability to craft armor, weapons, health packs, explosives, however this could have all been fleshed out more.I also particularly liked the titular premise, the game being the War Logs of the aptly named character Innocence. I think that shows some storytelling promise from Spiders.If they learned from this game, I'm excited to see the results of their sort of sequel, Technomancer. If they got about the same results with better graphics, I'll likely wait until that drops below $10 too.			"

												Ok, I'll give a recommend, but just barely and it isn't because the graphics are washed out and lifeless. It's because the story was uninspiring. I lost interest in it about 3/4 of the way through. But there are some redeeming factors in the game:1. Boss battles are challenging2. The loot is finite which makes crafting ever so important3. And finally the combat is very atypical. There are no real guns/weapons in the game. You can fashion a nailgun into a weapon but thats the only firearm in the game. However, you can make grenades and mines. You get different types of melee weapons that can be modified to enhance combat and your stats. Your armor is modified in the same way. But the most important combat is done using technomancy which is basically the ability to wield electricity and shockwaves.The skilltree is huge and I was only able to fill 2/4 of the branches so choose wisely on your path.The side quests pay very well in experience, but you'll find yourself asking why you accepted this mission (oh right, the XP).The ending was very forgetable as were most of the characters.

In regard to story and characters, this is its graetests weakness, the companions are not really that developed, but I sense a great potential. The story is not that good, but it will give rise to a lot of questions and some of them I still have unanswered, but all in all, a pretty decent game from one of the smaller developers.			"

												Meh, the lore is sort of interesting, but overall this game is just the vision of mediocrity. The combat system is alright, but seeing as thats like 70% of the game it had better be. Im not joking about that part. Unless you take like the evil path and Kill everything in sight, which actually is a disadvantage. because you can keep fighting the same enemys later if you just grind to hight levels if you just knock them out. But fighting over and over again will happen even if you do kill everything.The graphics and music are okay but nothing special there either with the exception of the ungodly amount of yellow and red. You may be asking, whats the big deal there? Well if you play this game for an extended amount of time eventually you start to get a headache from the color pallet.The game does actually give you choices that can influence the story, though there are not that many chances and its rather obvious.Its the prequel to the Technomancer game and from what I have heard that game isnt much better.If you have the money and no other game options of to play I guess I would reccomend it.

												Mars:  War Logs really deserves a neutral rating, and I once again find myself regretting that Steam doesn’t offer the option to rate a game that way.  It takes about 10 hours to finish the game (including all the side quests).  The big complaint everyone seems to have is that the combat system sucks.  The controls do take some getting used to (I elected to play without a controller based on complaints about shoddy controller support), but you start to get a feel for it after a few battles.  The combat system demands that you constantly kite around enemies by rolling to get in solid blows and avoid taking damage.  Unfortunately, some battle take place in cramped spaces that make battles a pain.  It is also unfortunate that all of your Technomancer powers have a slight delay before they are used, which leaves you open to having the move cancelled.  The camera sometimes glitches during battles, and the game isn’t shy about sending huge numbers of enemies at you.  It’s fine if you are playing on easy, but I think harder difficulties would prove to be unpleasant.  You should be able to tell after a few battles if it’s going to be a deal-breaker or not for you, and that is well within the refund window.Let’s talk about the rest of the game.  Spiders is a small studio, and the fact that Mars:  War Logs is a budget title does show.  You’ll see the same character models over and over again and the environments are very stale.  Some of the dialog is poorly written, but overall, I think both the setting and the story are enjoyable.  The game does manage to tell a cohesive story in 10 hours or so, but I couldn’t help feeling like something was missing while I was playing the game.  The main character is awesome, but the morality system is underdeveloped:  nobody cares how evil you are most of the time, and being good seems to come with comparatively fewer rewards.  The three romance choices were very shallow (almost an afterthought, really).  I can’t stress enough how the stale environments are, though the background art is generally good.Overall, I liked the game, but it won’t be for everyone.  I was actually ready for the game to be done when it ended despite the short length, and I don’t see it being an RPG I’ll play through again.  If you are interested in the game, pick it up on sale.  If you aren’t enjoying the game by about an hour in, or if the combat seems like an aberration to you, go ahead and refund the game.  The Technomancer powers you get at the end of the first chapter don’t significantly change the combat, and I felt the first chapter of the game was actually the strongest. "

												Wow! What a hidden gem. I picked this up in a sale knowing nothing at all about it, but somewhat drawn to the aesthetic. I had no idea what to exprect, but what I found was a wonderful game with a deep engaging storyline, a superbly realised world and a truly bittersweet ending. Combat takes a little while to master, but it's rewarding once you do. There's a few rough edges, such as the voice acting and some of the dialogue, but on the whole I highly recommend picking this game up. The campaign took me about 14 hours to play through.			"

												I recommend this game and do not regret any time spent playing it. ~10 hours of gameplay as of right now but I do plan on doing a second playthrough eventually.This is not a AAA game. This is a game with many flaws but also with many unique quirks that allows it to stand tall.Pros:- Flowing action combat- Voiced dialogue (with some kinks here and there)- Skill tree with three distinct branches (you can specialize or mix and match)Cons:- Does not successfully utilize all combat mechanics (you can block or dodge but I had way more success dodging)- So man doorsNotes:- Some of the voiced dialog is really good and some of it is really bad. There was on character who's lines were delived so uniquely (ignoring punctuation) I found myself giggling every time he said anything.			"

												A recommendation that is not one.Interesting battle system at first sight, but the inventory is confined to 5 weapons (+ nailgun) and 4 clothes, poorly customizable.Enemies without interest! They got short/llong range weapons or Technomant powers yeah, but hit and roll to dodge they all be as easy to knock down.Ridiculous lifetime for a RPG! 10 hours to finish it including side-quests (1 or 2 were cancelled - maybe I did something wrong).Captivating universe, but the scenario runs out very quickly: choices and ""reputation"" without significant influence on the story.I know I will love this game, when it no longer be a proof of concept.

												The game fell verry short from creativity hitting a sad plateau effect after the first sector, i thought it was gonna be like a Red faction Rage mix yet i saw a game that fell verry short of eather tittle. The companion AI was extremly plain, could not even change their equipment just who they target wich made verry little diference the vendors always sold equipment that you eather had or found within the next mission. Crafting was among the worst i have ever seen with only a couple of items being able to be crafted- out of a game that has scattered scraps every where this was terrible. the voice acting was laughable and the graphics was even worse hitting invisible walls everywhere back ground units or npg where lifless  this might be the worst RPG i played in a while			"

												A lot of issues on this game : UI/Interface, many A-to-B quest travels with endless ennemies respawns, no fast travel, reputation system broken, etc.BUT...despite all of the above, the world, setting, and story (even without proper fluid narration), are appealing.Art Direction helps a lot regarding immersion, and some characters are attaching. Seems like an unfinished game, somehow, but with a sufficient touch of interest in the world and overall story to give it a go.			"

												--Updated--Mars War Logs is a third person RPG with a not so bad story settled in an intresting environment, actually the background had a lot of potential, enought for a prequel/sequel/whatever without the risk o being repetitive.Because of the potential of this environment I expected a little bit more details in the story and side characters development, more than often the characters move in a world that they undestand pefectly (well, it's actually their world, you know) and the player is left wondering about how the plot twist and turn, not knowing much of the background details that may help to get a better grasp of the story and it's meaning.Of course is not like you have no idea of what are you doing, mostly you have to fight for your skin, like in 90% of games out there, and the story is pretty straightforward, maybe just a little bit too straightforward. (mind peolpe, I'm the kind of person that read every single page of a diary, piece of codex, random book, signs and talk to everyone, even if my character is on fire and the NPC is an anvil, so try to take the critique about the story by the point of viev of a details lover)Switching to a more technical side, MWL is a normal RPG, you gain experience by kicking butts, level up and then build you character choosing freely among three branches of specialization.There is also a nice upgrading and crafting system for armor and weapons.The gameplay is actually good when you learn not to freak out because of the game controls, it is similar to what I experienced with The Witcher, when you learn when you are suppose to hit, it goes all nice and smooth.In the end I really liked this game, even if some potential on story, lenght and character development was wasted, it offer a nice min10-max15 hours of gaming and some intresting story and characters.I actually won't mind if Spiders would pop out a more detailed and longer sequel, the lore they have built is worth further depening.-Please don't mind my ""monkey on acid"" english-			"

												This is low key the most under rated RPG ever. Yes the budget may have been like 2 cents and it may have been way too ambitious of a project but the end result is still very much worth checking out. If you are like me and don't really care about all the fluff Bioware has been adding to their games recently, but still like their stories and characters, this game is for you.  Important note: They got a lot of new voice actors and re did a lot of the bad voice overs. So the annoying voices in the trailers are not actually in the game (although LOL@ Innocence randomly getting a British accent)Pros+Story very enjoyable. Not a huge grand adventure but still I found it interesting, and found most characters to actually be pretty good. +The setting is amazing and I hope at some point it can be revisited. +Visually very beautiful. (Design wise, graphics themselves are ok if you care about that lol)+The combat actually has a lot of fun elements to it, and I also enjoyed the character custimization. It doesn't play like most other WRPGs, but I didn't really mind although I know some do.+Roy is a preset character whose pretty defined but you still have a lot of flexibility with how he acts in conversations. Compare to auto dialogue mess Shepard from ME3? I'll take Roy/Temperance any day. +So many good ideas LOL normally I would not suggest this but a bigger company needs to buy Spiders and give them some $$$ and direction. Once they have those 2 things they could honestly be the new Bioware. Cons-The game is small scale. There won't be a billion items to collect or places to explore. A lot of simplified elements but honestly who actually cares? I don't get much out of endlessly exploring desolate areas (Thanks Skyrim for bringing this awful trend back) -Combat can be wonky and annoying at times -Level design is... not the best. A lot of backtracking around the Jail/City/Other city depending on what act you are inThe game is pretty short which could be a pro or a con. Also I still don't know if I find the virtue names cliche or really interesting. Maybe its best there probably won't be a sequal, I can't imagine there are that many virtues left for them to pick from for new characters lolEDIT: I LIED A SEQUEL IS COMING LMAO.

The crafting system is actually really cool, the story is already compelling and I am only about an hour and a half in, Good game thus far. Combat is a little clunky but the full controller support is a big plus. If you have $20 and looking for something new, this game might be right for you.			"

												Okay, so let's get this out of the way: This is the B movie of RPGs, at best. The dialog is stilted, the character animations are stiff, the character development is shallow at best. There are stale tropes everywhere, both of the game sort (Pointless crafting system that has you spend a third of your time rummaging through crates and piles of trash? Camera that spins around in combat? Binary branching plotlines? All check) and of the narrative sort. The protagonist is incredibly bland, pretty much all the female characters are given stereotypical roles, obesity is used as a visual marker for sexual predation, and the threat of sexual violence hangs heavy over the miserable denizens of Mars (though interestingly, it hangs over men as well as women). There's a seedy bar that you can find by following the street signs helpfully advertising ""Seedy bar"". It's not a great story, nor a great game.That said, I always try to look for the positives, and Mars: War Logs has some qualities if you're willing to tough out all the issues. Mercifully, it's very stable - I didn't encounter any bugs or obviously broken systems. Beyond that low bar, though, combat is surprisingly streamlined and fluid. It's simple, understandable, and actually fun - and to my shock, most of the enemies you defeat aren't actually killed, but rather just left writhing on the floor (you can choose to kill them for extra cash, but I never needed to). It might actually be one of the most bloodless RPGs I've ever played, and it's done in such a simple, obvious way that it makes me feel a bit gross about all the other RPGs where I play as the good guy but slaughter hundreds or thousands.The art style (minus the animation) is actually pretty good, creating a rusty-feeling world and some strategically-placed sci-fi aesthetics, such as with the Technomancers. The story also has a few genuinely unexpected twists. At least three times I found myself surprised or even shocked that things weren't going the way I had expected them to, and that's rare. I don't know how the developers managed to craft a game that was 90% shallow tropes and 10% really surprising and interesting turns, but they did it.The world itself is also really interesting. Mars often shows up in fiction either as a harsh wilderness to be tamed (in early colonization settings) or a rebellious, oppressed colony struggling against greedy Earth overlords (in late colonization settings). Mars: War Logs does something different entirely - Earth or even spaceflight barely get any mention at all, and instead Mars feels like it's been abandoned, with people fighting over scraps of water and fertile soil. There's also a fantasy-esque vibe to the setting that is really interesting, and it's enough to make me put the sequel (The Technomancer) firmly on my wishlist.So in short: this is, at best, a bargain bin, shoestring budget version of Mass Effect, written by people who mostly uncritically repeat tropes from other media. But it takes place in an interesting world and has hints of intelligent and surprising writing, and the gameplay is entirely welcoming. Give it a shot if you can appreciate or tolerate the videogame equivalent of eyerolling B-movie cheese, and you may just find yourself enjoying it and wanting more.(And better. Please, please let The Technomancer have better writing.)			"

												While Mars: War Logs is not a AAA game I still enjoyed it a lot.  Enough so to go back and replay it to see the other ending.  Almost all aspects of the game scream indie meaning things like Voice acting, character animations, character customization/skills, etc., are done failry well, but not quite as polished and deep as you see in other major titles like Mass Effect  In one respect, you could almost consider it a rudimentary version of Mass Effect.  Playing through the game you'll notice these shortcomings or lack of depth in each aspect of the game, but if you can look past theses definitely enjoy the game.To be honost I am a bit of a snob and won't touch games unless they're of AAA caliber.  Mainly because I don't have a lot of time to play games so I want to spend what time I have on worth while games.  By chance I decided to give this game a try and the first couple hours of gameplay were enough to pull me in.  The environment and setting of the game look absolutely amazing.  The devs did a great job of creating a dystopian city on mars.  I found the story quite interesting and kept me intrigued throughout most of the game.  There are some pacing issues towards the middle, but if you stick to the main quest line, you can power through through these slow points fairly quickly.  The other thing this game did well was the combat system.  I thought it was done quite well feeling very smooth and polished.  It never felt awkward or clumsy where my character was slow or didnt attack when I wanted him to.  The one thing I found to be a bit irritating was its very easy to be swarmed by a group of enemies and die.  But to be honest this serves to make it more challenging.All in all regardless of the shortcoming I still very much enjoyed this game.  A solid 7/10TL;DRGreat story and combat system but lacks depth in all other aspects of the game.  They are still done well so if you can look past this shortcoming you'll definitely enjoy this game "

												At the point of writing this I have almost beaten the game and am enjoying it, yes there are some flaws to the game but they can easily be over looked if you are the type of gamer who likes to read into all the lore you collect during the game.I would recommend this game to gamers who enjoy learning the ingame lore and I would wait for it to go on sale if you plan on purchasing it. I would sum this game up as, the game it what you make it out to be.Roleplaying- The game gives you the choices of how to build your character how you want, I play a combat oriented character but you can spec your char out for stealth but most encounters in the game do require you to engage in combat. When it comes to the story it also leaves you with the good or evil approach to most situations. Also there are major story choices you get to make during the game so on the RPG aspect it has the basic points, nothing major like you would see from a Bioware RPG. Also when it comes to equipment the choice is there to custimize it how you want but most of the visually appealing option dont have stats to make them worth it.Combat- Lots of gamers dont like the combat in the game but I find enjoyable, its not flashy like something you would get in the Batman Arkham games. I place combat more like a real life fight, you vs 4 people and they all are try beating up on you at the same time. Unlike most games that have your attackers come at you 1 at a time. Combat requires some thought to it not just going in swinging hoping to beat your enemies to death. I did have to up the difficulty to get the most enjoyment out of the combat.Negatives- The biggest negative to this game is the dialogue in the first area of the game it has poor writting, but once you past it the dialogue gets a lot better. Voice attacking is lack luster and emtionless but I am able to ignore it.			"

												Not quite a diamond in the rough. More like a really roughed up diamond. Unimpressive graphics. Mediocre voice acting at best. Interesting story. Lovely combat, that is actually challenging. Too many games these days place combat and gameplay as just a secondary thing tacked onto their ""expansive world"", and ""engaging story"". This game may not have the best presentation in the world but it was throughly enjoyable to play, and isn't that what really counts. It has a definite indie vibe running throughout, but in my opinion they managed to put together a decent game. When I read reveiws for this game from publications like IGN, they seem to focus on all the wrong things. They judge it for not being a triple A title, and it seems the ""reviewer"" didn't even play the game for more than hour. It always seems to me that the Video Game Media just pick a narrative about a game and all the different publications follow suit. Don't listen to that garbage. Steam's ratings is a much truer representation of the quality of this game.			"

												Mars: War logs is a rough diamond with a lot of potential.The first part of the game within the Prison is a bit meh, but afterwards it does get far better. So, I'd recommend sticking with this game a wee bit longer before giving up.It's an unusual RPG game, one that has a lot of potential with an interesting but unusual story set on Mars. Combat is okay but can be challenging, the game is a little bit rough in spots and pacing does need a bit tweaked.However, this game was made by a small studio that clearly put their a lot of effort into this game.If you're am RPG fan, and are looking for something a bit different then give this game a go, even at the current price. But do be aware that it can be a wee bit rough around the edges and the first level is a bit on the 'meh' side.			"

												20 minutes on record. 10 of which spent trying to figure out how to get a controller to work. Quit out of game and spend 20 minutes online searching for a fix. All I can find are years old threads of people asking the same thing on release. Only problem seems to be to unplug your wireless mouse or keyboard. Of which I have neither. Alright, I'll try it with keyboard and mouse. Notice game is developed by Spiders. Is Spiders trying to corner the market on awful dialogue and voice acting? This game and Bound By Flame both sound like they were written and acted by people who speak English as a third language. Get past the first part of the intro, an NPC is about to be♥♥♥♥♥♥♥by a large man appropriately named, ""Fatso"". PC shows up and stares menacingly at them. They get unnerved (after several lines of cringeworthy dialogue from Fatso) and leave. NPC thanks the PC. First dialogue option of the game, ""I couldn't just stand there and do nothing"". That's literally what he did. Choose it anyway. Hear PC's voice actor. ALT+F4.			"

												Enjoyed it.There was one bug that prevented me from reaching epilogue. I then leveled up, recycled some stuff, and tried again, this time it showed me the epilogue.			"

													Do yourself a favor: don’t play Mars: War Logs. Buy a game with better production values, or more vision, or that does something original or creative. You can skip this one. "

												To simply put it this game is meh. The controls are weird. Fighting is awful. The story has potential, but the voice acting murdered it. I have the slightest urge to try and complete the story, but why should I force myself through all the fetch quests when I so many other amazing games to play.			"
