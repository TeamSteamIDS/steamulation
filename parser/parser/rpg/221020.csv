  TL;DR: DO NOT PURCHASE   The game is broken and unfinished. The game is abandoned by the developers.  They're censoring constructive negative criticism. They essentially took the $2 million dollars and ran. They're not letting new potential buyers know it's abandoned.The GameI played the game for around 300 hours in total. Only around 80 of those were recorded by Steam due to me playing the other hours within Steam Offline mode. In darkness and secrecy, the game was abandoned by the developers during Alpha, the updates stopped rolling out and eventually, many months later a non significant update was released and the game was now considered ""Finished"" according to the their Steam Store page. But in truth, the game was nowhere near being finished, it had and still has a ton of bugs and issues. There's a lot of things missing from the game, and the AI is beyond horrible. The AI is bad enough to give your townsfolk a tendency to end up killing themselves. I wish I could say that events such as that are rare, but they aren't. It's common and in some occasions, it causes your entire village to die.MarketingThere were no/still isn't any announcements or information on the Town's store page letting potential new buyers know that the project has been abandoned.  Eventually articles surfaced stating that the game was indeed abandoned, the developers were interviewed and claimed  ""In fact, the team is currently thinking about instead working on a sequel to Towns through which they want to implement all the features that they could not with the original game.""  and within their community forums, one of the developers claim that Originally posted by Burningpet on www.townsgame.com: Towns is very much alive and kicking.	 Originally posted by Burningpet on www.townsgame.com: So so far Towns has sold more than 200k units and generated a gross revenue of more than 2M usd. and although we are pretty sure we can and will sell a lot more, we still see it as a huge success. Dictatorship / CensorshipAfter reading some reviews of the game, and reading the original posts people made on the Steam and/or townsgame.com forum. (Including deleted ones, thanks to caching) It's quite clear that the developers are silencing anyone and everyone who is posting/discussing negative critizism of their game. And they're doing it forcefully, they're also going the extra mile by deleting the post, banning the user and then responding to it publicly, claiming the player posted harassment among other accusations. Due to them removing the post/thread and banning the user, there's no way for a reader to verify what happened unless the reader has cached versions of the forum. Out of the 50 posts I read through, which all had been deleted for ""Boycotting"" ""Harassment"" and other reasons. Only a mere 6 of them had anything that was even borderline harassment or boycotting.ConclusionEssentially, me and many others came to the conclusion that they took the money and ran. They're still trying to get people to buy it by censoring everything they can. And the reason for abandoning the game? Because they were ""burnt out"" yet they claim they will make a sequel. Do not purchase this game, and I highly advice people not to purchase any future releases or new games from this company/developers ever again based solely on what they're doing with this game and the social media involving it.RefundValve added a refund addition to Steam on June 2nd, 2015 that could potentially allow customers to refund Towns as the development of the game has halted.Originally posted by Valve on http://store.steampowered.com/steam_refunds/?l=english:You can request a refund for nearly any purchase on Steam—for any reason. Maybe your PC doesn't meet the hardware requirements; maybe you bought a game by mistake; maybe you played the title for an hour and just didn't like it.

It doesn't matter. Valve will, upon request via help.steampowered.com, issue a refund for any reason, if the request is made within fourteen days of purchase, and the title has been played for less than two hours. There are more details below, but even if you fall outside of the refund rules we’ve described, you can ask for a refund anyway and we’ll take a look.FeedbackDon't hesitate responding with any constructive criticism that I could use to improve my reviews. Also note that posting your own experiences with Towns whether good or bad assists potential newcomers in making their decision in whether to purchase the game or not.			"

												This highlights the worst part of Steam Greenlight.  The developer posted a ton of ideas, some good-looking screenshots, and pitched a solid concept.Before I even get to the review, I'd like to note that THE DEVELOPER HAS ABANDONED THE GAME.  He took the ""Early Access"" money, cranked out an Alpha-at-best version of the game and left.  He got another developer to theoretically try to finish the game, but the hopes of that actually happening are looking pretty dim.So as for the game itself.  You build a town to attract heroes to explore and clear dungeons.  Sounds good.  The execution is NOT.  It's a buggy mess, with villagers having AI and path-finding so bad that they often get stuck and starve.   You control which heroes arrive, can't tell them what to do, and can't even sell them items.  The crafting system is tedious and the building system feels like it's constantly fighting against you.It's a buggy, barely-playable mess with no endgame, few sounds, and almost no animations.  Avoid like the plague.EDIT: The developers responsible for taking your money and running are Xavi Canal and Ben Palgi.  I've been asked a few times to mention them here so if you see any projects from them in the future, you can remember this cash-grab and avoid them.			"

Of course, they got that way AFTER their game was sold... unfinished. Hope they enjoyed the 2 PLUS Million Dollars they made. I will never again buy from ANYONE who was involved in the making of this ""game"" . Rip-off artists, and scammers. They KNOWINGLY sold this game unfinished. This game was NOT an Early Access Game, but ""realeased as done."" They should refund the cash paid for the game, and remove it from Steam. Warning: DO NOT BUY THIS!!!!

												This game has been abandoned by the devs over and over again. During the most recent sale I pointed users to a great review about the history of the game and what has happened with the devs.. It was removed as ""boycott thread"" I then made a post regarding how it wasn’t and it was a review... I was then banned from the forums. I have never seen such shadyness from developers or steam forum moderators.  Stay FAR AWAY!!!Here is why I was supposedly banned...You have been banned from Towns Discussions by a forum moderator for your post in ""Towns General Discussions"": 
YetiChow Moderator 3 hours ago 
Deleted thread ""Don't buy this game"". Reason: spam, calls to boycott, and the fact that the same topic has been done to death already. Also a rather icky necroposting.

A reminder, these kind of boycott threads will NOT be tolerated. There's a reviews page for reviews; if people ask for opinions then that's another place to give them; but these unsolicited boycott threads are just unacceptable.

I highly disagree with this. My original post was notifying potential buyers of a great review that was written about this game. It told the back story of what happened with the devs for this game and how they abandoned it(surprise? it just happened again). How could that be a ""boycott thread""? If I had somehow managed to find a positive review for towns and asked the user base to read it and get educated of the background of the game it would somehow be tolerated. This just again shows how shady you are YetiCHow for removing threads entirely and labelling them as something they are not.

Update:  YetiChow has now updated his original post to again try to make me look bad.  If you are going to police the forums in a dictatorship manner and not allow users to share reviews or their opinions unless it is in a positive way atleast own up to it.

YetiChow Moderator
I was going to avoid naming names in the hope this was an isolated incident; but apparently that's not the case. Also deleted another topic by the same user bizkit_109, written in response to my deleting the original thread. This user has now been warned, and further behaviour in the same manner will not be tolerated.

Apparently they like to silence any honest negativety towards the game and if you display any of that you get the big ban hammer.  What a joke this develpoer is and the staff it lets moderate its steam forums.

UPDATE!!! MAY 28 2015 !!!!!
After a user made a post asking YetiChow to comment about my review he again went after me and spread more lies saying the following:
YetiChow Moderator
For the record, I'm the one who issued that ban, not Supermalparit, not Burningpet, nor Moebius (the ""second dev"" who seems to be the person this post is addressed to?). The reason I issued that ban was because the poster was spamming (and worse, abusing other posters as well as the developers; the spam offence happened to be the straw which finally broke the camel's back).
I didn't want him again to be able to lie to the community and spread more misinformation so I confronted him on this as I never attacked the devs nor another forum poster.  He then banned me permanently from the forums.  Here is the screen shot of his post, my reply, and my new ban.  What a joke this guy is.

												Original Dev took the $2mil Alpha sales and scarpered. Sold it to a second dev who said, after abandoning it:“I hope you are not too disappointed. And if you are: I’m really sorry. I’m quite new to indie game dev and I couldn’t really see that the game sales were declining that rapidly. I guess if I had more experience I would have seen it comming …,”Abandon ware.It's a real shame - what exists is broken but playable. If they delivered what was initially promised it would be a cracking little indy game.Moral of the story? Don't buy Alpha, Beta or Early Access of anything. Ever.			"

												So if Moderators or others push you to the demo, its not the best way to understand how the game is or how well it runs. First off, the demo does not give you the greatest feel for the game, just proves that the basic mechanics are working....I'd also like to point this out, HEAVY MODERATION in the forums, see link below. If YETI does not agree with you or finds a reason to delete ""negative"" posts, he will. If you post in the forums, YETI will justify and ""help"" you make sense of the horrible AI and how the game was built as SH***Y as it is but it was all done like this on purpose. He responds to every comment to mask the amount of players who feel the same way about the game. Discussions that become overwhelming negative he will delete because the discussion is going in ""circles"" Check his own delete blog on the link below. This type of moderation in the forums is one attempt to keep the game alive. He HEAVILY defends the game at every chance even with all of the people arguing with him. The only people who agree are Lvl 0 Steam Users with Blocked Profiles.... Enough said. http://steamcommunity.com/app/221020/discussions/0/35220315866244607/Now for the review:The game is time consuming which is why you may see players with a fair amount of hours, the bugs become more apparent the longer you play. Horrible AI, AI starving itself with plenty of food. Slow productivity of the AI. You have to micromanage every aspect of the game which to me and everyone else in the forums, is horrible AI construction and pathing that they will not fix. If you attempt to build a house all at once in the game, the builders constructing it will not stop working on it until it is finished, that includes dieing in the process from starvation (with plenty of food next to them).... feel free to drop me a comment on here with anything else you would like to know. *I do not respond to Lvl 0 Steam accounts with blocked profiles, your comment will get deleted. Dungeons get even more involved and getting to them is a pain... to say the least. Construction is not polished at all. To sum it up, the game runs, if you work around the poor mechanics of the game, it is playable. Its extremely time consuming which looking at this game, it should be a faster payout of fun since its a bit behind its time. There is no Dev support in the forums, just moderators pushing the game every now and then. Development is next to nothing, look at the update history.			"

												Ok, I have a lot of hours in this game so maybe you could say that I got my money's worth - or maybe I just have a penchant for watching little pixel people go about their business(dying of starvation or eating everything in sight, dry-humping monsters to death or walking straight into a village full of hostiles) .. actually, I also go afk a lot and hang out in the kitchen.. that might be why :pAnyway, I do not recommend buying the game in its current state:- very buggy- rough and unpolished(for example, last time I played the little pixel people had like 2 frames of animation when walking and looked like they were dry-humping monsters upon attacking them). - feels incomplete, as in missing game-play features.- very, very slow updates(if you can even call it an update when one or two little bugs are fixed after several months).- Dishonest developer: this is the biggest reason for me right now as to why you shouldn't waste your money on this game. Let me clarify .. some other reviewers mention Early Access but the fact of the matter is that this game was not released as Early Access, it was being offered as a finished product when I bought it back in 2012.. well no way was it finished then and still isn't now 2 years later! It could be said that Early Access hadn't started back then so we might forgive that transgression - but then this game should either be categorized as Early Access right now or removed from Steam because it isn't the complete product it is being marketed as.*if you want a charming game where little computer people wander round and build a home, eat, sleep, dig up treasure, fight monsters, etc.. then go check out 'Craft the World', this is an Early Access title that already feels like it's polished and finished(except for missing later campaign levels); it certainly feels like a AAA title compared to Towns..

												SEE BELOW FOR AWESONE ALTERNATIVESThis games has a terrible AI. Citizens will walk right into enemy territiory to pick up a random bone. They will refuse to stop working and starve to death. They are worthless at producing food weapons or anything else. Forget the grandoise buildings you see in the screenshots, just building a hut can be a monumental task.The game is otherwise very buggy, terribly balanced and lacks a lot of features. It has been completly abandoned by the developers.I recomend instead;STONEHEARTH; A very similar game that is constantly updated, already has numerous features, great 3D graphics and most importantly a great AI. Has made incredible acess since it first realeased.GNOMORIA; A game that is also very similar to towns, with a similar graphics style and a fourth of the price or less when on sale. ALso has much better AI than townsCOLCKWORK EMPIRES; A game with simialr gameplay to towns but with a steampunk vibe. It is regularly updated and the game has made great progress since its early acess release.In other words all these games will give you very similar gameplay with better AI, and more importantly, a developement team which is on top of updating and talking about their game. Just do not buy towns!DWARF FORTRESS- Probably the orginal game with a town building survival gameplay. It is incredibly deep, and a is practically a cult classic. It is infamous for its difficulty, but you can find it for free at bay12 games.			"

This game had a lot of potential and I had a blast with it a few years back when keeping in mind that it was Early Access.

												If you want a Dwarf Fortress Clone with graphics, please play Gnomoria. This game is a very low quality and not fit for release. It is a bummer that this was one of the first game to be ever Greenlit. Contrary to the public belief, this game is not and never was Early Access, yet we got an Alpha Version of the game sold. The store page also says that it will be continuously updated, but this does not happen. We get a patch all few months, which tends to break even more things. The visuals are okay, but the menus are just downright amateurish, the tutorials useless and the game absolutely explains nothing. Hello Developers, it is 2013, wake up. You don't need to hold my hand, but if you don't explain how your game works, then there is not fun to be had. Crawling through half the internet to understand how the game works is not something you want. Gnomoria is way more intuitive and has a clear progress line, even if you never played this genre. Don't touch it with a 10 ft pole held by someone else on the other side of the street.Update May 7th, 2014:The devs have now officially abandoned the game.

												Held off for so long on writing this.330 hours... Must be a great value right? Nope, nearly all of it was idle in the background while I waited huge amounts of time for the terrible AI to get anything done. This game is a tedious unpolished mess, filled with either insane levels of micro management or giant periods of idle time. The AI is dirt poor and starves to death doing basic tasks. Asking questions about it on the forums will get you told by the moderator how it's not a bug and is really your fault... this is only true because you bought the game.The dev also seems to think it's cool to appoint fanboy's and white knights as moderators. The Steam moderater doesn't moderate, he takes a clear side and bans people who disagree. Do not buy this game, do not support this dev.

												I honestly can't say I'd recommend this game at any price point.  There are quite a few other games out there that fill the same niche and many more currently in development, e.g. Banished and Stonehearth, and sadly actually have active development staff.  Yes that is currently a problem for this game.  If like me you picked up this game back when it was first greenlit only to assume that it would actually get patched and improved over time I feel your pain.  If you're looking at reviews to decide whether it's worth your money you can get a lot more enjoyment out of other games at any price point and a lot less frustration.  You can mod the heck out of the game manually to make it somewhat passible to get past some of the more glaring development omissions but it only gets you so far.  I can't say I've finished a single session with this game feeling happy about spending the time there.  You want fun, look elsewhere.			"

Development of this game has been cancelled, and no refunds are being given. The game went through Steam Greenlight prior to Early Access existing, which is the only reason it doesn't have an EA tag on the store page.

												The first and most infamous game to come out of Steam's ""Greenlight"" program, Towns is an incomplete and buggy mess, released in a beta state (yet conusmers such as myself were not initially informed of the fact it was still in beta) that never was completed, but rather ABANDONED by its programmer in a miserable state.  That's right, the sole developer/programmer took the money and ran.  The game is as complete as it will ever be, and that's very depressing.Towns was billed as a ""Dwarf Fortress""-type game, wherein you build a town atop a ""dungeon"" filled with various baddies.  Your goal is to build a nice enough town to support guards to protect your citizens, and adventurers who will come to your city (given your city has the necessary buildings) and venture into the depths to assault the creatures therein.  The problem is the programming is dreadfully incompetent.  The AI is beyond dumb.  People will stand around and starve to death rather than harvest and eat food.  Citizens will wander off alone and get themselves killed by groups of enemies.  The ""tutorial,"" if you can call it that, teaches you next to nothing about the game.  The still images of the towns initially shown on the game's Steam page were actually impossible to create in the game.  Building (especially roofs) is an exercise in frustration as pieces don't seem to want to fit together like they should.  The programmer's ambitions far exceeded his capabilities and after as few beta updates (which didn't really fix anything), he simply bailed.  What a great guy.Don't buy Towns.  Get something better.  And practically ANYTHING is better than this pile of excrement.			"

A few very minor bugs are present, the AI is a bit dopey, the enemy scaling is absurd (due to the market system, you can get Gold, a top tier material early on and proceed to completely stomp the first 5 or 6 floors of the dungeon, then suddenly it all comes to a halt on the next floor as enemies can one or two shot your heroes regardless of armor because armor only increases evasion, it doesn't make people more capable of taking damage) the game can have massive lag at times when doing mass item hauling (most common when you want to sell several buckets of iron) and the punishment for doing something wrong can be horrible especially when you don't know why said thing is bad (ie you have to make graves for corpses or they spawn strong ghosts, but now there's an event lategame that can rarely spawn even stronger Zombies for your village to fight off if you didn't build your graveyard a mile away, even high level zombies can spawn potentially adding to the death toll unless your village is well equipped O_O However, despite all the bad things, I feel like they're more nitpicks that could be ironed out later (if they ever do) the game is strangely satisfying when you do the smallest of things. I felt glad when I got my first town up and running with a constant food supply and with enough production to allow the town to build walls and decor to make them happier, which brings more people in, and eventually Heroes, whom I also got a nice warm feeling from when they moved in, especially a cameo from the fantastic Sips_ :D. When a dungeon level gets cleared there's also that good feeling when you clean all the loot out and equip the village with better items to withstand the ever increasing sieges that want to ruin all your fun. Overall there's just a great feeling I get from getting things done right, it's oddly satisfying to watch all your little people mine out all the stone before converting it into a storage room for your builders so you can continue to build up the town walls to make it harder for the sieges from completely stomping all over all your work so far, and i got a really good chuckle when the nasty hoard of yeti coming in to storm the place is almost completely wiped out before they reach their victims because you built a bridge that serves as the only way in that's completely lined with traps, and watching them set them all off (sadly there's no real animation, but it's still great to watch a big bad yeti get his foot caught in a bear trap and his friend who walked on ahead set off the bamboo shooter, hitting them both as well as anyone else nearby, then the log traps finish off the already wounded, before the villagers team up to pick off any surviving monsters that are likely bleeding from every possible area of their body. Perhaps next time they'll realize that the decaying goblin heads shoved on the pikes outside are a sign that this town is defended) If you already own a copy go ahead and have a blast directing all your little people to their fates. Grab some mods to fix some of the problems and some of the frustrating elements and you're good to go. If it appears in a bundle with some other things you're interested in, go ahead and give it a go, you might like it. But I would not buy this game through steam now, especially at full price, when there are more options available that either offer more polished development, are cheaper or promise so much more in the future. Gnomoria, Craft the World and Banished are all around the same price but all offer their own quirks and are still being developed regularly or are even finished in the case of Banished.The main reason I am not recommending this is because the devteam, they released a game which was basically in alpha, but not stating as such, they slowly developed said game over about a year, then dropped it. Now I can perfectly understand their situation, as one who actually browsed the forums, they got too deep into something they shouldn't have, their reputation was on the line, their own personal lives were causing them trouble. They hired another developer but their paycheck would have been so low that they too eventually dropped the project. When the game was left in this dropped state, the steam community went wild, with people buying the game just to give it a negative review, the product tags mostly consisting of ""scam"" and ""abandoned"" and the reviews said nothing about the game. The development of the game has since continued, however i would still not buy this game until they can promise to the buyers that they can bring out frequent updates (updates as of late have been very minor and slow, but a v15 is in development to help fix some issues)So until then, if you have it already, have fun, otherwise it's probably best to stay away unless it's on sale for £3 and you're curious or have nothing better to do for a rainy weekend. Then again, if the devs do get off their butts and finish the game, this could possibly be one of the best entry level Dwarf Fortress clones ever...			"

												I liked the game when I first got it. Sure it was buggy but it was in early access and the developers were making progress and updating and making it better. Then they released an unfinished product and gave up all together. I could forgive the game's mistakes when it was early access but now that it's released? No. It's not worth the $15 anymore. Maybe at one point but not now. Go play Dwarf Fortress of Gnomoria if you want to play a game like this.			"

												This is the game that made me lose faith in Greenlight. I have bought numerous early access games ( Prison Architect, Starbound, Space Base DF9 (ugh), Kerbal SPace Program etc.) Some have been solid games that keep building on themselves and are enjoyable even in early alpha (like KSP), some have been rocky but still enjoyable and are continuing to be made and starting to look better (Starbound), and then there are the games that don't really evolve much and kind of just.... stop.I bought this game around the release date thinking that it was a neat fresh look at dungeon crawling with city building and some basic logistics managment. I was totally jazzed at the idea and played the game into the ground for a couple of weeks. I had a bit of trouble with the building system, but I figured that had more to do with me being a n00b at the game. (It was a mess since your villagers could get stuck on air and kinda just... sat there as they got eaten by the critters and such on the surface.),. To be fair though there wasn't a tutorial at all at the time.I also found it impossible to attract addidtional villagers to the town or any heroes, even after fitting all of the criterea that the wiki said was required. The lack of forward movement gameplaywise is what lead me to drop the game until it hit beta.Now many moons later I come back to check out what is up with a game that I wanted so much to love and find out that it has been pretty much dropped by the devs. I liken it to ordering a car from somewhere and stopping by for a test drive of a prototype. You drive it and think it's all cool and can't wait for the consumer model, but after hearing nothing for a while you drop by again to see how the car is coming and the one they let you drive is exactly the same except they added seatbelts. Granted that I didn't drop $20,000 on this game and that this game is not a car, you get pretty much the same feeling, like someone took your money and gave you a shoddy product.If only I knew then what I know now.TL;DRShoddy at best and the devs dropped the game.

												It's difficult to recommend this game at the $15 sale price (4/23/2015), while there are so many other (more finished) games on the market.The game was created by 2 people. Steam added the game in 2012. The original creaters stopped working on the game in early 2014, and struck a deal with a single person to take over development. That person discovered there wasn't any financial incentive to continue developing the game, and let the community know that he was stopping all work.(Reference: http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2014/05/07/towns-called-malice-development-of-city-builder-ends/  )I like the game's concept of town management and plowed ahead with multiple game instances. However, I had to put the game down due to functionality. Sometimes my townies would starve to death instead of stopping a task to eat. They would wonder too deep even though you're supposed to be able to set the max floor depth. etc.TLDR: I can't recommend buying it. If you're still curious, download the demo.			"

												My children and I play this game. We liked the look and feel of the interface. The game was interesting and fun for a bit but little things kept annoying us. Issues like folk will starve to death instead of dropping the task they are assigned and eating. I guess making that piece of armor was more important that their own survival. The town seems small compared to other games in genre. The depth is limited to about 19 or 20 levels. Some other games in genre go below 100 levels.  For over a year the developer has been releasing rare and tiny updates. The game is not polished, but playable. I gave up on game and went to other games in genre that developers are actively making their product better. I'd recommend game for a few $.			"

												I was with this game from the beginning. From the moment I heard about this game in the Royal Indie Bundle, I fell in love with it. I played tens of hours of it through Desura. I desparately wanted this game to succeed because it was like a beautiful growing flower that would blossom with so much potential. I was an active contributor on the game forums along with others who shared the same passion. Then Steam Greenlight was launched and when this game was one of the first to be on passed through it, I was absolutely thrilled. And then, it all went south. The game was becoming more and more complex (which isnt necessarily a bad thing) but the way the developer did it made it more robust and annoying to get into. On top of that, each update introduced more and more bugs. The developers became less and less responsive. One of them left due to family concerns which is understandable. The gap between updates became longer and longer. Soon enough, the developers just disappeared. The game stayed in its buggy alpha state for months. Then out of nowhere a new dev was hired to fix it up. Except after only one update, he too seemingly has disappeared and the game continues in its buggy alpha state. I wanted to love this game. I wanted to see this game completed and succeed, I really wanted to. I now see that that future will never arrive.Don't get this game. It's dead and abandoned. RIP			"

												So...where to begin. This game I remember seeing back in 2011 on YouTube and I thought it was pretty cool. Found it on Steam when I joined, bought it when it was on sale for like $5. At the time, it was still being worked on, albeit slowly, so I thought ""why the heck not."" Looking back now, this game had potential but was left to rot by the devs and since late 2014 has never received a lick of development. It's unfinished, unpolished, buggy and will probably never, ever see what it was to become. It has good features and has a lot to it despite being in its forever unfinished state. The A.I. has always had a mind of its own and is hard to deal with when trying to set up runners, farmers, builders, and traders at the same time. Not having even just one person assigned to just one tiny task could end up causing your settlement to crash without enemies even attacking, simply because someone wouldn't go and make flour so you can bake bread so your dedicated farmers could eat and go harvest more wheat to repeat the cycle. It's a challenge, but if you're looking for a basic time waster, this game is good for that. I can't recommend it, however, just because of the state it's been left in without further development. If it's on sale for cheap and you like a nice, casual city builder, you might look into it. But for full price, look elsewhere. This game is going nowhere and will forever be that way.			"

												So what is with Towns? I would rather say it's pretty dead. This game came 2012 to steam greenlight and was a interesting project, where you create a world in which yo have to make andventurers happy and not to be the adventurer.But what did go wrong?It's pretty easy. The developer cashed the money in, which was brought by many people, who were exicted (like me), to try it, to play it and to support it. But unfortunately the developement stopped in 2014.What's wrong with that?So the problem with this is, that this game is far from being finished. This game is still in alpha and lacks many features, so many that you could rather say it is not much fun to play this game. I got very disapointed as i have heard that and my money is lost, just because someone did not manage to get their things right and just because he did not have ambitions anymore to work on this project, he stopped! I want to say one thing. I burned myself on this game and on some other. I would recommend for everyone not to buy early acess games or greenlights, just as they appear, but to wait and watch or to look at reviews. We gamers have to put a stop to such methods, we can not allow this to happen to us anymore!I do not recommend this game, don't buy it and don't support someone who disappointed thousands of players, with an unfinished, not even polished, game. He earnend about 2 MILLIONS $ with it and left the game just as it is, UNFINISHED!I would rather recommend you ""DwarfFortress"", it's free, developed by only 2 guys and can offer you much more.

												To my great disappointment, this ""early access alpha""- looks, sounds and plays just about the same as it did over a year ago. Sounds - None of the 4-5 sounds adds any value to the experience, what so ever.Graphics - The graphics are all placeholder at best.Gameplay - Has potential, but the AI will destroy any play beyond the first hour of play.Steam should have pulled this title a long time ago as it feels like the developer made it available only to go on a permanent vaccation right after. If you want a town-building-management experience, pick up Dwarf Fortress and make a donation to Bay12Games instead.			"

												I like this game, but I don't enjoy it as much as I should. It feels incomplete. The tutorials can be done in 5 seconds where it seems pointless to do them and the tutorials don't cover enough. Some pre made towns would be awesome. A news ticker would be great. A lot of this game is tranquil waiting. You send your townies to do something and it starts off being quick, but as the town gets bigger it can take them hours to build a set of small homes. Its a game you can watch TV and come back to while it plays.Oh and to top it off.... I've played one single game around 60 hours and NEVER EVER had any town that looks like the screenshots. NEVER EVER. I might not ever in fact. That's just how the game is. I often have the game playing in the background on another computer virtually unattended.			"

												This game was purchased for me a long time ago as a birthday present. Got a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ of good hours out of this game, but it was abandoned by the developers and left in a painfully unfinished state. It basically went straight from Alpha to ""Finished"". They flip-flopped on actually abandoning it for a while - they hired a new guy to work on it, which failed within weeks of happening...twice. Then they talked about releasing a Towns 2, despite this game being unfinished. The last attempt at saying ""yes, we still care about this"" was in early 2015, when a dev's house was supposedly under construction, so he had no room/time/internet to release a new patch. Finally, they stopped talking altogether. Their forums are a ghost town. This was one of the unfortunate early failures of the Greenlight system.Been a while since I've played it, but I just wanted to add my voice to the chorus of ""holy ♥♥♥♥ don't buy this"" that is already out there. The game you're getting is not worth a 15 dollar price tag.			"

												tl;dr: STAY FAR AWAY AND DO NOT BUY___________________________________________________________This game could have been good. But the Dev abandoned the project. The decided to pick it up again. Then abandoned it again (I think). Its pretty infamous for being one of the first games out of Early Access and the first promising Early access game that sold a ton of copies where the dev ""took the money and ran"". This game burned a LOT of people on Early Access, and is still burning people. I cant believe its still for sale. Its a bug ridden incomplete mess taht never got out of Early Access and is being sold as a complete game.Go play Dwarf Fortress instead. "

												This game is unintuitive, poorly done, very buggy, bland, and disappointing. I got the game when it first came out (before you could purchase beta access to games). The game was difficult to figure out and very clearly incomplete. At the time it hadn't claimed to be anything other than complete so I was surprised by the alpha phase feel of the game. The tutorial wasn't clear or useful and I had to take to the internet to learn how to play.The UI is awful and looks largely like it is meant as a placeholder until the game is further along and finished. The game is still not finished. The last update released for the game as of this writing (12/6/2013) was 9/30. That update made some things better, but didn't really affect the problems, such as the weirdness with townies auto-equipping things, the awful UI, the terrible tutorial, the stupid pathing and ai, the cruddy combat system etc.I was really looking forward to this game because it is similar in spirit to games like Dwarf Fortress and Dungeon Keeper, but it fails miserably and doesn't seem to be trying all that much. If you are a fan of DF or DK, I suggest just playing either of them, or try Gnomoria. Gnomoria is regularly updated and communicative with the player base. Don't get this game unless you are the kind of person who gets a kick out of bad games.Update 8/19/2015:Just wanted to add that as far as anyone can tell, the developers have abandoned this project and Steam continues to leave it up where it can still be sold. If you made the easy mistake of purchasing this game thinking it is complete or being worked on, please keep in mind you can refund games now and refund as soon as possible. I know I wish I had that option when I bought this game.			"

												I've come back to this game a number of times and sadly I'm unable to recommend it.While the graphics are generally ok, the font used is rather difficult to read - its simply a very poor and quite small bitmap - I've seen much better bitmapped fonts, from java even a pure opengl application its not too dificult to implement true type fonts...If only the text were the only issue, I could get past that and get on with the gameThe real issue comes when you attemt to create a building, it is almost impossible to be sure (even with their ""2.5d"" cursor) if you are building on top of a lower level blocks, and don't even start on a roof I hear its possible but a blavk art indeed.  A simple ghost block above lower blocks might help, but its just really confusing trying to work out whats going on.			"

												I have to give this a thumbs down.  It is very buggy, a very steep learning curve, and totally random.  I got really lucky in one town, and found a merchant willing to buy dirt, and sell me gold and some magical crap.  I gave 2 townies full stets of gold stuff, and they were slaughtering everying left and right.  I had a good working farm and started to grow my town, getting heros, but building took FOREVER.  I left the game running and the next day my build orders were not done.  I left it a few more hours to find that all my townies were slaughtered by some stupid monster, exccpt the ones with gold sets.  Well, kept trying to rebuild, but could never recover the population, too slow to build, too slow to do anything.  I just don't see this game going anywhere, really cool idea with little execution.Sadily, it has gone so long wtihout an update that I guess it will never be finished.  This game really had a lot of potential.  Buyer Beware!			"

												I really loved this game when I first started playing it. Had a ton of potential and it was very fun. If you wanna see a very good lets play and funny letplay of the older game then watch the sips videos on it. That is when this game was definatly at its most fun. Then gnomoria came out and had its fully 3d block system and the devs then decided they wanted to compleatly rewrite the game to have this feature. I guess many in the comunity wanted it but in my honest opinion this was a bad move. It made the game look too much not like its previous version and dident add anything to the gameplay other then you could build a better looking buildings. The game is a town building game not a building building game they went in the wrong direction however this was not what killed it. What killed it was one of the dev's having a personal crisis that then forced them to not concentrate on the game. This in turn spiraled into more work for the other dev's and them loosing intrest. I would have highly recommended this game a few years ago durning its alpha but it seams soon as it hit steam it was pretty much abandoned. Like the other reviewers I no longer can even recommend buying this game. Maybe if it was 3 bucks but definatly not 15 like what its being asked for.			"

												This game hits a couple sweet spots for me, in that you spend your time designing and issuing instructions to virtual ""villagers"" (or dwarves, employees, etc.) and then watching them go about their virtual lives.  I purchased it rather early on in its existance, and enjoyed running through a few plays of the basics that were in place.  It certainly never felt even remotely finished, and I decided to walk away from it and give the devs time to flesh it out. They never did that.  The original developers lost interest, which is a huge risk for people who are paid in advance for the promise of a product to come, and effectively decided to cut and run.  They farmed the work to a new developer who was working solely for a percentage of future sales, and the small improvements that were being made never generated those. This game is not actively being developed and is not worth a third of the asking price in its current state, which is a damned shame, becuase this genre could use more finished games, and fewer abandoned skeletal concepts.

												Terrible game.  Development is slow to the point of almost being non-existant (6+ months between major patches).  The AI is bad, especially the player's Townies (they border on suicidal at times).  Heroes are nothing more than dungeon-clearing mooches that sometimes bring total death to your Townies by bringing a train of mobs when they run away.  Only one music track that continually plays.  Townies cannot tear down already placed structures and items.It's truly an alpha-stage game that is passed off as a release-ready game.  Look elsewhere for a city-building game.  Dwarf Fortress or Gnomoria are truly better options.EDIT:  Also, do not listen to a word that YetiChow, the mod of the Towns forums on Steam, as he is a self-professed Troll that has no actual interest in the Steam community except to get rid of people who are critical of Towns and Town's developers.  http://www.townsgame.com/forums/viewtopic.php?f=88t=8032&start=40&p=47838&view=show#p47838Everyone of the users that he's perma-banned on the Towns forums on Steam (listed here:  http://steamcommunity.com/app/221020/discussions/0/35220315866244607/ ) were speaking only the truth about the history of Towns that included the actions of the Towns' devs and how they falsely advertised this game during the launch on Steam.

HOWEVER, I must say this game is still the same POS as it was then... Hardly different.. Potential and My time WASTED!!?!?40/100Pros-potential (aha there was)-Some decent addons (this will make it just slightly more playable)-Not buggy (not seriously buggy, however it would be more enjoyable if you could think of all the problems as just a mistake)-:( still can't think of anything actualy enjoyable after my money was stolen for an unfinished gameCons-game will not be fixed (game is not gonna change now or ever GG)-AI is ♥♥♥♥ing stupid as hell.. ( they will ♥♥♥♥ you off so bad..)-Very boring and repetitive at times! (basic actions are way to simple and click heavy with very little aesthetic or enjoyment as a reward..)-Not replayable (since you cant really ever do much in the first play or second or third or fourth.. you will achieve very little in this game as everything takes forever)Don't BUY FOR THE SAKE OF YOUR PRIDE AND WALLET!!?!!

												I ended up buying this game twice, once when I first heard about it from various communities speaking favorably of what it could become, and again when the game was eventually greenlit on steam. I justified both purchases, because I was genuinely excited over the prospect of the game, and wanted to support it as much as I could. I was wrong.The game and by extension the original community presented the concept to be a Dwarf Fortress like game with better graphics, but I would argue that it is more closely related to the old Majesty games without a mission scenario. Your objective is to build up a town that will attract adventure's. You are tasked to manage and create food for the town, gather materials for building and forging tools/weapons, and eventually mine beneath the surface and break into dungeons beneath the map. All the while you need to defend your townspeople against invaders, native enemy's and eventually the monsters living within the dungeons.The art is very inconsistent. Between block styles, animals and items within the game, there seems to be a 'mish-mash' of different approaches to how things ought to look, and none of them are particularly good. The animation is non existent. Everything glides across the screen, the combat looks like how a child emulate a 'fight' by smashing two dolls together.  Gameplay wise, you are allowed to create various structures, however you want. Similar to prison architect and DF-9, the game follows a system where you designate the type of room (bakery or carpenters workshop), and then supply those rooms with the necessary components allow those rooms to function (such as an oven, or bakers table). Buildings can be multiple floors up or down, though rooms are restricted to one level. The AI is what ruins the game for me. Peasants will frequently pick fights with monsters unarmed if they are near them. Like the Majesty, you cannot control the hero's that come to your town, however you also cannot curb or influence the hero's with gold or bounties. You simply have to hope the hero's will go where you need them too on their own. The menu's and displays aren't pretty to look at either, and navigating through the various menu's is rather unintuitive.The sounds are pretty terrible to be honest, especially the sound for when peasants eat food or die. If you happen to have your earphones on, and at a high volume, I would imagine it would cause your ears to bleed. Overall, the sound effects are pretty generic, but maybe I'm expecting too much from an Indie game after playing Minecraft.Now at the time, I could just explain such issues away, because the game was still in active development. However the game has since been abandoned by it's developers, and no further updates are planned. Because of that, I can't in good faith recommend this game. There's too much simply missing or unpolished for this to be considered a good purchase.			"

												One of the collective of Greenlight games that has been discontinued in its development.The developers have backed away from it entirely, after having instilled new ones to take their place.Though it has mods to take its replayability and value up a notch, it is not going anywhere beyond the most recent update.The game itself offers an interesting idea, where you are given a group of individuals who've managed to get stranded in the middle of a wilderness where survival is bent upon preparation against attacks from waves native slime blobs, werebears, skeletons, goblin-like creatures, and other manners of mythical beings. Each of said creatures seems to inherently wish to destroy the little ""Townies"" that inhabit the locale.Thus it is up to you to assign duties and crafts in order to farm, harvest, bake, mine, and provide a kind of economy of barter in order to sustain the townspeople from starving, or being slaughtered and eaten by local denizens.After creating a working village, whether it be in a mountainside or under the ground, or whatever the case, townies can venture below, into the earth to unveil treasures from creatures, with or without the help of heroes attained from local taverns.With certain mods, the game can be improved, but what with the care given to it, the modding community has very well moved on; it has been left aside and is a token of proof against the usefullness of buying games before their true completion.Other games similar to this are Gnomoria, and Stonehearth, both of which brandish better Ai development and offer a team who is in love with the product they are creating.I would only recommend trying this game if it were on sale at 80% off if you wish to give a town-simulator a try; but I personally would have preferred buying Gnomoria over this game.

												Edited at version 14d, in which development seemed to have a heartbeat again.The new update brings some cool new features, namely terraforming. This allows for a deeper playstyle in regards to the land, allowing you to flatten out areas quicker etc. While a nice thing to have, the reason this review is now edited is due to the developers finally getting off their ♥♥♥ and providing an update. On time. If this keeps up, I have hopes once again for Towns. The idea is great, and if it is true we're seeing Xavi once again get to work, then Towns could finally become the game it was advertised as. If you like town building games like Gnormia, Dwarf Fortress etc, Towns is a nice twist that basically is you making a town/city for an adventurer. Imagine your the town that the hero in skyrim comes and visits. The hero might bring enemies with them, among other things, and survival is incredibly hard. This is not an easy game. Only if you like this genre of title and want to spice things up would I suggest buying it CURRENTLY; we will need to see if the developers can keep working on it, lest they fall into their bad habits again. Keep an eye on this review; in the future, it will change as updates come along.Man, I wish they could launch in Early Access retroactively.---ORIGINAL---I entered Towns unknowing of it's past or the community reaction. It looked cool enough, and I thought that I could make towns like the screenshots showed.Boy was I wrong.If you want to spend $15 on this you're not fit to be on Steam let alone have the method of purchasing games. I'm glad I only spent $5 on this mess. Where to start? The early game is practically impossible; the tutorials don't cover anything useful and you're villagers will not follow your orders in the right order; you might ask them to build walls to protect themselves then ask them to make a house: The house will be made half way then some random walls will be put in, all the while they run into eachother and get stuck. Lack of food, lack of direction and overall poor controls make this game basically unplayable. You'd have better luck finding a brand new AAA release on %99 discount on Steam than someone who has ever made anything that resembles the screenshots in this awful game. You enter thinking of grand citites: You leave with a tribe of misfits trying to survive in the worst way possible.			"

												This is the infamous game that has gave a bad name to steam's early release program.This was one of the first games to be available to purchase from a new (at the time) steam division which was intended to give funding to games which were partially developed and showed a lot of promise.  Back in 2011ish, this game was seen as having amazing potential. Lots of people bought the game, and we thought the money we gave would be used so that the programmer would work full time on the game.  (There is a big write up on exactly how much money was generated from game sales, I can't remember if it was in the hundreds of thousands of dollars or more). What happenned instead, was that the developer took the money and stopped working on this game.  Disbelief, outrage, and anger from the community ensued.  No refunds were issued. Steam didn't withhold any of the cash.  So many people feel they were burned by this affair, that they swore off purchasing pre-release games ever again. And that's the real loss here.			"

												Broken, buggy, unfinished mess. This game was released on Greenlight, with the devs claiming that they would continue development. I understood this to mean that I was buying into an alpha that was in development still. The game feels about 40% complete. It's playable, but..1. The AI is terrible. Both townie and mob. 2. The way you construct things is really hard to use, reminescent of RCT2 in that the isometric way the roofs tile makes it difficult for you to see if you placed a roof properly or not, but with the added annoyance that you need to have it so that your townies can reach it, so you need to place scaffolds everywhere. It's not fun, it feels like a chore.3. The GUI seriously leaves a lot to be desired. Things with no tooltip, weird buttons that do unclear things, annoying flashing notification buttons every single time you pause/unpause..4. Complete(or near complete) lack of satisfactory tutorials. It's not extremely hard to grasp like DF is, but there are strange things that I still don't understand, like why the entire underground of the map appears to be a giant dungeon and there is no underground stone. 5. Bugs.6. No where near as much customization is possible as DF has, the environment is basically the same generic map each time.All of these things are totally fixable. The problem? The devs have halted development. There hasn't been a patch in several months, no offical posts on the (horrible, echo chamber of a) forum, total silence. They kept complaining about being bogged down by all the work, and being burnt out. Plenty of devs are, but you don't just stop development completely. You take breaks, not quit. Ask people for ideas, don't quit. Open up your code so that others can work on it with you, don't quit. Really disappointed I supported this project and got a broken, unfinished product. It's made me more cynical about buying into alphas, which isn't a good thing to be, either, I guess. Don't buy this broken, unfinished mess. Truly a disappointment.			"

												The concept of this game is neat, but it is lacking a lot. I've played it a while ago, and I dare say it was a bit better back then than it is now. Development seems to be quite stagnant here. At the end of this review you'll read what I really recommend instead.The tutorials are, to say the least, quite braindead. They could've made it more interactive, but as it is now it's quite dull. Some details seems to be badly written as I didn't always get the desired results.The military in the game is kind of a joke. If I see a spider or any other enemy, why oh why can't I just go rightclick it and tell the military to go attack it? Or at least something that enables me to make more use of the military than 'patrol there' and hope that they actually will engage the enemy on their patrol routes.The actual mining is quite non-intuitive. Somehow I wasn't able to mine certain areas until I moved up/down. It's rather hard to see what level you are at currently, and there are no size indicators in the area you're about to mark to be mined. And you can build a roof but somehow I have not managed to build a roof on top of my shacks. I might give that a try again another time, but the game seems so pointless that it isn't really motivating to.You have absolutely no connection with those little guys you're ordering around. You can see some basic stats, but all those little peoples aren't really special. It's lacking a certain something there, and I can't quite place my finger on it. Let's just say that you don't really care who they are, as long as they get the jobs done already. There's no feel of a story attached to it.Assigning jobs and assigning productions/stockpiles is quite a chore. So much a chore that you just leave everything up to the defaults. A quick overview is rather impossible. Sure, they do have a list of civilians, and a stockpile list. But instead of having it present a clear overview, it's rather a messy job. I think they focused way too much on iconized displays with tiny numbers inside. In cases like this, a table-format would probably make more sense. We want to know some nice numbers and some other stats, not how pretty they look in a circle with one tiny number in there.Speaking about iconized displays.. the GUI is very clunky. It is definitely not polished and is just bare bones style. Nothing fancy about it and there are options lacking. The build icons are non-intuitive. If you want to go back a level in the menu, the 'go back' arrow is in a different location every level. So you can't just 'click click click' fast to get to the root level. No, you have to check every time you went back one level in the menu where the back button is at now. Nothing has been streamlined in this game.If you are charmed by this kind of game, I can recommend a different one instead which is still in active development and is rather more promising. Take it from me, you want to try Gnomoria. It might be in Early Access, but I've been playing it for a while (on Desura and now also on Steam), and it is way more finished than this Towns ever will be.			"

												I adore Towns. I know it's not the popular opinion here, but I have spent a happy 300+ hours building and exploring and fighting. It was well worth the $10 or so that I spent on it a few years ago. In Towns, you are in charge of an idiotic band of Townies who you instruct to gather resources, build buidlings, craft luxuries, cook food, and defend the town both as soldiers and civilains. In addition to keeping you populace well-fed and happy, you must defend against raiding bands of villians while delving deep into the dangerous underground to find more stone, iron, and gold. You can entice heroes to come and help you or instead swarm the monsters with well-armed townsfolk. The gameplay is heavy in resource management and building but has a satisfying amount of fighting and exploring. Why are the reviews so negative? This game long been public and under development, and that development stalled and then eventually halted. There are lists of features yet to be implemented and bugs to be fixed. Many believe that Towns is an unfinished game and are very angry about this. My interpretation is that the developers were just too ambitious about what to include and ended up with lots of great features that don't all function perfectly. I think it's finished, just not polished.  So despite my positive review, buyer beware. Play a demo if you can. Think about what bugs get under your skin and what you are happy to ignore while exploring the game mechanics. Think about how many hours or what level of gameplay you need to shell out some cash. But I would buy this game again, even in its current state. But do not buy it expecting additional development - that ship has sailed.			"

												Ok, having reviewed the game again, it still seems to me like this is a very hit or miss game.  On the one hand, it's a game with the interesting premise that you're creating a town to attract heroes to fight in the dungeons that are invariably discovered beneath the town.  On the other hand, it's bogged down by horrible micromanagement through clunky menus.  Before you find yourself running a town worthy of adventurers coming to visit, you have to BUILD the town.  You start with a handful of people standing around with their thumbs up their asses waiting for you to tell them what to do.  You tell them to grab some fruit and put it over there in a patch of ground we'll call a stockpile.  You tell them to chop down trees and put the wood over there in a different stockpile.  You designate certain areas of ground as a room for various purposes and then have to figure out what order you're required to build the furniture for these rooms.So you want beds for your people to sleep in?  You're gonna need a carpentry bench in a carpentry zone.  What about food more filling than apples and pears?  I guess you're gonna need a baking table and a baking oven in a baking zone.  But wait; there's something about this baking oven being made out of stone.  Now you're going to need a masonry room and an appropriate table in an appropriate zone.This kind of crap takes place all the time in this game. Oh and it's also set to some mind numbing repetitive music barely above ""bad midi song"" level. The characters themselves aren't very well animated and most might as well be colored stick figures.  I mean, you tell your guys to chop down a tree...do you see them pull out an axe and swing it at the trunk?  No, you see them stand next to a tree for a few minutes while a chopping sound effect is played and then you're treated to your character hauling a log across the map to a stockpile (if you bothered to make one).This game has a lot of promise and I've actually had this game since it was ""officially released"" waiting for it to live up to that promise.  It hasn't done it yet.  Oh and about that official release:  It basically went from alpha to final release overnight.  Had steam's ""Early Access"" been a thing at the time it would have been a perfect candidate for it.  Instead they released it as if it were done when just a day before it was ""alpha"" quality...but again, that wasn't really an option for them and they were desperate to make sales.  Now, in the time since the game went ""live"" on steam to the writing of this review, they've put up a few updates and it does look like they've fixed a few things here and there, but it hasn't changed to the point where I could wholeheartedly say ""yes, buy this game!""  It's still got a rough and unfinished feel to it, and if they'd take some time to polish up the UI, add some more variety to the music, and redo most of the graphics, it would at least look like they've made some progress.  Instead it's all ""under the hood"" stuff with very little outward change from the earliest version on Steam.If despite all of this you're still willing to buy the game, yes, you can easily sink 10-20 hours into it (I've almost sunk 20 into it when it was in its most broken state) because you get that feeling that somehow you're slowly making progress in the game and building something.  It's not entirely unsatisfying...it's just not entirely satisfying either.  If you buy it, lower your expectations and I'm sure this game will meet those lowered expecations and maybe even surpass them.  If instead you go into it expecting a great and polished game from the start, you'll be let down hard.			"

												As many others have been stating, this game has long since been abandoned. I used to play this quite a while back, and while I did have fun and enjoy it at times, it lacks in quite a few things that could've been improved to be much better. The game has quite a few glitches and issues, and I think it's a shame what happened to it. It could've been a much better game than it is right now. It has some potential, but I'm disappointed that the makers have stopped entirely, and I wish that I hadn't spent the $15 on it that I spent. This game has become one of the only games I regret purchasing.Likely the creators and developers do not have enough support, and things probably got too complicated. While I understand everyone and all developers have their own life and their own needs, I've seen so little effort into updating this game and bringing it back to life that it feels like the entire project is dead to them.It's sad when this happens to games. I've played some wonderful indie games before, but I'm afraid this one is just going to still be dead as it's been for so long. I wouldn't advise purchasing it, and I'm sure there are much better games that could be found of similar gameplay types.			"

												It is really not that great. There is no real way to sum up all the existing posted reviews other than saying; ""DO NOT BUY"". It is a waste of time. I managed little more than 30mins before giving up on it. Maybe if the developers can come back from their slumber and resume work I might give it another go.

												While the game was promising while it was being developed, the developers have stated that they have seized all development and support. The game more or less feels like a scam now, and Xavi Canal and Ben Palgi made millions of euros from it. This was probably the last unfinished game I ever purchased because of that.A sad fortune, because the game really did have promise.Edit: It seems someone has been appointed to further develop this game. If this is the case, the outlook should be more positive.			"

												Towns is now the poster child for Early-Access-Gone-Bad. The devs took the money and ran. All I can say about Towns, is that it was the first (as far as I am aware of) game that mixed a usuable interface with Dwarf Fortress. The graphics were fine, and the music is meh. The game was really fun.I really want to give this a positive review because I got well over 20 hours out of this. I think I paid 15$ so I feel like I got my moneys worth out of this title. Would I tell you to buy it now? No. Go for Gnomoria. Trust me on this one.			"

												This game. THIS ♥♥♥♥ING GAME. I had fun. I had a lot of fun. But this game is like a ♥♥♥♥ING CRASH TO DESKTOP SIMULATOR. Once every hour, this game will CRASH WITH NO INDICATION AS TO WHY. Plus, I have heard that the developers have STOPPED. Early access they said. Now what? $15, and they don't even finish their game. What made me write this review was what happened a little while ago. My citizens dug out some stone, which I told them to. The stone was holding up a ♥♥♥♥ ton of water from the river above. Water is infinite in certain situations, and my miner ended up dying. Tried to remove the water by doing the ""Remove Liquid"" option, ONE DAMN BLOCK AT A TIME. GUESS WHAT? HALF THE TOP OF THE RIVER IS GONE, WHICH IS LIKE A THIRD OF THE ♥♥♥♥ING RIVER, AND THEN THE GAME CRASHES! ♥♥♥♥ING ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥T. YOU GET A NOT RECOMMENDED FROM ME, TOWNS.

												If you like buying a game where the developer announces they are abandoning it before it's finished and in the same post announces the sequal. This is the game! I don't get how you can announce a sequal in the exact same post of you deciding you'll never finish this game. I hope you realize how stupid that was, I'm sure marketing Towns 2 is going to be great. ""Hey remember Towns, the game we never finished, buy Towns 2!""This game needs to be removed as soon as possible. The gameplay is nowhere near polished to be sold on it's own. At first, it's kinda easy to maintain all the citizens and stop them from going deep underground to get useless items. But, the more citizens you have the harder it is to stop them from going on suicide missions and you'll have citizens dying constantly. It's more fustrating then fun trying to build a decent town.

												PENDING FUTURE UPDATES: As of now I can't recommend. This is a game that has a lot of promise but ultimately fails to deliver. The tutorials do not explain a whole lot, and are often buggy. (Random shutdowns.) There hasn't been muchwork done on the game. If you're going to sell a product, make it a playable product. One that delivers. The dungeon mentioned that is below the town? Not there. Character AI? Random, buggy to where it doesn't always respond to yourcommands. Everything else plays like someone put it together with a poor copy of RPG maker. I held off reviewing this for a while, because I liked the initial promise...but it has been months and months with nothing of merit added to the game. I can see why the others felt ripped off.Steer clear until the devs get their act together.			"

It was fun while it lasted. Play the demo. Then, if you don't care about any current bugs or future updates, you might consider purchasing this game. It probably wouldn't be worth the full price tag since it lacks any development, but it might be worth it if it went on sale.Edit: Just saw an update for this game in my download queue.

												I've got to say I'm glad I got it when it was on sale. It's definitely more of a $5 game, not a $15 one. If you find this game at $5 or less, then think about it, but any more than that and you might want to find something that got finished. This review is based off of my experience and the regular price though, so overall I don't recommend it. There's no way there isn't better games out there than this.Let me start with what I found to be good about the game though, since I did technically like it. I never played this Gnomoria that everyone else is mentioning, and with little function in Minecraft for watching a village come to life even with mods, I found it to be a great idea. Even though it was immediately obvious from opening the game that it was far from finished I found myself enjoying finding different combinations and ways of getting my limited villagers to survive.Secondly, the zoning. By assigning a zone type to an area the area gains a particular function, while losing other functions. This makes building a city kind of cool because the buildings one makes will actually function the way that they've zoned it to. Added to the fact that, if one could figure out the menus easily, one could get the villagers to use and upkeep these zones automatically, without any help from the player. Then there's just the world in general. Although the maps are small, they generate well, and they're fun and easy to shape. If a player shows enough patience, it actually is possible to build the kinds of places they show in the promotional material and screenshots.The last thing I thought was really cool was being able to put writing on tombstones and books and things. I can go through my village and remind myself of the events that passed. Who died, who did the best, or helped the most – it felt like making a civilization, even though it was really just a town at best. Epic legacies in a tiny town.Now, the wonderful negatives that ruined it. Unfortunately there are a lot of these, so I'll put a chunk of them in point form;*Odd menu style. That took a while to get used too, and I feel like things could be implemented better.*Moving items is a hassle, or just plain confusing.*Can't place enough text in books, graves, signs, etc, and can't use characters like “/”, making labels and text look flat and odd, like they were written by some 10 year old that was too lazy to use any punctuation. Breaks immersion. *The use of scaffold isn't clearly stated to be useful, and so it can be difficult to find out about it and how to use it properly to build better buildings. There isn't a lot of direct help on the internet either, so simply building can be a hassle. Also, making second floors is too tricky.*Extremely limited character sprites. Everyone will have too many clones for you to care about them. They also all have weird french-sounding names, even if playing the English version, and though unimportant, feels like it takes away from immersion into the game.*The armour doesn't fit on the sprites properly. Sometimes this is funny, but it just isn't proper for a game that costs $15.*The first floor dungeons, though easy to pass, are too expansive and too full of monsters. There's no easing into it at all, making the game feel less thought-out and more slapped together. Also an immersion breaker.*Next to no updates. These people probably don't care anymore, and it's showing. They don't update anywhere near as much as they should, and some of the bugs in the game could really use some fixes.*The bugs. Seriously, the game is definitely not a finished product. Amusing, but certainly not finished.And lastly, though kind of silly, what I found to be the game-breaker; The weapons you make, buy, and find are cool and all, but it isn't hard for some ""hero"" to waltz by and take all your good stuff, leaving your citizens and soldiers pretty close to defenceless. Some heroes. I worked hard on that stuff. “That hat was for the blacksmith!” and “she needed that spear to save her life!” might become alarmingly common frustrations.So yeah. Ends up under $5? It'll amuse you long enough. $15? It's cute, but it ain't that cute, just go back to your Minecraft mods and this ""Gnomoria"" everyone else is talking about.			"

Their names are Xavi Canal and Ben Palgi if you'd like to read more about the story.  So then they give the development over to some poor schmuk named Frankenberger.

												**** August 2015 Update ****Almost a year after being told the game development was suspended for ""home renovations"", there has been no word from the developers and the forums continue to stay without complaint (due to moderator Yetichow not allowing posts that factually state the game's status or factually state why the game is unfinished/needs improvement/general feedback).So, on that note, please make sure you avoid the game (unless you want to waste your money).  Read the REVIEWS of the game and disregard the forums (since Yetichow had decided to scrub them clean and ban any who disagree).   Congratulations, Towns.  You made it into the Steam group, ""ScamReport"".  You should be proud...(/sarcasm)****March 2015 Update****I wouldn't bother checking the forums for any kind of clarity.  The current moderator bans anyone who criticizes the game, despite there being valid reasons to criticize.  Only the positive forum posts don't get edited or deleted.  Anyone trying to warn potential buyers on the actual status of the game, gets banned.We were told that development had picked up again (for the fourth time of it being active and then subsequently stopped) but after only a month-ish, the current moderator stated the developer was having house renovations done and did not have regular internet access.  That was in September of 2014. Make your own judgement call from that...---------------------------------**** Initial Review ****Voted to Greenlight the game WAY back and upon it's release on Steam, I was excited to buy it.  Imagine my shock when the game I loaded up was nothing more than a poorly coded alpha with a crap tutorial and a laundry list of game-breaking bugs.According to the Devs, the game was fulling finished and wasn't in alpha/beta/whatever.  Fully finished. Fully playable.  With continued updates scheduled!  Please note:  There was no demo released at the time.  NOWHERE on the page did it state that the game was feature incomplete (which is STILL is).  And then customers started voicing their concerns.  They (myself included) were met with insults from the PR/Devs directly (anyone remember TommyKent's abrasion?).  We were called stupid for not ""understanding"" how these type of games are to played.   That ""if we just gave it time"" we'd figure it all out.Screw that.Even over a year later, the game has only had a handful of crappy updates - most not even addressing major issues.  We've been told the entire run of excuses from health problems, to vacations, to quitting programmers (who left to work on other projects! AWESOME!)Avoid this like the plague.  It was a cash grab.  They're millionaires now (not exaggerating) and they're never coming back to save this wreck of a game.  Matter of fact, avoid anything SMP does.  I will be.			"

												The Short of it:This game has been abandoned, wait till a sale brings its price down if you want to try it.The long of it:Unfortunatly I can't recomend this game. I bought it when it was still young and worthwhile, full of proimise and hope, sadly it has been abandoned.Don't get me wrong here, I love the concept, I love the style and I love how the game works, but its unfinished, buggy and in need of some serious love. Perhaps the developers would be willing to part with it and hand it to someone who would be better suited to... finishing it off with all the features that I recall seeing on a roadmap... somewhere a long time ago....If theres anything I can say about the game its that its gotten buggier since I stopped playing it, perhaps thats just the age of my computer finally showing, but I don't think so.Its still quite challanging in and of itself, but like most of my towns end up, it is very unfinished, ""Hero"" mode and one other mode not implimented, and a lot of things requiring some much needed... laquer.If you are looking for a game that will play similarly to this one but has a more finished feel try Gnomoria or Banished. Hell even the currently WIP Hearthstone has a more finished and complete feel!Keep an open mind that games are always subject to change, and that, if this game is lucky, it will be worked on again.

I have the sense that I threw my money away, but thats a risk with Early Access. But, please, don't waste your money.

Towns is sadly full of wasted potential.  On paper, it had everything going for it: resource gathering, micro management, needs of villagers, crafting, construction and combat. Instead, everything is implemented in a basic way that for some reason just doesn't work, and ends up being a cluster♥♥♥♥, to put bluntly. The screenshots showcasing busy townfolk running around a bustling city look amazing, but don't be fooled: whilst it's true a picture says a thousand words, gameplay says a thousand words + 1. The graphics, well, it looks like it was made in the early 90s,    there were a few games using similar painted-art style, but I can't remember their names. The interface is ugly and obstructive, thankfully though the buttons can be minimised. The entire game looks like a free game you play on those Flash sites. Not necessarily bad I must add, but surely if they took a backseat towards the visual department, then they could have pumped more beans into the gameplay side of things? Apparently not. Main game problem: Artificial Intelligence. The villagers lack any kind of soul and brain, that makes the NPCs in Doom and Quake more likeable.   They'll randomly dart across the landscape for no apparent reason, and the way they slide across the place looks freaky. They have no goals and just stand there doing nothing, permanently frozen in an upright stance for eternity (except when they die they rotate 90 degrees). Order them to chop down a forest, and they'll just fly towards the area en mass, stand completely motionless in front of the tree and it magically dissapears, through use of sound effects. Couldn't they at least have the sprite of an axe in their hand?  About their intelligence, they just come across as mindless drones.   Granted, they actually do a very good job of following orders: ask them to hack down some trees, mine some rock and what not, and they'll literally drop everything, rush towards the area like a bunch of gophers and gleefully carry out said task until it's done. If only public service workers in real life were as committed as these folk are.   On the other hand, the villagers lack any sense of self preservation.   They'll often, for no reason at all, decide to wonder to the complete opposite end of the map and get killed (or ♥♥♥♥♥ rather, due to the bad animations) by some high level monsters. Then again for some unknown reason, another villager will decide it's their turn to dash to the other end of the map and repeat this morbid process. It's extremely frustrating as there is no explanation nor solution to this phenomenon, I've actually lost an entire village due to this sick process. If it's not a bug and actually some invisible monster using mind control on my villagers to turn them into suicidal lemmings, than I do apologise. Remember when I said before about game features being basic, yet for some reason not actually working?   Well here's an example. I tell a villager to go bake some bread, he does so without delay. Next to the bakery is a designated area for storing bread. Said villager then bakes the bread, and takes the finish products to the store room. Simple right? What actually happens is SOME bread gets put in the store room, whilst the rest is just littering the floor of the bakery, for no explained reason. And now the villagers are eating the bread off the dirty floor INSTEAD of the stockpile, despite the stockpile being closer to them. And again for some unknown reason, some of the villagers decide to find food in the dangerous jungles be yonder, rather than pluck it from the safety of their own town. Maybe they suffer from wheat and gluten allergy? OK, good things. City building is decent enough, as the villagers will happily carry out construction, even when they are dying of starvation:   a problem with other city building games is that sometimes buildings weren't been built because the villagers were too busy with other trivial tasks or ""idleing"", so props to Towns for fixing this common issue (even if it's due to bad AI). You can custom build your houses block by block, choosing a variety of different colours, furniture, etc, and decorate the surrounding area with plants and other decorations. So in essence, Towns does actually deliver what the name implies, assuming you can get past the bugs and terrible AI, and the fact is you need the AI to get the most out of Towns. Finally, there is only one, ONE single 2 or so minute long music loop that plays throughout the entire game.   Do yourself a favour, switch that damn thing off and play something in the background of Youtube, as this single endless loop will drive you absolutely insane. Towns is a massive disappointment, considering the hype and broken promises the developers blew around.   It actually got abandoned after it was pushed out of beta and into its final, albeit broken release state. I guess they jumped onto the city building craze every other indie game was doing, but didn't have the know-how on how to actually make a game properly. It's a colossus shame as Towns could have very well become a massive hit and a new standard for village building games. If the original developers were to release the game engine/source code for open modification, that could potentially completely turn this game into a success as I bet there's many talented people out there just hoping to get their hands on this and fix all the problems.There's tons of other similar games that does everything way better. And for the record, to end the Towns vs Gnomoria debate, Gnomoria wins tenfold. At the time of writing, I've only spent 3 hours in Towns, as opposed to 65 hours in Gnomoria. Don't need to say more.

												Towns had the potential to be an absolutely phenominal game. Had was the key word in that sentence. The game has been abandoned by the developers because it no long her enough punlicity for them. Do not buy this game unless you want to support a group of developers that no longer cares about their community of gamers.			"

												This could have been a great game. Health and other personal problems have seemingly prevented the dev from finishing the game, if we believe the statements on the dev blog. Or maybe he took on more than he could handle. I don't see this product as a scam as some other steam users do, but knowing it will never be updated it's surely too expensive for what it's worth. At least I've had fun with it so for me it has been worth the money. I sometimes replay this unfinished gem and wonder whether a similar game will ever see the light of day.			"

												Before you read any further: this game has been abandoned. Any flaws, problems or glitches will not be fixed. Towns might have been the first Early Access game I've ever bought and it made me skeptical and wary of all future Early Access titles. It has a great premise that is executed poorly and although you might have a bit of fun with it for a few hours, there is little here to recommend an indepth playthrough.I don't mind isometric, retroish graphics but these are, more often than not, absolutely annoying to look at. Towns has gone for a sort of Populus/Simcity kind of look, all graphical tilesets and while I think some of it works, particularly outside of the Town in the woods and forest, it often just looks totally ugly. There's no definition or clear sense of layering; what lies in front of things and behind other things can be really hard to tell. When you do have a Town, it all runs together and looks like someone who just found out they can download Final Fantasy sprites and has mashed them all together. Certain textures really grate on the eyes, particularly the water texture which you see a lot of.Controlling this game isn't much better as the inteface is awful.  I've played a lot of games with clunky interfaces and struggled my way through them but this might be one of the worst. Absolutely nothing about it works properly; you'll probably have to hit every key on the keyboard to figure out what does what and even then, attempting to divine the systems that control anything in this game is like trying to scry the future or turn lead into gold. Towns had a lot of potential for growth (with a bad launch, but hey, potential?) - I mean, running a town built over a dungeon and attracting heroes, managing the enemies that come out, building the town up with facilities for the adventurers? It sounds like a perfect blend of Recettear, Diablo and Dungeon Keeper. But this is not that; Towns is a shoddy, abandoned game with very little to recommend it. It usually comes on sale for 7.49, discounted down from 14.99. It is not worth playing at either price and the fact they want you to pay $15 dollars for an abandoned game is repulsive. You shouldn't be paying for abandonware - speak with your wallet and say no to Towns.NOTE: Steam shows 0.1 hours on record but I know for a fact I played at least a day of this - it felt longer, honestly, but trust me you don't need a whole day to see the flaws in this one.

Yet, the developer is working on other projects, AFTER he took everybody's money. Everybody gets burnt out and frustrated at times, but why just abandon the project altogether? Especially when so many people paid for it, expecting patches, fixes, new content, etc. The game is fun, and it's good for what it is... but it will unfortunately most likely never be finished.			"

The dev posted a ton of things that never got implemented and jumped the ship with all that early access cash; leaving the game in an alpha state, full of bugs, and with mediocre gameplay.

												DO NOT BUY.  THIS GAME HAS BEEN ABANDONED.This initially had promise as one of the first Greenlight titles in 2012, and I enjoyed the potential within.  However, the developer did not complete the game as promised, and I'm actualy quite stunned it's even for sale still.  Personally, I would not recommend anyone purchasing an incomplete product and rewarding someone for essentially being incompetent.  This game sold well, and generated more money than what this result is worth.  There are a myriad of better, and cheaper, alternatives.THIS IS AN INCOMPLETE GAME THAT WILL LIKELY NEVER BE FINISHED.  DO NOT PURCHASE.			"

												While I sure got my monies worth out of this game (some 60 hours clocked) the fact remains that the dev ran off without finishing the game, and this after several youtubers had been praising the game (and funnily enough getting their names in the game). hmm.. Not saying anything.The premise of the game is solid just it still lacks so much that would make it a good game, is it playable sure and you could probably have more then a few fun hours but the fact remains we shouldn't be rewarding devs who just dash off with our money like that. Was the first and last time I put any money on an early access game. Shame, as I said I like the idea behind the game, the graphics are cute but in the end.. there isn't enough there.Oh and did I mention the dev just ran off without a word?			"

												This game is not complete, even though they it's not listed as Early Access. Basically they just took the cash and ran. I'd like to say some really nasty things about that, but that would be pointless.Lots of playtime pre-Steam. Game still has most the bugs it did when it was alpha. IMO the biggest bug is that your people work themselves to death, literally, they forget to eat and starve. Got one town up to 70 population, only to see them starve to death in the next 2 hours to to 5. After that I deleted it, being that was the upteenth town that did that.One of the patches made all the townies rock climbers, so you only need the first set of stairs. And then you get to watch them all race down into to the depths, to fight and die. Heroes are the ones that are supposed to go fight the monsters, not your townies. Once you've collected all that loot and minerals, you're left thinking, what do I do with it. Since there really isn't much to make, I think there's only 1 item made out of gold. So you have that hero running around with that wooden sword you made because he's too stupid to pick up that magical sword that was found. So usually one of your townies will equip it. You can tell them what to equip, but it's a click fest just to get it done. Your townies are kinda stupid too, they just drop everything on the ground rather then put it into containers that are right next to them (that was also int he alpha).Want to have more fun? Turn on sieges and get wiped out before you even make that the second crafting table your need. Last time I played with siege's on (that's where the monsters can attack you town up top, not counting what the heroes pull to your town), I had just made my first workstation, and here came the spiders, they killed off most of my townies and then the rest of them were wiped out by the next 2 sieges that were 5 minutes apart. Games are supposed to be fun and keep the player active and interested. This game doesn't do that. This is also the only game I know of where the player is penalized for being active. So if you're constanly giving them orders, none will show up. I used to go watch tv so they could have 'idle time. I heard that there was a patch that came out for this. From what I understood of it, it did minor fixes and made it playable on some other OS so they could suck more money from unsuspecting buyers.How strange my original review of this poor game disappeared. Might have been deleted by the devs due to me stating that they have a new game they want you to buy. I forget the name of that one. However I intend to avoid anything these guys work on it the future if I possibly can. They abandoned this  BETA because they got bored and started playing the blame game. Who's to say they won't do it again. One dev even bragged in the Steam forums that he took a months vacation in South America from the profits.  How about finishing the game?So if you want a game that penalizes you, gets boring, frustrating and is incomplete, go ahead and buy this.			"

												I wanted to like this game. I really, really did. I played this for days, almost obsessively. It almost seemed like it was starting to get better, after many hours of having it constantly crash on me, I got into the habit of saving compulsively. After losing progress, hours upon hours of progress I'd start anew, stronger, faster, better prepared. But I don't think it was ever as fun as it seemed at the time. It was horribly tedious. I often had another game going on another system at the same time, as I waited for things to happen in the background. That's not a game. That's a simulation. And if I wanted to play a simulation, I'd run one with more polish and more things that were interesting to watch. This has neither. I'm certain there's something similar, better, out there. Find it. Play that instead. Don't waste your time like I did.			"

FREEZE! Before you even think about buying this game, let me ask you a few questions. Do you like unfinished games that try to pass themselves off as ""finished""? Hopefully not.Do you like extremely buggy and unplayable games that make vanilla Bethesda games pale in comparison? You really shouldn't!And finally, do you like wasting money on a game that promised continual updates? Of course not!""Towns"" is the epitome of unrealized potential. Lazy developers took what would have been a decent time-wasting game and somehow managed to turn it into a mess. This pile of slop caused a backlash worthy of a Penny Arcade article.http://www.penny-arcade.com/report/article/the-perils-of-greenlight-how-towns-enraged-a-community-by-selling-a-game-th It was published in 2012 and still rings true over a year later.In short, please DO NOT buy this game ever.

												Don't buy this.  Don't even consider it.I made the mistake of thinking this was a near-finished product that would be a bit easier to play than Gnome Fortress.  Not as complex but you know- a town simulator of SOME degree.  So I bought it more than a year ago.  The ""tutorial"" was garbage, as was the interface, the gameplay- basically everything was atrocious to one degree or another.  I promised to never touch it again until it was released in a finished state.News: IT WILL NEVER BE FINISHED.  Seriously.  Look at http://www.townsgame.com/forums/viewtopic.php?f=8&t=11402.  They're done ""updating it.""Basically, this was a Greenlight product that was released before it should have been.  This is the one game that made me completely cautious of ever supporting any Early Access title whatsoever- AND THIS WASN'T EVEN EARLY ACCESS.  IT WAS RELEASED AS A FINISHED PRODUCT.  FOR 15 DOLLARS.This is a perfect example of what developers have the potential to do with your money.  Promise to make finished products and then back off and reap the rewards without any reprimand.  Sure, it sucks that the developer got burned out but he should have realized what he was doing before he was able to put this on Steam as a completed game.

												When I bought this game it wasn't even labeled as being unfinished, I gave the game a chance and got bored with how buggy and incomplete it was so I waited and waited and waited and got to the point where I just lost interest in the game all together...one day I read an article about how the developers of this game had abandoned it. Developers like this thieving ♥♥♥♥♥♥ give all indie devs a bad name so don't give this conman any money for this game or any other game he may develop in the future.			"

												Unfortunately, as the game progresses, there is a major bug that causes your townies to freeze or ""forget"" what they are doing.  Not really worth playing as having a large enough settlement to successfully explore dungeons creates this fatal game breaking condition.   "

												I played this game back when it was in alpha, back when there was still active development and a very active community. A friend of mine did a Let's Play of it and I enjoyed what I saw and played. Sadly, the last developer has finally called it quits, and I personally doubt this game will ever leave its alpha/beta state. It is fun micromanaging your town, trying to get immigrants to come to it and attract heroes to it as well, but the food system seriously needs to be reworked. My villagers can go all the way down to the bottom of my mine before needing to come back up again to eat, and since your town can experience hunger lock (Where you don't have any food at all and all villagers can't do anything due to starvation), expect a massive kill off if your food supply ever dwindles to an incredibly low number.There was a lot of potential behind this game, enough potential that I threw my money behind it back in 2011. Sadly, that potential will never be truly realized since its own developers and the last man working on this game gave up on it. If there ever is a Towns 2, I will not buy it due to the lack of interest the developers had in the first game.			"

												Development on this game stopped about a year ago when it was still unfinished. I don't understand why it is part of today's (Oct 12, 2015) weeklong sale. It is not a finished product and never will be. The last patch was over a year ago. Steam, you are doing your customers a disfavor by still selling this. It is failures such as this product that are turning players away from funding and purchasing Early Access games. It certainly turned me off and I won't make that mistake again.

												I do not recommend this game for one simple reason: it is not finished. Read the posts of others for confirmation. This has happened to a few DF clone games that I have tried on steam. Bottom line: I knew I was taking a chance when I bought it, and like any other entertainment that you like that is abandoned, you are left with the hope someone comes along and resurrects it. If you get it on steam for a cheap price it might be worth it for a few hours of fun until you realize you have run out of material.			"

												I hate to give bad reviews, but this game deserves it.  I was one of the many who jumped in early when this game was first released, mainly on the promise of what the devs said it would become.  I played the game a lot back in late 2012 and early 2013 and enjoyed it for the most part, but there were lots of things that still needed to be fixed, most notably the AI and the way it would handle performing tasks with your villagers.Reinstalled and played the game again a few months ago.....and found that nothing had changed in almost 2 years!  Reading about how the original dev abandoned the game and ""sold"" the rights to someone else is almost heartbreaking.  Indie games have a bad name with a lot of casual gamers because of behavior like this, and I'm ashamed that I contributed to this jerk walking away with more than $2 million in sales.			"

I had a couple of extended playthroughs even though it was buggy and clunky, but it was fun nevertheless and showed heaps of promise.However, it was never completed, there's no signs that it ever will be, and so it joins the growing ranks of unfinished early access games :/If it was priced at a couple of bucks, I'd say get it and you'll get a bit of fun out of it.

												Incomplete game, being sold as a finished product.Dev team has fallen apart and/or walked away multiple times.Every once in a while a meaningless patch is applied so that the founder can say ""See! not abandoned!""It had potential, they did not get there before the game stopped advancing.It's a game where you do not directly control the units, you say what you would like done and the AI gets around to it, sorta like dwarf fortress..... but wait, that only works if the AI is functional. The AI is this game is more brainless than the original AI in Master of Orion 3.Run away, don't read about the game, if you see what it was supposed to be you will just be sad that it never made it to that point.

												In a nut shell, Towns didn't make any sense. The game was extremely boring and quite dull. There are many better town builder games out there which are very similar, but better, then Towns. At first glance the game seemed interesting and new, but it turned out to be buggy and unpleasant. It being the one of the first few games to get Greenlighted, Town had a lot of potential. Some of the blame for the flop of Towns goes to the developers. I feel like these Devs almost completely ignore there game and get out around 2 patches per year. For a game that is still this buggy the devs should be working harder. The upside to Towns was it gave me a hour of mediocre fun. Overall, don't buy Towns.3.9/10 Sloanster Score			"

												The idea behind the game has merit, but in actually play I found it very boring and repetative with few moments that felt like something had been achieved or completed. There are better games for town building and better games for dungeon adventures. While this game mixes them both, it does so it a very lack luster way. If later on down the road there are some sort of objectives, quests, goals, or really anything to help give the game some momentum it may be worth revisting. For now however, I cannot reccomend this game. 4/10			"

												Excitedly coaxed into buying Towns by a friend I was incredbily dissapointed. Towns is nothing but a reskin of Dwarf Fortress (A FREE game with graphics mod already available and better also for free) with no intresting mechanics, a poor tutorial that will frustrate those not familiar with Dwarf Fortress, among techinical issues I experienced (frame drops galore on Mac). Towns is also infamous for being one of the first projects taken off of Steam Early Access. That basically means the dev, knowing it was unfinished, decided to take his project off leaving the current version available with no future updates. An unfinished project that sets a terrible, unfortunate precident for furture projects in the Early Access program.			"

												Disappointing.This game is a clear example of why one should be cautious when buying into a beta, alpha, or early access title. When I bought into this, Towns was in early alpha, and looked like a promising graphic upgrade to dwarf fortress. However the game is not a completed product, missing many of the features that were promised by the devs, and full of bugs. The devs left the game in a beta state.That being said I did get some enjoyment out of the game. The base idea for the game is a good one, and what is there is fun to play. However it gets old quick.

												Disappointing.This game is a clear example of why one should be cautious when buying into a beta, alpha, or early access title. When I bought into this, Towns was in early alpha, and looked like a promising graphic upgrade to dwarf fortress. However the game is not a completed product, missing many of the features that were promised by the devs, and full of bugs. The devs left the game in a beta state.That being said I did get some enjoyment out of the game. The base idea for the game is a good one, and what is there is fun to play. However it gets old quick. I come back to the game every now and then, play an hour or two, and get bored again. All in all it was fun while it lasted.

There isn't really much actual gameplay involved, that portion of the game is out of balance and broken.

												In the current state, I would not recommend this game to anybody.When I got the game in the end of December 2012, the devs were updating it relatively frequently. It wasn't like they were releasing weekly or monthly updates. The game worked well for what it was. Then the updates dropped off.I realize this was a greenlight game. I view that similar to a kickstarter game that fails to deliver what was promised. This stuff happens. I got the $4.99 i paid for out of it. I don't know how much it costed to buy it when it was originally greenlit, but it was fair for what I paid. I've bought worse games for more money.Instead, check out Gnomoria.			"

												The game has an interesting concept and was the first Greenlight title.  Take a typical RPG setting and control the town instead of the heroes.  Your job is to build up sufficient infrastructure to attract and keep heroes happy for...some reason.  Who knows.Most of the 36 hours I spent playing were staring at the game in frustration trying to get it to work.  It has some similarities to Dwarf Fortress but it felt like I didn't have as much control.As others have said, get Gnomoria instead.  Cannot recommend this game to anyone.However I must give Towns at least a 1/10.  Due to its incredibly broken and frustrating nature, I had to look up help on YouTube and that led me to discovering Sips for the first time.  So thank you Towns for helping me find one of my favorite YouTubers.			"

This game HAD massive potential but the developers flubbed it. Dont spend the kind of money they are asking for on this game. IF it was 5 dollars it'd be worth it, just to test out their idea. You'd need to accept the challenge that it'd be and work things out on your own for the most part but when you do, its fun.I lasted 13 hours before I got tired of it and the minor bugs i had run into at that point. All the same, I cant recommend it, especially at the ridiculous price they are asking. I got it for like 8 bucks near the beginning of development so saying 5 bucks is worth it still applies. "

												This game is essentially a retexutred, very watered down version of Dwarf Fortress. This costs money, DF doesnt, don't buy this and go play the actual game instead. I don't even know how many boring, labored hours you'd have to put into this game to get something even remotely resembling the screenshots.			"

												In the beginning the devs were really into developing and making this game, they promised these grand ideas, and even started to make some money from it, time went on, the game was released on steam on the back of the support they had, but they quickly realised that they were starting to make obscene amounts of money despite not providing any updates  because of the exposure steam got them... and are now pursuing their hobbies as working as cashiers at the local mall.The game is under developed, buggy, and abandoned.

												Use to be really good till they gave up on it, I'd say if you want this game take a look at Gnomoria. It's cheaper, the UI is easier to use, there's more too it and its still being worked on. You can even name your Gnomes the only downside is that it doesnt have the Hero's that towns does. But on the plus side your Gnomes can crush Goblins lungs with their bare hands.			"

												Died in infancy, a failed product of Early Access.  What killed it?  Literally Steam Early Access.  This game sold pretty solidly for a bit before that, but when it was dubbed as being ""garbage"" by a majority of steam, it seems the devs lost interst in further developing it, and moved on.Sad, but true.  Other games seem to be following in it's foot-steps however, though less in the ""Failed and Abandoned"" way.  Stonehearth looks promising, as does Timber and Stone.			"

												I originally bought this with the thought of ""Woah cool, a town simulator!"" in my mind.  After all, the screenshots showed some very epic looking towns, and the game wasn't in the Early Access category. (meaning it wasn't an alpha/beta, but rather a full release)Boy was I in for a surprise.. and not the good kind.I can sum up this game in one single word - Awful.  There was barely a tutorial involved, so I had no idea what I was doing.  I started up a game and within minutes my villagers with their fantastic AI decided to disregard all common sense and took it in turns to throw themselves at a monster, resulting in most of my population dying right away.  Those who survived died of starvation a few in-game days later because I had no idea how I was meant to feed them, despite throwing food down right infront of them.The game is filled with bugs, and there's been very little care and attention given to the game from the devs.  They've tried to pass off this game as being a full release, yet it's clearly still in alpha stage.  There's been many players complaining and demanding answers from the devs, but their cries seem to fall upon deaf ears.  Now that the devs have made a cool $2mil from this game, they couldn't care less, and it clearly shows.Don't buy this game, not even for a laugh/joke.  These developers don't deserve any of your money.			"

												This game is abandoned by the developers so no more updates to fix this buggy pile of ♥♥♥♥. I played this game before it came out on steam (so my hours played is wrong), i was in an area with no internet and had a new computer so i only had towns installed because it looked like a promising game; with awesome stuff to build, nice customization (many blocks and armours) and a cool endgame with adventurers helping your town, but after some hours of playing i'd rather just look at a plain wall for three days. The stuff you see in the screenshots are quite ""end game"", even the most simple structures, your ""townies"" will most often sleep eat and work outside because you won't be bothered building houses because the building system is VERRY frustrating because:1. Your townies do not indicate whether or not they can build something unlike Dwarf-Fortress and Gnomoria and your townies can't reach ♥♥♥♥.2. Most building-blocks require some weird-♥♥♥♥ items like slime ""stuff"" (can't remember name and this game is to horible to back and look) to make some stone bricks. Why? I don't know but it hampers creativity.3. You can't build floors unlike DF or Gnomoria so every story you add you need an extra layer just for floors (this may have canged, it was a long time since i played)There is a solution for the reatching problem and that is ""scafolding"" a block that can be stood upon, walked troug and climbed up. it's completley free so it feels like cheating using it. In other games that adds a scafolding sort of thing they usually cost resorces because scafolding tends to be realy good for moving around. The scafolding tool has been dubed a ""god tool"" by the comunity because it is realy OP. Other god tools are things like the ability to drop lava anywhere on the map.At least you can get a lot of hours out of this game, but i would definetly NOT recomend it. Go play Gnomoria (that is 2 euros cheaper), DF (that is free) or any other city builder but definatly DO NOT play Towns.			"

												I like many i'm sure, bought this game because Sips played it. I'm not blaming Sips for anything here, i got enough fun out of it for the price i paid but that does not excuse the devs abandoning the game. PLEASE DO NOT BUY THIS GAME. If it appears to be ""ok"" to put up a game on Early Access then abandon it because it's not selling as well as expected it will start happening a lot more. Lets tell them that this is NOT OK to do and WILL NOT be tolerated. Also, its really buggy and not at all worth 15 dollars or any of your time.			"

												As a patron of Minecraft, I very much enjoyed musing the idea of having multiple people placing the blocks, especially in the form of a functioning town rather than a purely aesthetic one. Towns has the potential to be that awesome crossover, but it is not. Although listed as a finished game it feels very much as an Alpha. The control over the ""Townies"" is extremely limtied, and each map begins the same way : a horrible struggle.The question is why is it a horrible struggle? Right off the bat there are a number of monsters covering the surface of the map, many are able to kill a townie 1 versus 1. The townies will engage anything they encoutner and unlike the ""Heroes"" do not ever disengage until one of them is dead. So very early on your main task is gathering resources but in very controlled ways to avoid your townies by chance encounter a monster.So you lost some townies, how does one get them back? Well you will need to have rooms built individually for each town plus any extras you want, they must be well furnished and food must flow in abundance, this together allows them to maintain their happiness which will entice others to join. Here is the kicker: work quickly saps happiness, so when you lose a townie or two the others must work twice as hard to provide happiness. I am sure you can see the paradox happenning.Ofcourse many other small time problems persist throughout the game which make building anything close to the promos provided to be a long, long way away. Sure this sounds like the right approach, you cannot build a city over night, but the truth is you will spend many weeks before seeing anything resembling a couple huts.In conclusion this game was greenlit with the hopes of it being grown, expanded and ultiamtely polished. Here is how it looks. Greenlit - September 11th, 2012Last Monthly Update - September 21th, 2013Date of Review - June 24th, 2014It has been nearly a year to the date of this review since anything signficant was changed and it will be a surprise to see another.

												Game was disappointing and unfinished when I bought it, but there was a promise of ""will be further updated later"". Apparently the developer has now abandoned the game, leaving it half finished. Complete rip-off; there is no way this should be on sale without an ""Early Access"" tag, and seeing as it will now likely never be finished it is difficult to see how even that would be fair advertising. Buggy, unbalanced, and with many obvious missing features; it compares badly with many games currently available in the same genre, many cheaper and some free.Current price is £9.99, which is insane- almost twice the current price of Gnomoria. Might be worth 10% of that as a brief diversion, but frankly anything more than ""free"" is probably a waste.			"

												By general standard this is not a ""complete game""Graphic of this game is....let's say retro.AI in this game is poor.Last update v14 was released in September, 2013. V13 was released in May, 2013. The changes that was implemeneted in these patches contains very few contents and minimun bug fixes. It seems like the developers just don't care or hoping that modders can fix everything for them.LIke every other games in the same genre that's on greenlight, AI in this game is poor.and there's a breakdown of their ""about the game"" info page on steam""The game brings a fresh new take on the city building/management genre by introducing many RPG features. ""Nope, there are many others just like it, the game is heavily inspired by many other game and it offers nothing ""fresh"" and ""new"".""n Towns you manage a settlement on top of an active dungeon. Instead of playing the hero who delves deep into the dungeon, how about playing the town that houses and caters to the hero's needs?""Heroes don't need jack. All it takes to attract heroes is to boost your population and have an area set up as ""tavern"". The ""tavern"" area doesn't have to be enclosed. Meaning that heores will be perfectly fine sleeping on the ground looking at stars just because you painted a 3x3 block purple and called it ""inn"".There is no intereaction between your townsfolk and heroes at all. They have very poor AI and die very easily if you are new to the game. Gearing up these heroes is not an easy process and sometimes random. You need to put the items on their path or ""hangout"" area and hope that they pick up the gear you want them to wear. ""Both the RPG and strategic aspects will be fleshed out over a series of sprawling dungeons.""The only RPG elements involved in the dungeons is ""there are mobs, they drop loot"". The only strategic aspect of the game is ""pray to the gods that when you dig down, you don't dig directly into a group of mobs because your townsfolk are dumb and they will not flee"" and ""dig open dungeon walls bit by bit and hope your townsfolk don't try to engage the mobs""There is minimun strategy and minimun RPG elements in this game. Townsfolk has a hunger bar, a sleep bar and a happiness bar and that's it. There is no ""leveling"" for your townsfolk and leveling for heores is meaningless.""Attract travelling heroes that will independently explore the dungeons below, fight off monsters, gain levels, special skills and collect the best loot they can find in order to clear the land of all evil!""Like stated above, there is no interactions between you and the heroes. About the loots, here's the funny part. Once you clear a dungeon, it's best not to collect loot from the dungeon because there's a billion of trash loot lying on the ground. Heroes will pick up gears when they feel like it. It's best to leave those in the dungeon.The best loot is often not dropped in the dungeon. Once you have a market set up, travelling merchants will come and they will randomly sell you the best gear in the game. So in order to get the best loot in game, you priorites a market over anything else. Regardless your progression in the game, you will be able to buy best gears purely based on luck.""Craft unique weapons, trade with exotic items, obtain randomized loot, set up devious death traps and build a settlement capable of holding back the forces that come up from the depths!""Mobs in the dungeon will come to your town only when a hero engages them with low health and decides to run away. Those mobs will not stop chasing the fleeing hero until one of them is dead. This normally leads to a few townies dying because of the poorly designed AI. There is nothing unique about the weapon and item designs. They are very generic items. I wouldn't describe loots to be ""randomized"". 90% of them are trash loots and 99% of them are just junk on the ground waiting to be sold when a merchant arrives (if that merchant has enough money and willing to buy these crap. normally they just don't want them at all).In summary, this game is not worth its asking price. Yes, it's about the price of a very fancy subway sandwitch in Canada but I assure you that you will get more satisfaction out of that sandwitch than this game. If you are desprately looking for a game like this, wait for it to go on sale and do not expect any updates because it's not very likely. There is a modding scene for this game. It's small and I suggest you to go to their forum and check out more information there. Simply google ""towns"" and you'll be able to access their website and forum. Thank you.			"

												if you sell a game, it's supposed to be playable and completed.If your game is not completed, you work to complete it.if you haven't completed your game and decided to quit before its completed, you should refund your customers.if you fail to do all above, and still have the face to talk about a sequel to a ripoff, you become the lowest form of life among the game community.Avoid this game, avoid feeding a ripoff.

												The game is broken.  Bottem line.Its hard to describe because the game WAS (the devs gave up once they got the $) getting patched so broken things were removed... and then new broken things were added in but here is a list of what I found the most broken.1. Building is not fun.  There is no easy copy and paste for buildings.  And if there is, then it is hidden under the games terrible interface.  It can take a lot of effort of placing certain building blocks in certain orders to build a house with the clunky building controls.  But then if you have to do it at least 20 more times if you want to get townies.  It can take a while.2.  The interface is horrible.  The labels are off.  It just felt clunky.  First you have to click one menu button, then you have to click a sub menu button and find what you want.  Then if its something like wheat and you want it to be bread you have to go into more menus and submenus to find what you want.  The bread making tools and blocks should all be on the same page not scattered around.3.  Your villagers are idiots.  They have no clue how to do anything without dieing.  Horrible monsters attacking?  Don't worry, your villagers will just stand there and die instead of running.  Sometimes they run indoors but most of the time go around doing what they normally do.  Their are even some maps with randomly wandering enemys, I dont have a problem with that but they do it so poorly in Towns.  In the snow maps one stray yeti can just wander on over and kill EVERYONE.  Also they will run though hell and back...to get stone.  I have seen them go on some brave runs just to get a basic resource.  You got to give them credit.  They will stop are nothing to drag that junk back to the stockpile... even if they all die in the process.4.  The monsters that attack your village come out of THIN AIR.  You would think they would come from any dungeon entrances you have but they seem to pop out of midair at times.  5.  Monsters are either really OP or really easy.  I watched a guard kill five slimes once.  Then I watched three guards with iron gear just get massacred by ONE wearpig. (Which is actually a common enemy.  Any normal pig could be a wearpig.)  6.  Hero's are broken.  I must have done EVERYTHING I could think of to attract a hero.  They never come.  They are broken.  That or the system is terrible.  Either way the game dosen't explain things and after browsering the web for a while I still can't get damn Heros.  Worst part is.  You need heros to clear dungeons, but you can never get them it seems.7  The way you make your townies happy is stupid.  They mainly get happy from eating.  Problem is, if you have food that fills them up a lot and dosen't make them eat as often.  YOU GET PUNISHED.  I actally tested this at one point by making bread fill 1500%.  Sure enouth happyness dropped to zero because they were not eating.   You can do a few other things like have badger fights (which seem broken) and put decorations but it seems food is what they want the most.  So remember, just spam cakes.  Anything that actually fills their stomachs is bad.  They don't want to be full.  THey want to be hungry.  Makes zero sense.    8.  Last thing I am going to mention is the dungeons...THEY ARE EVERYWHERE.  It seems I can't dig down at all without hititng a dungeon on most map.s  I just wan't some stone but the game shoves the dungeons everywhere.  They cover the whole map when they should be deep underground and have SMALL entrances.    Now things may have changed since I wrote this but this is what I encountered when I played the game.  And maybe some of the issues I mentioned have easy fixes but there is a problem...THE GAME SHOULD EXPLAIN IT THEN.  There is no tutorial.  Well there claims to be one but it just starts you off on fixed map without telling you much.  You have to find the message log and it tells you to do basic stuff.  Nice they have one at all but it never explains the fine details of the game.  Just the basic crude that I could probably figure out just by expermenting.			"
