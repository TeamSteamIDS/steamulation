												This game along with Dragon Raja were one of my first MMO's I ever played as a teenager. I had countless of hours, days, weeks, months and years of fun in this game and it made my youth that much more exciting (internet was new and talking to people across the world was new). I made friends through it and never had a dull moment. There were always new zones to farm, items to get and money to be made.Class system, music and general feel of this game still send chills of comfy nostalgia spikes down my spine. I can't vouch for this version, but back in the day this was the best MMO pre-WoW out there and for a good reason. I say download and play it, just for the music alone if grindy Korean style MMO's aren't your thing.However this server is not recommended if you speak English and live in Europe. If you're French or German you'll fit right in as those are the two more dominant languages on this server for Europeans. The server feels dead at times and after level 90 you will feel the grind. The Steam accounts get a free week of Premium meaning it won't feel too grindy but after a week you realize what a clever trap it is.Expect to only get bored unless nostalgia can keep you entertained for hundreds of hours of killing the same monsters over and over. Also the pay to win items will infuriate most and 3-1 (end game) classes are behind a pay wall might also turn away most people.I don't recommend this game for everyone but the few.EDIT: International Ragnarok Online Server (iRO)I'd like to add that after this review I started anew on iRO (international RO) which is the server you join through Steam if you live anywhere else but Europe and unlike the European server people actually speak English on iRO which makes it much more pleasant for people like me who use English mainly as a way to communicate online. iRO is vastly better than the one I based the review on and I managed to enjoy my time there more as there's more content and better quests to help you level. Also you don't need to whip out a wallet to get to third classes either and there is a daily quest grind called Gramps that makes leveling a bit easier.It is however also pay to win too and laggier for Europeans, but if you like RO I recommend that server over the European one even for Europeans. Simply google International Ragnarok Online and download the client that way instead of using Steam. I played a hefty amount of my time on that server and reached level 130 within a month on two characters, until finally quitting when content was unbearable to do -- this game is hard and will test your patience -- and the smallest mistake leads to death and losing hours of experience (death penalthy is lower on iRO though).Again if you like grindy old school 2.5D style Korean MMO's with heavy anime theme and a great soundtrack this game is just for you. Others I advice going back to World of Warcraft where the fun is more casual and easier to obtain.			"

												A recent nerf in EXP (-25%) for non-premium members has made this game Pay2Win. Well, atleast on the european server.Terrible shame, the game is great though... Better just join the iRO server instead of the european fRO. The amount of online players is like three times as much too.tl;dr: Don't play this gem, it's past its glory days SADLY. iRO > fRO (in many ways)			"

												This review concerns fRO/euRO server.My problem with this server does not lie with the Renewal system but with the management. As a long-time player of RO, a game I love, it is really painful to watch it slowly tortured to death and milked dry. The level of greed as it currently exists is incomprehensible. Under different circumstances it would be easier to understand, say, if they were on schedule with new content, for instance. (For those unaware, they are far more behind the official Korean or the international server than they would like to admit.) Well, there are no schedules because they don't want to be held accountable for not meeting deadlines. There is also no community management. The choice of action when things get messy (because of incompetence and/or outright lies to the playerbase) is hiding and waiting for people to calm down. The controversial topics get forever ignored and no official statements made. I frankly cannot think of any MMO team which handles its game this bad, nevermind one that can afford treating its customers like dirt long-term.Now this server also has lowest exp and drop rates for free players out of all the official servers out there in hopes to get more people to subscribe for Premium (more exp and higher droprates), although the excuse given is to ""combat botting"". I kid you not.The typical maintenance (every Thursday) consists of switching WoE (mass pvp, for those interested) maps, fixing bugs, adding more cash shop items and implementing events. The majority of these events focus on:- Buying Karats- Spending Karats- Using Bubble Gums (bought with Karats, or if you're rich enough, in-game)Moreover, participation often requires items that you can only get from cash shop or buying Premium for the event period. Rinse and repeat ad nauseam.Even the cash shop boxes that require real money to buy are bloated with worthless crap. Most notable of these is the (recent) shadow gear, which, despite being identical with iRO's requires excessive gambling. If you wish for a successfully refined set, expect to shell out about 900€,While you can play the game in multiple languages, including Italian, the linguistical capabilities of the management are limited. If a game supports Italian, one would think there better be someone to contact who doesn't use Google Translator to communicate. Even when it comes to English, you will see many grammatical and spelling errors even in re-used events and cash shop descriptions. The corrections are reliant on player willingness to point them out specifically, not proofreading or testing before implementation.tldr: If you have a significant amount of money to blow and give to people who will spit on you, be my guest and play it.

Product received for free
												The Steam version of the Game is tied to the new european Ragnaök online Server (former fRO) and is running a little over 500 Players at lowest, 1300 at highest times (WoE, new Patch).The War of Emperium (WoE) community in this server is strongly tied into the core of this server. The majority of recruitment chatrooms are looking for active WoE players. For those who don't know: WoE is basically a massive scale castle siege PvP event thats occuring on a scheduled base.Now here is the problem with that: Equipment. The monetization model of this particular RO server takes into account, that people don't need the Cash Shop items after hitting max lvl, since most Items in there are convenience Items like EXP-boosts, character-Slots and cosmetic Headgears. At some point in time, the Management decided to add new Headgears with unique visual appearance into the shop and added effects on those Equipment pieces that rival the power level of high level MVP Cards (Read: 1:10.000 dropchance items from bosses that only respawn every couple hours).These Headgear items can single handedly outrank EVERY SINGLE NON SHOP ITEM.Also there is the issue of EXP-multipliers. There are 2 levels of base EXP for players on this server:0.75 Base EXP multiplier / 0.75 Job EXP multiplier - Free 2 Play accountsPremium Accounts have 230% increased EXP across the board until their payment runs out.So playing with a friend that has a Premium account renders you unable to progress together quickly, since the maximum level that partymembers benefit from each other killing monsters is 15.All in all, the monetization model is awful, the playerbase is declining due to frustration and the only content you can play as a F2P player is solo, since older players probably invested money at some point, so they cant party with you after a couple minutes.Oh, and also: The main content of 3rd Classes is locked behind a paywall, Quests from the newly introduced Eden Group that should be repeatable (70+) are locked out of repeatable status and any recommendations in the forum grant you a link to premium status to alleviate the pressure of missing exp from quests.I really love Ragnarök as a game, but in this environment, I'd hate to play it			"

												Love it or hate it! Ragnarok is one of the very first MMOs ever created! More than 10 years later it's still as good as the 1st day I played this chunk! I highly recomend it! BUT!!! Like I said.... you're either going to love this game and get addicted or play it 10 minutes and drop it. With Ragnarok there's no mid term.			"

												Ragnarok Online is a classic mmo rpg, that is easy to get into and requires very little from your PC.This game has a lot less focus on questing or grinding lots of gear like in most mmo's.Instead of getting most stats from your gear you can apply stat points as you please when you lvl up.Everyone starts out as a novice class and can progress into better classes as your job lvl goes up.Even though it is not as complex as the bigger mmo titles this one will keep you entertained for a long time. Even when you quit, you can easily come back to it months later.Wether you play hardcore or just an hour or two per week, you can experience the full game.I can really recommend it!			"

												This game is really enjoyable, especially when you play with friends. I'd recommend playing with somebody who knows what to do, initially. For me the best thing about Ragnarok Online is advancing within your class, every 'job change' is really exciting.  This game is not for people who think a story is a must, because it barely has one. If you like to progress and become stronger by killing monsters all the time, this one is for you.			"

												Best MMORPG in 2017, and probably forever.This review is targeted to the European server.As it might seem that there are some connection issues, it is only because of the Aegis emulator.The game is working really good and I have 33 ms.If you look for a long time investment this is the game which will offer a lot of depth.The community inside are very nice and eager to help.It is by NO means P2W.Good job Gravity!

												It's a good game as long as you don't need support from the staff. There are probably no logfiles on the servers, since you need proof in form of screenshots or video for them to do anything.The translations are sometimes really dodgy, leading to me buying the wrong stuff off the cash shop. A Refund was not possible, since they in their own words ""generally won't do refunds"" and I didn't have a screenshot of said transaction.Thus I can't really recommand this game in 2016 anymore. It's just another game that used to be fun.			"

												I probably missed the time it was the best to start and play Ragnarok Online - there were almost no people around when I tried it for rather short time and I don't feel like going back. Still, graphics looks fantastic, music fits game perfectly and as Multi Massive Online RPG game it doesn't fail. It's free to play so you can at least try it.			"

												Well... Launcher opened up fine. Thats the one redeeming quality this game has.Past that the launcher is partially in French, and also has three main buttons... 'play','replay' and 'exit'. Replay didn't even make sense to me, but when I clicked it, it seemed to just reopen the launcher.Then an options button on the side that takes you to a Windows 95 style options menu. This menu can only change options outside the game and if it doesn't work right, tough. It looks like your spending time resetting the client to♥♥♥♥♥♥around with this menu.The options are bugged based on the fact it took me a good 5 attempts to get this to even display outside of a tiny box in my screen (even though options were set full screen it was displaying a tiny box that looked like a cutout section of the login screen). The login screen music is reminiscent of the old Final Fantasy days which made me feel nostalgic. Ok so finally I get to give this game a chance.Then I finally get to the login screen and enter my login name I chose, only to have a French popup box give me an error. I check my email and find out they changed my login name from what was accepted for no real reason.After clicking 'memo' which I assume is remember, I login and get greeted by a charecter creator, which has hair style and hair colour... nothing more aside from your starting stat points. I choose a name and a popup says 'taken' then boots me back to the start losing the customisation options anyway.I finally make a charecter. login and am greeted by black boxes in every block of ground for no reason. I go to the options menu and try to change something but the only option in game is resolution for the sprites and effects.... Clearly much effort shown in this game already.Then I speak to an NPC who asks me to select a language.'Great!' I think 'at least I will be able to get rid of the French and finally be able to understand the game now!' then I go to the next NPC who proceeds to ask me math questions in French and then asked me to click which number was displayed, again in French.....Another few minutes in almost every damn NPC is talking to me in French, which would be fine if I could speak the language but unfortunately aside from a few words I can't nor do I want to learn.I wanted to give this game a chance but if the developers cannot be bothered to translate the game, I aren't going to do it for them.Oh and to add insult to injury, these guys are also trying to stop people leaving reviews. You can play for hours but when you actually load the game up it dupes steam into thinking you aren't actually playing anything and Steam just says you are online not in a game. This is done because you can't leave a review till after 5 minutes of playtime.The only way to bypass this is to constantly load in and out of the game because thats the only time it flashes that your playing a game on Steam for about 5 seconds a time.I actually wasted time doing this just so I could leave my first ever review on Steam because this crap really made me mad, its one thing using an old popular game to get money but its another running it into the ground and then trying to stop people warning others about it.A video mini review/rant can be found here:

TL:DR French, not English. Developers stop you from leaving reviews by not actually placing you in a game on Steam despite playing for hours.			"

												This was supposed to be an official server for EU region, but it's years behind kRO for some reason and just because of that I don't think it deserves that title. The game itself is brilliant, but the server is just so so rubbish. Thats why I choose to NOT RECOMMEND it unless updated. I dont know if its GM's incompetence in not getting enough support from korea or just simple ingonrance. Maybe both. Pass.			"

												Probably one of the best MMORPG ever.The game is very interesting from a technical point of view and its graphics, although it is now old, manages to amaze me. Choice of classes varies a lot, even the choice of job is vast. For me it is promoted.But perhaps it is not a game for everyone.

												My favorite MMORPG. I loved it since my first log-in to game, when my cousin installed it on my PC. I've played it for few years (around 8? with some pauses of course), on many different servers (mainly polish mid-rates). Now I came here, to the server recommended by steam. I can feel here the classic rates of Renewal RO like these on iRO. Maybe over 50% things has changed if we compare Pre-Renewal and Post-Reneval RO, but it's somewhat easy to become accustomed with this. Even if the server is a little bit laggy, it's fun to play. But if you don't have good friends to play with, the game may become boring.There's no comparison between classic RO and RO2. Legend of the Second is totally different game for me and unlike first part of the game, didn't make me like it that much.Alchemist > Creator is my favorite class, but it's time to try Geneticist!

Well depends...First I have to say the last time I played RO was when the euRO servers got shut down, after that due to lack of further interest and a slow internet connection I never could pursue iRO.So for me, good old RO is going in and grind your♥♥♥♥♥off!It is not like that anymore:You get instantly level 12/10 through the trainingsground and you can make quests to level faster.It is still a lot of grinding but at least you have a purpose now and a reward for killing 100 fabres...Some other things:-ingame shop for cosmetic articles and boosts-a bit of lag on my end (it is iRO and I am in germany, but I don't know if it is just my connection or a general problem)-not that much players (around 8k I counted, but I don't know exactly)-still no real PvE content outside of slaying MvP'sWith newly set MMO standards I only recommend this game to fans of RO, new players may be bored after a time cause of the high level cap and the complete focus on PvP.

												When i changed to official server in WoW, i couldn't go back to privates, everything working perfectly and stuffI love RO, but this 'official european server' is so bad, lags like hell, bugs, party not working lately, not to mention pay to win aspects. It's better idea to find yourself a good private server.			"

												Of course I recommend it, I spent half my teenage life in this game :D (2004-2009) Aged graphics and UI, but great music and nostalgia factor! :3 They actually made the game a lot more player-friendly than how it was when I started playing 10 years ago. Now there's an actual quest window and tutorial lol.The server itself is not that excellent though. There are events and good mod presence, but it used to be a French-only server and it's really noticeable in the horribly translated and full-of-typos English NPC dialogues. It takes away from the immersion a lot.Also it would really help if the server had an auction house, the classical RO-style afk marketplace is really chaotic.			"

												Wow. It actually made it to Steam. Amazing. How many hours haven't I spent playing this? Thousands!It's an old game now, with plenty of poor additions and changes up over the years. It's a sad thing, because it is, or at least was, the best MMORPG ever in my opinion. They made a sequel, but it's no where near this old classic. Give it a try, but don't expect too much out of the official servers. Private servers usually have better performance, less clutter and often without the worst additions.			"

												Well this game is a grind game at its roots. While it is fun to play for free it is also very hard to level at end levels. I'm a non-trans class (trans is reseting after lvl 99 to obtain stat boosts), level 96 and I get 0.1% from good exp monsters. I can't imagine my self killing 1000 of the same monsters just to gain 1 level and it won't change if I get higher level and kill higher monsters (only 0.2%). It's fun lvling early but not after 95. Although I spended 15 euro's for karats I can't see myself playing this  game anymore. Too grindy and not supportive at higher levels. I mean common, atleast give higher monster more exp!Conclusion: Don't waste your time on this outdated, grind fest.Play time: 60+ hours			"

												I've always heard a big fuss about Ragnarok around the Internet since the time I actually began using it for gaming (more than 10 years ago)... But when I started this game I realized (without ever seeing any of its graphics) that it's a game of the past. The 2D feels so retro to me, compared to the quality of games right now... It just isn't my scene anymore.My guess is that people who were very young when they played this will certainly like to do it again for the sake of nostalgic feelings.Otherwise, I don't recommend it. Not because I didn't understand the point in it, but because I feel people have to move on, and new generations of games and engines are constantly rising, so my opinion is that gamers should ""go with the flow"" of that evolution. It's good to remember your childhood, but don't get stuck to it, you'll tire very quickly. At least I do.Oh, and a little bug: if you play the game, the time won't count on Steam, only if you are in the ""Ragnarok Setup"". Fix that Steam.			"

												The quintessential MMO experience. I've played many others (Lineage 2, Guild Wars, Guild Wars 2, TERA, WoW, Aion and a few others) and the only other game that's even come close to capturing me as much has been Phantasy Star Online.I still own my original, physical retail release from back in the day when Ragnarok Europe launched as fRO (Ragnarok France). I've played this game for so long over the years, it's not even funny. Sometimes I don't even realize that this game has been a near-constant in my life ever since my very early teens!Every bit as much of a classic as your favorite Nintendo or SEGA games, except it's still going on and it's still just as good. Like the anime art style and deep lore? Give it a spin! You might just find a new (old) game to add to your all time favorites.			"

												Wow,i can say without a shred of doubt this is the WORST game i have ever played. Why? Bear with me for a while and i will tell you in great detail. Well, first things first: i have played it for about two weeks and came pretty far for this short amount of time given. What kept me playing is the only good thing about it: the community. From what i have experienced one of the friendliest online communities, i have met only nice people who treat you kindly and even answer a lot of questions you might have. Comparing the people from RO to, let´s say, the people from League of Legends is like comparing Gandhi to Ed Gein.Anyways i started playing this abomination when i saw it was f2p on steam and the oldschool look suckered me in, rekindling old memories of the 16-bit era i grew up in. After launching it you will be guided through a short tutorial teaching you the basics of movement/attacking etc. just to be thrown to some town without any clue what to do next. Don´t expect any storyline to follow or anything to remotely give you a sense of purpose. Without anything better to do i started grinding monsters. But unfortunately that is all you do in this game: farm monsters and level up. After reaching level 99 you will be given the option to do a rebirth in order to become a more powerful character. But what follows is a reset to level 1.WHAT? I couldn´t believe my eyes. Seriously? My reward for mindnumbingly boring grinding is... more grinding?? I mean sure i accept grinding and leveling as part of pretty much any given mmorpg or rpg and althought it just gives you a false sense of accomplishment for doing mundane things atleast you get a stronger character and maybe have fun while working for that goal. Usually a nice scenery/stroyline or interaction with NPC´s and other players helps forgetting the boring task at hand and most games succeed in making the trip to max level an interesting story. I have played WoW and GW2 and both kept me atleast motivated enough to keep on playing. But with this game it´s different: the maps are plain and only vary in color schemes and very little landscape while the monsters you have to kill are interchangeable sprites behaving almost completly identical. You basicly go to a map - grind for a while - go to a map - grind for a while - rinse and repeat. For hours, days, weeks. How the hell is this game so popular and how are it´s players so persistent? With perseverance like this they could have cured all know deseases if they hadn´t wasted it on this dull game. What makes this even more frustrating is the absence of efficent healing items, you will not notice that right from the start but later on when the monsters pack a punch. The most common healing item sold by vendors is the white potion which recovers 325 hp. You might say: ""Hey that sounds ok,right?"" or ""Well how much Hit Points do you have?"" If you asked the second question i praise you for your quick wit, because that is the point. Soon you will find yourself with a couple of thousand HP making the potions pretty useless and you will have to spam them in order to stay alive. Of course that only goes for newcomers to this game who will start playing solo. In order to keep your sanity you will either need a vast collection of music/audio books or a friend/slave to play alongside you and heal you. Seasoned RO players might argue: ""But there are better healing items in the game even some which restore half of your health or all of it!"" Yeah there are, starting at prices of 250.000 zeny (the ingame currency), what a steal! Oh and while we are at it: because this game is pretty old and most experienced players have more cash on their hands then braincells left alive, everything you can buy from other players will be too expensive to afford.But maybe the gameplay is awesome? No, it´s not. The server, probably a relict located somewhere in a shed in Papua New Guinea always surprises you with lags and breakdowns contributing to the atrocious controls. Controls that make you feel like orders given to your character are treated like friendly suggestions that he/she may or may not follow, will inevitably lead to a couple of deaths. While dieing in a game isn´t all that unusual here you recieve a penalty in form of experience points deduction which on higher levels will equal to an hour of grinding lost for a mistake you didn´t make.To sum up my experience with this game i would love to post a picture of my broken keyboard, but instead i will warn you.Don´t play this game, just don´t. It is boring, repetetive and if you love mindnumbing chores then go rake up some leaves, that way atleast your fiance will be happy. If you, like me, want to dwell in a little bit of nostalgia then just pop in one of your old SNES games, trust me they will be more fun than this load of f*** will ever be.			"
