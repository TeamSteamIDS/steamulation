												Before the release of final fantasy titles on steam, there was Penny Arcade's On the Rain-Slick Precipice of Darkness 3. Bearing in mind that this game doesn't relate much to the previous two titles (as they were 3D games and developed by different team), you can easily go head first into this game without playing the others which is nice. The music is alright at setting the mood of the game. The dialogue and story is funny at times and quite unique. The gameplay is like final fantasy 3 and 4. You start a few roles (i.e classes) for each character, but you unlock and can switch between more roles later in the game as your character levels up. The combat is similar to the 'Active Time Battle' system in final fantasy IV. Each character (including enemies) will have to wait until their portrait on the top screen passes a line before they are able to make a move. This may be seen as a good thing as you have some time to plan out moves for your characters, however the combat may seem slow to some (especially those who haven't played previous 2D final fantasy titles). There are a limited of monsters in each area and they don't respawn after you defeat them, but you can see them so you won't be walking into a trap. There is also a colliseum where you can easily grind to level up quicker if you wish. There are also some stores laying around which some decent items and equipment at decent to rediculously expensive prices.Besides the normal campaign, there is also a prequel campaign that doesn't really offer much to the story, but contains  more challenging monsters.If you are looking for a cheap final fantasy-like game or never played any of them before you should try this game out. However, if you don't like turn base combat (like previous final fantasy games) you should stay away. "

												Penny Arcade's On the Rain-Slick Precipice of Darkness 3 is a comedic RPG with some parody elements and convenient features. I can't tell you too much about the story, as I don't want to spoil the game. Also, I can't fill you in on the backstory because... I haven't played the first two games. The reason I started on this game, and the fourth, is because they were in a pack and I had played the previous two games the new developers had done before getting asked to do these, which were Breath of Death VII and Cthulhu Saves the World. That's where my perspective is coming from, so keep it in mind. Basically, you're a company that investigates supernatural happenings, and supernatural things happen. So... you investigate them. That's really all I can tell you without getting into potential spoiler territory.You can explore specific locations on a world map with well defined places to go. Inside these places, you can search for treasure, battles, and main plot points for going there. While there is some interesting story and dialogue, the battles are the meat and potatoes of the game. The battles are nice because they are not random. Instead, they are represented by monsters clearly visible on the map. You battle in a turn based fashion, however there's a meter on the top of the screen. This determines the order the combatants will attack. It will be initially set by speed stats and certain passives, but it can also be changed by using slows, stuns, and interruptions. A combatant can also move up their position on the command line by defending, although this will not allow them to attack on that turn. So why bother? Well, to reduce major damage from a major attack, or possibly to help utilize another interesting mechanic. In this game, you don't have a pool of MP to work with. Instead, you start battles with zero MP and gain 1 MP per turn. So if you want to build it up, you can use items, use certain abilities to boost it, or simply do something that does not require MP. This forces you to manage your health and position on the timeline much more carefully, rather than having magic users spam abilities right from the get go. So what gives you your abilities? Well, each character starts with their own class. The classes dictate what abilities, passive or active, these characters have. This will affect how you use them. Beyond this, as the game goes on you will receive badges, each with their own additional classes. You get to add one, and eventually two, to each party memeber. This gives them a total of three classes, and many possibilities on how you can build them. However, badges can only be on one person at a time, so you can't use the same class on every character at once. All of the badges and characters level up as you win battles, although the ones you actively use will level up faster. Also, you can further customize your characters with equipment as well.This game is full of conveniences, such as the aforementioned blanket leveling and visible battles. Whenever you finish a battle, all characters are revived and restored. If you lose a battle, you get to try it again. You can save or change badges at any point. Convenient traveling through an easy world map, with shops in fixed positions and a training area to grind if needed. The game does a lot to try and ease the burdens of RPGs while still being an RPG. However, I found a few things a bit disappointing. One is that there are too many classes leveling up constantly. It seems that after every battle, at least one if not multiple classes gain levels and often new abilities, which is a lot to look at and manage. You'll be constantly checking your new abilities to see what they do and who they will be good for, depending on how you're trying to build characters. Plus, the fighting system is somewhat complex for newcomers, which detracts from the game's convenience factor a bit. Also, while the game tries to teach you one thing at a time to gradually get you familiar with the gameplay (which I like), it feels like once you finally understand how to fight and manage your badges and equipment and strategize, the game is basically done. It also ends on a cliffhanger story-wise. So, this whole game essentially feels like it is a buildup for the sequel, both in story and basic gameplay ideas. Although the sequel (which I will review once I finish) is rather different in some aspects. I guess I just felt like the game was getting me ready for the real adventure to start, and then it abruptly ended. Overall, it's still a good game. Fun for people new to RPGs and looking for good value games. The characters and story have enough charm to carry some of the weight. Plus all the conveniences, well paced learning curve, and constant upgrades to manage, make for an entertaining experience throughout. I guess it's good that the game left me wanting more rather than being sick of it, and the extra mode recommended after you finish the main game gives it some more for you to play and satisfy your cravings. However, I'd say that if you're looking at this game, which is only 5 dollars alone, you might as well just pay the 8 bucks and get the two pack because you'll be well prepared to take on the fourth game after this. I got them both on sale for a dollar which was well worth the price. Judging this game on its own, I'd give Penny Arcade's On the Rain-Slick Precipice of Darkness 3 a solid 6 out of 10 for being an engaging RPG experience without the common headaches that befall so many other RPGs.

												Whether you're acquainting yourself with eldritch horrors that seep through the frayed weave of reality or just punching a bunch of filthy hobos in their filth-filled mouth-parts, On the Rain-Slick Precipice of Darkness 3 is a delight. Combining the creative power of Penny Arcade with Zeboyd's love for old-school role-playing games creates a package of hilarious weirdness and nostalgic vibrations (with a couple hints of modernity) that feels neither derivative nor stale. The turn-based combat has a perfectly applied dose of additional strategy, which can bring even a high-leveled party of characters to their doom if their actions are dictated without thought. To compliment this, the story, dialogue, items, and enemies all carry the ridiculous, eloquent, occasionally poetic writing of Jerry ""Tycho"" Holkins as well as art inspired by Mike ""Gabe"" Krahulik. All of these elements together make On the Rain-Slick Precipice of Darkness 3 a funny, bizarre quest that any fan of early RPGs is sure to enjoy.			"

												This is part 3 of the episodal penny arcade series of 4. NOTE: THIS IS NOT FOR KIDS. I PERSONALLY RATE THIS GAME AS ""A"" FOR ADULTS.This game is quite different than the previous games in the series. First off, it is now more traditionally a rpg in this game..the comic book style in previous games are gone and have been replaced by rpg goodness. This may turn off people that played the 2 previous games, but i think it is much better this way. Also, if you wonder what happened to your character from the previous 2 games, there is short little side game that answers that question in the game. Note that you must be used to this game to try the extra mission.I actually like the changes they did for this game. Anyways, i recommend playing the first 2 games because the storyline is required for this series. Recommended game for new rpg aspects in it and fun dialogue and humour.			"

												The long-delayed sequel.  Gone is the ability to make your own character; you'll be playing the PA guys the whole game.  Also gone are the 3D polygon graphics and animation, replaced with SNES-esque sprites and tiles.  This would be a big step back in some ways, but fortunately, the combat makes up for that.   It's got some ideas borrowed from other games (like Grandia and FFT A2), and some new ones.  The classes are also pretty interesting, and offer some good combinations.  Fights are less plentiful than some games, but still relatively common, and the enemies are tough, so they can take a while.I was annoyed by the fact that, if you stick with the same classes the whole game, you won't wind up with all of them capped out.  To explain further, you start out with no class equipped and quickly gain your first set, then later get another set and the ability to equip a second.  There will still  be leftovers, however, and unequipped ones earn less exp than selected ones.  Add in 2 more factors: the number of fights (and thus exp) in the game is limited (monsters don't respawn), and there's a bonus  dungeon that can only be unlocked by maxing out all the classes.  You can see how this would be frustrating, to finish the game and be stuck with no way to get into the bonus area.  Now, there is an arena where you can fight stuff, but I'm not sure if they give much exp.  Might try this later on.			"

												This game was an enjoyable throwback to 16bit turn based RPGs, but with a twist. They improved the combat system by adding some complexity without making it overly complicated. Since the core of all these turned based RPGs is mostly how well and fulfilling the combat is, the majority of this review will go over that section in detail to give you a greater understanding of how the game plays. I broke down the review in bold sections so you can read what is most important or what is most interesting to you in order of importance. At the end of this page there will be a Pro's Con's and overview which would be the closest thing I have to a ""TLDR""THE GUI (Graphic User Interface)When you get into a battle in this game, you will see a very familar layout, the graphic user interface or (GUI) will probably remind you of a plethora of similar older turn based titles like the final fantasy series, chrono trigger, or the breathe  of fire series. You'll see fight or attack, item and Defend. However this is where the similarities end and some of the polishing of these older combat system begins. The menus themselves are fairly easy to navigate and use, nothing new to see here but nothing bad either.The GUI also has one new feature which is really nice, which is a bar on the top of the screen with the portraits of each of your characters and the enemies on a visible time line which shows you who or what enemy is likely to be next in turn. I say likely because in this game there is a ""speed"" stat and interrupt mechanic attribute which can be manipulated to increase or decrease the likelihood of who's next to perform an action. Speed is exactly as it sounds, a flat given rate at how quickly your next turn comes. Once their portrait goes from the right side of the screen to the end of the bar on the left they start somewhere back on the right, distance moved on the bar per action or round spent is based on your speed stat.Hovwering over an enemy unit will tell you the current hp of the unit, and how many elemental weaknesses it has, but not which ones. Its your job to explore and find them your self! It will also usually include some kind of humorous description of the unit, generally relevant or commenting on its aesthetics. Other cool features are the skin changes, at any time outside of battle you may change your skin from ""furry"" ""gender swapped"" ""undead"" or ""normal"". I remember one battle actually had a condition of increasing the power of all female characters during it, but it wasn't an issue and this feature really is just there for your visual enjoyment. One more thing of important note: This game has a range of 4 preset difficulties which can be changed at any time (outside of combat/dialogue), should the game not be challenging you enough or too much. It defaults on normal.THE INTERRUPT FEATUREYou can slow targets, stop them, or increase your own speed, but the best feature is the interrupt feature. The interrupt feature allows you  to push back the time it takes of a current foes next turn. When you use an ability that has this feature you will see their portrait be pushed back. This effect generally is on a diminishing return so you can't ""lock down"" an opponent from ever being able to preform an action, but you certainly can hinder it, and many interrupt abilities later still deal damage, or have other bonuses like not costing MP! Usually every 2nd interrupt wont hit as hard as the previous. So interrupt 1 will give you a good knock back, 2 maybe not so much, but 3 will be powerful again and the pattern continues.CUSTOMIZING YOUR CHARACTERSThis game has the traditional armor, weapon and accessorie slot, but the real customization begins with class pins. Each character has its own unique abilities, and later on you get up to 14 (1 from an optional boss) ""pins"" which provide new abilities, passive abilities, and bonus to certain stats and pretty much work much like Espers or Materia for you final fantasy fans. There are no restrictions on what character can wear what pin, so you can have quite a few different combinations. The equipped pins gain experience along with the character's core abilities as well, and unlike other older games the unequipped pins will still gain experience but not as quickly as the ones being used. However, each character will inevitably be able to wear 2 pins, so that only leaves 5 pins not at use at any given point in time.  So this lets you balance and combined 3 classes abilities on one character, his own, and the two pins you equip on to them. So any character can fit the role you decide to give to it.OTHER IMPORTANT COMBAT MECHANICSThe most important feature in the combat here is that, you  can drag out a boss or any battle until you win but.... it gets much harder.. Ever so often the power of the NPCS get stronger, the longer the battle goes the more damage the abilties and attacks of the NPC's do. So only using one character to deal damage, while healing all the incoming damage is rarely an effective strategy. When you hover an enemy unit you'll see something like XXX% power, every interval they gain 10% more power. The longer you go... well... they start to hit harder and hurt more...Certain battles even have conditions where certain types of damage or stats are increased (which affects everyone in most cases, you and your enemy). Most of the time these bonuses can be used in your advantage. Other times they add in a new element to the fight to over come and conquer. MAGIC POINTS AND NON EQUIPMENT ITEMS REVISITED AND REDONEEssentially every turn you get 1 MP or Magic point and you get a variety of abilities to use, but like any ability it has a cost, some are free, some have greater effect on the first turn, others cost more, and/or have other conditions or bonus effects. However there are items and abilites later in the game that allow you to gain MP faster, such as stealing it from your other allies, or energite, an item that can only be used so many times per battle thatr grants X MP.Now to items, Items in this game are consumables that you can upgrade and have a limited number of charges per battle. Every battle they reset to full.There are 6 different items to use in the game and they can be upgraded in two different ways, their effect (how powerful) and charges (how many uses).OVERIEW: 8/10PROS AND CONSThe tone of this review may sound to some overtly positive but this game isn't without its flaws so we will start with Con's first. There aren't too many though I am happy to say.CONS: Certain abilities or ability combos can become overwhelmingly powerful which cause you to stop using previous abilities or fall into routines.The game is rather linear, and besides 2 optional bosses, and the Arena, there is little room to ""Grind"" or gain additional experience or $$$ to farm items, upgrades, and accessories.The plot line of the game is a bit hazy if you haven't played the two previous installments. Some of the events and dialogue can leave you feeling questioning your self, If I were to have played the two previous games would I have a much greater understanding of what the hell these people are talking about and who they are?PROS:Innovative combat system that holds true to turn based combat while adding in new features to keep it as fresh as possibleLots of character customization and combinations in terms of classes.Despite the potential plot confusion the game's dialogue has made me chuckle, laugh or bust a gut on many occassions and was still enjoyable regardless of any confusion.

												Wow, what has happened to you Rainslick? You were interesting once. With your funny and well drawn cutscenes, unique gameplay that was different and more casual for those not interested in Final Fantasy-esque turn based combat. You were fun, funny, charming. Well obviously that's not what this is.I don't know what happened, but long story short, Penny Arcade didn't want to go Rainslick anymore for some odd reason, so the guys that made Cthulhu Saves the World, were called upon to make the 3rd and 4th games of this series.There is nothing good about this game to me. First off, Pixel graphics. While it CAN work depending on the game and how it's used (See Papers Please), here it's just used as always used, for a Final Fantasy knockoff. The combat is not exciting, nothing moves except for characters and enemies to get into place.BUT the worst sin this game made, was one that made me give up on everything about the rest of this series.Ok, so you're in a bank looking for a portrait, when you're exploring vaults and you think you're gonna find jokes. One of the ""jokes"" is so horrible that it forces you to play it until completion.A FULL ON FINAL FANTASY 1 PARODY!!!And then into Star Trek. And the game forces you to stop and play all of this for no reason, when I could have gone into the right vault and left. It's only there for grinding that's pointless.Go play Rainslick episode one and two, and try not to cry at the end of two, because then you'll think about how it got botched and replaced with this garbage.

												I'm a little disappointed in this game. I truly am. The previous Penny Arcade games, in their 3D environment, semi-free-roaming capabilties, witty dialogue, character customization, and comic book-styled cutscenes were excellent, but this one...I just can't bring myself to keep playing. It's become a 2D RPG-stylized game, and though it started out pretty alright, the required battling, which for the most part, is every enemy you see on screen, really started to bore the living fecal matter out of me. It was just too much. Between every fight, you regain all your stats fully, so there's really no urgency of healing, which could be taken as a blessing, but...I don't know...I felt less imersed in this game, less dedicated to the characters and outcome. Sure, the dialogue is witty, for the most part, but given the lackluster gameplay and visuals...it just wasn't fun. I would've rather just read a comic book with the same style and written dialogue without the non-stop RPG fights chewing up my time and killing me with boredom. I'm genuinely sorry for not enjoying it more. I look forward to the next installment of Penny Arcade and hope for the best.			"

												2 gods down, 2 remaining. And here we are again, on the rain-slick precipice of darkness!Part 1+2 (which you should totaly check out - they're fun) used a mouse-based rhythm-clicking battle system, where well-timed buttonpresses powered up your attacks or activated special moves.Part 3 ditches this whole mechanic - including the graphics style.What you get is a homage to the classic 16bit-rpgs like the older final fantasy games.With full controller support, playing this thing is a blast. I never really got used to the keyboard+mouse-clicky-thingy in parts 1+2. Now you get a very traditional battle system, as well. ATB-style, party of 4, skills, spells, items.Once again, enemies are weird or downright ridiculous (which is good), Job classis for your party are hilarious (which is very good) and the dialogue is over-the-top nonsensical (which depends upon personal preference - I found it well-written and immensely entertaining).Should you play it?If you like the old 16bit-games and dig this kind of humor, then yes. Yes, you should. Hell yes. Did I say yes? Seriously, though. Play it.			"

												Zeboyd Games (of Cthulhu Saves the World and Breath of Death VII and Molly the Were-Zompire fame) have done it again.Penny Arcade is a web-comic that follows Tycho and Gabe through various scenarios. And they've been put into a game where Tycho is trying to end the universe before anyone else gets the opportunity.Now, I haven't played the first two games but I don't feel that missing out on them is too big a worry for these, they're still highly enjoyable. It's an RPG, turn based combat. There's a load of classes atop the main class for each character. Tycho's a scholar, Moira's a Gumshoe, Jim is a Necromaster and Gabe is... well, Gabe (I forgot what his class is).The story is humorous, the same humor that you get from Cthulhu Saves the World only not as meta (until the fourth one but that's another game review).If you've played any old school RPG like Final Fantasy before it went 3D, or anything along similar lines, I recommend this to you.

A basic, SNES style RPG that gets by on comedy and nostalgia.Here is a game that largely matches expectations without exceeding them. If you're looking for solid, retro-RPG combat and witty writing then you'll find it here at a very reasonable price. However, the story behind all the sarcasm and jokes, while entertaining enough, lacks tension and impact. It sets up the following game for a more interesting setting and conclusion, but that's not enough to elevate this game's narrative above ""mostly forgettable"".Precipice of Darkness 3 does a great job of bringing complexity and flexibility into its turn based combat. Each party member has one permanent base class that matches their personality. In time you'll unlock two additional class slots for each character that can be swapped at will between battles. You choose from a pool of bizarre classes that allow you to easily experiment until you find a winning combination. I really like that unused classes still gain experience and level up, just at a slightly slower pace than the in use classes. This negates the chance of any class becoming under leveled to the point of discouraging you from trying it.In battle the game uses a combat bar to queue actions that is much like the old Grandia series and, more recently, Child of Light. It is one of my favorite turn based systems that allows for characters and attacks of varying speeds as well as strategic interrupts of enemy actions. To be victorious I needed to make proper use of buffs, interrupts and adjust my strategy to account for enemy weaknesses and resistances. I played on the Veteran difficulty and found it to be on point except for in one area called The Bank of Money that had a frustrating and unusual spike in difficulty. The city map that you use to navigate from area to area is very plain with linear paths that don't allow for any deviation or hidden surprises. The exploration areas are genre standard mazes of corridors, barriers and rooms. Their layout is pleasing, including treasure chests, non-random enemy encounters and silly descriptions when you examine some objects. Visuals are definitely not this game's strong suit. They get the job done without being outright ugly, but the best compliment I can give them is that there are some creatively comedic enemy designs.Having not played the previous two games nor read much of the Penny Arcade comics I'm coming at this game without a preexisting attachment to the characters. While I did enjoy their distinct and quirky personalities, they only grew on me a little over time. There are some decent attempts at character development, however the priority is clearly on humor over substance. As for the comedy, for me it was consistently amusing without ever being a truly laugh-out-loud level of funny. It's worth noting that I did not feel like I was missing anything from not having played parts 1 and 2. My total playtime clocked in at 15 hours for all the content this game has to offer. It is a modestly successful entry in the relatively sparse field of games that place a heavy emphasis on comedy. I am comfortable recommending this game to any old school RPG fans out there or Penny Arcade aficionados.Click here to check out my review of Penny Arcade's On the Rain-Slick Precipice of Darkness 4.

												Penny Arcade Adventures: On the Rain-Slick Precipice of Darkness has a title that is immediately indicative of the brand of humour you'll find throughout. The writing in these games, courtesy of Penny Arcade writer Jerry Holkins, is everything you'd expect, but unfortunately you'll have to put up with a turn-based JRPG of sorts to see much of it. In Ep 3, the developer, Hothead, has been dropped in favour of Zeboyd, and the accompanying total overhaul of the gameplay provides a much needed change of pace.			"

												Loosely known as the third episode of the Precipice of Darkness series, episode three offers an entirely new narrative, art style and gameplay experience. The game itself serves as a parody to the classic ""SNES era"" where 16-bit graphics ruled the gaming industry. Penny Arcade does, however, continue their trademark tongue-in-cheek narrative that joyfully pokes fun at the classic role-playing game experiences. In all, episode three is fantastic fun and proudly pays homage to gaming classics.			"

												Clever retro-RPG, where every fight plays out like a puzzle rather than a grind due to instant HP restoration between battles, no random encounters, and a fun three-classes-per-character system which lets you design your character using classes as tactical ""building blocks"" (for example, the Gentleman class is a mixture of physical attacks and healing magic, but do you give it to your brutish tank character to maximize the skill attacks, your ""all-rounder"" or rogue so they'll be able to cast frequent heals, or your mage so he can benefit from the ""non-special attacks are based on Magic instead of Strength"" passive?).  The writing is also obviously amusing.			"

												A very different style from the first two episodes... a fact which disappointed me at first but I quickly got over it. The new devs for this series, Zeboyd, did a great job with this. The non-sensical comedy is still there but this game featured a more interesting plot. It actually had me genuinely surprised at some points which I did not expect from this series. I'm not typically a huge fan of the turn based JRPG-like combat but I really enjoyed this one. Not sure what it did differently to make me like it more than in other games but it's sparked a wider interest in this genre for me so thanks Zeboyd.A fun little addition was that you could gender swap the characters or turn them into furry or undead versions. As a woman who just enjoys playing female characters (just cause I relate to females more naturally), I really liked the gender swap option. I actually switched back to the traditional models for the last half of the game because by that point I just kinda wanted to experience Gabe and Tycho as they were meant to be... but I really appreciated the option being there.

												This game was a whole bundle of enjoyment, playability and laughs for me. Essestially it is an rpg with 16-bit graphics. You can play it straight (well as much as this crazy game allows), or embody the madness. It pokes fun at the genre and at itself. Really it's what you might expect from Penny Arcade. If you don't know what PA is, i recommend you check it out, and get this game too, it's worth it.Btw if you're interested in a more detailed review, i recommend you check out the one written by MinervaMedica, which is a true belter of a review, congrats Minerva.

												Moving to 2D was obviously a budget-enforced choice, but this game was still a fun diversion for a few hours. Having the navigation on rails didn't bother me, and other than that it's largely the same kind of RPG as the first two.Really I just wish that the story were stronger. It was fine for the first two games, but not much has changed or evolved and it's starting to feel stale. The characters haven't grown much - if at all - and the plot is just moving forward one foot at a time on its predetermined path.So if you liked the first two games it's probably worth it to continue, but play them first.

												I've played 1st and 2nd Precipice of Darkness a long time ago. Never managed to finish the game whatsoever. You don't have to play them to know the general story of the game. Just open the wikipedia page and read the summary.A bit of warning though if you are playing this game after playing the 1st two games you might be dissapointed.This third game is fundamentally different than the the first 2 mainly because of the devs are different now done by Zeboyd.As for me i like Zeboyd's version better, because i play this game after playing Breath of Death VII and Cthulhu Saves the World. So i know what kind of ""style"" i was getting into.Pros:-Enemies are on fixed locations. So you don't have to worry about tedious random encounters ala classic rpgs.-Characters fully healed and items regenerate after battles. Making the game much more simpler.-MPs are not carried over to the next battles. Every characters start with fixed MP. So you don't have to worry about MP management anymore.-Hilarious jokes. A bit different (classy) than Zeboyd's style because it's written by Penny Arcade's creator.-Unique job system. Dinomancer anyone?-Cool snes graphics. Reminds me a lot of Final Fantasy 6.Cons:-Very short. About 8 hours or so.-Too simple and too easy. You only need to find classes that works for you and stick with them to the end. Rendering the customizations offered in the game mute. You should play the game on Insane difficulty.-Music are forgettable and pretty dull.-Too linear. There is no exploration like in other Zeboyd games.-Jokes takes a bit to getting used to. Most of the time it's a hit or miss for me.			"

												On the Rain-Slick Precipice of Darkness 3... what a title. In fact, the writing in this game was probably my favorite part. Constantly making clever jokes, the dialouge never got old. As a turn based fighting game, I enjoyed the skill variety and the mixture of class options. I hadn't expected any kind of depth from a title like this but they surprised me.The item system was lacking in my opinion since the best gear was handed to you as a part of the story anyways. My only other complaint would be that the story line was a bit hard to follow. Now, perhaps that's my fault since I didn't want to invest a whole lot of plot-thought but I am also concerned that the original two titles would have been a prerequisite.While I can reccommend this game, I do so with some reservations. I don't feel particularly excited about playing the next game in the series and that seems like a bad sign. However, on a rainy day if you like a little dry humor this is a great way to burn time and snag a few chuckles.			"

												What is there to say about this game? For starters, I haven't played the first two titles of the series. Because of that I wonder if I missed something important... I mean, some references were thrown during the playthrough and I really couldn't get a grasp on anything, but of course, I'm pretty sure that some of them (or mostly) could simply be meta. Back to the game, I think that I could define it as an unusual RPG title. I mean, there's no such thing as those awful random encounters, in other words, you always know when you're going to have a battle ahead. After every battle your characters will regain health, which makes everything much easier. Each character has special skills, some are good with melee attacks, other with spells, ranged and so on. There's not much to say about the graphics or the soundtrack, they're ok I guess (I think it's needless to say that the story is extremely wacky). Actually, for some reason the game concept made me think of one of those Adult Swim series... Well, if you enjoy RPGs and nonsense, give this one a try.			"

												Very neat RPG, has interesting class based combat and cheesy humor. Combat can get a bit repetitive at times, but if that becomes the case just set the difficulty to easy. Has about 7-12 hours of content. Doesn't require as much grinding as ZeboydGames' other games (BOD VII, CSTW). All in all, it's good old schoolish RPG. If you're a bit nostalgic or just like the art style then go for it. Also, the music is pretty great.			"

												I came into this series as a fan of Zeboyd games and with little knowledge of Penny Arcade. Zeboyd continues to demonstrate their love for old-school RPGs and their deep understanding of what makes for a good battle system. This game quietly has one of the very best battle systems of any JRPG style game. I cannot overstate how satisfying the battles are in this game and the difficulty setting allow you to adjust it to your liking. The story isn't super memorable overall, but the writing is funny and well done and moves the story along nicely.			"

												PA3 takes a different approach than the first two games, but it still manages to keep the humor that drew me in to the series. Overall the game is pretty linear, but for a game that takes about 8 hours to clear I wouldn't expect a ton of exploration.I rally like the battle system used. It is a nice twist on the standard turn-based system and the extra power of interrupts when in the ""sweet spot"" add a nice layer of complexity to something that could easily become boring.			"

												Well-made oldschool style RPG.  Does away with some of the genre's frustrations - random battles, has ""running"", and multiple difficulties; the hardest of which is borderline unfair (rng based) in some encounters.The story and dialogue are pretty ridiculous.  Each area brings new enemy types and no two encounters have the same configuration.  There are many jobs to mix and match on your characters, but there are a few obviously strong and a few very weak.Should be over 20 hours on insane, much shorter if you play on a lower difficulty and don't have to retry battles.

												This game is a classic Japanese-style turn-based RPG featuring writing from the creators of Penny Arcade. You control 20's-style detective versions of Tycho and Gabe as they solve the latest paranormal mystery.Entries 1 and 2 in this series were made by a different developer, and from what I've played of Episode 1, I think that this episode is a much better starting place... it's a lot more fun. Zeboyd Games specializes in making classic RPG combat fun again, and this game features another amazing battle system. It's a classic formula that's not only nostalgic to those who have played early Final Fantasy games, but the strategy is a lot deeper. The battles get very repetitive once you've figured out your strategy, though.The graphics are really well-done, though the sprites are borrowed heavily from FF6. The music is pretty nice, though I would've like a longer battle theme. Though the humor is very strong in this game, the story's a little weak. There's not much actual plot... it's just very drawn out.If you like classic RPGs, get this game, along with every other Zeboyd Games title. This game's humor is also a great reason to pick this up. If you never cared much for turn-based RPGs in general, then this one probably won't convince you. If this is your type of game, the price is definitely right... there's a lot of content here for $5.			"

												You like a nice, freaky, eldritch fantasy story?You like witty dialogue and references?You like good old (J)RPGs?You like the humour of Penny Arcade?If you could answer any of these questions with 'yes', then you should really consider getting 'On the Rain-Slick Precipice of Darkness' despite its weird, lengthy title.The story includes the end of the world, wicked dimensions, ghosts, demons, hobos, mimes and all the other darkest parts of all possible realities, spiced with a lot of sarcasm, silliness and fun.The mechanics are mostly solid classical RPG stuff, with some diversity on class systems and battle mechanics, which can be nice, but can also sometimes feel a bit rocky and may miss some simple options to make the experience smoother. But that barely matters, as the battles are more like little breadcrumbs, or candy on the path through the story and very forgiving, even if you lose one, you immediately pick up again from before the encounter - may vary on other difficulties, haven't tried.It's not necessary to have played the earlier episodes, it's not required for the story and the style in graphic and mechanics is very different from the previous episodes anyways, but if you'd like to get the whole story from the start, you should start at part 1.And if you've already played the earlier episodes and even bothered to visit or even search for the rest, why are you still reading reviews and not just started playing already?

												Set in an interesting universe, with a set of characters that, most of the time, amused me, you can't go wrong with buying this if you like the combat system type (check it in videos if you are unsure). A warning though, it might get a bit repetitive, but the contrast between cenarios is satisfying and you will certainly get a kick out of the different creatures you'll encounter and out of the comical side of the game. Provides about 9-12 hours of gameplay. If you happen to catch this game on sale, don't hesitate, get the bundle with the finale.

												PA's OtRSPoD 3 continues the story of the previous games, with three main differences: first, the look of the game has completely changed to that of a 16-bit style RPG; second, the combat (while grounded in the 16-bit RPG style) is based on an all new system involving ""pins"", which are basically different classes with specific abilities that can be applied to characters; and finally, there is no longer an option to create your own character to join Gabe and Tycho's party (also note: nothing from the prior games is imported at all). The writing is the same as it was (perhaps even better), but if you're not a fan of Jerry Holkins' style, this game probably won't change that. As a fan of these types of RPGs in my youth, this game brought a lot of nostalgia to the table, and I enjoyed it for that alone. It's not perfect, but Zeboyd Games and Penny Arcade have put together a nice little retro package at a fair price. If you're a fan of retro RPGs and/or Penny Arcade, give it a look.			"

												Penny Arcade's On the Rain-Slick Precipice of Darkness or short... uhm... PAOTRSPOD? damn... even that sounds ♥♥♥♥ XD well, anyways, it is... meh? it's not really good, it's not really bad, but well... I can say it works... SOMTIMES! I had the big problem that I installed it, started it, and it worked, then I opened it the next day to play again and... well... I couldn't! there was an error. so I thought: ""aww, fine! I'll play something better then!"" and well... I tried it a few more times.... it didn't work... after about a month without touching it, it... it... WORKED! once... then I had the same problem again! so yeah, great game besides that :D			"

												Made by Zeboyd instead of Hothead, this is just a much more fun game than its predecessors.  You swap the 3D for 2D sprite graphics which may upset some people who don't care for the aesthetic, but it was not a bother for me.  Music is more catchy.  You lose the descriptors on every minor object in the world, but those held no meaningful value so not really a loss.  Environments are just placeholders for progression... but that was still true in the previous game too.  At least there's no backtracking.  Game takes a more serious tone here so if the comedy that overlaid everything in the first two games was a detriment to you like it was to me, then you will appreciate this change.Game mechanics become more traditional of RPGs, so no un-fun QTEs every fight this time around.  There's a meaningful amount of customization and planning, compared to the first game where every upgrade was limited and linear.  Its just more fun all around.Its just more fun.  Definitely enjoyed myself this time around. "

												Zeboyd Games does it again, with a hilarious RPG that brings nostalgia and great new mechanics together again. The class pin system especially shines here, letting you build very interesting and unorthodox multi-class characters that are capable of some really interesting things. The writing is hilarious, the story is interesting, the art is great, and it's so full of charm and fun that I couldn't put it down. It's also got some great little hidden gems in it, especially if you're a fan of Zeboyd Games in general. It's a well-crafted experience put together with a lot of care. This is, all in all a fantastic game. It should appeal to anyone who loves the old SNES-era JRPGs.			"

												I played Precipice of Darkness 1 and hated it, the shallow real-time combat system with mini-games that had you clicking like crazy on imprecise targets ruined it for me. I skipped 2, not wanting more of the same.This is very different and a great improvement. First, it captures much better the spirit of the JRPGs of old it's emulating. The combat system isn't incredibly complex but has some depth to it, and with each character eventually combining two classes of your choice with his basic one, experimenting is fun.Now like previous Zeboyd Games titles, this game is kind of lacking in terms of interface. There's no way to examine your character stats during battle, to see how much some effect buffed or debuffed you. You can't examine a class without equipping it, either, which makes for tedious shuffling when you're trying to determine which class combo is the best. And for some reason you can see the stats your character would have when buying weapons, but the same isn't true for equipment.All in all this game feels stuck in an alternate timeline where the last console that came out was the SNES. Sure, it improved on classic JRPGs, but modern turn-based JRPGs like Shin Megami Tensei have refined the formula a lot and feel much slicker to play, as well as faster even on higher difficulties. In POD 3, raising the difficulty to Veteran mostly made the enemies feel like bullet sponges, with fights dragging on quite a bit - this automatically gives the advantage to the enemy since they grow in power every turn, a system I'm not too fond of.The story is sometimes funny but not gripping, I was a bit bored in some dungeons since I wasn't looking forward to the next narrative bit. But overall there were some good moments and the combat mechanics kept me interested just enough to keep going.Verdict: Worth playing, and it's won't eat a ridiculous amount of your time.			"

												Not a fan of this one,combat worse than the 1st two in the sense its old school as this looks.Comedy is as subpar as usual. Game is a huge grind,nothing but monsters to fight on the maps. The only thing you find on maps other than mobs are chests which have various things. Item system is as basic as they come.You get potions that heal,up magic strength,remove illness,etc. Basic styled , not interesting like in the 1st two games. In Short if you MUST complete the whole series then get it I guess. If you want a game that was fun like the 1st two to you skip it. Not sure how episode 4 is I do not own it yet.If/when I do I will write up some stuff.			"

												The best game I have ever played in twenty years of computer gaming, bar none (and I have played a LOT of games). Eight years on I can still recall how profoundly that game gripped me, and I am not an overly emotional person. You will care about the characters, you will be moved, you will make choices that tell you more about yourself. It sounds trite, I know, but it really is that good. If only someone would make more of these...insightful, intelligent, devastatingly creative. Fallout is the only RPG to come close. A word of warning: You MUST read all the text, explore all the dialogue options, if you are to gain the most from the game. A decent intelligence and wisdom score is recommended.....although so is a decent score in everything else....the game does the best job of making usually superflous statistics genuinely useful that I have ever seen. Still very much worth playing.			"

It takes too long to do anything, and the majority of the game is spent pandering to the creators of Penny Arcade.If you are just a fan of Penny Arcade, don't get this. You will not enjoy it.If you know everything about the lore used in their D&D campaigns (meaning you played D&D with them), you might understand a bit of this.Simply put, unless you are the creators of Penny Arcade, the majority of what goes on in this game will be over your head, and you spend most of your time playing a mediocre RPG.If you want something that's fun, go play Cthulhu Saves the World.Verdict: PASS			"

												While I'm sure this game is full of classic Tycho and Gabe Penny Arcade humor, the gameplay is almost meaningless. Monster fights are in specific locations that you need to go through but once you beat a monster at a location that's it. There are no random encounters and the only benefit to fighting is to gain strength for the next fight and because you have to fight. There are maybe 6-8 fights you can avoid only because the path branches and you only have to fight on path A or path B. On easy you almost don't need to try, but if you want to punish yourself then go ahead and crank up the difficulty level. This thing is the baby of an RPG and a visual novel and in my opinion that's not a good thing.			"

With the exact same, if not even better quality of humor found in the Hothead games, awesome battle mechanics, a quirky cast of characters and monsters, and a well written storyline, this game, like Cthulhu before it, puts Zeboyd on the top of the 16 bit realm.

												Episode 3 - Revenge of the Sith!Wait no...that's not right......(may contain spoiler)Episode 3 - Two Gods Down. Apparently 2 still exist. This is a great edition to this series. Though a bit different in terms of style. It is a very straight forward turn base game. The premise fo a 16-bit game compared to the original was a bit confusing, but in the end the new format and style was very enjoyable and easy to get through. As you battle mimes, crabpeople, paintings, ghosts, and a whole bunch of weird (medieval times and star trek esque). You make your way through the world with the thought of stopping Dr. Blood. The story gets more in depth and leaves you with an ending craving you to want to find out what happens next (well I guess a good thing I own Ep IV then). Instead of simply leveling up your stats this game kind of has a human type trainer-esque to it. You level up abilities. Range from magic to necromancer to even turning into a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ Tyranosaurus Rex. It's a very interesting twist that can lead you to creating a large number of different character set ups. Throughout this game, one question stayed on my mind. what happened to my character. Where is he, why am I know longer in the party as we quest to stop the evil that first was seen on Desperation St. The short story between Ep 2 and Ep 3. Shows it all, and leaves you with a wtf moment at the end. I played through it as me (well me in a big bag) fighting my way under the sewers and periphery under my once beautiful home. The once quest to find a home I guess sovled at the end though sad as it may be.I highly recommend this game (most people have it thanks to Penny Arcades free Ep 3 giveaway). I also do highly recommend the series in general. Though you dont really need to play Ep 1 and 2 to get the plot in this one. It's nice to know my reference to the ""You"" Character Though disappointing it is ""You"" don't return for the main story of episode 3.Here's my go through of the story in between ep 2 and 3 if interested - http://www.twitch.tv/punasaurusrex/c/2736518 "

												The Third Episode of ""On The Rain Slick"" Episode continues as brilliant as the other episodes ended. This time in a new look. The third episode is made with the RPG Maker, but the guy who made it, is a god with this program. The charakters didn`t loose any charm compared to the old episodes. The battles got a bit more tactic now and are definetly harder. The playtime is around 10 hours, depends on your playstyle and how much you explore/grind. This game comes with 2 free DLCs, one with a extra story line and one adds a super hard dungeon to the main game. As in my previous review I can only repeat that I had some problems with the dialogues. My english is okay and I casually dont have any problems to follow a english written dialogue. But the english used in this game is tough. I can recommend this game for every oldschool RPG lover. And for 5 bucks its a steal.			"

												It has some quirky writing which some people might appreciate and the games combat is very reminiscent of Final Fantasy 5 and 6. However the games uniqueness and quirkyness quickly gets tiresome; after reading way too much text that ultimatley says nothing and fighting way too many unnecessary battles that are way too easy the game is boring.The pacing is also very bad with the game giving you too many jobs at once with some being very overpowered and others being totally useless. Nice graphics and unnecessary words doesn't make for a good game.It's not a bad game by any means but if it's not up your alley then you will quickly get bored of the overuse of superfulous words and overly intelligent themes. I don't think the series spans four games because the games are good but instead they did it so they can try and sell it as good.			"

												While definitely still an extremely robust turn based RPG, I feel that the direction Penny Arcade has taken with the game doesn't live up to OTRSPOD 1 & 2. Going from a unique art style and combat system back to the dated ""JRPG"" system we all know (And in some cases love) just feels like cheapening the game. I wouldn't reccomend, and definitely wouldn't reccomend if you were a fan of the first two games and decided to pick up the third. Judging by the newest release they've decided to stick with this art/play style, at least for the time being.			"

												A complete and utter disappointment. First, graphics are your run-of-the-mill, RPGMaker junk, losing the style and feel from the first two (Hothead-designed) games. Second, the music doesn't play for me -- and based on comments around the internet, I'm not the only one. I followed a few different steps and nothing helped. Oh, well, since a visit to Youtube showed it was chiptunes so I'm good.Look, I love old games. I have hundreds of them, I own a damned arcade machine... but give it a rest, developers. It only stands out when you're unique, not one of thousands.If this game didn't have the Penny Arcade writing and humour, it'd be hot garbage through and through. edit: The DLC has a solid story, but unfortunately the same derivative JRPG gameplay. It's worth playing, though. OtRPoD 3 is darker than the first two games, and at first I wasn't sold, but I think it's good, especially when taken with the DLC.			"

												I love Penny Arcade and immensly enjoyed the earlier iterations of PA: OtRSPoD, but this one fell short. I like Zeboyd's idea of adding new features to the retro RPG model to make it interesting, but no ammount of innovation can possibly remove the mind-numbing tedium of those old games, and no ammount of nostalgia can make them fun. The game took me about ten hours, and that is more than double the ammount of time I'm willing to spend on such a repetitive combat system. Further, while the earlier games were funny throughout, and had amusing plot points revealed about the world of new Arcadia, this one  was only good for the occasional chuckle, and none of the plot was more interesting than stringing your characters along a series of drawn-out dungeons. Seriously, what has happened to Penny Arcade?			"

												Summary: The game is an obvious throwback to the RPGs of the 16-bit era, with elements that are uniquely set to the ""Penny Arcade"" universe. The nostalgic appeal loses its' charm very quickly, with an intentionally incoherent storyline and script [which may appeal to fans of the series], extremely repetitive and subpar combat system, and limited exploration. However, similar to how I feel about Farcry 3: Blood Dragon, the game is very short and the main story plus bonus prelude can be completed in 6 hours without much effort. There is some replayability with the different classes available, but I personally cannot see myself replaying the main storyline since it offers little reward or enough of a altered playthrough. The game has some merit and can be a great casual play over the course of a weekend, but I would not recommend it and give it a 2/5.Although this is the third installment in the Penny Arcade's On the Rain-Slick Precipice of Darkness, the approach is completely different in comparison to the previous games. Changing from a 3-D to sprite-based 2-D world is the most  apparent change, but there are a couple additional elements to the game. Timing attacks, button combinations, and overkills have changed in favor of classes, interrupts, and magic. Classes in the game allow for different strategies in combating the enemy and will offer the greatest amount of customization. They range from the Scholar, which utilizes various magic spells, to the Brute which favors more physical-based attacks. By the game's end you will have the ability to equip 3 classes at the same time and can various class mixtures that favor a specific play-style.  Want to build the ultimate melee hero? You can try to mash the Brute, Hobo, and Masochist classes to maximize your strength and plus up on physical attacks. Now, due to the way that MP is accrued in the game, this has some serious limitations. MP is earned throughout a battle, for each turn a character will gain one point of MP. This means that more or less 90% of your battles will follow the same pattern and will make the game extremely repetitive. For me, I had Gabe go into an attack stance, Tycho cast an Apocalypt, Jim cast a Skeleton, and Moira interrupt a monster. Could I have changed it up? Sure! But why would I purposefully choose an option that would have been less effective in those 90% of the battles I fought? I strongly believe that if the game had more of a traditional battle system, similar to the SNES Final Fantasies then it would have made the fighting system more enjoyable.One element of the game that I thought was a positive was the use of interrupts in the game. In a sense the game is turn-based, but as you can probably see on screenshots, there is a WAIT-COMMAND-ACT phase. Once a character reaches the COMMAND point, you decide on your action and wait until the character reaches ACT for it to execute. Now some of the classes have certain abilities that will give you the ability to interrupt the enemy. For this to be effective, you have to time your character's interrupt to occur when the enemy is between the COMMAND and ACT points. If successful you can drive back the enemy's bar all the way back to the WAIT phase. This will become critical mid and late game because the more you can interrupt and slow down the enemy, the weaker the enemy will be in the long run. As the battle progresses, each turn of the enemy will yield typically a 10% increase to its' attack. This can be interpretted in two ways: either end the battle fast or prevent the enemy from acting. Certain characters, like Moira, can be class mixed to maximize her ability to interrupt the enemy and give time to the rest of the party to get a few additional actions at the beginning of the battle.As with the previous installments, the world is rather small and the vast amount of exploration you will do in the game is limited to a a dozen dungeons. Battles are not randomnized but the types of enemy you fight will be varied and figuring out what their strengths and weaknesses can add some strategy. So the game has a set amount of battles, with pre-set monsters in each battle, and you will fight each battle at full strength [the party regenerates both items and HP after each battle]. If it isn't apparent yet, the game is linear, and each playthrough will be roughly the same as your previous playthroughs. There are only 5 playable characters in the game, of which only 4 will be useable mid to late game. As odd as it sounds, even though there are four characters, there is an extremely limited amount of character development in the game. I know of the loose associations for these characters, but there's nothing beyond that, nothing that really makes me change my opinion or gain an interest in any of the characters. Jim is a floating skull in a jar, he doesn't talk...we learn nothing new about him. Moira  was Tycho's ex-wife, we know something happened between them, but nothing is really pounded out, no flashbacks or intimate moments discussed. There may be some external source material available, but it is still the game's responsibility to draw the gamer into the world and develop a connection with the characters.Hitting on the storyline and script, I know that there are fans out there that just love the humor and nonsensical conversations in the game, but as I played on it felt like it detracted from the game. The awkward, completely random, and  unnecessarily ornate dialogue just gave me even less to care about, the storyline is so muddled and incoherent that I found myself more confused and uncaring about the trials and tribulations of the party. I'm not asking for a 16-bit Game of Thrones, but what I would like is a storyline that makes sense...that has a purpose, an objective that is easily understood and draws me closer to the characters and plot rather than detract from it. So in conclusion the game is mediocre at best. It has its' moments, both good and sometimes really bad, but the game has some serious flaws that limits your enjoyment. Buy it if it's very cheap, buy if you were a fan of the earlier games, but do not buy it if you're expecting to relive the glory days of the 16-bit era. The nostalgia runs out so fast, even with the Dragon Quest world and the Super Mario World-esque overworld, and when it runs out you'll realize that the game doesn't have any legitimate merits to stand on. 2/5			"

												I bought this game for about a dollar on sale. Well, I got what I paid for.The menu starts off by blatantly telling you ""screw you here's some restricting options that ONLY apply after you restart the game"". After restarting the game several times to finally figure out what I want, I begin to play.You are immediately thrown into injoke after injoke that only fans would maybe laugh at. The jokes that weren't injokes were extremely dry. There is no witty dialogue or interesting story. It's just thrown at you, or rather spit up into your lap.Gameplay is braindead and plays itself, even on harder difficulties. There is no exploration or random battles. You take a few steps, fight an enemy, get a chest that ether upgrades one of your items or just lets you upgrade your ""infinite use"" item machine that refills after every battle. Enemies are not threatening in the slightest.Boring game, bad gameplay, save your dollar for a crappy emote or something. There is nothing going for this game.Also there's a furry skin that turns Gabe into a pony.			"

												Have you played the first two Penny Arcade adventures? If so, play this. The change of format from episodes 1 and 2 is a little jarring, but the humour is completely intact and very amusing. If you haven't played the first two but you like Penny Arcade's style of comedy, play the series in order. As a standalone game, though, Precipice of Darkness 3 is a little weak due to the odd blend of simplicity and complexity, as well as dragging on a bit at times. But it's cheap, so it's got that going for it.Full review here: http://postlaunch.blogspot.ca/2014/05/penny-arcades-on-rain-slick-precipice.html "

												♥♥♥♥♥in' throwback to 16 bit goodness. Combat system's fairly straightforward, but innovative enough to make you think. Story's rather convoluted, but so are all the other Rainslick games, it's practically half the point.Duration's about 10 hours to playthrough, a perfect length if you're working and don't want a massive time sink game or if you've got all day to play through a game. Either or, it's quite enjoyable and the price is more than reasonable.			"

												Penny Arcade 3 takes us back to the 16-bit era of classic roleplaying games! It's in your face, quirky humor is what you would expect from the minds at PA, and the game itself is built on a unique class system and a really solid battle system! (Think Final Fantasy V & VI) Even though the installment is number 3 in the series, you don't have to have played the first two to dive in and get going. With promised future support (free, might I add), and hours of addicting gameplay, On the Rain-Slick Precipice of Darkness 3 is a no brainer. Especially at $5!Do yourself a favor and grab this one.

												Yes, I recommend this game. However, I should probably point something out before you buy it:Yes, it is funny. It's really funny. This game will launch your sides into orbit.Yes, it is a GOOD RPG. A damn good one, at that.But there's not a whole lot of content. It's kind of crazy that I only have 25 hours on this game after playing it so much, having to retry certain bosses over and over again. And even when I had done all of the story related content and beaten the DLC areas, it didn't take me very long to 100% my save. TL;DR: This game's really good but it doesn't last long			"

												All the humor from the Penny arcade team stuck into a wonderful throwback to the heyday of 16bit rpgs. This is as good if not better than any jrpg from the SNES days.

												While I enjoyed Penny Arcade Episode I and II, III is by far the best. Zeboyd Games does it again! Each game of theirs has been better than the last and PA3 doesn't disappoint. The battle system is a familiar, albeit, unique system. The class system is close to what Final Fantasy has done before; each class learns different attacks, but you can assign 3 classes to a character (something Final Fantasy has never done). If you enjoyed Zeboyd's previous games: Breath of Death VII and Cthulu Saves The World, then you will most certainly enjoy PA3. Even if you aren't familiar with Penny Arcade or the previous games, you should still give it a try. I'm very excited to play PA4, and this Spring can't come soon enough! Always trust Zeboyd games if you love classic style RPGs, they'll never let you down.			"

												A retro-styled RPG hearkening back to the likes of Dragon Warrior VII and Final Fantasy VI. It's not long nor grindy, and intentional measures have been taken to alleviate the frustrations of older RPGs: for instance, you don't have limited items, you have limited uses of each item per battle. They restock out of combat automatically. Thus, the retro-styled RPG. The real fun comes from the Class system: each character has a core class (Gabe is always a Brute, Tycho is always a Scholar, et cetera), but each character can have up to two swappable classes assigned to them as well, a la Final Fantasy Tactics. Find a combination that you like, steel your heart, and prepare to battle with evil gods from beyond mortal comprehension on the rain-slick precipice of darkness.			"

												I like Zeboyd's style and design choices with their RPGs, and this is my favorite one. The difficulty is pretty well-tuned to be fun the whole way through. There are no random battles, and no battle is repeated twice; every battle at least has a different configuration of enemies. Items, HP and MP are all used on a battle-by-battle basis, so you don't have to worry about stocking up before you go into a dungeon or not fighting to your last breath because of the battles to come. You just give your all and fight to the death in every battle; dead characters still gain experience, so there's no need to give up or delay ending the battle if some of your characters have fallen. The way they handle MP is pretty fun; you start the battle with 0 and gain 1 every turn, so you have to save up for more powerful attacks. In addition, enemies become more powerful with every turn, so the longer you drag the battle out, the more advantage the enemy has. There's a class system that lets you acquire different useful abilities, and you can choose which ones you want to build with which characters. I'm also a fan of the way there's a space of battle time between giving commands and actually executing those commands, and if you hit an enemy in that space, you interrupt them and slow them down. Certain abilities were better at interrupting but poor at damage, which made for interesting choices. The Penny Arcade script is pretty hilarious, too.			"

												This game reminds me of DeathSpank, but in a more retro style. There are some flaws: The menu is blocky and hard to use (I'm surprised I didn't accidentally delete a previous save and it took me a while to find some info I was looking for), the text is amazing but not presented well (voice acting would've been nice, as would music changes and animations for what was happening instead of raw text, and I forgot what we were even doing by the end of it), and the combat just drags on to the point where an area that'd take me two minutes to explore on foot now took an hour due to combat (I had never really played an old-school RPG before, and the combat was like getting punched in the face, literally, it gave me a headache). However, as the game goes on, battles become engrossing, especially with the dozen-odd classes you can mix and match (Hobo anyone?); the chiptune music is surprisingly catchy; and the highly-sarcasic comments and randomness will keep you wanting more. Great game for $5.			"

												So here's the deal: If you want a short, mindless game full of wit, charm, and a story, then this game is amazing.  However, the gameplay itself gets tedious rather quickly.  Battles become severely repetitive, your signature combos being replayed again and again regardless of the actual conditions of the battle.  It can be underwhelming, and at a few points a chore to finish.What the game does amazingly though, is combine story and humor in ways often not expected.  The ending, OH MY GOSH.  I would highly recommend playing the Hot Head Studios prequels, as they do share some insight as to the story, but the game itself CAN stand on its own.7/10			"

												Honestly, Penny Arcade's On the Rain-Slick Precipice of Darkness 3 is of the better JRPGs I've played gameplay-wise. While the writing, aesthetics, linearity, and Penny Arcade might turn some people off, the Grandia-esque battle system is well-crafted, the character classes are uniquely designed and encourage synergy, and the vast majority of battles are challenging on the hardest difficulty setting, requiring both proper configuration of party members beforehand and careful consideration of formation and agility within them. The way most of the genre's trappings like encounters, experience gains, items, and resource-management are streamlined keeps the game's pace going quite smoothly as well. 15 hours well-spent, especially at such a low price.

												Are you somewhat fond of crappy JRPGs from the eighties?  Random encounters, level grinding, changing equipment every new town, and other sins of a bygone era?  Than you'll likely get a kick out of this game.  Based loosely off the script Jerry Holkins posted a few years back, this game adds a pixelated flair while fusing together several ideas to keep the gameplay fresh.  Combat is based on rotation, the faster your character, the more often his or her turn.  MP is reset to zero and replenishes at a rate of one per round.  Health regenerates every battle, meaning that more emphasis is put on figuring out how to survive each encounter over throwing you a bunch of generic, easily dispatched enemies to deplete your resources.  Also, the fourth wall explodes violantly in a ray of scorching light every fifteen to twenty minutes, so, you may want to watch out for that.			"

												It's obvious that a lot of the cinematic feel was sacrificed in the process of going from 3D to 2D for the third episode of Penny Arcade's, but the essence of the earlier games, mainly their sharp writing and sense of humor, is preserved extremely well. Main systems are borrowed from Grandia and FF5, but they're also expanded upon compared to previous two games and now you actually have a choice with on you want to build your characters with ever-so-witty classes and varied gear. Only real negatives I have would be at times unnecessary combat padding and a REALLY abrupt cliffhanger ending setting up for a sequel.			"

												Superb in all categories. Really fun combat system, although there are way more abilities than you could ever use... usually you stick to just a handful, and ignore the rest. During the first half of the game you don't really find very many items to equip. Later on in the game you end up with so much money that you can easily buy the best items in the store, which kind of makes you over-powered... because of this the item system feels somewhat useless (and many of the items in the game are.) I enjoyed Cthulhu Saves the World (made by the same people) much more due to the dialogue and characters, but this game was easier to play, and the level design was less infuriating. Overall, an excellent game, minus the cliff-hanger ending, which felt abrupt and unsatisfying. Took me ~8 hours to beat. Looking forward to Episode 4.			"

												Zeboyd Games is pretty much my hero when it comes to the RPG genre as of late and I hope that if they can find the resources, they can move forward to create even better looking games. Do you honestly enjoy random encounters? Level grinding for hours? Having to save your best items for fights that may not happen? Zeboyd has you covered. Every battle in R-S 3 starts you out with full health and every item you have bought/collected at your disposal. At the end of the battle you get all of that back. You also get 1MP per turn (magic costing up to 9MP) which you can use freely without fear of having to save it for another battle. This creates actually enjoyable gameplay where every battle is a different experience (enemies are already put in groups at pre-set points in every map) that requires tactical planning prior and mid battle.I loved the last two R-S games for being like the Mother/Earthbound games as delightully quirky and fun urban RPGs. R-S 3 manages to continue this trend while being double the length of the last two games (for the better!) and will ALWAYS surprise you. On top of that, you don't actually need to have any knowledge of the former games. Because of that, I actually recommend this game more than the games before it.If you love RPGs you owe it to yourself to play this game. It's cheap, it's fun, and if you ♥♥♥♥♥ about it being too easy, play it on Insane and eat your level grinding heart out (level grinding is optional on easier difficulties!).			"

This game is solid and has some great ideas.   Battle Time is used but you have to think ahead as you decide the move a few 'seconds' in advance, meaning an enemy can attack in between deciding and acting which puts a spin on the BT system and makes it a challenge, you can't tank it either as the enemy slowly gains power.This is a good game but it comes with a warning... the difference between Penny Arcade 2 and 3 is chalk and cheese; I feel that it has lost its charm by becoming a pixelated TBS with active time.  Its continuing the story but it isn't a Penny Arcade game.  If you loved the comic book charm of the first 2 games, then I'm sorry but you will be disappointed. "

												Even if you don't like penny arcade this is a good game. It's been a long time since I've played any RPGS and after playing this I only want more. The writing in the game is wondefully stupid yet enjoyable and at the same time witty and sarcastic. Game play is fun simply due to the twisted take on RPGs. All in all it's a great game and I highly recommend picking it up as well the first two episodes.			"

												Penny Arcade's On the Rain-Slick Precipice of Darkness 3 is a fantastic RPG and I highly recommend it to any and all RPG fans. It is well made and fixes many problems that I feel other rpgs do. Personally, it is one of the few rpgs that I love solely based on the battles and mechanics alone. It has 3 components that makes this game truly fantastic.The battles are all constructed so that it is never too hard or too easy. There are no random encounters in this game so you can never be too underpowered to fight an enemy or too overpowered to just easily bypass an enemy. Because of this, every battle forces you to carefully choose your attacks. It's never advisable to just spam the attack button unless you want to die. Also, the lack of random encounters also makes choosing your difficulty actually effect your game. The battle themselves have a sort of timer that determines when a character attacks. the slower the enemy, the longer it takes them to attack. This makes it clear when an enemy is about to attack and when you need to anticipate it.The game also has a certain mana system that makes fighting enemies a little more strategic. You can choose to spend points to do a special move or do a normal attack to gain more points to do a stronger attack, but that could leave yourself vulnerable.The class system in the game is well made. Any character can be any class simply by giving them an item. You're never forced to use the same 4 classes every game. The classes them themselves aren't just the generic classes you typically see (like warrior, mage and healer). Each class is very different and creative. Not only that but every class is a viable option. Any combination of classes will be able to beat the game. Just choose what you like best. And because you can easily switch any characters class, you can easily find a class you like.Another thing that makes the classes unique is that every class has their own special twist. Some focus on defense and protecting other team members. Some focus on battle stances that change attack effects. Some slows the attacks of enemies. They are very different and yet all work very well against enemies. Replaying this game with different classes is pretty rad.This is probably my favorite rpg of all time. Most rpgs I love are due to their story, setting, and or atmosphere. I love Earthbound and I think Pokemon is pretty good too, but I love Earthbound for it's story, setting ad humor and I like Pokemon because i'm able to train and build a unique team. I love Penny Arcade 3 almost solely on it's mechanics and battle system (I do enjoy the story as well). If you love rpgs, seriously, do yourself a favor and buy this game. Especially since it's only 5 dollars cheap.			"

												While a step away from the original two, the hilarity and story are still quite strong and enjoyable. I did enjoy the SNES RPG style graphics and had an entirely joyous time playing this.

												I have kind of mixed feelings with should I recommend this games or not. The game developer changed from one to another and with that the gameplay/-look changed completely so I can definitely understand why some people won't like this even tho' they might have liked first two episodes.The story and the jokes naturally stay in the same level than in last two episodes so if you liked those in previos episodes you will most likely like them now and vice versa. For me it was more or less to see what the game offers in gameplay perspective and I'm happy to say that it doesn't let you down. If you have played any other games from this developer and liked those you are going to definitely like this one as well.			"

												Zeboyd Games is pretty much my hero when it comes to the RPG genre as of late and I hope that if they can find the resources, they can move forward to create even better looking games. Do you honestly enjoy random encounters? Level grinding for hours? Having to save your best items for fights that may not happen? Zeboyd has you covered. Every battle in R-S 3 starts you out with full health and every item you have bought/collected at your disposal. At the end of the battle you get all of that back. You also get 1MP per turn (magic costing up to 9MP) which you can use freely without fear of having to save it for another battle. This creates actually enjoyable gameplay where every battle is a different experience (enemies are already put in groups at pre-set points in every map) that requires tactical planning prior and mid battle.I loved the last two R-S games for being like the Mother/Earthbound games as delightully quirky and fun urban RPGs. R-S 3 manages to continue this trend while being double the length of the last two games (for the better!) and will ALWAYS surprise you. On top of that, you don't actually need to have any knowledge of the former games. Because of that, I actually recommend this game more than the games before it.If you love RPGs you owe it to yourself to play this game. It's cheap, it's fun, and if you ♥♥♥♥♥ about it being too easy, play it on Insane and eat your level grinding heart out (level grinding is optional on easier difficulties!).			"

												The third episode in Penny Arcade's series is a much needed detour from the first two games. This is a silly ATB-like RPG based around silly classes. Each of your characters has an innate class and can use one of several secondary classes to complement their abilities.Although there is an element of strategy, the game isn't terribly hard in the standard difficulty. Every battle is scripted and placed in the map so you can see it coming and, in a few cases, avoid it. Unfortunately, the story is almost 100% linear. On the plus side, it eliminates the dreaded need of other games for farming. On the other side, this hardly feels as a more traditional RPG in the sense that exploration and discovery is limited to searching every nook and cranny of the dungeons.It's overall a fun game, but not a great RPG. If you're trying to complete the quad- tetralogy (?) this will feel like a much needed rest from the sometimes sluggish pace of the first two games.			"

												As a fan of Breath of Death and Cthulu Saves the World, I wanted to like this game.  I couldn't make myself do it, though.I wont be overly critical of the story, as I'm not really a fan of the source material, but I will say that the text drags to the point of being tedious.What really kills the game for me, though, is how slow the combat is.  There's a good game hiding in there, if you have the patience for it.  I consider the drawn out combat to be a plus, that you have to pay attention and not just mash your way to victory, but when you combine that with slow combat it just makes for a frustrating experience.Maybe if you're a big Penny Arcade fan then the scenes and long dialog are a good enough reward to push through each slow fight- but beyond that, I just don't see it as being worth even the half a dollar I ended up paying for it.

												So here's the deal: If you want a short, mindless game full of wit, charm, and a story, then this game is amazing.  However, the gameplay itself gets tedious rather quickly.  Battles become severely repetitive, your signature combos being replayed again and again regardless of the actual conditions of the battle.  It can be underwhelming, and at a few points a chore to finish.What the game does amazingly though, is combine story and humor in ways often not expected.  The ending, OH MY GOSH.  I would highly recommend playing the Hot Head Studios prequels, as they do share some insight as to the story, but the game itself CAN stand on its own.7/10			"

												Yes, I recommend this game. However, I should probably point something out before you buy it:Yes, it is funny. It's really funny. This game will launch your sides into orbit.Yes, it is a GOOD RPG. A damn good one, at that.But there's not a whole lot of content. It's kind of crazy that I only have 25 hours on this game after playing it so much, having to retry certain bosses over and over again. And even when I had done all of the story related content and beaten the DLC areas, it didn't take me very long to 100% my save. TL;DR: This game's really good but it doesn't last long			"

												I could put a massive review here of what I think of the game, but I'll shorten for simplicity's sake.This is easily Zeboyd's best game to date. The speed/interrupt system, multiclassing, humor, and new items/abilities are all pulled off quite well.The game isn't flawless, but what flaws it has are minor.Definitely give it a look.			"

												Just when you thought there would never be an episode 3, the gang is back in Precipice of Darkness. So it is review time.Story- Some time has passed since the events of RSPoD 2 when Gabe and Tycho go on another mission to find out who Mr. Blood really is and what he is up to. But things are not what they seem to be as it seems everyone has a secret to hide. Just when you think you know someone. This story is quite darker than the previous two games with a fair amount of death, betrayals and lies. My main problem with the story, though, was where was my character from the first two games. After all he's  been through, he seems to dissapear from the game for good. Well, he (or she) is not forgotten as there is a little side game prolouge that explains his dissapearance, humorous but desturbing, that is all I will say on that. A-Graphics- Well, Zeboyd games now takes the wheel for creating this game and so they took a completly different direction graphically. Remeber the old Final Fantasy games for the SNES? That is the style to expect for the remaining games. The retro style looks nice and well defined but may not be for everyone. CSound- There is no voice acting this time around and the retro sound effects are lifted straght from FF6 but the music is actually an improvement from the previous 2 games with a surprizingly rich score. BGameplay- This game plays just like an FF game from SNES days and that is not a bad thing. The controls are easy to get used to and are even better with controller options available (XBOX controller preferred). The dungeons are fun to explore and the battles are a blast from the past. There is even a class system for additional strategy in battle though the fights are relativly easy, it's fun to expirament with different combinations of classes. The down side is that the world map is very restrictive as you follow a strict path from point to point, making the game seem kinda restrictive. B+Overall- Due to the poor sales of the first two games, the project was almost canceled, but was picked up by a different company to finish. As such, you cannot transfer saved games. Though they manage to find creative ways around this issue, it still feels dissapointing that you cannot continue as your created character and that really bugged me throughout. But it still was a fun game and much improved from its predecessors. Recommended. B-			"

												I actually read the text story before the game came out (see more at http://rainslick.com/chapters/list/ ), and I'm surprised at how well that story was translated into a video game. Usually when something is adapted one way or the other it ends up noticeably forced into a box of specific shape. Zeboyd's engine is kind of crappy, unless you're really nostalgic for those 80s menus where you need to reinput commands a bunch of times to view each character's stats or equipment. It also relies on messageboxes with face shots and larger pictures to reveal the narrative, because the sprite engine can't handle cinematic posing. (For comparison, see an in-game cutscene from Final Fantasy Tactics.)The battle system is interesting. I don't think it's balanced right, because some classes just feel useless. Some will deal a few thousand to every enemy, while others will deal just a few hundred. The class combinations and the MP-based attacking work well, though.The story is amazing. I think the book reveales a lot more, but the book and the game work well together. I can imagine you can consume one, and then the other.			"

												Have you played the first two Penny Arcade adventures? If so, play this. The change of format from episodes 1 and 2 is a little jarring, but the humour is completely intact and very amusing. If you haven't played the first two but you like Penny Arcade's style of comedy, play the series in order. As a standalone game, though, Precipice of Darkness 3 is a little weak due to the odd blend of simplicity and complexity, as well as dragging on a bit at times. But it's cheap, so it's got that going for it.Full review here: http://postlaunch.blogspot.ca/2014/05/penny-arcades-on-rain-slick-precipice.html "

												This game reminds me of DeathSpank, but in a more retro style. There are some flaws: The menu is blocky and hard to use (I'm surprised I didn't accidentally delete a previous save and it took me a while to find some info I was looking for), the text is amazing but not presented well (voice acting would've been nice, as would music changes and animations for what was happening instead of raw text, and I forgot what we were even doing by the end of it), and the combat just drags on to the point where an area that'd take me two minutes to explore on foot now took an hour due to combat (I had never really played an old-school RPG before, and the combat was like getting punched in the face, literally, it gave me a headache). However, as the game goes on, battles become engrossing, especially with the dozen-odd classes you can mix and match (Hobo anyone?); the chiptune music is surprisingly catchy; and the highly-sarcasic comments and randomness will keep you wanting more. Great game for $5.			"

												Almost nothing of Rain-Slick 3 even resembles the first two games.

												Enjoyable game despite the extremely linear structure of the game. The combat system is more tactic based which makes combat alot less tedious. Instead of just using the same moved over and over, or mashing attack, you really need to think about your actions, and how to get the edge on your enemy. If you try to fight every battle the same way you'll probably end up losing a lot. It's also forgiving. If you fail a battle you just have to try it over until you succeed. I was happy to see the fun dialogue and interesting characters didn't suffer from the large switch in game styles. I miss the point and click bits from the last two, but this makes up for it with nicer descriptions, and a bit more dialogue.			"

												The Penny Arcade series reinvented in 16-bit era JRPG style. Basically the same combat system as Zeboyd's earlier games, crossed with Penny Arcade humor. The story is not great but not awful and it does tie back into the events established by the first two parts.  Other people have complained that it's linear, especially in the ""overworld"", and that is certainly true, but I'm not really bothered by it. For me, the biggest problem with PA3 is that PA4 is so much worse.  This game ends on a cliffhanger and finding out how the story ends requires you to play the sequel ... and unfortunately, it turns out that PA4 is somewhere between mediocre and terrible.  If you like a good old-school hack-and-slash RPG and aren't too hung up on understanding the things happening in the story, you could definitely play PA3 by itself and have a lot of fun.			"

												THis game seriously is a perfect continuation of the first parts, even better than them! WIthout the self-created character, which may have been nice, but ended up being pretty useless, has a lot more depth of story and the wit of the game didn't suffer the least. FOr all that seek out a classic RPG will find surely pure gold within this game and it's fair, but never UNfair difficulcy.			"

												At first, I wasn't sure whether I'd like the sudden change from 3D Point-And-Click environment to retro RPG environment. This may be an understatement. I was rather disappointed. Largely so. I was so angry, in fact, that I threw my laptop out the window, went back in time, threw it again, went further back in time, stopped myself, and after ending any resulting paradoxes, I played the game.THEN, I took back all my hateful feelings and such, because the game is effing awesome.I was pleasantly surprised to see that even with the changes and with the slight lack of continuation from the previous game, the humour was still there, the main entertainment was there just as expected, if not better, and the retro RPG feel went surprisingly well with the themes of the game.My ONLY single complaint is that I played through the whole game, played through the Beginning of the End DLC and it crashes where I would supposedly meet the boss of the prelude and see the important part of the story.I ended up watching this on YouTube, but if this crash is fixed, I won't mind replaying it.Okay, wait. One more complaint.I'm so used to examining random crap in an RPG and especially here, I think they could have added in tonnes of jokes or random nonsense. I'm a little disappointed that this wasn't something that anyone insisted on during development.... Final complaint: Y U NO INCLUDE ANY STEAM ACHIEVEMENTS?Rating: 9/10			"

												So, after two Penny Arcade games from Hothead Studios that were strange, weird, and also quite different in many ways, we're now suddenly thrown into an SNES-like sequel made by a single person.And to be short... this change doesn't really work.The higher difficulty levels, for example, is no longer about being a test of skill (timing your attacks and defences well), and instead becomes about luck, especially very early in the game. Luck as in who the enemy will randomly target, and with what attack. If they do it in the ""wrong"" order -which are most of them-, it's game over; but if they attack you in the exact right way, you'll survive. True, after a while you can compensate for this by having your own ""level up"" area, but that just turns it back into grinding mobs for EXP...This is particularly annoying considering that the whole point of the first two games' combat system was born out of a desire to make every fight count; non-repeatable, non-random, and the attacking and defending skills being more important than the stats. They'd fixed something that Jerry/Tycho in particular thought of as ""broken"", and then this game comes and reverts it back to broken again.The retro graphics doesn't really work either. Much of the charm of the previous two games was that it really captured the aesthetical Penny Arcade essence, especially with the cut-scenes being done in comic book format.In the end, I played through this game -and the next- mainly because the first two games had presented a really gripping story that I wanted to see done to its finish. And that's pretty much the only reason I can think of to buy episode three and four of this series. Otherwise, steer clear.			"

												This game is highly underapreciated. While there may not be the greatest graphics, or the most sophisticated combat system, it certaintly is a great game to pour in 20 minutes there, another 15 here. You can probably beat it in 3 hours, maybe less, but i reccomend taking your time to look at all the hidden stuff and all the stuff you might just walk past. Wait till it goes on sale, then by it for less than a buck. You dont have to purchase the previous installments in the series to undersand a vague plot, and i really didnt like the fourth installment.			"

												This is a good game. Steam stopped tracking my hours for some reason, so my play time is not accurate. I put in about 10 total hours into the game, and have beaten everything but the DLC (I'd be interested if I didn't have to grind some classes to level 40. It would be easy, and quick, but I'm just not that interested).Be forewarned. This game does not feature ANY carryover from the first two games, as it was developed by a different studio. Your custom character from the first two, also does not make an appearance or cameo, and is only barely spoken of, at all. For all intents and purposes, pretend you finally found a home, far far away from Tycho and Gabe, and thus, are safe.This game, I feel, is much better than the first two. Instead of relying on mediocre combat mechanics involving timing blocks and having to farm items, you have instantly replenishing items (thank you!) and a simple JRPG battle format, involving a simple turn based gage system, The game is really simple and very easy if you have any idea how to juggle classes. The UI is kind of poor, but once you have the classes down, it's fairly easy to think out a good combination in your head. From what I understand, the DLC is a challenge, so if you find the base game too easy, perhaps you will find your challenge in the post game.Having more of the humor that Penny Arcade is known for, with a more engaging story line, that feels to be the perfect length, this is probably the best game in the series (although I haven't played 4 yet, so...)Pick it up when it's on sale, which it seems to go on, quite a lot. I bought this game for like 50 cents, and it was an incredible value (5 cents an hour just cannot be beat).			"

												Ah Zeboyd what did you do to this series? Just as a back story , since it confused me as well, Hot Head Games made the first two in this series and Zeboyd made the last two. After Precipice of Darkness 2 Hot Head Games devoted their time to the game Deathspank (awesome game series btw) and let Precipice go to Zeboyd (why? i'm not sure) but on to the review. This game retains much of what made the first 2 entries great. Same story same adult humor, it truely feels like it is continuing the story line albeit outside of the normal graphic style. This version no longer has the 3-D ish  style it now harkens back to the earlier Final Fantasy 8 bit era. The character you have been involved with in the first two episodes is gone and they some what explain this briefly.This game definately is worth the buy but you should play the first two to understand it completely. My only real problem with this game was the fact of constantly being reminded that this is only a shadow of its first two itininerations. Had the series started like this there wouldn't be any problems but to me it is like playing the Assassins Creed Series and then in the new version it has you playing the game like Civilization. While it may still be a good game I would keep thinking how much I miss the old Assassins Creed.			"

												Zeboyd, like a white knight, sweeps in to save this franchise from its own destruction by both ignoring the first two games and making fun of the fact that the first two games were full of it. Gone are the generic combat and the Pee-covered Ultimate Weapons. Instead, we get a well-written comedic RPG that never forgets that it's a game first and an extension of Penny Arcade second.			"
