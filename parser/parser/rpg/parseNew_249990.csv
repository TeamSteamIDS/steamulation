												Do NOT buy this game if you plan to play single player.  It's miserable.That said, I absolutely recommend this game for co-op with 3 or 4 players.  This game is a very tough gauntlet-style game, with puzzley elements frequently thrown in.  Yes, you are smacking monsters and trying to stay alive, while doing puzzles at the same time.  It's freaking hard.But, it is very satisfying to complete the levels.  The only downside is that the netcode still isn't rock solid.  For whatever reason, I have a 20%ish game freeze rate when trying to start a group game, requiring me to totally shut down the game and restart.  Other than that, it seems ok.			"

												Don't try this without friends, you'll go mad in singleplayer. Extremely difficult, we've spent over an hour on certain trials (still not done with all of them), especially difficult if you want to do the challenges. Controls work great on a controller, gameplay is overall interesting. The orb idea is a neat one, makes for fun and interesting puzzles, although you might kill your friends over it at certain times. You WILL have to go back and revisit previous levels to do the challenges, which provide the upgrade gems for abilities. I personally like this, challenges are usually fun and they really need teamwork, but I imagine it may bother some people playing the same levels over and over.Plays best if you have friends over, you really need to communicate (yell, actually). The main reason why you really need friends for this. Everyone should have a mic and lots of patience, really difficult to have this with strangers.Got a 4 pack in sale a while back, money well spent. We're at roughly 23 hours so far and still has a lot to offer, so I'm pretty sure you would be happy with it even at full price.			"

												Forced is absolutely brutal, requiring constant team communication, clever problem solving and the mastery of combat skills. It can be an incredible amount of fun and is highly recommended for any group of gamer friends.This game pleasantly surprised me: simple in concept, but with an incredible amount of depth to it.I can’t stress enough how much fun Forced is when you’ve got even just one other player. It’s a smartly designed cooperative action game with a great variety in its challenges, and a great combat system that encourages teamwork over all else.Forced is an honest cooperative RPG with some good ideas suitable for 3 or 4 players but a hard nut to crack for lone wolves.Playing solo is oftentimes more frustrating than fun.However if you’re itching for a hardcore co-op action experience, then you’ve struck gold with Forced.

												Forced is a co-op tactical arena game. It can be compared to games like Diablo, but it's not another Diablo clone - there's no loot in this game and its more co-op than any Diablo-like games I played.In this game you play as slave gladiator who is forced to fight to amuse god-like creatures. Thus this game is based around Trials - rather small arena-like challenges. They can vary from ""kill everyone"" kind of thing to puzzles, mazes and boss battles.You have 4 classes(or to be more precise - 4 weapons) - Volcanic Hammer(AoE melee damage), Frost Shield(Tank), Spirit Blades(Single target melee damage), Storm Bow(Ranged damage) (Each of them have skills to heal each other). In each trial you can get a maximum of 3 crystals (1 for the completion of the trial, 1 for challenge(these will vary from trial to trial) and 1 for time attack). These crystals will unlock new skills(you have a total of 8 active and 8 passive skills for each weapon with only 6 slots(3 for active and 3 for passive)). Also note that your progress is shared among all weapons, so you will get all skills for all weapons simultaneously,Another thing is Spirit Mentor(named Balfus) who is one of the key features of the game. Balfus is your way of interacting with environment and is vital to every trial. To spice things up, you can't just order him to go somewhere. Instead, you can only call him on your current position, which makes everything a bit harder.And about the difficulty - this game is hard. Like, really hard. Not once have I found myself stuck and not once did I go back to gather some more crystals.As a closing note - this game is heavily co-op oriented and I don't know how good it plays in single player. So it will be better if you have some friends to play with.As a downside of this game I can say about quite unstable net code, but devs are constantly working on it. "

												I really owe this game a review.  I've had more fun with this playing with friends than any other game.  No other game has permitted me to talk at such loud levels to the people sitting next to me.  It's a lot like gauntlent but a greater challenge in my opinion.  Where as gauntlent is more geared toward grinding mobs down, this is more for how well can you work together on a particular goal.  I haven't encountered many games that make you have to be this tightly coordinated.  Weak links will become apparent and quick.  Each level brings a new way of having to making a plan.  Each monster has to be learned how to be dealt with.  Kiting isn't an option.  Understanding how each fighter operates is vital.  My warnings:  This is meant for co-op.  You can play single player, but you aren't going to have as much fun.  More importantly, you will want to find a consistant person or so to play with, which I know isn't always easy.  Pugging this game usually ends in a bad result, and there aren't enough people in the lobby to make games happen when you have time to play.  Also, I would not say this is for a casual gamer.  If you haven't built up a reasonable degree of twitch, I feel you are just going to get frustrated.  I'm not saying people can't learn, but I've seen people that don't play a lot of games say this is not for them.  Games are fun, but to me this one was an experience.  One I could share with some good friends.			"

FORCED is a Action Role-Playing Game heavily pushing a co-op experience. STORYI would say the weakest part of the game, other than some of the technical issues that some people still experience (see technical) - would be the story. It's a very quick and short tale that leaves a lot to the imagination. I'm not saying it's bad; simply shallow. If  your goal is to find a rich story - you will not find it here.ELEMENTSAll players have the option to play one of four classes which are determined in the entrance room to each trial room. It is also good to note that no matter the decision of the class; in most cases you will have healing spells, damage spells, and defensive spells of some kind. Other than the inherit differences between melee and ranged; the developers have done a good job at keeping most everything balanced. The true co-op experience comes into play before anyone even enters a trial; deciding who will have which spell to counter the trial mechanics. This is an element that most co-op games don't have.GAMEPLAYOnce your skills and class has been chosen - per challenge - you will face 25 trials with increasing difficulty. As one may expect the game starts out in a tutorial manner, teaching players how to navigate the trial and use new mechanics. Balfus (your spirit guide) is an integral part of the gameplay, requiring players to move him to destroy shrines or statues, light the path, assist in damage dealing, or in some trials - used against you!The primary game play is to complete objectives which range from killing monsters, finding the end of a maze, or simply lighting shrines. As a side note I wouldn't say this is necessarily a game with heavy puzzle elements; however there is a degree of puzzle solving.DIFFICULTYIf you plan on being a completionist, to get all 75 crystals and all achievements, expect to spend some time on this game. At the time of this writing I have completed all achievements in roughly 24 hours of gameplay. Most challenges took my team 1-10 tries; the challenge on the last boss took us roughly 4 hours. If you plan on simply completing the trials to have the experience to play - expect at best half of that. I would not recommend this game if you want to just play single player - this is a game best experienced with friends. Disclaimer: Your mileage my vary, every gamer and team is different you could see significantly less or more gameplay.TECHNICALI have to peck at the game a bit on this level; there are still a few issues with networking that the developers are actively working on. In addition the game is poorly optimized in terms of graphics use. A lot of the options to effectively reduce load on a computers GPU is non-existant. My system with a GTX570 runs this game fine, but quite hot in comparison to other games with a much higher expectation (100% load in some areas running 70c+). I assume as the game matures further, the developers will continue solving some of the technical issues that some players are reporting as problems; they did not effect my team as much as some but it is important to note that they could come up.CONCLUSIONHighly recommended for any CO-OP experience. This game is quite fun with a lot of potential for growth in the future. 9/10 for what it is, and for my experience.			"

												IMPORTANT NOTICE: This is not really an RPG game in most of its sense; there is no actual character sheet, and when your character evolves, whatever choice you make in that regard can be undone freely. Changing your build is literally like changing clothes. There is no looting or potions. There is no choice of gear other than the 4 basic sets, which are also your ""class"", and once again, you can freely swap. This is nothing like Diablo (in this sense) unlike other reviewers insist to claim. Bear that in mind.Devilishly challenging yet fair, this here is a masterpiece.You are simply FORCED to undergo challenges in a twisted sort of arena. Endlessly spawning monsters chasing you while you try to solve a maze, or while you run away from a deadly red myst, or perhaps while you try to take cover from a laser beams (lol what?! its magic!)... figuring out how to solve each area is one thing, solving it is ANOTHER THING!Completion of each area is required to access its respective boss, and each completion awards you with one crystal - literally one ""experience point"" - that unlock skills. Optionally you can solve an area while doing a special challenge (depends on the area) or while time-attacking, each of which award you another crystal. Whereas you might think ""Nah, I'm not an achievement hunter, I just wanna finish the game"" you might be FORCED (unexpected pun) to change your mind there as sometimes the higher level skills give you a crucial advantage when fighting the boss.There is no difficulty tweak, you cannot switch to ""easy mode"". Definitely not for people who get frustrated easily.			"

A bit about the game and developers.FORCED has been developed and published by a small group of Danish developers, called BetaDwarf Studio. They actually had a pretty funny story while making this game. In fact, it was so funny that they even made a picture about it which you can see here.So, FORCED is a Co-Op adventure game with a lot of puzzle elements. The game does future single player, but I do not recommend that.. More about that in the Gameplay section of the review! They also plan to bring this game to Wii-U!About Gameplay.As I said above, Forced is a game that allows both single player and co-op. At begining I was playing this game single player. My steam friend list has a couple of people who own this game, but nobody played at the time when I did. So anyway, In single player the game is quite fun! The story is very good too. It wasn't so hard, and I really enjoyed it. But then, couple of missions later... It became quite hard! So, I got into the game once at the same time as my friend FaithNoMore did. We decided to try the game out in Co-op..It was amazing! The game became much easier but it kept being harder and harder as we progressed through the challenges. In most of the cases one of us was always the last-man-standing, running around the enemies, doing his best to stay alive long enough for the other person to revive. We also found out that this game is actually meant to be played in four people! After a while, our obstacles became quite hard. So hard that one of us had to keep sacrificing just so we could complete a mission. If there were four of us, it would be piece of cake!The game has four different classes, a rogue, archer, tank and a ""area of damage"" damage dealer. Each of them has their own element. Rogue uses poison and has teleportation skills and skills that get him out of combat quite fast. He's the best class to take creatures down one by one. Archer uses lightning element with which he deals nice damage to couple of creatures at the same time. His arrows also always push enemies back, so he doesn't have too big problem with staying alive. Tank uses ice element to make ice crystal around him which then pushes enemies back, and so on and on. Needless to say he's got the biggest hp. He also has a weapon (shield) which can be thrown away to enemies. Now, the AoE damage dealer uses fire element to deal very big damage to multiple creatures at the same time. Sounds overpowered, right? Well, he does deal big damage, but he swings very slowly. He can also crush a meteorite down onto the enemies.This game also has a lot of different creatures that you have to fight against to win. All of them have their own strength and weaknesses. Some spit on you from far, some charge you with their massive cleaves. And once again, you need a full group of four to make a great tactic on how to win against the creatures.Graphic and AudioGraphically speaking the game looks very good! The game itself looks a bit cartoonish. The skill effects look quite nice. For an Indie company they really put their backs into it! Voice acting in the game is very good too!Pros, cons and final grade.Pros:- Very cheap!- Extremely fun!- Supports four players at the same time!- Full of puzzles!- It's an extremely fun, cheap coop puzzle based indie game!Cons:- Almost unplayable in single player.Final grade: 9/10 !Extra info: If you're into puzzles and you're searching for something to play with your friends, this game is for you! Don't look anywhere further, just buy this game and play it. It's amazing!Thank you for reading my reviews! Don't forget that I'm usually posting new reviews on my blog weekly and you can check them out here:[/b] http://midnightwolfie.blogspot.comThank you![/b] "

												Just know that while there is a single player option, you will need friends or you will have a bad time.  The first few trials are fun, but then you hit trial 5 and 6 and realize that not only will you be facing off against multiple enemies who move faster than you, but you will need to try and fight them while trying to move the orb around.  The enemies will surround and overwhealm you.  Maybe I just missed something, but the youtube videos that showed how to do these levels were people who had already earned the crystals needed to unlock more advanced abilities.  I'm disappointed but hopeful that I can get a friend to play this with me and maybe my experience with the game will be different.			"

												If you are looking for a couch coop game, this one is the best or one of the best.Levels include increasingly challenging puzzle and hack n slash level. Some levels are almost purely slow puzzly levels, some are fast paced fighting levels and rest are some combination of those two.Game mechanics are simple and are introduced sufficiently smoothly so you don't feel overwhelmed. Later on these mechanics are combined in various ways and the game never feels boring.Biggest con for this game would be that its not a single-player game. You can play it alone but its not even half the fun.So if you are looking for a coop game to have fun with your friends this game is for you.			"

												FORCED is an insanely fun co-op puzzle brawler. You play as a slave being trained up to be a gladiator and you are exposed to 25 challenging levels (5 bosses, 20 challenge rooms). After 30 hours of playing the game (it can definitely be completed MUCH faster), here's what I think..Pros:- The game is infinitely more fun with co-op partners. The difficulty fluctuates a lot depending on whether you do a challenge solo or with a group. For example, some challenge rooms are easier to do with more people. On the other hand, some boss rooms require a lot more concentration with a full group due to the higher amount of adds. Either way it is a game that does a great job of promoting teamwork seeing as the 4 available weapon-types have a specific role to fulfill.- The skill variety is ample enough. There are 3 passive and active slots and there are enough skills for all types of situations.- There is a large variety of different challenges rooms with various objectives. There are 4 acts (or areas) and all of the puzzles are different. No 2 puzzles repeat so you can be sure that the game stays 'fresh' until the end.- You get to face challenging bosses. Each boss has a speed challenge and a 'self-imposed' handicap challenge. With these 2 challenges, you can't just face-smash your way to full-on victory. Fully completing a boss level requires a certain level of precision and understanding of the room's mechanisms.- The spirit guide's dialogue is quite well-done. It was entertaining enough to get me through the entire game without getting complacent.Cons:- The Camera feels very limited.- There is currently a glitch that sinks the 3rd player in any group under the floor when entering or re-entering the preparation room. They are currently looking into it.- High latency can cause issues in some puzzles. These issues can block progression.All in all I loved FORCED. I haven't had that much fun in co-op since playing Magicka. I would like to see more puzzles in the future. The bosses were alright but the puzzles felt a lot more satisfying/rewarding when completed.9/10 and looking forward to sequels and other releases from this developer!			"

												Edit #1: This game is pretty hard.  When I play this, I get quite frustrated, but I like a good challenge.Some of the challenges seem impossible, but it might just be because I'm a newb.In this game, each ""level"" is referred to as a trial.Each trial has 3 achievements you can unlock:-Completing the Level-A unique level challenge (such as beating a level without killing monster spawn points, etc.)-And beating the level with a speed run aspect to it (Time Trials).When you beat a trial, you earn ""crystals"" which are basically level ups for your gladiator.Crystals unlock active and passive skills to make your hero stronger.There are 4 Heroes (weapons), you can choose from, and that you can change at any point in the game:-Volcanic Hammer (Warrior class)-Spirit Claws (Rogue class)-Ice Shield (Paladin class)-Storm Bow (Hunter class)It plays like an arcade game, but man, it is pretty hard, and my frustration is a 9/10 most of the time. lolThe cool thing with this game, is that the puzzles and monster spawns scale with the number of players in a game.So the more players, the harder the game is!For completionists, the good thing is that you can compare your rankings with other players from around the globe to see how well (or poorly) you've done.All in all, a good game, and would recommend even at full price. :)[END OF EDIT]~~~~~~~~~~So far so good!I've been eyeing this game for quite some time now, and have passed up various Steam sales, either out of forgetfulness or laziness.66% Off, 50% Off, I finally picked this game up for $2.24 (85% Off), and the initial game play is decent so far.Initially, the game has a Gauntlet Legends/Warcraft 3: Custom Map/Use Map Settings vibe to it.The game plays similar to StarCraft 2 Challenges, mixed with some Gauntlet Legends-Arcade style vibe to it.I've read the reviews prior to mine where the difficulty ramps up as the game progresses, and isn't fair towards the later stages of the game... (Dungeon Defenders suffers from that, where you HAVE to play with people)I haven't gotten that far yet, however, when I get to that point, I'll be able to update this review and give my whole-hearted opinion of the game.There is one thing though: the story/voice acting, albeit, is minimal thus far, is very lacking/dry. (Supposedly the game was created with a team of 7, so it's just a side thought.  You aren't playing the game for voice acting, you're playing it for the fun factor!)All in all, the Trials are challenging... it gets me frustrated trying to race the clock and I get killed in the process. lol.I promise to update this review as I progress in the game. :)			"

												Great Game. One of the best couch co-op game I've ever played. It reminds me a good deal of doing well designed WoW raids without the time commitment and loot grind. Which for me is a great thing. It allows you do test reaction time and forces you to map out plans if you want to be truly successful. Communication between all playing is required and fun. I can not speak for solo play or playing with random people through online play. I've always played with people I know and had a blast each time.			"

												The game is quite different from what I expected when I was buying it. It's not that much about puzzles or real combat skills (I imagined something like dodging at the right time, using different attacks per enemy weaknesses, combo-ing, etc). No, it's more about great cooperation between players (voice chat is an absolute must), selecting correct skills from the skill tree for that particular level, and, unfortunately, also about grinding. The game is quite hard, don't expect a casual multiplayer co-op game. You'll need to repeat every level many times to at least finish it. And then, you'll need to repeat it many times more in order to fulfill the challenge or time criteria. If you don't do it, you'll be very much underpowered in the later levels and the difficulty will go from high to insane.So, the principle of the game is not to enjoy many different levels. The number or levels is quite low (25). The principle of the game is to rinse and repeat until you finish them perfectly. It's not what I expected and it's not what I enjoy, but tastes differ, I'm sure many people will like it. That's not why I'm giving it a thumbs down.The thumbs down goes for technical execution. From technical level, this game is horrible. Network issues are extremely common - the game splits and people see different things on their screens, someone can't move at all, someone dies but gets stuck in the dying animation and glitches the level, unable to complete it, and the list goes on. But, that's not the worst thing. The worst thing is the camera. It deserves a paragraph on its own.The camera. The devs had an idea that you need to see all characters at the same time, all the time. So if you go into different directions, the camera zooms out to make sure you see all characters. Questionably a good idea, with the worst implementation ever. First, this camera mode is mandatory, you can't switch between ""focused camera"" (seeing just yourself in the center of the screen) and ""overview camera"" (seeing everyone). No, it's just the overview camera. So, if you go far apart (necessary in some levels), you're zoomed out immensely, and your characters (and enemies) are very small. Try to use your skills effectively then! You're also in a corner or near the edge of the screen, so you have no idea what's near you in certain directions. The camera constantly shifts (as others move around), which throws your aim out of balance (especially frustration when playing the archer character). And to top all of that, the devs even botched it so much, that very often the camera actually crops your character and you're behind the edge or the corner of the screen! So, you don't actually see yourself, or the enemies around you, and you're expected to fight them and survive. Please don't forget this game is extremely punishing for even the smallest errors. You'll cry, you'll shout, you'll tear things apart. That's how bad the camera is.One final note, this game has to be played with a stable group of friends. No one might be missing any time. The reason is that every time you start a game, you'll only receive those gems, which have been completed by *all* members of the party. So if one of your friends was not available last time, you'll need to repeat all levels with him/her again, and complete all of it again. This was not the best design choice, and again, you have no option to configure this, you need to live with it. Consider it, if you don't have a stable group of friends to play and finish this game with.So, to sum it up, the game mechanics are not necessarily bad, they can be even enjoyable. But the technical execution is definitely a reason to avoid this game. And that's 18 months after release, so there's no hope of having it improved, ever.			"

												Lots of fun. Great game for the casuals AND the hardcore gamers. It's a challenge even if you don't look to complete all the achievement ( I did...I got hooked...It's awesome ^^ ). You never stop improving and if you're up to the challenge, you're going to have loads of fun. The adventure is great, with a steady learning curve. You get to learn how to play each of these four badasses if you feel like it or you can just go and solo one of them if you have a favourite, it's not impossible to finish the game if you do.Bosses are sometimes a bit easy because the strats are quite simple to understand BUT most of them are still challenging because in this game, knowing what to do is the easy part, being able to do it is a whole other story.If you have a trustworthy group of friends though, buy the fourpack, and solve these levels together. The more the merrier. Really. Especially since some of these levels take you by surprise : there's nothing funnier than seeing your friends panic and getting slaughtered in every side of the map because of some new content to the game ^^ (Beware of the fog !).Finally, the new mode they added, survival mode, is a gem. The first levels are a bit easy to beat imo, compared to the rest of the game, but the last one is....evil. I can't imagine playing with 4 players in this last level, but I'm guessing it must be the funniest experience this game has to offer. You'll understand once you get there ^^Also, there is a 'last man standing' level in these survival maps which seems pretty interesting and very promising in a way that I'll surely spend nights with my friends playing this level only and having fun helping/betraying your friends to survive the longest time possible =D.Overall an incredible game for those who like puzzles, badass characters with skill trees and passive trees, and last but not least, a little bit of challenge, for a price that is, in my opinion way underappreciated.

												Cooperative Action Puzzle RPG. You collect crystals throughout levels by beating them, and optionally, completing challenges. These crystals unlock active abilities, passive abilities, and slots for both active and passive abilities (up to 3 each). There are 4 varying classes you can choose from any time while in the hub. You can't have more than 1 class chosen at a time. My favorite class is Frozen Captain America.It's got simple combat where you can dodge most enemy attacks with good timing, and puzzles involving an ethereal sphere dude you call to your position, that you can also carry with you. It's used by guiding it through shrines, which can have a healing, explosive, speed boost, etc, effect. You can also guide it to a block, which can be pushed and pulled to your location by calling it. You can also activate other things, like torches, as well as purify things and destroy enemy spawners.The game has about 20+ something stages, and a challenging boss and new environments after every several stages.It's a pretty difficult game, and I suggest you try it with at least one other person, or you'll probably go mad in solo.

												Easily one of the best Co-Op experiences out there; the puzzles can seem easy at times, but at others they can easily stop you dead in your tracks. I play it on occasion with a friend and we always have an enjoyable time. Also for the price it is an easy 10/10, well worth the money and with steam sales it is a no brainer.			"

												Incredible game. Hits the right balance between ""these developers are evil!"" and ""holy crap I just pulled that off!"". The four classes are well varied and the skill trees are very interesting. Toying with characters builds is quite fun. The story is simple but the early twist plus good characters and good voice actors make it engaging. Coop (and local coop!) makes this a great party game too. All that together and the result is a game I haven't been able to put down. I think about it when not playing and push for the ""ok just one more unlock"" when I am playing.			"

												Word of Warning. This game is very heavy on Time Trials and alot of replays on missions. I don't see how a single player can do it with out spending alot of time redoing the missions or watch a youtube video on tme. We play about 10 missions and we completed in 5 mins or less per mission. Some of the time trials wanted you to complete the mission in a min or less. I purchase this for my brother and me and with two players using TeamSpeaker we had a hard time and it was not enjoyable. Game play was more like,move the orb around, light this stuff with the orb, blow this up with the orb, kill this device with the orb, then a hack and slash game with puzzles. We forgot all about the mobs and was just trying to get the mission done in time. I feel like the mobs of bad guys was just an annoyance and didn't help the game play. When you goal is trying to solve a puzzle in time, to get the crystals, to get new powers. I would not recommend this game, unless you like replaying the same lvl over and over and over to get the pattern down on using the orb at the right time to get all the crystals.  Also the game ""About the Game"" is so short, i believe because they was afraid if they gave you too much info you would not play the game. I will do alot more research on a game before buying in the future.			"

The levels are challenging, but never unfair and completing a challenge is extremely rewarding. I've played it with 3 different groups of friends so far and always had lots of fun. Even if you know the levels, your friends will still suggest different ways of solving the puzzles sometimes which makes the leves never become boring. "

												An interesting game with great co-op mechanics, the game ultimately lost my interest and patience with an unforgiving and unmitigated difficulty curve.  There are no difficulty settings and the ""RPG"" elements don't really afford you much benefit, at lease in the sense that in most RPGs you can grind/build up in reponse to a challenge you can't yet overcome.FORCED gives you no such luxury or mercy.As a result, unless you consider yourself a hardcore gamer, you'll likely find yourself frustrated with the game mechanics in subsequent acts past the first one.  There is no end-around or alternative strategy that will ease the challenge for the sake of completing the game.  Instead, there are brick walls.  You must find a way to climb them.  The game will offer you no quarter, even with friends.Ultimately a shame, because the co-op build and design is really enjoyable.The diffuclty level, for me at least, was a very unfortunate and very disappointing dealbreaker.

												For detailed impressions of FORCED as of 23/12/2013 check out: http://tap-repeatedly.com/2013/12/impressions-forced/""We were all pleasantly surprised and impressed with FORCED. We came in expecting a game along the lines of Torchlight but got something entirely different, refreshingly unique and sharply focused. I think it’s one of the best co-op games I’ve played over the last few years and I really can’t fault it for putting teamwork, experimentation and thoughtful proactive play at the front of the experience. We all initially sort of scoffed at Balfus (the orb) as a bit of a gimmick, but he’s arguably the star of the show, binding players together and really underlining the importance of cooperation. When you throw all the varied trials, challenges and puzzles in there as well as the enemies, the different shrines to activate, the slick and satisfying combat, the character classes and the skill pools to dive into and play around with, you’ve got a game that’s unlike anything else out there.BetaDwarf describe FORCED as ‘tactical arena co-op’ or ‘co-operative gladiator action’; whatever it is, it’s brilliant and absolutely worth your time and money if you’ve got a few budding buddies.""

												I played this game co-op with a friend. I have not tried single player. That said, the game was quite fun with one other person and requires a signifcant amount of teamwork to complete challenges and to fight bosses.FORCED is an interesting take on the action rpg genre. Instead of running around solely fighting hordes of monsters, you have arenas that you must enter and complete challenges. You also have an NPC that you must guide around who is an integral part of completing these challenges, which usually involves calling him to particular locations, causing him to move over shrines or other objectives to complete objectives while monsters are there to get in the way and make things more difficult. I wouldn't go so far as to call these challenges puzzles, as it is usually pretty obvious what needs to be done and is more a matter of execution.There are a panoply of abilities you can unlock to help you destroy monsters. They are unlocked by completing arenas, completing them quickly, and by doing special objectives in them. There are four classes and you are not tied to a particular one. You can change your class any time you are not in an arena and you will have the same tier of abilities unlocked on each character, so you don't have to level each one or anything like that.The boss arenas are fun and each one has their own interesting set of mechanics. A few of the arenas and one of the boss fights in particular (the skeleton, for reference) are quite difficult, but that just makes beating them all the more satisfying.So all in all, a fun game to play co-op. I'm not sure about the single player aspect of the game. Having had a multiplayer play through, I have no interest in going through a second run solo.			"

												Don't buy this game for its online multiplayer.  If you can even manage to connect to someone it's practically guaranteed that everyone will have crippling amounts of lag.  For a co-op oriented game all I can do is shake my head at this flaw.I really wanted to like this game as Gauntlet 64 on the (you guessed it) N64 was one of my favorite games of the time.  Also, Forced IS a fantastic game when it runs properly.  The puzzle component of the game adds some much needed ""spice"" to the hack-n-slash genre and the arena design is fantastic.  The limited RPG components of the game worked just fine and allowed for some character customization, combined with the solid gameplay it's a recipe for success.In the end, none of the games' strengths matter when you can't even hop into an online co-op match and have fun with your friends (or strangers).Don't even buy this when it's on sale if you want to game online with your friends.  You might as well flush the money down your toilet.  It's made even worse by how obviously solid the gameplay is when you play solo... such a shame!  A lot of TLC clearly went into this one but they messed up one crucial thing.  The devs can go on and on about how they are fixing it but that is total BS.  It should have worked right on release.  Selling a busted P.O.S. like this should be analagous to fraud.			"

												A terrific game that allows up to 4 people to play. I wouldn't recomend it while playing on your own though since that kinda defeats some of the purpose. Unlike other ARPGs or whatever we call these it's not focused around finding gear and leveling up. Instead each stage has a mission, a purpose. These are simple puzzles or annoying challenges that you need to find a plan on how to solve. It could be lasers, or bombs or just a simple ""kill everything mission"". After a mission you are returned to a ""world map"" inbetween missions. You may change between 4 classes and 2 people can't be the same class. The classes act a little different and are good for different things.In each mission you can earn 3 crystals, which is basically the leveling up system of the game. Once you reach a certain number of crystals you unlock additional skills you can use instead of the basic ones. How do you earn the crystals? It's a little different depending on the mission but mostly it's about clearing the mission within a certain time frame, not taking damage or doing something fancy. Great game, but play with some friends.			"

												Best co-op game for hardcore players I have ever played.Grindless hack&slash with puzzle elements for up to 4 players. It is divided into 25 diverse 5-10 minute missions, each with additional challenges (one speedrun and one tied to specific level features). Furthermore, there are 3 co-op survival maps available as well as a competitive ""last man standing"" survival map.After first missions the game gets progrssively harder (from the 12th level onward you will die regurarly). The game is fair in its difficulty though - every attack can be avoided if played properly.There are 4 classes available, each with its own niche. You can change your class and build anytime. The secret to the victory is finding the right team composition and strategy to beat the obstacles.There is no grind. Progression is based on a number of missions and challenges you managed to finish. ""Leveling up"" does not change character stats, but unlocks new abilities you can choose from, diversifying your arsenal rather than making you outright stronger. You can take up to 3 active and 3 passive abilities, so respeccing for particular challenges isn't a chore.The game can be played single player. It tunes its difficulty to the number of players quite well (some levels are a little bit harder, some a little bit easier when playing with friends).			"

												Hypothetical situation you're a gladiator and spirits are always with you because you have a spirit mentor he's called Belfry or something. He has a mental disorder, so he's got multiple personalities and one of them is a capital arsehat. that's why you have to be a gladiator. Once they establish the plot, you get to punch a scarecrow with a weapon and then you get to punch it REALLY hard and then you're a real gladiator. This is a good game to play with a controller. After you're a real gladiator, you have to go fight real enemies, and then you're a true gladiator. Once you do that, you can start playing actual levels, and then you can be acknowledged as a gladiator. Levels are fun with friends, if you happen to have any. Friends are useful because they do everything wrong and will inevitably make the game harder. So don't try to play this with friends, they're usually really bad at this. If you do play with friends out of the kindness of your heart, it is not required that you acknowledge them as gladiators. You may opt to refer to them as peasent, commoner, or perhaps dead.Fighting is fun because you pick a weapon and then you kill enemies with it. When you kill an enemy a few times, it loses health and gains marks instead. Marks are sort of like a currency in this game, where enemies can trade you their health points for more marks. Once they've made this trade, they can opt  to sell them to you in exchange for more damage. Through this method, you can kill enemies, and become a gladiator. Becoming a gladiator is harder than just killing enemies though. you need to get crystals and stuff, and those let you get more abilities and passive things and active abilities and passive abilities, as well as skills which you acquire by collecting gems. There is also a soundtrack in the game, although I do not remember any of it. It is probably gladiator music. I can not confirm this. I would give this game anywhere from 10 to 12 dollars, because I think it was on sale. Now is a good time to buy it, since you can get it at full price again. This is a definite must-have for anyone that thinks they might like to be a gladiator, in any sense of the word.			"

												Typically single player games have co-op features that aren't requirements to play and pass the game. FORCED on the other hand is a single player game that HAS TO BE played in co-op. The challenges scale so that if there are fewer players you may need to do a task fewer times or kill fewer enemies, but it's still challenges created with co-operative play in mind; you may need to carry a ball fewer times across the screen but you still need to carry it across the screen rather than alternating with a partner. There are four heroes, each specializing in different tasks and the game comes into its own when they're all working together taking advantage of their specialties. You can conceivably play this title single player but it's an experience meant for co-op. Preferably 3 people or more (max of 4).Like any co-op experience FORCED spends little time in cutscenes or dialogue; there are 5 hubworlds you travel to in a small overworld map, each with 5 levels and a boss. Each level gives you a max of three crystals: one for completion, another for completing a challenge specific to that level, and a third for completion under a certain time. It's a relatively short game if you're just aiming to pass levels and face the bosses. Despite that several levels and bosses present a WORTHY challenge and will require some coordination and strategizing on your teams' end. Otherwise length and replay value comes in trying to do the challenges and finishing the levels under the time limit. Many of the challenges further the co-op aspect by requiring some modicum of strategy in finishing them, whether that be lining up the shield hero so that he tanks hits whilst the archer attacks from afar so that no one on the team is hit by a particular enemy, or positioning heroes so that an explosive object doesnt touch enemies on its way to its objective in a timely manner. I don't know how its even possible to complete some of these tasks in single player.The point in completing challenges is for crystals; attaining a certain amount unlocks more abilities for your class and/or slots to use abilities (maximum of three). The abilities are obviously different for each class, and they have their use depending on what you're trying to do. You can use one of your slots for a healing ability to aid your team in bossfights, or you can switch it out for a rapid fire attack to take out many smaller enemies that may present issues whilst the rest of your team is focusing a large enemy down. Pre-levels there's a moderate amount of strategy in synergizing heroes and abilities to get the job done.Good and pretty short co-op experience, but that's the big thing: unless you have a group of people to play this with don't bother. It can be fun playing alone, but it's like playing payday or left4dead alone and without bots. It's made to be a co-op title and without it it isn't as enjoyable.			"

												A very challenging top-down puzzle action game that heavily focused on coop gameplay. Be aware, you WILL die tons of times.In every stage, you get to choose one of 4 different equipments, each have its unique skill and usefulness. The game mechanics are pretty straight forward. Every few stages it introduce a new puzzle element, and each stage you earn medals to unlock more active or passive skills for your characters.Although this game can be played solo, coop is still the way to play it. I completed the game with my co-op buddy in 2-player coop, and how I wish we can actually get 4 players to enjoy together! The game scales pretty well depends on how many players are in the game (for example, the more players you have, the more enemies will be spawned, and the target objectives will be harder).The graphics and musics are not bad. The plot is negligible. Glitches still occur occasionally, but most are cosmetic. Nothing game breaking. This game handles networking pretty well. If you are playing online coop, as long as the internet is not too terrible, the game is very playable even with a little bit of lag.For Achievement HuntersAll the achievements are doable, but will require you to get good in the game. This is not a very popular game, so game guides are quite scarce. Some of the stage challenges are easier on single player due to reduced difficulty. Most of the stage challenges and time challenges requires careful planning, practise, and a bit of luck.My score: 8/10			"

												Although I have enjoyed my brief time on this game - the reality is it is not ready for even a beta release. Primarily sold as co-op multiplayer - you'll be frustrated to realise that even if you manage to connect to your friends - lag will eventually render the game unplayable for everyone but the host. The devs have been hard at work trying to fix this issue - but at this stage its been 4 months and its plain to see that they are either in way over their heads - or knowingly released an unfinished game as a full release. As an early access or beta I would give this a thumbs up - but sadly this is simply not the case.			"

												At first I thought it would be another top-down, grind for gear, irrevocable skill tree, hack'n'slash. I'm ususally not a fan of this game type, can you tell? The puzzle elements in the game description got me to buy it, and this game launched up near the top of my recommendations list. No level or gear grinding necessary, no getting stuck in skill trees, and the puzzle aspect force you to think about what else you are supposed to be doing while you hack'n'slash the incoming mobs...not just mindlessly stumbling into your objectives on a huge map.The combat is structured well. The game description notes that ALL attacks are avoidable, which does allow you to focus on skillfully avoiding the enemies, rather than button mashing. The game scales very well in multiplayer, and the connectivity is great so far.This game? Buy this game.			"

												Wow, is this game fun! With the sarcastic and whitty narator/sprite that helps you out, lots of enganging trials to go through and complicated traps to dogde, along with some varying enemies, this game is a must. You can even change your class at any time before a trial, making it easy to switch to what your team needs. I have a few friends who play this with me, and the game's trials with change in difficulty to scale with how many team mates you've got. Even alone, however, this game is exciting. I haven't finished yet, so I can't speak to the end storyline, but I do know that the trials ARE difficult and increase in difficulty as you beat bosses. Heck, my group and I died so many times in that poison room then again in the rotating laser room. Yet what the game does well is that it doesn't beat you down if you fail. In fact, we would've all kept at the trial until getting it if one of us didn't have to leave. So yes, I would highly recommend this witty little game. Grab it for yourself and for a few friends, because they'll love it to (or simply tell them to get it. I mean really, do they think you're full of money or something?).			"

												The bottom line?  FORCED has some issues, but it's well worth your time to play, especially if you can play with friends.Upon starting FORCED, I faced some serious problems trying to get controllers working. Supposedly these issues have all been fixed now, so hopefully you won't suffer the same hassles.  Even if you do, however, I recommend you perservere and get it set up to play.FORCED is first and foremost a puzzle game. Yes, the combat plays a significant part, and you will get good at the combat (and will need to), but the puzzles and the teamplay is what makes the game.  Trying to work out how to complete levels, and then complete the challenges and time trials is genuinely fun and will make you think and strategise, which is a really refreshing change of pace from so many other games.Perhaps the biggest issues are the occasional bug that can make a level impossible, the aforementioned controller issues, and the skill unlock progression.  Some of the high levels skills unlocked later in the game are *really* underwhelming given the effort you've gone to acquire them, and the last unlock requires you to complete everything in order to obtain. That's right, you have to do everything in the game in order to unlock the last abilities, and even if they weren't hideously disappointing (which they are), that would leave you with nothing to do with that ability.While FORCED enjoyable solo, I would most heartily recommend it as a fantastic game to play local co-op, I've read reports of issues with the net-code for playing with others online, but playing with multiple people on one screen is great.I'd really love to see more from FORCED. I'd love to see more levels, and ideally some reworking of some of the skills available - there are a number that are basically useless.  Still, FORCED is well worth your money and your time.			"

												I'll make this very short - this is an excellent game that is very much worth your time and money. If you have some to play it with, that is - ideally someone sitting with you in the same room.The game consists of a disconnected series of ""trials"" (aka levels) with an overarching, persistent upgrade system and four classes you can change between at will between runs. After finishing six of the 25 available levels, I can say that thinking up and implementing strategies for achieving each level's extra goals (finishing it within a given time limit, plus one level-specific goal) is really satisfying.You will be running the same levels over and over again, but there's no grind - you will be trying various approaches, or attempt to perfect the execution of a strategy you thought up (it's not the hardest game in the world, nor does it try to be, but it's decently challenging for your average gamer, so that will happen sooner or later).It's not the Greatest ♥♥♥♥ing Thing Ever, but it's a splendid game you might spend tens of hours on and thoroughly enjoy it, and it's an excellent co-op experience. As a fair warning though - one of the game's core mechanics makes it highly troll-prone. Only play with people you know and/or trust to do fine, and as I've said before, ideally with people sitting in the same room.			"

												Disclaimer: Only tried the game in single-player mode so far.And it's great! It kept me up till 5:30 am, and I hadn't had this happen in quite a few years. FORCED is like the child of Diablo and Zelda (the games! not the characters :P). If you like both ARPGs and puzzle / platformers this is for you.You play as a Gladiator, a soul bred and trained for one purpose; to fight and survive the challenges of the Arena. Your spirit mentor, a blue wisp, guides you through these challenges. The game is split up into 4 (from what I can tell) segments, each with 5 trials and a guardian (boss). Each trial (including the guardian) has both a challenge and a time trial as well for extra gems - which you use to unlock skills. It looks like it will keep you busy for at least a dozen hours, if not more.In each Trial, the goal is always very clear, but don't expect ""how on earth do I get there?"" to also be clear ;) The puzzles pose various tactical (planning) and practical (execution) challenges - some of them very hard. The different classes / abilities aren't just reskins of eachother, they have very distinct effects and there's some synergy within the class itself. The difficulty & learning curve ramp up very smoothly. I also liked that all classes play very well with both keyboard / mouse & controller. Except the archer - he's a ♥♥♥♥♥ to aim with a controller. The only major downside I found was that the combat felt a bit stiff - I had a feeling I was constantly missing a couple more active abilities in my arsenal. Maybe a dodge/block/parry with a really small cooldown?The visual direction this game has is great. You take a random screenshot, it's gonna look beautiful. Very nice color pallette, and it's very functional as well. You never really have ""I didn't see that"" or ""where am I"" moments, even amidst chaotic battles. The game's soundtracks are also very well composed and fit each level. SFX are well designed as well, though nothing special. But what really sells the audio of the game is the voice acting. It's actually acting, as opposed to just reading lines. And it's not just your spirit mentor, but the bosses as well, which really helps build up the anticipation of facing them. The game isn't story-heavy (nor does it have to be) but the plot is quite interesting and well written.Overall the gameplay nailed it for me. Great experience and really looking forward to trying local co-op. I'm glad I bought it and would definitely recommend it!			"

Do not expect a ""classical"" aRPG like Diablo, no. This is more about strategy than loot. Each level requires you to think ahead a bit before you tackle it, so it's a bit of an action(lots of it)RPG(kinda)puzzle game. ;-) It's not your regular ""let's just wipe all of those mobs off the map to hopefully collect some valuable loot"", no.It's also more fun when played with friends, not solo.See youtube gameplay videos to learn about this game more.

												Lately I became a happy owner of 3 wireless game controllers. Naturally I started collecting (more like ""hoarding"") locally cooperative games. FORCED is one of the first i bought.It was on sale, and had excellent reviews, so being always on a lookout for some local mp games I thought I'll give it a try. It was an excellent purchase.My buddy and I have sat through it's levels on numerous nights, from dusk till dawn, and couldn't get enough.Surprisingly though game is easy at first but very challenging in longer run. First few levels are kinda slow-paced and trivial, You get to know your characters and their capabilities, and you don't really care for speedrunning, nor challenges, But what's brilliant about this game, is that it makes you go back and revisit levels and play them through perfectly, for sake of progressing through other hard levels.FORCED is a story of skill on a very interesting level. Game such as this- easy to play, hard to master- is not a very common thing these days, so I would recommend it to anyone. Playing with a buddy is greatly rewarding experience, so I'd recommend playing it in coop.			"

												A unique game that combines both fighting and puzzle-solving skills, with the icing on the cake of the co-op mode in which you can play with up to 3 friends to complete the levels, using both your wits and teamwork.At first i thought it could be another boring ""kill and solve this thing to proceed to the next level"" game, but damn i'm happy that i were so wrong.The puzzles are infact part that has been very well integrated into the battleground of your levels, it means that you will have to both fight and use a spirit with the shape of a sphere (your main tool to solve these puzzles) in order to beat certain kind of bosses, or just to open a door while running from a swarm of monsters or either avoid lethal environment present in the level, or even activate some for your aid.Even the fighting part itself is pretty nice, 4 different gladiators to choose from, each with their own weapons and unique skills that you will earn as long as you progress into the game by completing the levels themselves and their respective timer to beat, or some ""challenges"" which will test your skills furthermore.The requirements of this game are also kinda flexible, at the minimum of 2 GB ram i could've run this pretty smoothly, of course decreasing video quality, but with even more recent computers it can run decently at higher settings.One of the best university projects that made into Steam, made with the Unity engine. Definitely a worthy game.			"

												In FORCED, you are.. FORCED to fight for your life alone or with friends, with up to 4 player co-op with 4 different classes.In this game, you are tying to survive in challenges put on you by gods, made for their own enjoyment. You are helped by this soul to destroy them and free your people once and for all. In ages past, your race is alive only to fight and die for the entertainment of beings much more powerful than you. This will change.The four classes available are very different in what they do, being very solid to the class they represent.The first is ranged, using a bow and agility like abilities and based around lightning. Second, a strength based two handed class using fire and heavy but slow attacks. A rogue is the third, using fast attacks with evasion abilities. The last is a frost themed tank with defensive abilities and stuns to reduce the damage everyone in your party takes. You can choose between them whenever you want, in between levels and depending on what is needed.The game is a mix of a hack and slash with puzzle elements, really focusing on teamwork when played with others. I found the gameplay boring by myself, but when I played with a friend it was much more enjoyable. It can be very difficult at times, requiring a very good amount of game sense to dodge certain abilities and do certain puzzles. The bosses are very well thought out, giving a nice end to each chapter. They are also very unforgiving.The price is pretty high when not on sale, much too high for a game like this (its pretty short, being completed in around 8 hours) and I would recommend only getting it on sale. Make sure you get a friend who kinda knows what a hack and slash is, because its much more fun with another person, but having an inexperienced player makes it much much much more difficult.Overall, 8 hours of gameplay, hack and slash gameplay with puzzle elements and four classes. Don't buy on full price, wait for a sale.Personal Rating: 3/5			"

It takes a ton of communication with your teammates to get through some of the harder stages; might take 10+ retries just to get it right and not die.

												TLDR; Kind of tricky to get into, but with the right people it's a great puzzle-action-expericence.To be honest, first time I played (when I didn't know what I was getting into) I had a bad time. The genre-mix of puzzle-coop-arena-hack'n'slash makes it hard to wrap ones head around and certainly not for everyone. That said, when you give it a fair chance you will have a good time with this game.With three players we completed the first one and a half worlds and with the right mindset the game is really enjoyable. A lot of communication happening on the couch to figure out the levels.

												I wanted a game I could couch co-op with my girlfriend when we're in the mood for hack'n'slashing.Forced covered this perfectly, but also turned out to be so much more. The puzzles weave through the action seamlessly, creating a challenging but exhilarating atmosphere. The necessary tactical reconsideration after being defeated multiple times means replaying levels doesn't get boring. The levelling system is a cruel but perfect motivator, pushing you to visit forgotten torturous levels in the hope for one more gem.If you're playing by yourself, this will be a challenging but rewarding experience.If you're playing with a friend, this will be a heap of fun, but may cause you to slap each other.Very dissappointed the sequel will not be multiplayer.

												This is one of the few games in my Steam library that I have actually gotten my wife to play with me, so that gets it a positive review right there. But seriously this game is tons of fun. It's not exactly story-rich, but thats not really something you look for in this style of game. The four characters to pick from are a good representation of different play styles, and the variety of spells allow for some customization to that as well. The levels are more than just navigating through the map; the puzzles are very challenging at times, and the boss levels are actually tough. To me, those two points determine the success or failure of this style of game, and Forced is a winner in both categories.Pros: Challenging puzzlesTough boss levelsCons:Thin story (but seriously, who cares about that? That's like complaining that the Dota 2 lore is weak.)One more thing: go to BetaDwarf's site, and read about how while programming this game, they literally lived in part of a college that wasn't being used for almost a year before they got caught and kicked out! It's hilarious, and there's no way you won't buy the game after that. Better yet, buy the 4-pack and your friends will be FORCED to play with you!			"

												Pretty fun, unsurprisingly. But it's also not very addicting.I would compare this game to the old Gauntlet Legends games, but with more emphasis on puzzle solving and teamwork. The addictiveness of typical RPG's (like leveling up and collecting items) is kind of absent in this game. It's fun having the flexibility to select your skills and character at any time, but the skills are more like ""powerups"" that you unlock through the game.Overall, I think it has good depth, but the emphasis on puzzle solving makes it more casual, and not really a game to get hooked on.If I had to give it a vague rating, I would say 7/10 and recommended.

												ForcedThe game is good and fun with very interesting mechanics. It works well on my Mac and a big advantage is the full controller support. The game also features online and co-op modes as well as campaign, survival and arena and more to come.The game has good graphics and works well. It is worth the price it currently is. The game is good but could get more improvements.The game features four Gladiators with a class each:ArcherHeavy MeleeMedium MeleeLight MeleeEach class has weapons such as bows, shields, knives and axes.The game is good but could be better, anywhere from an:86-96/100			"

												This is one of the few games in my Steam library that I have actually gotten my wife to play with me, so that gets it a positive review right there. But seriously this game is tons of fun. It's not exactly story-rich, but thats not really something you look for in this style of game. The four characters to pick from are a good representation of different play styles, and the variety of spells allow for some customization to that as well. The levels are more than just navigating through the map; the puzzles are very challenging at times, and the boss levels are actually tough. To me, those two points determine the success or failure of this style of game, and Forced is a winner in both categories.Pros: Challenging puzzlesTough boss levelsCons:Thin story (but seriously, who cares about that? That's like complaining that the Dota 2 lore is weak.)One more thing: go to BetaDwarf's site, and read about how while programming this game, they literally lived in part of a college that wasn't being used for almost a year before they got caught and kicked out! It's hilarious, and there's no way you won't buy the game after that. Better yet, buy the 4-pack and your friends will be FORCED to play with you!			"

												Decent premise, unique gameplay mechanics, very tight controls plus co-op!  This is in the same vein as Magicka and Torchlight.  It has fewer bugs and much tighter controls than Magicka.  It is not nearly as deep in terms of skill tree etc as Torchlight and it is rather linear, but I do appreciate how the classes play off one another.  While torchlight will throw half a dozen usable skills at you which may do very similar things, FORCED lets you pick a couple skills and use them in what seems like a half dozen ways.  While I miss the stats of Torchlight, this is a very satisfying little game.  Get on sale if you can, but a thumbs up regardless.  8.5/10			"

												I thought my friends and I made a great team. I thought we could tackle this game like a well oiled machine, just as we have with any other game.No. I was wrong and for my arrogance I paid the price. But my friends and I are closer now for this game showed us the worst in eachother. Now our teamwork has skyrocketed.This game is hard. It will challenge you mentally and socially. Your ability to communicate ideas on the flaw will be sharpened or you will fail. This is a top down RPG with a stronger focus on classes that play off eachother and not so much on customization. You play through a quick and easy tutorial and then are introduced to the main area where you will select which level you want to play, much like Crash Bandicoot 2: Cortext Strikes back. This game has a large focus on cohesion and team work and less on hacking and griding through hundreds of monsters. I strongly recommend this game because I have never had so much fun getting my♥♥♥♥♥kicked.			"

Maybe I'm just bad, but it's so hard to juggle the puzzle aspects of the game while having to deal with waves and waves of monsters on you at the same time.  I also find the combat system itself to be fairly clunky.  It could be pretty nifty with other people, but playing online is hit or miss.			"

												20 June 2014It's with Great shame that i will advise not to bother with Forced yet.This is one of the greatest ideas and the game itself feels amazing to Play, so why the Negative?Forced is currently suffering from a Number of bad Game Design Choices and certain Bugs.Myself and a 2nd player reached the second boss with a few bugs but nothing horrible.We were pleased with the game and wanted to go further, but the the only reason we got as far as we did (level 2) is that the ease of the game covered the design flaws to that point. When the complexity (not difficulty) ramps up you begin to realise the flaws.    Flaw 1: The Camera is Horrible. This game is centered around it's co-op mode and it could be fun, but the game currently runs on a single camera system that always keeps you, you parner and or the boss in it's view. This is fine until the level complexity increases at which point characters can become very hard to see and the camera distances itself massivly. A bug also occurs here where you can actually walk your character off camera, and if your team members are fighting or solving in opposite corners you can't see youself at all, causing all sorts of issues. Local Camera is heavily needed, keep the player and the Boss (for example) and fix the edge Clipping, letting your party do as they please, Colored Player indicators are amazing in that situation to determine where people are, or even a very simple minimap if its THAT complicated.    Flaw 2: That leads me nicely onto this. The company have decided to op out of being able to walk through your enemys. This feels good until you encounter more then 2-3 at once, at which Point they surround you, locking you in place as you can't Push them. There are knockback mechanics and escape mechanics you can choose for your character. But now you find yourself in a position where fun or damage talents are unusable because you need movement survival and escape for when you get Trapped or Knocked back. This ALSO has a bug of its own, where EVERY ability that can be classed as an escape or survival can just ranomdly not work (Non more evident than using the shield weapons 'dash' ability, where it often takes you no-where, despite showing the animations of you moving, or even teleports you back to where you started)    Flaw 3: The gameplay lends itself to heavy hack and slash combat that's real fun. But more enemys means you quickly start to realise an issue. You can't Heal. 2/4 classes have heals, one is decent but on a LONG Cooldown (And interuptable via knockback), and the other is a heal over time effect with a speed boost, that whilst being mandetory is only useful for the speed, and requires spamming. The only other way to heal is the Poles you can drift the Orb over, which also require spamming in order to stand a chance. What this leads to is a Cluster F*** of enemys who synergise very badly and do nothing but follow you in a Lump. You find yourself unable to find many safe attack areas and spend the majority of combat running around avoiding the fight because you can't heal, or because the enemys invincible until the boss gives you a charge to defeat him (a charge you can only call to you, and that almost Kills you if it detonates nearby).All in all, this game has the potential to be one of the best co-ops out there, These issues however make it frustrating and awkward to play. After a lot of frustrating game mechanics issues, we left Forced behind at level 2. No amount of skill or learning will get you past RNG when your dash's, escapes and heals don't work. No amount of skill or enjoment will get you past camera fails, where you cannot see your Chatacer.Current? 3/10These simple issues Fixed? 7-8/10 EASILY.			"

												Recommended for the great control and game mechanics. The controls are on par with, or even succeeds, the best in the genre (which would be Diablo III I suppose)... they are very snappy. Ok, maybe calling the orb to your location could be smoother, that is the only thing I don't like.FORCED differs itself from every other ARPG by not having any grinding... and also not having equipment or experience points. If this is good or bad, I don't know, but it makes for a different game.You unlock abilities by completing trials. Each trial is a level with monsters and sometimes puzzles.You get one point for completing the level.You get one point for completing the level within a specified amount of time, andyou get one point for completing a unique challenge for each level.However, by not having the grind, there is a burden on the developers to provide a lot more content than normally in the genre. You finish each area much faster, and there is no value for the player in going back once the trials are completed... and the amount of content is OK, but not great.			"

												Forced is a great ARPG game that features 4 classes. Each class has different unlockable passive and active abilities.  You collect Gems  by completing various tasks within each level and that's how you level up in the game. You play as gladiators (the Storm Bow, the Volcanic Hammer, the Spirit Knives and the Frost Shield) who try to find their freedom and are aided by a spirit called Balfus. Balfus and the fact that you can use him by calling him toward you, lighting torches (and some other things) is the main reason this game stands out as it adds some great and diverse tactics that always serve towards your goal of earning the 3 Gems each level (arena) has to offer. The story is not this game's strong point as the plot is fairly simple. You play as a gladiator that has been FORCED (pun intended) to fight in arenas and Balfus guides you through it and you ultimately have to become a free man.All in all the game is really tactical and has a lot of strategic depth, granted you want to 100% it with friends.The multiplayer is really fun and I recommend you get 3 or 4 friends to play with. The game provides great puzzles and fun combat and with good co-operation it's bound to be a truly fun experience! I thoroughly recommend it!			"

												This was a failed attempt to merge 3 different genres: RPG, Top down hack-and-slash, and co-op puzzle solving. Its claim to fame is that players are supposed to cooperate in puzzle solving while being assaulted by waves of enemies. However, these systems work against each other. The AI enemies are not threatening enough to pose as a threat; they become a mere annoyance as you try to solve the puzzles to finish the level. Likewise, the co-op puzzles aren't very good either; instructions and tutorials are vague, but if you manage to guess-and-check your way to the solution, you'll find many levels that repeat the same type of puzzle. The co-op system doesn't really work with puzzles; you'll be fighting your friends for your idea of problem solving, instead of collaborating to complete the challenge. Connectivity is horrid, and although the game features 4 different classes, they feel somewhat similar against the same dull foes. 3/10			"

												This game's advertising, store page included, is incredibly misleading. I thought the game was going to feature a storyline, class-based gameplay, towns, characters, skill trees, etc--standard RPG co-op fare. INSTEAD, the game delivers a series of identical challenge-based arenas that might have been tolerable if it wasn't saddled with the most irritating gameplay feature I have ever had the displeasure of using: maneuvering a Zelda Navi-knock off around the arena into statues. You'll know you're doing it right when the terrible voice acting tells you so. Skip this one.			"

												For a game so focused on co-op play, its a shame that the multiplayer almost doesn't work at all for me or any of my friends. We either cant connect to each other, or the game in unplayable due to 4-5 second network lag. In this day and age these problems belong back in the mid 90's. I have seen the devs promise over the course of two months in each patch that they ""fixed"" network issues. No signs of any actual fixes. Avoid this at all cost.			"

												A fun and challenging co-op action/puzzle game. It's not really an RPG such as Torchlight II or Diablo, but is instead focused on having four different weapon classes to take on challenges known as ""Trials"". Completing each trial will unlock crystals that automatically unlock abilities across your weapons. You can change abilities and weapons before any trial, so no need to worry about taking the wrong things. There is also this orb that you can control and is the main aspect of pretty much all puzzles, and even some combat.Bought during sale. I really enjoyed this game.  Highly reccomended to play if you have any friends to play with, as it can be a bit dull alone. It performed better than my expectations, and was well worth my money.Obligatory pro's and cons:+ Really fun for 2-4 players+ Handles multiplayer scaling and progresses in difficulty very well.+ Fun combat and classes+ OH GOSH SO MANY ENEMIES TO KEEP IN CHECK WHILE TRYING TO CONTROL THIS ORB AND BEING CHASED BY A GIANT SPINNING DEATH LAZOR- A bit dull alone- Slight lagspikes at times during multiplayer (could be my internet, though)- Orb-controlling is slightly annoying when you're not co-operating properly in multiplayer.- OH GOSH SO MANY ENEMIES TO KEEP IN CHECK WHILE HAVING TO CONTROL THIS ORB ACROSS A GIANT SPINNING DEATH LAZOR FIFTEEN TIMESFinal score: 8/10 so far. Reccomended to buy during sales, but 14€ is worth it if you're into this kind of games.			"

												I absolutely adore this game. Plenty of people have already mentioned that it is a beautiful and challenging arena-style game, putting a lot of focus on teamwork and using different tactics to defeat different opponents while solving puzzles at the same time. But what I like most is that before every fight, you can choose anew which one of the four weapons (claws, shield, hammer or bow and arrow) you want to use and which passive and active skills you want to assign to it. The skills for all weapons are unlocked simultaneously, so you don't end up with a level 10 hammer and a level 1 shield. Neither will you regret your choice of character five hours into the game, or wonder if you shouldn't have focused on a different skill tree after all.My friends and I bought the game when it was on sale because of the sob story on reddit. Having played it now, I would pay full price for it without hesitating. I can only whole-heartedly recommend Forced to anybody!			"

												An evocative, beautiful, engrossing, and innovative Coop ARPG. I really enjoy it and the strategy involved with each class is great fun, not to mention the feel of the combat. I feel like it's actual combat, and not floaty button mashing like most ARPGs and MMOs. The daggers, shield, bow, and hammer are all very different and entertaining. I quite thoroughly enjoy their styles and how they synergize better for different occasions. Much deeper than it first appears, incredibly entertaining, and a must buy!High production value just like FORCED Showdown, a fantastic sequel to this great game.			"

												Overall: 9 out of 10I've been looking for a good couch co-op hack'n'slash for a while. So many are shy of satisfying.Fortunately, this one steps up.Levels and puzzles have more variation and inginuity to them that your typical game. It had me looking forward to the next map.Persistent character gain (skills and skill slots) unlock via gaining gems (basically exp). Beating a single map feels like a win. (i dislike the modern fad of games resetting every time)Levels are replayable and have very decent challenges to gain additional gems. I usually tend to avoid this in similar game, but found it reasonable and enjoyable in this game.Gameplay definitely encourages cooperation. while i think it would suffer single player, 2-player was a blast and it is supposed to tailor difficulty to the number of players.Additional notes: *aside from explosive level objects, there is no player damage (As i definitely prefer!).*difficulty is generally moderate to a bit challenging. The game sets you up to have consistent challenge, driving you to stay alive. You will die, but it will be fun trying not to. (I am definitely not into ""hardcore mode"" games. I want a reasonable challenge, not a chore or test in patience). A reasonable gamer should expect to die a couple times and then succeed on most levels. Children may have a hard time.*the game also feels much more polished than many recent games. (no pixel=style laziness, and no half thought out levels)			"

												This is a very challenging action game with a lot of puzzles in the mix.  Not the most difficult game you could be playing but still very difficult, Forced has you playing through a variety of challenges, from puzzles to boss battles to time limits.  This was my first game to get 100% achievement status on, and I got that status within 12 hours, so obviously, the game is short.  However, I have to admit the game was absurdly challenging and required a lot of patience and planning to play it properly.Keyboard/mouse controls are great, so I did not bother trying out a gamepad, but there is Xbox 360 controller support.  The space key is used for multiple actions, however, and I often had to restart levels because I accidentally called the orb when I was trying to skip dialogue.  Not a big deal, mind you.  I just found that slightly annoying.The game could be longer, and I wish there were more character customization options.  There are no visual customizations, but what I would really like to see are some more skill and stat choices.  I felt like only a few of the skills and stats were worth using.  Overall, the game was a lot of fun, and it is worth full price to me, but it is far from a perfected experience.			"

												FORCED has made my buddy and I quite happy.It feels like the developers had fun making the game, and it shows.The gameplay is very reminiscent of Gauntlet: Legends:+isometric camera+hack and slash combat+'level up' system in unlocking new skills+fast and well paced+The campaign is a little cheesy, but charming in it's own way-graphics aren't impressive+but it makes the game easy to run+and the art direction more than makes up for it+inspired and creative puzzles keep you thinking, but don't slow the game down enough to where you're bored and feel you're in a puzzle-only game.You're constantly working out defeating small waves of monsters, dancing around the map's pitfalls, and working out how to solve puzzles.-some of the challenges can be tedius and seem unresponsive, though it's more an issue of getting used to hit boxes and mechanics.I strongly recommend this game to small groups of friends who are looking for a fun and challenging multiplayer game.9/10			"

												Quality Action RPG: check.Quality puzzles: check.Quality skill and build diversity: check.Quality trolling potential: oh yes.There is only one main component for puzzles: a spirit guide you move around by pressing space. This means cooperation is EVERYTHING in multiplayer mode; this may be why you don't see many public games in the co-op lobby. It's just too damn easy to troll because everyone doesn't have their own spirit guide, but then that could make FORCED game-breakingly easy.Also, you have a lot of interesting options in how you build your character, but the game doesn't save your build which is pretty lame. If you could actually save your build without having to remember your ideal skill setup for each weapon, FORCED would be hands-down one of the best ARPG's in years. That aside, the game still has plenty to offer and is definitely worth your time. Plus it's incredibly fun to play with friends (that actually want to help you win the game, because it is so easy to troll).			"

												Forced is one of the best unity games ever made. an enjoyable coop game with some fairly difficult challenges and enjoyable combat. -pros: Sound and music           A plethera of interesting settings and objectives           Some tough and unique bosses           Good voice acting for what little there is           Spirit Mentor mechanics           Combat and progression are fun and encourage you to be creative           Local Coop-cons: The rogue and archer classes are far better than shield and hammer           Some of the completion times use to get crystals for new abilities are somewhat impossible to get           Playing with the M&K after an hour and a half or so starts lagging the game           no pvp It's still one of the best coop games to pick up and I would recommend to anyone.

												Forced is one of those games to make you rage uncontrollably. Its difficult, sometimes obtuse, and requires impeccable communication. And its damn fun. This isn't a game you can autopilot through. You have to be on your A game 100% of the time, which for me meant taking a break every couple of levels. However the completion of a challenge is extremely rewarding.Unlike many hack and slashers, this game does not focus on equipment or leveling skills, instead it provides skills that have distinct tradeoffs against other skills and may need to be optimized between levels. Your characters never get more health or do more damage, but they do get skills that combo together to do more damage. Art style was basic but competent, character readability was very good. Sound was basic but competent. I got this game as early access and was impressed by the improvement and overall progress that the devs accomplished. The game has online coop and local coop with up to 4 players. While you can play by yourself, its singnificantly more fun with friends.			"

												An evocative, beautiful, engrossing, and innovative Coop ARPG. I really enjoy it and the strategy involved with each class is great fun, not to mention the feel of the combat. I feel like it's actual combat, and not floaty button mashing like most ARPGs and MMOs. The daggers, shield, bow, and hammer are all very different and entertaining. I quite thoroughly enjoy their styles and how they synergize better for different occasions. Much deeper than it first appears, incredibly entertaining, and a must buy!High production value just like FORCED Showdown, a fantastic sequel to this great game.			"

												Yes, i've only played a little bit of this game but what I've played is amazing. If you are a fan of Gauntlet from N64 or the PS2/Gamecube one, you will enjoy this game a lot. It isnt just killing things endlessly, it actually has a fair amount of puzzles in it that can be quite challenging. 10/10 for sure, this is a game that is well made.			"

												Overall: 9 out of 10I've been looking for a good couch co-op hack'n'slash for a while. So many are shy of satisfying.Fortunately, this one steps up.Levels and puzzles have more variation and inginuity to them that your typical game. It had me looking forward to the next map.Persistent character gain (skills and skill slots) unlock via gaining gems (basically exp). Beating a single map feels like a win. (i dislike the modern fad of games resetting every time)Levels are replayable and have very decent challenges to gain additional gems. I usually tend to avoid this in similar game, but found it reasonable and enjoyable in this game.Gameplay definitely encourages cooperation. while i think it would suffer single player, 2-player was a blast and it is supposed to tailor difficulty to the number of players.Additional notes: *aside from explosive level objects, there is no player damage (As i definitely prefer!).*difficulty is generally moderate to a bit challenging. The game sets you up to have consistent challenge, driving you to stay alive. You will die, but it will be fun trying not to. (I am definitely not into ""hardcore mode"" games. I want a reasonable challenge, not a chore or test in patience). A reasonable gamer should expect to die a couple times and then succeed on most levels. Children may have a hard time.*the game also feels much more polished than many recent games. (no pixel=style laziness, and no half thought out levels)			"

												FORCED Co-op really shines.   It captures the 'feel' of a large scale MMO raid, without the time investment needed.  It requires close and constant interaction with your teammates and gets really tough, really fast.   If you like hard challenges and enjoy strong teamwork, this is a game for you.			"

												BetaDwarf guys decided to do something we haven't seen in a while; create a new genre, and they did it really good! Ok, not exactly new, it's more a hybrid between classic ARPGs and puzzle games, but it plays very differently from both...Actually, you play through many different ""arenas"" (trials) trying to pass their main challenge thus providing yourself a crystal (something like leveling)... Each trial, has 3 crystals, one for completing it, one for special challenge within it, and one for completing it in a specified time frame... Completing a trial is the part of the game you will have problems with, but completing the special challenge and time frame is almost impossible, and you will often need to level up (gain more crystals) and come back later to do it...Gameplay consists of classic hack-n-slash, fast reflexes for dodging and puzzle elements. Puzzles are not hard, but you're always multitasking, killing monsters, running and using a spirit Balfus to activate everything you need (be it healing, damaging or puzzle element)...Story is not spectacular, but it makes sense which is not easy for games like these, graphics style is nice and colourful (the latter can be a problem sometimes) and gameplay is interesting, dynamic and often frustrating...And, that frustration can sometimes be the biggest problem this game has... It is hard... extremely hard! Unforgiving, and painful... But, for the same reason really, really rewarding!Another downside is the necessity to use online feature even for local co-op?! Very bad :(Either way, it's a fantastic game, and easy recommendation!			"

												WoW inspired design. I think it's better to play it with a gamepad, but it's completely ok with keyboard and mouse. You play arenas by sequences, and finish by a BOSS arena.Interesting coop system where you have to trade the blue etheral ball with players.  Some little puzzles aspects, gameplay is focused on combat. Quick and effective skill system, with 4 class (each unique to pick, and swtichable). I had it for less than 5€/$, and it's worth every penny.			"

												Up front, Forced appears to do a good job of blending Guantlet arcade-style smash'm up with ARPG elements--added to with a touch of simple puzzle solving. Sadly, the game idea that Forced is needs much more...For Single-Players, or Solo-Play:The attempt at a story is more of a hinderance and should've been left out almost all together. The general direction in design is pretty spotty and left me feeling non-plussed several times as I attempted to learn one mechanic or another. The challenges are a bit too tightly setup, and are limited in scope. Thus, completing challenges unlocks abilites, and so you find yourself ""forced"" to wait for much good deal of the fun the game can provide, repeating the same stages over and over. Also, a key element in the game, your spirit mentor, could be so much more interesing. Last but not least, the graphics really could be better, indie or not.As much as Forced is a solid idea, the production quality and execution are both sadly lackluster...and that voice acting...yikes.

												This is a very challenging action game with a lot of puzzles in the mix.  Not the most difficult game you could be playing but still very difficult, Forced has you playing through a variety of challenges, from puzzles to boss battles to time limits.  This was my first game to get 100% achievement status on, and I got that status within 12 hours, so obviously, the game is short.  However, I have to admit the game was absurdly challenging and required a lot of patience and planning to play it properly.Keyboard/mouse controls are great, so I did not bother trying out a gamepad, but there is Xbox 360 controller support.  The space key is used for multiple actions, however, and I often had to restart levels because I accidentally called the orb when I was trying to skip dialogue.  Not a big deal, mind you.  I just found that slightly annoying.The game could be longer, and I wish there were more character customization options.  There are no visual customizations, but what I would really like to see are some more skill and stat choices.  I felt like only a few of the skills and stats were worth using.  Overall, the game was a lot of fun, and it is worth full price to me, but it is far from a perfected experience.			"

												The story may be terrible with voice acting to match but by god does it have a wonderful game underneath it all. Surprisingly well done co-op. The levels adapt to how many people are playing in such a way that it doesn't become a hindrance to have your allies nor does it become too easy. FORCED hit a wonderful balance; for the most part. There were a few parts that weren't as well thought out but overall this is a good time.If you're looking for a fun, challenging, cooperative game that involves killing things and solving puzzles; this is a good choice. Just... skip all the exposition and story. Which, coming from someone who will play through terrible games because they have an amazing story hidden underneath, is saying something.			"

												Forced is a interestingly unique Gauntlet Legends style top down game, with a lot of puzzle-esque elements and battles to attend to at the same time. You play as one of 4 unique characters each with their own strengths and weaknesses.It's heavily intended to be played with co-op, with each additional player a scaling difficulty setting. And much like Magicka, the ways in which each player dies is more hilarious than the last. Me and my buddies have had way too many laughs at the expense of our lesser game inclined friends, throwing them into the game with a basic knowledge base of the games mechanics and watching them try their hardest to no avail.Pros:+ Up to 4 player Co-Op fun+ Hilarious gameplay + Puzzle Mechanics incorporated into the battle system+ Unique characters that suits each playstyleCons:- Some challanges are extremely difficult and potentially unencouraging if you're an achievement hunterTL;DR:9/10 Top down Gauntlet Style Co-Op game with puzzle mechanics			"

												This is a pretty unique hack and slash game. There is no loot to gather or quests to complete. You run in and complete each dungeon utilizing 4 different classes. I think the game is best played in co-op as you need to pass the orb (Balthus) through objects across the screen to activate. I beat this playing locally with 2-4 people at a time. Difficulty and # of enemies scales with more players. Abilities of different classes complement each other pretty well (healing, taunting, invisibility, etc.). It was fun to play locally and would play through the game again switching up classes and abilities. I give this game a 9/10 but only for the reason that there is no DLC or updates. If there were more boss fights then this game could have more replayability. 9/10			"

												This is not a hack n' slash action game with puzzle elements. It's timed ball-moving puzzles with an action game built around it. Nine times out of ten your absolute first priority is moving a ball through the right hoops to give it the right property and perform the right action.Yes, enemies will spawn all the time. Yes, you have a skill system that let's you grow more powerful as you progress. Yes, there is some great synergy between the four classes if you go at it in co-op. Still, this never changes the fact that the only reason you want to become a better fighter is to be able to move your ball faster and safer while the enemies mob you.This makes it an action game where the combat is a nuisance to your great ball-moving fun times.Add to this that everyone in your party has the same ammount of control over this sphere of godly importance.

												Looks really good in the videos and pictures they have up on the steam store but like Frozen Synapse, the gameplay is pretty different than what you see, except in Forced's case, not as different than in Frozen Synapse. Forced is a team game where you try to complete puzzles and fight monsters to go on to the next level and progress through the storyline, however, there is barely any people online to play with. This sucks because most of the challenges that you need to complete require the help of another person. In short, this game is boring to play by yourself as you'll find the story is very linear and boring, while the actual gameplay, which is intended for group play, will be frustrating. I'd recommend playing this game in a group but if you're more of a lone wolf, don't pick it up. I got bored after the 2 days I spent with it. I would return it if i could since it's that much of a kiddy game			"

I can't stress enought that being FORCED (haha) to cooperate with teammates who may just be a ""little slow"" is terrible. Need a heal? Use the ball. Need to get an enemy from slamming your face into the earth? Use the ball. Two players need to do both at once? Yea, go f*** yourselves, only one person is making it out. Enemies aren't balanced and you'll find yourself repeating the same mission over and over becuase a laser beam keeps obliterating your pathetic, wimpy, body. Classes are crappy and you cant double up on them, nor does the game seem to give a damn whether or not the missions are completable. Save your money and spend it on something better, like a hammer to bash in your own skull if you decide to buy this. Only good news I have for this is that I'm not the one who bought it, and a friend bought a four pack. Note: if your friend buys this, bash HIS/HER head in instead.			"

												One of the better co-op games I've played. Definitely the best co-op indie game I've played. So awesome, in fact, that everyone I play it with avoids continuing to play with me! I get way too into it. But it held interest for my wife and I and a friend of ours for about 20 hours of gameplay before they didn't want to listen to my♥♥♥♥♥♥anymore, so that's saying something. Honestly, though, the element of interacting with each other via using the orb to interact with the environment in order to navigate the map and defeat creatures and bosses... it's ingenious (I realize that was a confusing sentence but perhaps it helps properly emphasize the complexity of the game). This game gets a solid 9.5/10. It would get a 10/10 if I could find the right friends to finish the game with! I really want to beat it!			"

Koop is even worse; you share one camera, so splitting up just a bit is really hard as you wont see what comes from the other side..			"

												I would closely reccomend this game to anyone who is both a fan of Dark Souls and of Diablo-ish games. The only way to make progress is to fire as much crap at the enemy that the can't advance towards your position, or get 3 other friends as meat shields to keep the enemy at bay by blocking the enemy's machetes with their foreheads.A lot of fun, unique gameplay, challenging in the beginning, but really difficult in later levels.

												Basically just a super dumbed-down version of torchlight or diablo 3. Fun for about a half hour because there is no exploration whatsoever (maybe I was wrong to assume there would be), no loot or gear, and only a handful of weapons with 1 special abilty each. You can only have 2 abilities equipped at a time. Maybe further in the game there's more stuff added but clicking on the small variety of enemies with the same 2 attacks in miniscule maps is just not enough to make me want to progress.Oh and the puzzle aspect is so basic, tedious and unrewarding that its not really worth mentioning.But hey, the graphics aren't bad.

												I am really surprised this game is rated this well.It has a lot of issues. Game for one is extremely difficult, but in the wrong way. A lot of anti fun mechanics, such as enemy attacks slowing you down.It has also been pretty buggy, have had frame rate drops and slight freezes, and this is on a semi decent computer.This single player seems way too easy, because I think you have infinite lives, as long as you don't die every 30 seconds.Meanwhile, in online play, it seems the complete oppisite, and very difficult to even get passed the first boss.The online/co-op game play requires a next level mindset, to all be able to equally control the ball on which the game is based around.Overall, I'd rather throw away the money spent on this game, then buy this game again. Do not buy, buy a good game, like Sprial Knights instead, oh wait, that games free. HMM.			"

												Refreshingly challenging and enjoyable.  The class and level designs are very well tuned for the sake of being challenging.  Each class has its own unique playstyle, and several builds to try and play around.  The level design clearly shows how much effort the developers put into this game because each and every single level is unique, and even unique with respect to the number of players.Don't worry about the difficulty.  I guarantee you can SOLO clear every challenge with only trial and error in game. (Yes, I have done that myself, without using any guide.)  Everything is managable if you know what you need to do and what you are doing.  Analyze the level, plan your action, customize your character build, then execute it with, um, some reflex.I truly recommend this game.  It has been so long since I last enjoy action/puzzle game this much, especially in multiplayer mode.			"

												My advice: DO NOT buy this game. The description is misleading: there is no RPG element to this game. Nor is singleplayer actually possible, despite it being an option: you simply cannot complete many of the challenges. All it is a coop puzzle arena, and even that I would not mind if the coop worked. It does not. Well, it does for a while, but if you get more than, say, 20 enemies onscreen at one time, something breaks in the game's netcode and everyone who is not hosting suddenly gets massive lag. Looks like GPU lag almost. So we tried different host. Same thing, the host always seeing the game fine, the guests getting 1-5 FPS during intense fights. TL:DR This is a multiplayer only game that does not support multiplayer, avoid at all cost.			"

												This game is acutally pretty cool!  I bought a 4 pack a while back and got it to a few people but anyone who doesnt have it yet should consider it...  It would be a killer title for the togetherness sessions my fellow bros in virtual arms.  One of the cool features of this game is the skill trees which allow you to manipulate how each of the 4 chars play making the gameplay experience more dynamic! BUY IT NOW!			"

												I bought this with a friend, and we had a blast. The payoff here is great; I received immense satisfaction from figuring out puzzles and performing insanely powerful attacks by coordinating with someone else. I firmly believe the best way to experience FORCED is with a dedicated partner or three so that you can complete the entire game with the same group of people.That being said, the puzzles are not very complicated at all. The true difficulty will be in attempting Challenges (finishing a level while achieving a specific goal) and Time Trials (finishing a level within a certain amount of time). Completing Challenges and Time Trials will require attempt after attempt after attempt. Beta Dwarf could have planned for this a bit better and not put as many long cut scenes in inconvenient places, but you can skip after a few seconds. Nevertheless, Challenges and Time Trials give this title some serious replayability. The game is fun enough to justify multiple (read: dozens of) consecutive attempts. I did not feel like I had completed the game until I had all 75 gems, which took roughly 47 hours.The online infrastructure can be a little rough. We had to exit out of the game and set it back up once every 1-1.5 hours or so due to game crashing bugs or unresponsive controls. However, it is important to note that the gameplay made it worth it. We kept coming back to it because of the addictive gem collecting and the fun, rewarding combat system. Mercifully, Beta Dwarf has insured that load times are minimal and creating/joining a game are very simple. This means setting up a game is a trivial affair, and the inconvenience of the (infrequent) game crashing bugs is mitigated. The combat system is the crux of the gameplay. Basic attacks leave enemies with marks. Depending on what abilities your character has, marks can cause special attacks to do more damage. The abilities you equip your character with (up to 3 active and 3 passive) give you perks and access to powerful attacks. Discovering synergy between passives and actives is one of the most compelling reasons to keep playing the game and adds strategy to what would otherwise be a mindless beat-em-up.Gems enable you to unlock abilities and equip yourself with more abilities. There are 75 in the game, three for each level (1 for beating the level, 1 for completing the challenge, 1 for beating the Time Trial). Every few gems you score, you unlock a new ability, which adds to the sense of progress throughout the game and encourages you to experiment with your new found awesomeness.It is important to note that the experience I am praising arose from me from having a friend that was dedicated to playing the game. I cannot speak to the game's singleplayer mode, but I also cannot see it providing the same sense of accomplishment, nor can I see it motivating me in the same way to attempt each level the insane number of times I did. It always helped to have someone to talk to and discuss strategies with. With that understood, I give it...8.7/10I hope Beta Dwarf keeps making awesome multiplayer games with over-the-top bosses.TL;DR : Great gameplay, adequate online connectivity, don't get it if you don't have friends.

												FORCED combines a few things that every player likes: undeads, powerful skills and a shiny blue bubble named Balfus that acts as your mentor. Featuring challenges, puzzles and four different classes to choose from, FORCED is definately worth a try. The story is a little obvious, but the tiny bits of sarcasm from Balfus as he blows up whatever stands in it's way (yes, including you) make it all worth it. Just my tip: play it with people you know. It makes it much much better. And you can blow them up if they annoy you. What's not to like?			"

												2013/11/01三人COOPにてプレイ、約7～8時間。(シングルは未プレイ)スクリーンショットではハクスラめいた構図ですが、トレハンの要素はなく、若干の成長要素があるものの純粋なアクションパズルゲーム。個人的にはMagicaにBlizzardイズムを合わせたようなゲームと感じました。プレイヤーは4種のRoleを選択し、しゃべる珠Balfusと協力しながら各Levelをクリアしていきます。各Role共通のシステムとしてMarker(コンボポイント)があり、上手く蓄積とフィニッシュを織り交ぜることで敵を殲滅していきます。戦闘バランス自体は絶妙で、各Roleの特徴をしっかり活かしてカバーしあわないと割とあっさり死にます……バカゲーかと思いきやかなりしっかりと作られたゲームで高評価ですが、ラスボスが機能停止するバグと一部リトライ時に3Pが地面に埋まるバグがマイナス。メインテーマとラスボスのBGMはかなりアツイ。個人的評価ゲーム性　　  85点ストーリー　 　70点BGM　 　　　70点コスパ　　　  55点バグや謎仕様-15点総合評価　　 70点(意外な良作、バグや謎仕様が惜しい)以下各Role-赤(ハンマー)MeleeのAoEやAuraがウリのパワーファイター。一定時間溜めることで強力なスイングができるが、移動スキルや脱出スキルが乏しい。-青(盾)ChargeやAoEStunを得意とする。一定時間毎にShieldがあがり攻撃をBlockできるようになるが、殲滅力に欠けるTankタイプ。-緑(ダガー)素早い攻撃とフィニッシュムーブの回転率で単体ダメージを叩き出す純粋なDPSタイプ。軽快な挙動も魅力。-黄(弓)得物通りの遠距離型。チャージショットや設置型のHeal、ChannelAoEなど強力な攻撃手段を持つ。 "

												Uppers: Intense, surprisingly intricate action co-op that works with three or four players and has a clever push-pull teamwork gimmick. In its best moments is like doing a really good raid in an MMO but without the hassle and poopsocking. Difficulty can be fine-tuned by doing challenges or choosing particular classes (eg no archer for Graw).Downers: Some strange performance issues - sometimes stutters a lot for no obvious reason, which can be a death sentence. Understandably cheap feeling to the presentation. Possibly a bit short. You will curse Balfus' name.The Bottom Line: Co-op improves any video game, and FORCED uses it in an effective, rather innovative way. It's tough but rarely frustrating, and features satisfying/comical teamwork. Grab your mic and fight the spitters.			"

												A fantastic couch co-op game! Not enough games have this feature anymore but nothing beats getting some friends around, hooking up 4 controllers and having a laugh. The game looks beautiful, especially as you get through the game and explore different scenery. You play through ""trials"" which are small levels which feature puzzles, combat and strategy. By completing these you earn crystals which you use to unlock skills with your character class which you can change at any time.  Each trial has 3 crystals to obtain, one for completing the level, one for completing a said challenge within the trial and one for compelting the trial within a time limit. Some of the challanges are impossible to get at a lower level which means you need revisit levels you have done before to increase your crystal total.A fun game with depth that I did not expect. I expected this to be twin stick shooter but turned out to be so much more!8.5/10			"

												So bought this game as a 4 pack with some friends. Totally worth it! It's a sorta hack/slash rpg'ish puzzle game. You control 1 of 4 different characters (hammer, bow, shield, daggers) each has their own set of skills, passives, and playstyles. You work with your friends to navigate innovative maps and figure out puzzles all with the help of a little orb spirt guy. Every person can call this orb to their position so it can be trolly if everyone is spamming. It requires a great deal of communication as it sometimes requires you to bounce the orb from person to person but without letting it hit objects (part of the puzzle). I highly recommend you pick this up in a 4 pack and play with friends over voice chat as it can be very fun, quirky, rewarding, and frustrating all in one but there is sense of accomplishment similar to when you first beat a boss in an MMO when you nail a puzzle while 3 of your friends are dead and you are teetering on life. The simple combat systems works perfectly as there is plenty of other object happening on the screen to keep you active and always thinking.There isn't a game out there like this on the market that I am aware. Anyone who plays with friends should pick this up.			"

It is currently broken for EVERYBODY (as seen here http://steamcommunity.com/app/249990/discussions/0/792923683637174491/) and therefore online coop just doesnt work. In fac it hasnt worked since October 24 2013 according to that forum post. Which is extremely disspointing because this game is such a great game and with coop could be an amazing game.

												Great game at a great price!  I've read some reviews that the co-op isn't playable, however I've only played the single player/campaign mode and find the game excellent!Forced combines Diablo-type hack & slash with some very unique puzzles and difficult challenges. The casual player could try and hack & slash their way through the game, but for more hardcore gamers there are times to beat and challenges to conquer on every stage which require a lot more thinking and strategy.  Another great feature is that most levels usually take under 5 minutes which make this a great game to sit down to if you don't have hours and hours to play.This is a really well made indie game that I'd say competes with the big market games.  In fact, I bought Diablo 3: Reaper of Souls about the same time as this and haven't touched D3 since.			"

												Forced is a neat little Action RPG puzzle couch co-op game. Maybe a cross between DotA/LoL + WoW + Portal 2. In short you are solving puzzles in a dungeon/instances with your partner while mobs attack you.Imagine sitting together with your 360 controllers (or on skype) running around avoiding a laser beam while trying to kill mobs that are attacking you. Meanwhile your co-op partner is aligning Balfus (a floating orb) in a straight line towards you and screaming at you to pull the orb so that it goes through a shrine that stops a deadly mists that is slowly filling the dungeon. You pull the orb towards you but just when the orb is about to turn off the the mist your co-op partner gets pinned by a mob he didn't avoid and needs to call the orb back to him to free himself. Now the mist is out of control and your coop partner is low on health. This is a basic scenario in Forced.The game has several dungeons/levels that you have to complete. Each dungeon rewards a total of 3 crystals. One for completing the dungeon, one for a speed/timed run and one for completing with a special requirement (e.g no healing, not getting hit by a special mob, etc).Before each dungeon you choose to play one of four available classes. A warrior, rogue, hunter and a tank. Every class has two talent trees: One tree for active talents and one for passive talents. As you earn more crystals you unlock more of your talents.  You get to choose 3 active and 3 passive skills. That means that you have 4 buttons to press: One for basic attack and three for active talents.This is a game where you can play competitvely and min/max what class and what spec to play for eac dungeon. make a tactic and practice exucuting it impeccably or you can grab a 360 controller and have fun with your girlfriend on the couch.

												Overall, this game is an interesting and perfectly satisfying single player experience. The difficulty follows the learning curve pretty closely, so that the game feels consistently new and challenging without getting (too) frustrating. I've never tried coop, which is probably for the best since it doesn't seem to work for many people (although I'm going to use this opportunity to add another voice to the crowd reminding everyone that a fair number of people *have* gotten it to work fine. Sometimes you just need to learn some basic networking to get multiplayer games to run </lecture>)			"

												In co-op, this game is amazing. Simple enough to pick up quickly but has enough depth to keep your attention, whether just trying to get through the levels for the first time or going back for the challenge objectives and the time objectives, there is a lot of fun to be had here with a friend or 3. Graphics are pretty enough, and the progression is handled well. Analyzing the mission and changing your loadouts to best suit what you are going for (speed run, certain objectives, etc) has me coming back for more every day. Highly recommend, if you don't have any friends playing it is highly worth buying the pack and giving someone a copy just to play with. Lots of fun and encourages good communication and problem solving to play at a high level.			"

												Forced is a neatly polished game which will bring a couple of hours of fun with you and your friends. At first the game teaches you the simple mechanics as you learn each of the classes. As you progress into the next world, the game does get harder, with enemies being tougher and puzzles more challenging, but as you master that world, the next is even more difficult, where you and your friends have to work very hard to complete each challenge. Has a very nice levelling and upgrade system, could use some work, balancing, etc. The only problem I have, is Singleplayer and Multiplayer difficulty scaling. Want to play past the second world by yourself? Well that is near impossible. I am not sure if this has been fixed yet, but BetaDwarf should consider to make the game easier (lower enemy spawns, health, damage, etc.) when by yourself. Also I've noticed an uneven scaling with two to three to four players. I believe three is the easiest. Other than that you'll probably snag a good 5-20 hours based on how much you enjoy it, and if you have a small group of friends this is a great game to spend those hours together. Everything is polished, the graphics, the sound, which has exceptional music. 7.5/10, would be a 9/10 if made easier for singleplayer.			"

												FORCED is a fantastic Co-op game! It requires everyone to be light on their fight, heavy in their weapons, and fast in their mind. It Forces (get it? heh) all four players to work together to accomplish their goals and pass through the levels, more so than most games. I would Definitely reccomend to friends to play!			"

												Extremely challenging & addicting game! Just beat campaign for the first time after 30 hours of gameplay. Although there are tons of issues with online multiplayer, if you manage to get them straightened out it's a fantastic game to play with friends. The levels are very well designed and your are forced (no pun intended) to strategize in order to complete them. Also every level is unique and unforgettable (although that may be because you have to play each one a dozen times to beat it!). Not sure why it only got a 72 metascore... I would think it should be in at least the mid 80's.			"

												FORCED is an action adventure puzzle game that holds your attention for a long time. I have  about 2 hours clocked and I have enjoyed every second. The only problem is the Co-op sucks. It is currently broken for EVERYBODY (as seen here http://steamcommunity.com/app/249990/discussions/0/792923683637174491/) and therefore online coop just doesnt work. In fac it hasnt worked since October 24 2013 according to that forum post. Which is extremely disspointing because this game is such a great game and with coop could be an amazing game. So be warned, the game is amazing, but if your looking to play a coop game with your friends, this isnt for you right now.			"

												TLDR at the bottomThis will be my first and a fairly short review that hopefully gets the good points of this game across. This game is awesome. It is an indie game that will test your friendships on the highest level. It plays similar to diablo, with the need for reflexes like you're playing an FPS, and the mindpower for puzzle game. The thing that I found most pleasing in this game is the difficulty.In the past (NES/SNES/Sega) there was no difficulty level, you just dealt with what they gave you. This game can be done the easy way and still have a good time, but if you choose to go the hard route... the game will make you cry. This game is so pleasingly unforgiving and the developers as well. Having met a few I love their mentality towards the game and makes me a happy owner. For the people complaining about the problems. BF4, Skyrim, CoD or any other AAA title that had bugs up the yin yang and still people applauded how amazing it was. Not to say those games aren't good and that the bugs weren't fixed but why is an indie developer somehow excluded from being forgiven when they fix the bugs. -The game is a lot of fun, developers are awesome people with an awesome story, they actively attempt to fix bugs, challenging as heck, SPIRIT BLADES 4 LYFE!

												FORCED (Slightly Better Edition) is a fun combat/strategy multiplayer game with up to 3 friends, and I recommend it!+ Combat is fast-paced and simple, with enough difference in the enemies' approaches to keep it engaging.+ Puzzle elements CHALLENGE players to work together and think through obstacles.+ Different elemental archtypes to choose from (ice, earth, fire, air) with multiple skill choices to equip as you level up.- Occasionally blindsides the players with problems that require trial and error (or pure luck) to solve.- Puzzles become frustrating without good communication and coordination between teammates.- Low replayability.

												This turns out to be a 'puzzle fighting' style game.  Each individual challenge tends to be fairly well crafted with tricks and particular paths that are easier or harder.  Although it has a leveling system, the challenge based experience can leave you feeling stuck, and there is no actual grinding that can be done to unstick you.  Even so, failing the occasional stuck feeling, the game is enjoyable and worth a try.  I have been unable to actually land a multiplayer game (friends played at a different time than I did, and randoms never accept multiplayer requests), so can't really comment on that experience other than to say if you didn't bring your own friends with you, you probably won't be playing this way.Challenging, with interesting mechanics and good overall quality.Give it a try.

It would be nice to use a D-pad instead of the sticks.- Still crashes every so often, which isn't a problem in any other games I've played.- So far, I can only get local co-op to work with 1 gamepad, and 1 keyboard+mouse. It would be nice to have both players on game pads.Things are starting out slowly, which I hope pick up soon, with larger areas and more variety in combat. Other than that, so far the game-play is good. There's a good balance for single screen co-op (single screen, wepon loadout, tightly focused levels), and the spirit ball mechanic is a good team-building idea even though at first it seemed like a bit of a gimmic.

												I can't speak to how this game plays in a co-op setting, as of July 2014, there is no one left playing this game anymore - but I can speak to its single-player campaign.This game is simply not fun if you play by yourself.   Everything is balanced for multiple players, after the first couple trials, the game simply becomes tedious if you're trying to do everything on your own.While I appreciate a good challenge, this game focuses on the wrong place.  The puzzles are brain-dead easy, and the single-player challenge simply comes from throwing an ever-increasing amount of mobs at you.   If it was possible to out-run these enemies and kite their numbers down, it would be manageable, but as they all move faster than you and, in many levels, respawn faster than you can kill them it makes the singleplayer game completely unenjoyable.

												Games has poor hit detection and isn't meant for single player. I couldn't even make it through the Hall of Trials 4th section because all the enemies move at least 3x as fast as the character. Also, the game mistakenly assumes that you are playing multiplayer game even though I am standing there alone in single player. It still uses plural forms. Really? You couldn't be bothered to change the text or the audio? I couldn't be bothered to play it again. I was expecting something better than this. Why does the character move so much slower while attacking? Realism? This is a fantasy game! I haven't tried the multiplayer, and I am not sure if I want to after my poor first impressions from the single player. Borderlands also gave me this problem. I regret buying the 4-pack of this game as I don't really want to share it with anyone else.I might change my review if I play it again in the future. For now though, as a single player experience, this game leaves MUCH to be desired. I'm going back to Torchlight II.			"

												I can't comment on the gameplay because I bought this game for local coop and couldn't even start the co-op campaign. It is completely unplayable with two wireless Xbox 360 controllers.Some issues I ran into while trying to play this game:* The first splashscreen just has a text label to ""Continue"". Pressing a button on the controller causes it to be overlayed with a ""NO_BUTTON"" text label* Unable to select a two-player co-op with a controller, only 3 or 4. Workaround: select with a mouse* Pressing ""A to join"" on a second controller causes a player to be addded to the game twice controlling two characters at once. Yes, it's as dumb as it sounds. Workaround: Force 2 player coop (see item 1)* Once a proper two player coop is selected, each player has different controller setup (and they are not configurable). Player 1 has ""fire"" set to RT, and Player 2 has ""fire"" set to D-pad right.* I can't enter the settings menu from the main menu using a controller* A lot of pop-ups have placeholder messages for ""No translation for language"" even though the rest of the game is in EnglishThis is far as I got before I gave up. I sincerely hope that the singleplayer or online coop is amazing, I might try them out one day.			"

												This game is so fun, so challenging, and SO BROKEN. Impossible to play with 3 or more people online.  There are a multitude of game breaking bugs including: one more or players unable to connect to the server, one or more players controls randomly stop working, or one or more players get lost on their own screen due to camera malfunctions.  Such a shame, because this game has so much potential to be great: its beautifully crafted, excellent puzzles and gameplay (when it does work), but sadly many levels require 3 or more people to beat, and seeing as how you can't get 3 or more people in one game, thats out of the question.

Also there are this big connection issues onces in a while. Playing it alone is worse than watching old people have sex. And if u want to play with someone, then u better have a friend with this game or buy one for a friend u know u can play with. gl hf			"

												Played with a full 4 players, and while it was fun at first, the puzzle elements quickly became too fiddly and the overall level of difficulty too great.The main puzzle mechanic is that there is a companion character who is basically a glowing ball, which you move around only by calling it to where you are currently standing with a button press; in this way it will only move point to point in straight lines.  Moving the ball over various level objects actives them; you flip switches, move crates, and activate temporary buffs for your character this way.  However the problem is that you have to be quite precise with these movements; the ball is often quite small in relation to the screen and must move exactly over the thing you want to active.  This demands far too much precision in a game where you're often trying to focus on combat at the same time, and dealing with an isometric camera that is frequently zooming out to fit all characters on screen.  If the ball had a larger radius of activation, it would go a long way to making the game more entertaining than frustrating.The level of precision required is the main source of the game's excessive difficulty.  The combat by itself is reasonable, but almost everything after the first set of levels requires managing the ball to solve puzzles while fighting at the same time and the game isn't rewarding enough to make investing the effort feel worth it.

												The bugs in this game are impressive. Between the repeating ""Space Space Space"" and controller support dropping out until a restart, it's kinda hard to tell which one is my favorite. That's a lie. My favorite bug make progression difficult for some people.... So I started playing this with 2 friends and after a few hours, we went to bed having enjoyed the mechanics that make this game challenging. We were eager to get back into it the next night but I had errands to run. So my friends used the game's built in profile system to create a new profile so they could play fresh without me and switch back when I jumped in. Well, that worked fine until they switched back and their crystal count dropped to zero. Thanks to some complaints on the forum, we solved the problem easy and kept playing till we reached the final(?) boss and lost repeatedly.In case someone else has the same problem, here's a rough explanation of the easy workaround: First, go the data folders on the affected machines for the game and set them to readonly. Then on the master machine(the guy who didn't swap profiles), use HFS webserver to host the master data folder. Then, simply run the following c# code on the effected machines(might need to changes some variables) before you start the game every time. This way, the master machine keeps progressing in the game and the other machines get a copy of that progression before the game starts. Easy as pie!C# code(I ran it in Linqpad):string userFolderName = Directory.GetDirectories(@""C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\userdata\"").FirstOrDefault();string mainDir = userFolderName + @""\249990\"";string profilePath = mainDir + @""\remote\PROFILE_"";string cachedPath = mainDir + @""remotecache.vdf"";bool readOnly = (new FileInfo(profilePath)).IsReadOnly;(""ReadOnly:""+readOnly).Dump();(new FileInfo(profilePath)).IsReadOnly = false;(new FileInfo(cachedPath)).IsReadOnly = false;var profileSplit = File.ReadAllLines(profilePath)[0].Split('*');string steamId = profileSplit[1];string steamName = profileSplit[2];(steamId + "":"" + steamName).Dump();//profileSplit.Dump();var client = new WebClient();client.DownloadFile(""http://192.168.0.108/249990/remotecache.vdf"",cachedPath+""1"");client.DownloadFile(""http://192.168.0.108/249990/remote/PROFILE_"",profilePath+""1"");File.Delete(cachedPath);File.Delete(profilePath);File.Move(cachedPath+""1"",cachedPath);File.Move(profilePath+""1"",profilePath);var crypt = new System.Security.Cryptography.SHA1CryptoServiceProvider();var allOldBytes = File.ReadAllBytes(profilePath);int oldBytesLength = allOldBytes.Length;var oldSha = String.Join("""",crypt.ComputeHash(allOldBytes).Select (x => x.ToString(""x2"")));(oldBytesLength + "":"" + oldSha).Dump();var newProfileSplit = File.ReadAllLines(profilePath)[0].Split('*');string wrongSteamId = newProfileSplit[1];string wrongSteamName = newProfileSplit[2];(wrongSteamId + "":"" + wrongSteamName).Dump();string allText = File.ReadAllText(profilePath);string fixedText = allText.Replace(wrongSteamId, steamId).Replace(wrongSteamName, steamName);File.WriteAllText(profilePath, fixedText);var allNewBytes = File.ReadAllBytes(profilePath);int newBytesLength = allNewBytes.Length;var newSha = String.Join("""",crypt.ComputeHash(allNewBytes).Select (x => x.ToString(""x2"")));(newBytesLength + "":"" + newSha).Dump();string allCachedText = File.ReadAllText(cachedPath);string fixedCachedText = allCachedText.Replace(""\""""+oldBytesLength, ""\""""+newBytesLength).Replace(oldSha, newSha);File.WriteAllText(cachedPath, fixedCachedText);(new FileInfo(profilePath)).IsReadOnly = readOnly;(new FileInfo(cachedPath)).IsReadOnly = readOnly;Jokes aside, it's a fun game but if you hit a rough bug, you might end up rage quitting for good.

												I had high hopes for this game and was sorely disappointed. The levels are fun and it encourages good teamates. Some abilities are completely worthless but it is well made how each person has a different role to play and is quite different. The problem is based off horrible limiting/restricting design decisions. For no apparent reason, they take the moronic ""super meat-boy"" approach of screwing you over if you can't beat the level in the exact way they intended you to. The levels are hard enough in themselves and take 5-8 minutes each. You only get new abilities for beating levels, and for beating in in a time limit they choose and by completing a challenge they made up. The first problem is you don't know the challenge till after you beat the level which shows how much they want to artificially inflate game length by having you replay the exact same level multiple times. The time limits and challenges are not even remotely fair or achievable without dozens of attempts of the exact same level, of 6 minutes or so, spending hours on a single level. Why would you not want someone to get to use abilities you made for characters? Biggest problem is that althought you can move through the entire game gaining the crystal for beating the level, the final boss requires a stupid amount of crystals, basically making my entire playthrough a waste of time because I couldn't beat the levels in the exact amount of time developers and tryhards do.........If people like repeatedly playing levels over and over give time limits and challenges that help for leaderboards and rankings, idiots eat that Sh-it up. But don't keep me from getting abilities and from beating the game without letting me know beforehand. Amateur game-making at its finest. Why not have the best of both worlds......it's just ridiculous how a college kid thinks of better game design and implimentation than game developers.....guess the one of the hamsters in the wheels got loose. 5/10			"

												I was super-excited when this game came out because I'm always looking for great co-op games to play with one of my friends. We played this for a few hours but eventually abandoned it when we got to a level we couldn't get past.The game does a good job of forcing players to actually cooperate. But we found that when we only had 2-players that the levels became brutally hard. A single death meant all of the enemies homed in on the last man standing. Add in a few levels with insta-death from lazer-like barriers and we reached a level (after only 2 hours; the Slarth boss-fight) where the difficulty ramped up past our skill.A quick check of Steam stats shows that only 19% of players beat Slarth.It stopped being fun, so we moved on to other games. Maybe it is better with 4 players? Or maybe we're just not good enough (but I've played a decent amount of Super Meat Boy so I'm not TERRIBLE). Either way, the frustration exceeded the fun for us.

												FORCED: A game to improve your relationship with your significant other.Ever get that feeling that your communication is lacking with your significant other?  You just wish there was a better way to work out *how* to talk to each other, and really be heard.  Well, here is the answer!  FORCED!  There is nothing to improve a relationship like coordinating where to pass a flaming ball of doom, who should focus fire on the boss and who should be on adds, or call out for your partner's help when you are getting overrun and have them valiantly come to your rescue.  This game *forces* you to work with your partner, to be aware of them at all times, and to understand that the survival of all parties involved is not only important, but practically integral to the success of many levels.  You will die.  You will die again, and again, and again.  There will be chronic confusion of who Balfus should be following.  There might be an unsavory word uttered under someone's breath here and there.  There might even be a declaration of, ""This isn't worth it, I quit.""  To which you will respond, ""We *can* do it!""  It will be a rollercoaster of trials, testing your patience and your sanity, but once victory is achieved it provides an addictive feeling of fulfillment that pushes you, no, *forces* you forward.  You will find yourself strategizing, trying different techniques, characters and relying on your reflexes to get you through the truly chaotic portions.  You will share your frustrations with your partner, but you will also rejoice together.  One precisely placed heal will mean the difference between life and death for your partner, or that perfectly timed shout out for Balfus to be passed through a totem determining the victory of the level.  You will fall asleep with images of FORCED running through your mind, working out newly improved strategies for your next session.You will then inevitably understand that the most important rule of FORCED, and of relationships, is:United you will stand, divided you will fall.

												Introduction:The Story behind this game is about a town of humans who spend their lives training and work for the God. Throughout the year they send warriors from their village to go deep into the realms to battle the guardians and try to defeat them, but none prevailed. After a long await four warriors came forth from the villages and started to slay the Guardians as one god tries to guide them through the realms or chaos. As the Warriors it's your destiny to send them to the right path.Graphics:Throughout the game the graphics for this game have been great quality and had had some amazing sceneries, not a lot is need to play this game and with a lot more room for improvement I wouldn't put any bad remarks towards this game just yet, with the design and the equipment, to the boss and bad guys. The game shows the player it can be like WoW and Rift, full of imagination and fantastic detail in the structuresGame play:The game play in this game was very easy to understand, with the first few levels explain how certain objects word, the game challenges you through the levels, making sure you are fully aware of what certain things do and how to stop them. The game is based on a third person play and you can roam around the game with either a keyboard and mouse or a Controller.  for those who are PC gamers keyboard and mouse was easier for the bow master, but I personally liked the controller because of close combat so try and find something that'll suit your style. I play Volcanic Hammer and controller was my thing, but when it came to bow I had to switch. The detail in the inventory and explanation were simple and this is what a game need as for beginner people feel comfortable knowing what's going on throughout the start and not be pressured and button mash. Each character has different abilities and fighting styles, if you read the spoiler then you understand what I mean. But try and find the right warrior for you and play with him till you get used to his abilities and powers.Advantages:This is one of the funniest Coop RPG games I played, with me and my mates we flied through the levels and got more excited as the game went on, the boss and ideas that were put into the puzzles were genius, as well as hard. this game is good at both Single player and Coop. with coop play the game is at its best, you can roam and fight and work together to counter every possible bad guys and boss, but they also help you with strategies as all weapons will be in your arsenal so go and find the best ways to different each level.Disadvantages:As much as I love this game, there are a few bugs and downers on this game, one of them is the servers, through the game it won’t let you access other servers or game plays when you play coop, also when you host a game is sometimes freezes the game and closes the game down, making you restart from your last checkpoint, luckily this doesn't erase you data and you keep all you equipment, but this will frustrate you big time, even if your near completion or in the middle of a boss battle.Overall:I believe that even though this game has a lot of problems with it, I'm going to give it faith and say it's still a great game, the Developer is personally speaking to me and with anyone else who is in trouble and will help you throughout the game. For now I will give this game a 6/10 due to the bugs, but I recommend this game in the future.  With the designers fixing every problem and working hard on the patches this game will be a major success in the future. So don't get dishearted just yet. With the future patches I believe this game can hit 9.5/10 in my books as long as the serves get fixed and the game play continues.Thanks you for reading and peace out :)			"

												Forced is a multiplayer heavy game. i really dont recommend playing alone, as it is not as much fun and also some of the challanges are very hard or even impossible without other people helping you control the orb/ fight the mobs.it would also be pretty cool to see each class have their own ""combo"" with each other that can change your playstyle if you change class instead of just holding the attack button and use your skill when enemies are fully marked (marks is a system where if you hit the enemies they will get mark, more marks=more damage to skills)gameplay is basically a multiplayer coop puzzle action rpg game, where gems act as ""levels"" , more gems you have means more skills/shortcuts are unlocked for your character. i dont really like the only 3 shortcuts at max, but maybe this is so the game wouldnt be too easy, as the skills dont have that long cool down.my favourite part is probably the bossest. each have their own way to kill and each works differently, you may need to swap a few classes to see which is most efficient for which boss. graphics are pretty good, not in a high res way, but it looks pretty unique in the enemy/your character design, though i wish there is more customization done for your character other than picking out which skill to use.fun game, even more with friends. get it if you have friends to play, if not then they do have lobbies for that but it seems like the servers have wobbly connectiong or net code because it connects whenever it feels like, only when its a private game your friend or you make will work. at least, thats what happened to me. this will probably get fixed soon.

												Fun if you can get it to work, a difficult task in Linux. I partially blame steam for using a 32-bit client.UPDATEThe linux difficulties are mostly gone from updates, but controller support is broken. In other games the button layout might not be quite right, but they are sill playable. In Forced for Linux, directional controls are misidentified, making it impossible to play.			"

												I was really expecting something good out of this title, with all the positive steam reviews and the promise of a fun puzzle-y RPG-y Co-op experience. What I got was a poorly optimized game with iOS game-style level design and netcode issues. One of the primary mechanics in the game is this orb which each player can call to their location. It seems all puzzles, if you can even call them that, are based on this mechanic. The problem here is that these puzzles are all really uninventive and quite frankly boring, and using the orb for all puzzles doesn't make for a rewarding and interesting experience. The level design reminds me of iOS games because of its infatuation of having really short, play-while-you're-on-the-toilet missions which give you a ranking between 1 and 3 depending on how well you did. One for completing the level, one for doing some special thing, and one for doing it quickly. I really think this is a horrible practice for PC games and I was hoping for some Diablo-style adventuring which would fit the game a lot better than how it is now.These problems combined with the shoddy netcode (this was playing with 3 others with pings varying between 10-30ms) lead to a really unresponsive and disapointingly mediocre experience.

												Forced is like some insane mashup of an action RPG and basketball. The central mechanic of using a spirit-ball that much be passed around between players and used to activate, destroy or otherwise do anything important is an excellent co-op mechanic that's a ton of fun.On the flip side, however, network play can be quite buggy, our party had several challenges fail to reset properly, issues connecting to hosts, and even a couple instances of two players being assigned to control of the same avatar.These issues will hopefully be solved in future patches and the good news is that once you get the game running with everyone connected, it generally works quite well.If you don't mind dealing with a few network bugs and have some friends to play with, Forced is an interesting and challenging co-op experience that isn't like anything else you're likely to have played.

												Not gonna lie, the single player isn't all that great, but it really isn't made to be a single player game. Hook your rig up to a TV, get some controlers set up, and invite a few friends over and you'll be in for an absolute blast with this game. It's been half a decade since I've had this much fun playing a game with a group of friends. There are many games that have you playing in the same virtual space but not really playing it together. This game's ingenious design facilitates working together with the core mechanics without feeling like gimmicks. Call your friends over, you must play this game.			"

												The game is really enjoyable, pretty high difficulty. I really like that 'difficult' means in this game - abilities to avoid, and puzzles to solve while avoiding enemy abilities. In d3 for example they think that difficulty means doubling HP and DP's. Here difficulty is really something what you can enjoy.That's really rare for me to die in games and what's more that the game requires me to change my tactic for especially passing level.			"

												This game is a puzzle co-operative game, you can play it single player or coop. The graphics are good, the performance is good, there isn't any stuttering, there aren't freezes. There aren't an excessive amount of controls to get used to, this game compared to other coop games like magicka has better coop synergy, partially because of its puzzle based nature. You can move and fire your bow which is a positive aspect about this game, I appreciated this because i've played Alien Swarm and i like the movement controls. There's an ability to switch between controller and keyboard and mouse and the support for controller is great. The negative aspects of this game is that people can't join while your playing, if they do then you have to restart your game if you want them to play, you can't make private matches, if someone leaves the game then you are taken back to multiplayer screen. I don't find any technical problems with this game.			"

												Unless you like the party game dungeon crawl genre, I'd suggest skipping this, or waiting until it's fully finished. The glitches in the current version make it nearly unplayable.Me and three friends tried playing a few games together - all of us had issues at different intervals using/equipping new skills, which then doesn't allow movement onto the next stage. Start over a new game.Second try we experienced the same issue with different players. Third try I became de-synched during a match so the best I could do was attempt to keep up while my character slowly glitched around, lagging behind the party who were still fully functioning. I'd have to say this caused more unintended hilarity and fun in the game than when the game was running smoothly.Toss in a few random crashes, and we haven't really bothered playing this since.With a bit of polish it might be fun, and the graphics are ""ok"" but not awe inspiring or even surprising. The level design is fairly straight forward, and the puzzles were decently challenging while intuitive, rather than being frustratingly obtuse, which is a good plus.			"

												Ok, here is a review which shouldn't be written by me as I don't have the play time to make a fair judgement, but it seems no-one else has discussed this.5 words? FORCED. Seems good, no weight.Okay, now for the lengthy bit.... What do you mean by 'no weight'? well, that's pretty straight forward really, every strike, stab, stomp and shot you perform has no impression of impact in the sound or visual effects, it doesn't feel like you are striking down someone to the pits of the earth, it feels like you are pushing them over so they gentle fall onto a bed.Now, while this may make sense for the assassin-type character, this should not be the case with the warrior wielding a freaking HUGE FLAMING AXE.Don't get me wrong, the art-style is nice, the puzzles are cool, the soundtrack would be nice if you didn't have to choose between silence or being deafened and perhaps that's also the reason the fighting sucks, you have to turn the game sounds so far down in order to be able to hear your friends that you miss out on any subtle sounds such as impacts and also miss out on the soundtrack. The guide however? Oh, he'll violate your ear-drums silly if you don't shut him up quickly.Overall, FORCED probably isn't that bad, but it just wasn't mine or my friends' cup of tea. It was just boring, and trust me, I really wanted to enjoy it.			"

												When I first got this game it was plagued with all sorts of issues. The main issue that I had was that while playing a game hosted locally it would claim that I lost connection. If you check out the reviews from earlier in the games life there are plenty of other networking issues that arose, along with other bugs. Fortunately the team that developed this game has been on top of it releasing patch after patch. At this point the game is a great hack'n'slash puzzler. Basically Gauntlet with less killing and more complicated puzzle levels. The class and leveling system are a lot of fun and Balfus, your mentor and spirit guide, is a lot of fun. I only play local co-op so I can't speak for the online co-op but I did notice that the game list is usually fairly sparce, but if you have a few friends this is a great game.			"

												As a someone who codes for a living and earned a degree in game design there are a few expectations I have. The biggest is a working program. I can overlook bugs, I can overlook the occassional crash. What I cannot do is spend hours trying to get something to work. This game seemed right up my alley considering I have very little time to game; relatively quick levels, freedom to revisit levels, and fairly simple controls (good for when I go weeks without being able to game.)The problem I'm encountering is constant crashing, every time I played the game it crashed during a fight. Out of the 100+ games I have on Steam this and Dungeon Defenders don't work. Dungeon Defenders is an issue with my setup and I haven't had time to try the recommended fixes. Unfortunately this game doesn't even give me any clue as to why it crashes. It just freezes and can't be stopped through task manager because it stays as the fore window.Although this cost next to nothing (on sale) I would still like something that doesn't require me to jump through a ton of hoops in order to get back to a working system.Good effort and probably a great game, but I will never know because my time is more valuable than the reward of playing a game that has nothing truly unique.

Him and I both assume that we must outrun them. Wrong. As soon as we stand on the platform to start the sequence, we both dash out in both directions, getting pulverized instantly because the grinders were going to be so much faster than we thought. Turns out we just had to be patient and await the proper opportunity to not get turned into cube-steak. This game is truly challenging, always keeps you guessing, and really ♥♥♥♥s you up.

												This hack n' slash game will keep you on your toes, as it contains skill-based combat and puzzles that require you think on your feet.  It doesn't bother with the story and instead opts to focus entirely on the gameplay, which is fortunate because it is well thought-out.  Something of special note is that it is designed with co-op in mind, but while some games don't do any balancing, this game does ALL the balancing.  You have completely unique puzzles for anywhere from 1 to 4 players, and frequently puzzles will require all members of a team.It has challenges for each stage (beat it in X time, etc), but they are absurdly difficult, so I recommend you play through the story, then that's it.

												This game would be fun if it didn't have the mechanic of guiding a glowing ball around, while you're trying to fight off enemies. The combat is just fine, but you also have to solve puzzles and have way quicker reflexes than the casual gamer to simultaneously light torches/blow stuff up/snuff out mists. To me, it falls into the same category as Magicka, wherein it combines too much stuff into one game for it to be fun. But maybe I'm just getting crotchety and old and prefer my Gauntlet-esque games to be more like Gauntlet.			"

												After playing a couple of hours, I figured out this game's not for me. I bought it really cheap, but still I regret the purchase. One thing I didn't like at all is the game's controls; I couldn't play it with a gamepad so I used keyboard+mouse.			"

While it is really difficult, some of my friends still manage to get through those trials and beat the extra challenges.I am no master and thats why I stick with the multi player mode.

												As a someone who codes for a living and earned a degree in game design there are a few expectations I have. The biggest is a working program. I can overlook bugs, I can overlook the occassional crash. What I cannot do is spend hours trying to get something to work. This game seemed right up my alley considering I have very little time to game; relatively quick levels, freedom to revisit levels, and fairly simple controls (good for when I go weeks without being able to game.)The problem I'm encountering is constant crashing, every time I played the game it crashed during a fight. Out of the 100+ games I have on Steam this and Dungeon Defenders don't work. Dungeon Defenders is an issue with my setup and I haven't had time to try the recommended fixes. Unfortunately this game doesn't even give me any clue as to why it crashes. It just freezes and can't be stopped through task manager because it stays as the fore window.Although this cost next to nothing (on sale) I would still like something that doesn't require me to jump through a ton of hoops in order to get back to a working system.Good effort and probably a great game, but I will never know because my time is more valuable than the reward of playing a game that has nothing truly unique.

												So, my friend and I were in a trial. We had to avoid grinders majority of the way. We come across two grinders side by side with only a straight corridor to lead us. Him and I both assume that we must outrun them. Wrong. As soon as we stand on the platform to start the sequence, we both dash out in both directions, getting pulverized instantly because the grinders were going to be so much faster than we thought. Turns out we just had to be patient and await the proper opportunity to not get turned into cube-steak. This game is truly challenging, always keeps you guessing, and really ♥♥♥♥s you up. But I love it. Hands down- 10/10			"

												This hack n' slash game will keep you on your toes, as it contains skill-based combat and puzzles that require you think on your feet.  It doesn't bother with the story and instead opts to focus entirely on the gameplay, which is fortunate because it is well thought-out.  Something of special note is that it is designed with co-op in mind, but while some games don't do any balancing, this game does ALL the balancing.  You have completely unique puzzles for anywhere from 1 to 4 players, and frequently puzzles will require all members of a team.It has challenges for each stage (beat it in X time, etc), but they are absurdly difficult, so I recommend you play through the story, then that's it.  Get it on a sale.			"

												I bought a three-pack of FORCED to play with some friends and it is literally one of the worst games we've ever played. It feels like an high resolution Nintendo 64 title. Its gameplay is shallow and its graphics are ugly. There is no story to speak of. The voice acting is atrocious. It plays like a Mario Kart battle match or 1-on-1 Halo fight but without the fun of either of those games. The most I can say for FORCED is that we did not experience connection issues or other major during the <1 hour we wasted on this shallow, unfun game.			"

												Not a bad game. It is lacking in the RPG department though, no leveling up at all or skill points. You basically beat challenges and earn crystals, depending how many crystals you have unlocked will depend on what skills you can choose. This is a very ""mobile game"" type of mechanic if you ask me. So while it works ok I just feel the game is lacking in the RPG department.Essentially it is an Action game with skill unlocks minus RPG elements like leveling and skill points.Again not a bad game but I was slightly disappointed in the lack of leveling and skill points and so on.The story line is nothing to write home about either.The game does have some light puzzle elements but nothing too bad.Honestly there are better games out there, but this game is ok.Co-op would probably be the best way to play this so if you are getting it for co-op then I would definitley recommend it.I would give the game a 6.5/10.

												If I'm to classify Forced as anything, it's a cooperative MOPA - Multiplayer Online Puzzler Arena ;)Really good co-op game, with both fun and challenging combat system and clever but not too convoluted action-oriented puzzles, both rewarding you greatly for good teamwork and communication. Since each mission is its own little arena it's easy to pick up and play for a little while with people joining and leaving as they like, although I'd encourage you to play with friends to get the most (screaming and fighting over the shiny ball) out of it! ^^ Each class is tied to weapons and you ""level"" all the classes at the same time. Classes are divided between players so you can't play the same thing, which also encourages teamwork and letting the best suited for different tasks do their thing, but you can also switch classes freely between each mission. Since you can also skip some missions, it means you can decide difficulty by avoiding harder ones if you really want to, but I for one found the difficulty on an appropriate level. As far as co-op games goes this one is nearly perfect. The controls feels sharp and responsive, and the skills fairly intuitive. You can fight a boss without taking damage by timing dodges perfectly, or you can die miserably by doing it poorly. There's a nice balance between individual skill and teamwork that you usually (hopefully) find in MOBAs like LoL and DotA, but to me what it reminds me most of is running dungeons in WoW, minus the gear frenzy and hunter pets pulling all the mobs. Overall, I strongly recommend Forced, especially in four-packs.Trying to think of anything bad... we've had occasional random lag/framedrops for no apparent reason, but not a lot. There used to be some crippling network issues that appear to have been resolved. It seems some of the missions are in fact impossible to solo, but since you can skip some levels that may be possible to go around, I haven't tried. Although I have to say you kinda miss out on the point if you play it alone.			"

												If you’re looking for a challenging 2-4 player coop game, then look no farther. If you’re looking for a romp in the park, super lax fun-run, then you’ll probably want to keep looking. While the “Chalice” bit is kind of annoying the majority of the game mechanics provide a good set of challenges with extra level up bonuses for doing things faster and/or with more precision and finesse. It’s not a perfect game and it’s not my favorite game, but it is easily a game you should play if you’ve got some buds and if the price is right.			"

												Frustratingly fun, despite some issues with massive lag with enemy swarms. Keep on top of the spawners, guys. It's probably one of the most fun experiences I've had playing a co-op game, though. You need to know how the enemies attack to dodge properly, and to keep an eye on everything going on so that spawners or smoke doesn't get out of hand. This makes it so the game isn't so easy as to be boring, but it's also not so difficult as to be impossible. You do need to communicate with the people you're playing with, though, especially in later levels. If you run around like independent agents you'll most likely sabotage the whole team. It's a little annoying when playing the game with someone with fewer crystals than you, since everyone adjusts to the person with the fewest. You won't be able to play any later levels or use abilities they don't have access to yet, no matter how much you love those abilities, though I can see why it's like that. Having higher level abilities on earlier challenges might make them too easy, and this isn't a game that wants to be easy.			"

												I picked this up soon after buying and play Gauntlet. It was on sale for like 6 bucks and it seemed like a pretty similar game. In my opinion, this game blows Gauntlet out of the water. All four classes were awesome, with scaling move trees to customize your ability setup. Really fun co op game and extremely challenging single player game. I completed the entire game and got all but 2 achievements in single player mode. The only game to be as difficult to complete by myself to date is Bloodborne. But it was worth it, amazing game and I'm hopeful for more content or even a sequel.			"

												I was blown away by FORCED. In a world where we've come to accept that Indie developers rely on Early Access and AAA developers lean on pre-orders and DLC it's refreshing to see a game made by a small independent studio that delivers.The graphics, gameplay mechanics, and puzzles are all great quality. I've had lots of fun with this game and it's worth every penny.There are a couple of cons though and that would be that you pretty much need to play with other people. While playing solo is very much possible is it much more difficult. I know they've tried to address this by allowing single-player respawning and that has helped.Secondly when I played there were some network issues when I played with certain friends, which I guess came down to network settings, etc. I think they have in the mean-time fixed most of these issues as well.Overall, it's a great game to play during a LAN party or with some friends over voice.

												+ Great concept of a fast action hack'n'slash with added ""puzzles"" which are not actually puzzles, more like triggers needed to complete each level+ Nice looking graphics reminiscent of Torchlight, Deathspank and others+ 4 Unique classes with interesting skills+ Unique skill gem system that encourages level replayability, but can be frustrating at times (see below)+ Developers involved in the community and responding extremely fast to any reported issues+ Great sounding music and almost perfect voice acting with a few minor hiccups here and there- No difficulty setting (overall game difficulty is Medium-Hard with a few Hardcore levels)- Frustratingly difficult levels mixed with stupidly easy ones.- Luck can make or break a game, skill rarely comes into effect- Unbalanced classes, found myself playing the shield wielder more than any other class- Mostly impossible to complete level challenges for casual players, some levels require as much as 50 runs to get all the gems, the timed ones are really a pain to complete, better stick a fork in your eye than attempt them- Broken co-op multiplayer, connection to other player's ""servers"" works 2/10, there is no option to configure the server at all. There isn't even an explanation about it, I still don't know if the gem numbers on servers represent the required number to join or just an indication to the host's ""level""It's hard to give this game a note because there isn't something to compare it too. I think it can be polished some more and it sure needs the difficulty to be decreased for more casual players. Right now it feels like you are taking part in a championship or tournament that has no prize at the end making all the frustrating experience to go through all of it pointless.Maybe some extra levels at the end or a fifth class to be unlocked could have made it more interesting, especially to encourage co-op replayability.I will give it a 7/10 though especially for the idea, effort and team commitment.

												Really good co-op game. The community could be better but there are a few diamonds in the rough. This is mostly as people love to play premade rather than playing with randoms this is common co-op behavoir tough. I think its a great feature that you have no possibility to private games. Going 2 people co-op? but a random joins? Just rehost the game for 3 people this person could be a great teammate! Yet some people love to be rude and kick people on join. Just a small tip if you join a random game wich does not have private in the title try hitting that enter button and typing ""Do you mind if I join?"" or ""Are you waiting on a friend?"" in chat. Or you hit some person that will instantly kick you (He is probarely waiting on a friend don't blame him for being rude) , Or you will hit somebody that says ""Yes I am waiting on a friend could you please leave?"" , Or you somebody (rarely but funny) that says yes (like in as i mind) And you tell him you will leave but then he is like don't. (He missread or something) :D and then he turns out to be a really good teammate. Or another rare encounter where this person is again really polite (totally like the last one haha) and he lets you join :). If you find one of these you will have alot of fun. For the game itself just check a video or something its really fun.			"

												Frustratingly fun, despite some issues with massive lag with enemy swarms. Keep on top of the spawners, guys. It's probably one of the most fun experiences I've had playing a co-op game, though. You need to know how the enemies attack to dodge properly, and to keep an eye on everything going on so that spawners or smoke doesn't get out of hand. This makes it so the game isn't so easy as to be boring, but it's also not so difficult as to be impossible. You do need to communicate with the people you're playing with, though, especially in later levels. If you run around like independent agents you'll most likely sabotage the whole team. It's a little annoying when playing the game with someone with fewer crystals than you, since everyone adjusts to the person with the fewest. You won't be able to play any later levels or use abilities they don't have access to yet, no matter how much you love those abilities, though I can see why it's like that. Having higher level abilities on earlier challenges might make them too easy, and this isn't a game that wants to be easy.			"

												Top-down action game with very light RPG elements. A mix of puzzles and combat, it's not at all like Diablo or Torchlight. It's very similar to one of my favorite co-op games, Lara Croft and the Guardian of Light.FORCED is clearly designed for multiple players, because even in single player mode the narrator makes repeated references to multiple people. Kind of weird. Anyway, the combat is simple but enjoyable, the puzzles keep things interesting, and the story is alright. Recommended if you and a friend (or several) get a good sale price.			"

It's newly-thinking, extremely challenging and just too much fun - especially for the price. Tho' I cannot see myself playing this solo. You need them friends!

												Ohhh joy... another one of these co-op gimmick games.The game is near impossible to 100% complete alone, unless you buy it with a group of dedicated players... PASS, PASS, PASS!Also, not only that, I wasn't really digging the way this game works... There's very little sense of progression and the perks you get for finding all the gems just aren't very rewarding. This game takes an insane amount of memorization and reflexs to conquer, especially alone... with a full group it divvy's up the work load a bit and is the proper way to play the game.I'm also not a big fan of a progression system that doesn't actually reward the player. It doesn't exactly make any of the levels easier, just gives the player more useless attack animations to gawk at while they're running around telling an orb which wall to pass through, so it can hit some arbitrary switch, so you can finish the level... dumb.

												As much as I might like the idea of this type of game, this is not how it should be done. Only positive is the game mechanics that really forces you to coop. But other than that there are many things like :1. Horrible, horrible gamepad/keyboard support, it just switches randomly, we have to restart games all the time because during loading the game decides to ignore my controller2. Horrible stability. Lags, disconnects, twitching, stuttering. Game is nowhere near complex or pretty enough to lagg on my beast of a machine.3. UI and lack of options. There are just too many things wrong with the UI, the way you setup things, game needs more solid visual identifiers, especially during the hectic missions.4. Polish. This game badly needs one. So many bugs, from visual ones where you can't even see because of the ""SPACE SPACE SPACE"" all over the screen, to glitches and teleports.5. Lack of skill variety. It might seem that there is a ton of skills, but many are just plain bad, plus many are about creating marks on enemies, with very little skills to remove them often enough.TLDR -> If you want a 4man coop top down twin stick brawler, buy and play Gauntlet, that's a solid example of a polished, smooth game.

												+Good gameplay. +Challenging Cooperative puzzles in multi-player. -Camera range in multi-player is smaller than the play area.. you will frequently be in combat off camera.  -Console designed game. At the end of the day, the challenge curve created by the camera is excessive. It's designed as a console game with controllers, the mouse and keyboard interface is clunky.  This game should have been designed as a console exclusive for split screen gaming on huge screens.  "

Posted: August 25, 2014
												I really hate having to recommend against getting this game. I really wanted to like it but the experience the game gave just declined over the course of 14 hours. Let's start from the beginning.I bought this game pretty much right after it came out in 2013 and played it with 2 other friends. The net-code was unstable at launch which made it extremely difficult to get online co-op games (one of the main selling points) to work. When it did work though it was great entertainment. However, an unstable multiplayer was not the only mechanical issue I ran into and I crashed several times. Add numerous bugs and you have a less than stellar experience. A year later I picked up the game to finish it and while the net-code has gotten better it's still wonky and there are still bugs throughout, in fact the last boss fight of the game was more or less ruined as the big bad evil guy crapped out on me and was stuck in his walking cycle unnable to attack.Even with those mechanical flaws I still managed to have a good time but at the halfway mark of the game things just go down hill. See the game is structured a lot like an old Crash Bandicoot game (the second one to be exact). The game is split into worlds that has a series of levels along with a boss fight. Every level has 3 crystals to obtain. The first is obtained by simply beating the level, the second by completing a challenge tied to the level and finally a crystal based on completion time.The structure works really well and here's why: The game is a mix of RPG, Hack 'N' Slash and light Puzzle elements. Your character has active abilities, passive abilities and a special ability tied to each of the 4 classes (Hammer charges over time, bow can be charged manually, shield blocks etc.). However, in order gain new abilities you need to get crystals by beating levels. This creates a very real incentive to complete levels several times to pick up all the crystals.This brings us to the levels themselves and the puzzle element. Throughout the game you'll be escorted by Balfus a flying orb that might as well have been called Navi. Balfus has a lot of quips throughout the game and he happily chats away whenever he's given the chance and becomes real grating, real fast. Especially when constantly replaying levels to get those final crystals. Now the levels are structured so that you need Balfus to activate several items and objects by making him fly into them and for the first half of the game it's great fun to play with all the different objects in the world and there are some really creative puzzles in there. Like I said though, at the half way point it seriously starts to feel like you're simply going through the motions and things become repetitive just like Balfus' endlessly repeating lines.Another few gripes I feel deserve mentioning are the bosses whom have way to much health for their own good, seriously they are ♥♥♥♥ing sponges soaking damage like high-end kleenexes. The mark system which adds extra damage from abilities and basic attacks don't do enough to quickly wear down bosses at a reasonable rate and the boss levels which are supposed to be epic become tedious. The fact that the invisible creatures can only be spotted by Balfus and the fact there's only one Balfus and most likely more than one player it is aggrivating to kill just one, especially when they have enough health to soak several fully marked abilities. I could go on but I think I've made my point.In conclusion, I feel really bad for not recommending the game because I know this is the first game by the dev team and I know they worked really hard on it, but it just lacks polish and the player-experience is not optimal as a result. If you really want to play this game, get it on sale.			"

												If you want a good coop game then look elsewhere!Where to start? Want deep character customization? Too bad! Pick between four set characters (if a buddy grabs your favorite character, you have to play as a different one) with only one weapon set per character. while you can certainly upgrade their abilities and switch between a few special powers per character, its hardly in depth enough to make you feel like you have the ability to make important changes to your character to augment to your own playing style. And with zero loot in the game you aren't allowed to even optimize your character's gear in any way.Howabout the maps? Well, don't play this game expecting long sprawling dungeons, each level is more of a small arena with waves of enemies and little puzzles to solve. And when I mean arena I literally mean a smallish circular map where enemies will run in from doorways on the outside as well as from a few spawners. Its been extremely difficult to connect with friends, but when working the teamwork required to get through these levels is simple, but enjoyable enough (though it is a simple button masher) when played in coop, however that leads me to the greatest problem of this game in my opinion:When playing coop with friends with each of you on DIFFERENT computers, you are still forced to share the camera as if playing a couch coop with your buddies on the same screen. This can lead to anything from mild annoyance to intense frustration while playing. I can think of nothing more frustrating while trying to play this game then when my character is pushed off the screen because my friends are on the other side of the screen, and I am now forced to fight blindly or ask my friends to stop what they're doing and come back to my side of the arena. This problem might not be as frustrating when played with just 1-2 other friends, but if you get a full group of four together you'll run into this problem often. Its possible this has been fixed, though the fact that you were ever forced (no pun intended) to play this way in the first place is ridiculous!In terms of replayability, there is no randomness to this game, or any abundance of places you might of missed to explore. The game's main sense of replayability comes in the fact that each arena playthrough is timed, and ranked among others. The incentive being to replay the arena to try and get a better score.There's a reason why most of the people reviewing this game don't make it past twenty hours of game time... However, that being said, if this sounds like the type of game you want to play then by all means give it a whirl. Just don't be fooled into thinking that this game will be at all like an in depth rpg dungeon crawler. If you're looking for that type of game look elsewhere.			"

												The camera for multiplayer in this game is horribly broken. When the players are further apart than half a screen, your view gets offset and zoomed out to keep all players onscreen. You are no longer the center of your screen. It was a very poor design choice.Secondly, some of the challenges require specific skill combinations. Part of the challenge is figuring that out. I detest this use of the skill sets. I would like to play using skills I enjoy, not skills that I must use to progress. That is another very poor design choice.My last gripe is that I don't feel like the game has much replayability. Once I complete a very difficult task and get the extra gem, I don't want to do it ever again. That isn't a desireable feature for any game.			"

												This game reminded me of Gauntlet, so my 3 friends and I got it one night and decided to attempt to record it for my YouTube. The sad truth is the game is such garbage that I had 3 corrupted video files before I stopped trying.Between the 4 of us, my friends and I have between medium and advanced gaming rigs... mine being the best. All four of us had repeated game crashes every time we tabbed out of the game, for me it was to start/stop Audacity and for them it was either accident or to check their Twitch streams. However if that was the only issue it wouldn't be too bad, the major issue is this crash in the ended up causing all of our computers to crash and need to be manually restarted. After the 3rd try I stopped tabbing out and decided to run everything before opening the gamem which worked until one of my friends accidentally hit ""Main Menu"". When he did this, it kicked the 3 remaining players out of the game, crashed the game, and forced a manual restart.Lastly, the least minor thing but during our play none of us could use the controller even though it was an option. The controller settingers were optimized however every time one of us selected the controller it wouldn't allow that person to ""ready-up"" until they went back to the keyboard. Why even make something an option if your game won't allow you to use it?This game honestly isn't worth your time. We were the only people to have a room in the lobby and that was on a Saturday night, so theres little to no chance of finding a game unless you're solo or your friends were dumb enough to buy this game with you. Sadly, my friends and I attempted to play this game for over 2 hours and I fear we wont get our money back.Rating: 2/10 - Only because they suckered me into buying the deluxe so I can look like more of a bada$$ than my friends.

												A fun game for both playing solo and with friends.  While I've not had any issues with the game other than some graphical glitches, it's been nice to see the developers actively improving the game (better multiplayer connections, better controller support, other bug fixes, and several tweaks to solo play).It's an action RPG in the same genre as Diablo, Torchlight, etc., but with several twists.  It's much more puzzle based, but combat is still an integral part.  Classes are based on the 4 available weapons, and switching classes can be done with no penalty between levels.  Skills are unlocked by completing levels and challenges (one time and one other per level) to get crystals, which unlock abilities at certain numbers and is not tied to a class.  There's no gear progression, so there's no grinding.  In multiplayer, everyone has to have a crystal for it to be available for that play session, so everyone is on an equal footing.I picked this up because it was compatible with Macs, and I've really enjoyed it.  I've played with 1, 2, 3, and 4 players, tried all 4 classes and have 72/75 crystals.Some levels/challenges are significantly easier for either solo or multiplayer (time challenges tend to be more relaxed in multiplayer, but other challenges that require no one screwing up is much easier solo).  Also, the archer seems to be much more powerful compared to the other classes in solo because it is the only class with a ranged basic attack.  Furthermore, once you have 75/75 crystals, I feel there's currently limited replay value, even if you choose a different class.  However, there's a promise for more ""endgame"" content beyond the current survival mode.			"

The challenges that my friends and I faced has caused us the necessary frustration but the possibility of completing it has kept us at it. We are 70% past the game and honestly, my only wish were that it could be longer as we do love the game. The upside are the stages which are initially simple but you can opt to do the challenges which are much harder and have forced our team to use special set-ups in our attempt to conquer them. A fond way to think of it would be like a 10-25 man dungeon raid you would experience in some of the MMO's but that your team was reduced to 4, including you. Although you can play it single player, it is a much better game to play with friends and I would say your enjoyment rises exponentially with each friend you play with. The downside is that the game is relatively short, if you play without the challenges, you can easily complete in maximum of 1-2 days?This is one of the most challenging games and its still worth every cent.

												This game will kick your♥♥♥♥♥and take your name with it. This will give you an excuse to go cry to your mother. NAY....it will FORCE you to cry to your mother. You ever have a 4 person party quest for the king and fall on your♥♥♥♥♥in failure as a behemoth with 1200 of its ♥♥♥♥♥es laugh at you? Well this game is worse as it even gives you the 5 finger slap across the face while you drag a giant orb of light around 600 different terrains so that your team can go through a cluster♥♥♥♥ ♥♥♥♥♥torm of enemies and enemies and enemies and, just when you think you have completed the level, satan's hand reaches up and denies you the right to carry out the simple task of leveling. Still a good game though, I highly recommend it to people who like to play with others.			"

												I like FORCED a lot. Co-op with a friend or two is really cool. The arenas get pretty difficult and it is really easy to loose track of time when trying to survive and win. I haven't played alone yet, but I highly recommend it if you play co-op. Also works well with controllers, and the existence of LOCAL co-op is very appreciated.			"

												Even though the game doesn't play too well for a single player, the true power is in the co-op. If you feel like you're up for a challenge with three of your friends or even more challenging, three strangers, this game is for you. There are some small glitches and problems you may run into while playing online, but thankfully, it's never game-breaking. I would suggest this game for anyone who likes having a good multiplayer experience, especially since every character in the game has a completely different moveset. Try it out and have some fun.

												This game is the best local co-op game I have ever played. PERIOD. The girlfriend even loves it!I played the Trine series, the lego <franchise> series. FORCED comes out on top- we had friends over compulsively until we beat the story. It is the right amount of challenge and fun gameplay. This game perfects all the non loot related elements that made WoW raids appealing. The challenges range from easy to ""yeah there is no ♥♥♥♥♥♥ way we're doing that"". Lots of fun.BUY IT!			"

												FORCED is an interesting game, to say the least. I played it heavily during the initial development, before it was on Steam.The game is a mixture of time trials and Diablo-esque co-op combat, this means you have a persistant character that you level up in either singleplayer, or co-operative levels. These levels involve combat, as well as puzzle solving mechanics where players move and place floating orbs over certain objects for a variety of effects.If you enjoy time challanges, Diablo, or are looking for a co-op game with friends you will be hard pressed to find a better value than FORCED at the current time!You can see my other opinions on the game here:

												This is a puzzle game with a really bad twin stick beat-em up mechanic. No checkpoints in levels. A Twin Stick with no dodge roll, or block button. The twin stick is unnecessary and adds nothing but to make the game harder since it’s hard to see where you are facing. The game is unnecessarily hard and you can get surrounded by enemies and die easily. It's designed to be four players and the same amount of enemies will spawn regardless if it’s just two players or four. There is no way to complete all the challenges single player.  "

												I got to a trial, like #8 or whatever, that was seemingly impossible without a co op partner. Good luck finding anyone else who wants to play this game besides yourself though. It is a below average game at best, based primarily around puzzle solving with really bad generic boring combat. It is best forgotten to games of a much better quality, mainly games that have a single player campaign that doesn't require co op assistance, or at least isn't so incredibly frustrating that it is a complete turn off. This game is very easily forgotten in a sea of other, much more awesome games. It would be a lot better if the combat didn't suck so much and was less frustrating on some challenges that are clearly easier with a partner which you won't find unless you ask strangers in the forums maybe. Oh and did I mention the combat is generic and boring and takes a back seat to puzzle solving? Just making sure I made that clear.			"

Not very complicated which is good when you at the same time is bombarded with enemies. The problem with this game is the hack and slash part. It's just not compelling or versatile. It falls flat. Every enemy takes a lot of hits which just makes them annoying rather than scary and fun. The different characters doesn't feel very appealing and the RPG elements are limited and boring.Me nor my friends could recommend this.			"

												(At the moment I wouldnt be recommending this game to people I know.)Whilst the concept of this game is very good, combining the elements of an arena fighting game with puzzle mechanics. Myself and my friends have become gradually annoyed many times with little problems that arise from the strange lag, collision detection, clunky camera and online getting the game to linkup.Problems that arose during play- Sometimes found the Spirit orb wouldnt hit shrines or objects when it appeared that it passed directly into them.- When players were spreadout the camera wouldnt help you out.- We had some lag issues between players from UK and Sweden. (no problems in other games)-The online lobby had a few hiccups when setting up the match. (not seeing when Ready)Somethings id love to see added/fixed/updating- rolling or sprint. (due to the fact that everytime I tried to move away from enemies they would keep up and hit me this may or may not have been due to lag (unsure)- individual cameras for players with a button for map view to see other players.- fixing cutscenes and specific little issues with the game.""If this is slightly better i would hate to see what the original was like""Cheers Jezereth.

												I don't even know why I bought this game, maybe it was shiny, who knows. What I do know is this game is unfinished. I honestly thought this was just an early access title like many of the others, but no it's not. I checked the store page 3 times to make sure. This game has terrible audio mixing that makes most combat and music either too soft or not audible at all. The sounds are extremely far away if you are using headphones. Voice acting was bad, kinda the reason I wrote that first review after playing the starting trials. This game is just one gauntlet of completionist challenges. Honestly this is battle block theater if you take the platforming away and made it too serious. Really the most laughable part is that they included a built-in twitch streaming platform. In a game that is so boring and requires co-op to be any fun, why do they need to include this? The game is the same ball puzzle, as far as I've played. Use your floating ball to activate shrines and destroy arbitrary spawners and statues.You play the same character as everyone else just in different armor. I say charater but your just a gladiator without a name or face that wears different armor depending on what the lobby leader ♥♥♥♥♥es at you to be. It's a nice feature that you can change classes at whim so there's no commitment to a certain role. With the human husk of a character the story is terrible and the meat of the game is left to repetitive arenas one after the other. Meh, the game's just boring, noticibly unpolished, and requires multiplayer for fun. Also multiplayer is buggy and won't connect at times. So what can you do, play a better game at least.			"

												I have to congratulate this game for doing something no other piece of software ever managed to do. It manages to shut down both my monitors for 10 minutes of inactivity (at least that's my best guess, maybe it just lulls my graphics card to sleep after a little while), even though I was playing the game for those 10 minutes, which means moving the mouse around and using the keyboard. What's even more impressive is that the same happens whether I play in full screen or windowed mode. And the most impressive thing of all... this means that I can not tab out of the game leaving hard reset button on my case as the only possible way out.In a way this is actually quite a beautiful accomplishment and I could just simply turn off that setting on my PC when I play this game and see if that would help. Or I could also just uninstall this and move on with my life... which I ultimately decided is a healthier option.			"

												At $5 Its maybe worth it.  Multiplayer is difficult to function and rarely works properly.  And there needs to be some character gear to alter your character besides the 3 abilities to get to have ready on hand, and 3 passive tweaks.  Thats if you take the time to level up.  Which is done with progress only,  If you get stuck your stuck.   And you will be grinding old levels for challenges that might yield enough to continue.  I played the game for about 2 hours before i realized how lacking it was in gameplay,  Its more a puzzle game with some fighting on the side.  All in all, i would take a pass unless you have 3 other buddies who want it, and time to spend with this poor multiplayer connection.			"

												Bought it on sale for $2. Its an alright puzzle game, but nothing particularly compelling. Definitely not worth the $14.99 sticker price. Pros: Different weapon sets are useful for different levels, decent co-op play. Low cost on sale. Bosses you beat become toned down normal enemies in following levels, which introduces some neat mechanics in mundane combat. cons: Almost no replayability. Progression requires you to beat levels under a timer and while adhering to generally more difficult challenges, so look forward to playing all of them several times as you go through the story. Low variety of enemies. You'll see the same ones every single level. Puzzles are highly simplistic. Out of 20 story levels only a handful aren't painfully obvious. About half of challenges are super easy to get and you'll end up reaching them just by playing the level, the rest are frustrating and include a strong element of luck requiring you to replay the level multiple times. Stunlock for days. Not all classes have invincibility frames, and several enemy types can pin you against the wall or dogpile you and stunlock you to death. The completely invisible enemies that attack from invis without breaking it only add to this, as they make some attacks legitimately unavoidable. Camera is terribad. It has a maximum zoom and a fixed angle, combined with all the knockbacks its not unsual to have people stuck offscreen. Almost no multiplayer scene: less than five games at a time, coming off of an 85% off sale. Unless you've got friends who own it or buy a fourpack look forward to going it alone.  "

												Cool game but super hard. There are so few local coop games that I was excited to try this with my 2 kids and the first 30 minutes was great then the rest went quickly downhill. Replaying waves 15+ times with no additional progress is brutal. Way too hard for my tastest			"

												The game is basically designed around 4 people and doesn't scale back for less players. My friend and I are on the third wing/section and it's damn near impossible with just the two of us.It's also one of those top-down games where there's a single camera trying to focus on every player and it's a huge pain in the♥♥♥♥♥ Unless you're glued to each others' asses, someone is gonna end up off screen and killed.I wouldn't suggest paying more than a buck or two, and even then I wouldn't suggest buying it unless you have 3 friends that are going to play with you.

												This is a challenging game, more because if you don't have a team some things seem impossible.The game works in a way where you level up by gathering crystals which you get from: Finishing a level, Finishing it within a certain amount of time, or doing a challenge in the level. Recently they have added so you can get up to 12 more crystals from Survival modes, but it's not as helpful late game as it is doing it as early as possible.As you level up you gain Perks, Abilities, or a spot for a new one.However, the later it gets the more crystals you will need to get new things, easily trapping you with whatever you have and hoping that you can beat the next level.What I don't like is that even if you play the same level 50 times, you will not get anything from it, especially if you're stuck on it and you can't do any other time/challenge things.I'm still not sure if I recommend this game, it's really frustaring when you stand there with no ways to get the next unlock, but you're also stuck and can't continue.In the end, I will not recommend the game, for the way it treats unlocks, and singleplayer is nearly unable to do if you're an achivement ♥♥♥♥♥ like I am.

Okay, I could fork out for a controler but it's still a clunky form of movement.  What's wrong with mouse clicks?  They're direct, controlable and you go where you want to go.I wish Steam would post a WASD warning so I wouldn't end up buying games that are annoying to play!			"

Add that I can play for litterally five minutes or two hours and I call it a winner (it's easy to  hop in and out of if all of a sudden the gf/wife/spouse/dog/kid/giant spider attack suddenly cause a ruckus).The best part about this game is this: the devs RESPOND on the boards, and usually promptly at that.  That counts for a whole lot as it shows that they're not a fire-and-forget type of game company.Forced is well worth the few dollars/euros/yen/pounds/rubles/whatevers they're asking.			"

												One of the best LOCAL CO-OP games, I wish it had more content though. At some point missions get too hard to complete and you get nothing for trying the mission over and over again. The problem is, every try is pretty much the same as you get no drops no buffs nothing different. Same script every time. So as long as you progress, you enjoy it. As soon as you stop, you switch to other game.Overall, not epic indeed, yet I still like this game and would buy it again. I hope for expansion.			"

Your only way to survive is to compete in a series of trials and defeat the guardian of each chamber. Using 4 different classes, Bow, Hammer, Shield and Blades, you make your own choise of abilities and face these trials.The game works best, if you are playing with friends.

												Realy good coop game!Kind of Diablo-like without loot or exp. You collect runes by completing level, their challenge and the time limit on them. Mor runes = more available skills; easy as that.Not to easy, you got to be fast, there are nice bosses and mini-bosses and there are puzzles to solve.Even alone i would say this is viable.The big problem at hand is the poor netcodeing. You need to readjust router-ports, anti-vir and firewalls and it will still not tell you your NAT is ok. Aside from beeing unable to connect to ppl this will also cause heavy lags in mp (which are a bad thing if you do time trails or challenges ...), but well not with everybody ...Seeing that the connecting probs cause the mp to be friend-only-groups or half-way-dead i would say: Do not buy above 10€.

It will challenge your brain and fighting skills. I would definitely buy a sequel. This game is a must co-op, you will feel this when playing, and i love that. Can play with controller and keyboard on same pc for instance, this combined with online players.In a nutshell: CO-OP MUST HAVE			"

												A really fun puzzle-action game about TEAMWORK. You could play it solo, but that's for scrubs. With a bunch of unlockable abilities and passives for some very basic Diablo-esque combat, you have to figure out works best to beat a certaion challenge, or do it quickly enough to beat the target time, or maybe just beat the level period. It's definitely a good, fun test of coordination and covering your allies' backs. Did I mention it's a co-op game?Alternatively, pick Magma Hammer, taunt everything, spin to win, and you beat everything forever. True story.			"

												Brilliant game.  Simple mechanics implemented well.  With recent netcode fixes the game works well even on Australian internet connections (if you have a host with good upload ;)).One of the best co-op games I've played in years, and it can be played in small doses.  If you're missing Guardian of Light (and waiting for the sequel), pick this up.			"

												Realy good coop game!Kind of Diablo-like without loot or exp. You collect runes by completing level, their challenge and the time limit on them. Mor runes = more available skills; easy as that.Not to easy, you got to be fast, there are nice bosses and mini-bosses and there are puzzles to solve.Even alone i would say this is viable.The big problem at hand is the poor netcodeing. You need to readjust router-ports, anti-vir and firewalls and it will still not tell you your NAT is ok. Aside from beeing unable to connect to ppl this will also cause heavy lags in mp (which are a bad thing if you do time trails or challenges ...), but well not with everybody ...Seeing that the connecting probs cause the mp to be friend-only-groups or half-way-dead i would say: Do not buy above 10€.

												Great game if you have a little group of friends to play it with. Having tried to play this alone it's either stomping the level or borderline if not entire impossible to complete some levels. Still, if you have some folks to play with it's great fun, so much trolling around with the puzzles and whatnot and it gets really disorienting when you're trying to do a fight which involves rotating a mechanic between your group to avoid getting melted by a boss fight.I doubt I'd come back to this after a while, though still it's some good hours spent with friends.

												It is hard to sum up what exactly this game got wrong, when a lot of it is so close to being right. I enjoyed playing the beginning levels with my friends, but we quickly found out that in a nutshell....this game is still an unfinished and unpolished product, despite being out for a good while now.It doesn't take long to get to a level with what I consider game-breaking mechanics that just doesn't make it worthwhile to even try anymore. The frustrating thing is that it would have been really easy to implement something to fix these - like a dodge mechanic for example - and yet that was never done. It's like they released a good idea for a game that they never bothered playing or testing themselves, and then just left it alone. Therefore I recommend saving your money for a good coop game that a developer actually polishes and tests to make sure it is balanced and fun all the way through. "

												Hands down one of the most entertaining and fun indie games I've played in a long time, fun in both single player and multiplayer mode.Kudos to the devs for developing such an interesting gameplay and for the level design. Each stage was challenging in its own unique way and the end bosses were difficult enough while not being simple ""power creeps"". The strategic aspect of this game is what makes it great and extremly fun to play.These guys definitely have a thing or two to teach for what concerns design and gameplay.If there was an expansion pack with more levels available I'd definitely buy it.11/10 would recommend.Edit: Do not mind all those negative reviews that say that the game is too hard or badly designed and that one gets overwhelmed too easily and such. They're just people who didn't take the time to learn the mechanics of the game and are used to tunnelvision monorail playstyles where everything is already pre-cooked and easy.			"

												This is quite possibly, in my opinion of course, the greatest game I have ever played.  It has four very different and very fun classes, which you can switch between any time you want.  You can play it solo, or you can go co-op and play with both friends and strangers.  The game used to be almost entirely unplayable, as there were so many connection issues that it was impossible to play with others and this is an extremely co-op oriented game.  However, since then the devs have pretty much completely rewritten all network related code and spent a huge amount of time bug hunting, which shows a tremendous amount of dedication as this is the first and only game created by a new and very small company.  However, it did take a while for them to update it considering how much they had to fix, so many people who initially played the game have since forgotten it and not updated the reviews they left half a year ago, so the game's Steam rating is fairly inaccurate.If you like challenging, co-op based games that involve both problem solving and skill on an intense yet doable difficulty curve, I highly recommend this game.  However while you can play it casually, you will not get much out of it nor will you get very far, so if that's what you're looking for do NOT buy it.			"

												This is a fun co-op game where you can either play solo or with up to 3 other players (so 4 in total). Each player wields a different weapon. The further you progress, the more gems you get the more (passive and active) abilities you unlock and the more abilies you can equip (3 active and 3 passive abilties in total).This is basicly a puzzle game where you have to use your spirit mentor Balfus to activate or destroy items. Each person can summon this spirit to his/her current position, but while Balfus is moving to that location, another player might summon him and thus you can get very annoyed with each other :D Get ready to work as a team...

												I had fun playing this game. Having first played through the first few levels with some friends until we stopped for a while, I had decided to pick it back up on my own after a few years. Yeesh... this game is tough on your own!I found that many challenges took a lot of observation and some trial-and-error until I found the right setup of skills and passives to complete them. I never felt cheated or that it was impossible to do on my own, there was always a combination (along with some patience) that worked.You are given the choice to play as one of four gladiators, each with their own weapon type: archer, shield, hammer (AoE style), and dual blades (fast single-targeting). I played as the shield for most of the challenges, as he has the ability to heal himself while moving faster, reflect enemy attacks for a duration, make himself immune to damage (and immobile) for a while, and dash through enemies. Almost every level had me rearranging my abilities to complete them, and that's what kept me going; I never felt that I was doing the same thing every level.I'd highly recommend giving this game a shot. If you have some buddies to play it with, you'll have a blast. If you don't, this game is still a lot of fun on your own and is a good challenge.			"

												Great co-op game!  I played this LOCALLY with a gamepad and a keyboard.  Great controls on either end.  I found myself strategizing with my teammate(s) and generally having fun. Most levels after the first world (there are 4, I think) have an amazing level of difficulty.  Each level has three gems - beat the level, a ""challenge"" and a time trial. I generally skipped the time trial as that required you to really strategize in between waves and try over and over again to beat the level within the time limit.  Seemed like a waste of my gaming time to me, so I left it alone. however! Some of the challenges were actually really cool and most definitely add replayability.  For instance, a level would be about moving blocks around and solving a puzzle, killing some dudes, and then finding the end banner.  Easy enough, allows you to use your brain, and you get to fight quite a bit.  The challenge? Don't get hit by suicide monsters.  Adds some good challenge, but it isn't terribly difficult.  Strategy for those levels takes 1 minute or less, and a little bit of talking which is perfect.  Time trials are a different story - lots of strategy, retrying levels, and I would almost say are next to impossible with less than 3 players.In the end, I recommend this very highly to anyone that has even one other person they like to play games with. Netcode is great, no noticable lag, and steam has some great voice chat.Play!			"

												I have a very love hate relationship with this game. I unfortunately have only had the chance to play through the single player campaign, so I am not sure how much differs between it and multiplayer. In other words, what I say about it may not apply to the entire game, just the part I have played. Now this game is obviously geared towards multiplayer, which isn't bad but for those of us who prefer single player or can only do single player, it seems a bit unfair. Even in some of the dialogue it assumes there are multiple gladiators, rarely using singular terms when refering to them. But while it is probably more difficult to do this alone, it isn't impossible. Infuriating at times, yes, but possible. For those who have not played the game i'll try to sum up the gameplay real fast.There are four 'classes' you can chooe from, and unlike what you may be used to, you do not select it at the beginning, at least not permanently. You can switch between them before each trial. Of the four I have only used 3, but i've glanced over them all. There is the DPS dagger like gloves, with quick attacks. That one I never really used. There is the heavy hitter hammer which I ended up using a lot simply because of that. The shield I only used once for a challenge but he seems to be a tank like character, meant to avoid a lot of damage. Then there is the bow, the ranged attacker which I used almost as much as the hammer. Each trial may require you to use a different set of weapons, you can't just stick with one. And I mean that, I don't mean it'll just be more difficult, some areas I cannot see you doing without a certain character.An interesting mechanic the game brings into play is your spirit mentor, Balfus, a floating orb of light that acts as your guide and support. You can summon him to different locations, which you'll to do a lot as to activate altars you have to make him pass through them. These altars can do any number of things, some are required to be activated to continue the level, some give Balfus a healing aura, while another will actually push enemies away and much more. I really liked this mechanic as at times it required you to do some thinking, which is a nice break from the usual hack and slash. I just wish there were more puzzles that required extra thought beyond the second area. Balfus will also give you advice and tell you about new additions to the trials as they appear. However. One of my biggest gripes is that there are times where his advice and warnings come after the fact. For example, there is a part in the second boss in the very beginning where something is happening to Balfus but he says nothing. And if you stay close to him, you end up caught in a shockwave that damages you. No warning, nothing. Not until LATER does he warn you of the dark pulsing. And then there are times where he doesn't say anything at all and you have to figure things out on your own, like in the third boss with the eggs.You do not level up like you would in a normal game, instead you unlock new skills and skill slots by completing challenges and gathering crystals from them. There are three crystals in each trial, one for beating the trial, another for completing that trial's challenge, and the last one is for the time trials. I'm not sure if there are different challenges in multiplayer, nor do I know how the time trials scale with more characters, but at least in singleplayer they do not waste time in making them difficult to complete, and expect to experiment with different characters to be able to complete them. And some of these challenges are quite infuriating. And don't expect to be able to get by with just completing the levels because the final trial has a requirement of, at least in singleplayer, 40 crystals. These can be difficult to get and require a lot of patience(or sheer stubborness).Now there are some things I had a problem with regarding the classes. Each one has the same amount of health, armor and speed. The dagger and archer should be much faster then the shield or hammer in movement speed, it only makes sense and you are punished for using the archer because many enemies are much faster then you, even if you are running full speed(which requires you to move your mouse in the direction your gladiator is facing btw). What makes this more annoying is that while the weakest enemies don't do a ton of damage, each hit slows you down even further. So good luck on those time trials where you have to try and avoid enemies, you'll be doing them a lot. I also have yet to see any other character besides archer being able to safetly despose of those exploding enemies without the use of a skill, which while those skills help they don't do much in situations where there are lot of them and you can't just run away till the cooldown is finished because, that's right, they're faster and will catch up with you. This is where I started to feel like the scaling for single player wasn't quite right.What caused me the most grief, however, were the challenges. By the end of it all I was ready to slam my laptop against the wall. These trials require absolute perfection at times, sometimes being borderline impossible. And since it requires you to get an extra 15 crystals to get to the final boss you have no choice but doing some of the most difficult ones. I'd suggest not doing what I did by finishing this game in one seven hour sitting, and instead do these challenges in spurts, for the sake of your sanity.Speaking of the final boss, and i'm not going to spoil anything, I have to say it was my favorite part of the whole game. The game's music is great, but the music for the final boss really got me into the mood, it made me feel like I was in the middle of a legendary struggle, so much that even after all the frustration that had been built up prior to it, I didn't rage once at a death no matter how close I came to defeating him that run. Unfortunately it is where I encountered the only bug I found in the entire game, and made the last half of the fight childs play(he got stuck running in place in the middle of the room). However I still left that boss fight feeling accomplished, which is what really matters in the end.Now my favorite aspect of the game was not the gameplay, but rather the voice acting and story. Yes, the story isn't the main focus of the game, just a given reason to explain why you are doing all this, but I really enjoyed the bits of it you got after every trial. And the voice acting was just wonderful. Balfus was masterfuly done in my opinion, which is good considering he's with you the entirety of the game. However, while I do enjoy the story, it never felt complete. Slight spoilers in this next bit, i'll mark it for those who want to avoid it.Balfus makes mention of these being the 'new guardians' and this master being the 'new master'. But never makes mention to what happened to the previous ones, or how these new ones rose to power. It's left unanswered which leaves you wondering why they even bothered mentioning it in the first place. Unless there is something extra I am missing.For all my gripes and frustration with this game, it is actually quite good and i'd recommend it to play with friends, but only do challenge if you have extreme patience or like that kind of challenge. It's a challenge experience but one that draws you in and makes you want to complete it and it never feels old, you are always coming across something new and fresh in each trial. So if you are a very casual gamer, i'd stay away, but if you are one who likes being challenged, go for it.			"

												This is a fun co-op game where you can either play solo or with up to 3 other players (so 4 in total). Each player wields a different weapon. The further you progress, the more gems you get the more (passive and active) abilities you unlock and the more abilies you can equip (3 active and 3 passive abilties in total).This is basicly a puzzle game where you have to use your spirit mentor Balfus to activate or destroy items. Each person can summon this spirit to his/her current position, but while Balfus is moving to that location, another player might summon him and thus you can get very annoyed with each other :D Get ready to work as a team...

												I had fun playing this game. Having first played through the first few levels with some friends until we stopped for a while, I had decided to pick it back up on my own after a few years. Yeesh... this game is tough on your own!I found that many challenges took a lot of observation and some trial-and-error until I found the right setup of skills and passives to complete them. I never felt cheated or that it was impossible to do on my own, there was always a combination (along with some patience) that worked.You are given the choice to play as one of four gladiators, each with their own weapon type: archer, shield, hammer (AoE style), and dual blades (fast single-targeting). I played as the shield for most of the challenges, as he has the ability to heal himself while moving faster, reflect enemy attacks for a duration, make himself immune to damage (and immobile) for a while, and dash through enemies. Almost every level had me rearranging my abilities to complete them, and that's what kept me going; I never felt that I was doing the same thing every level.I'd highly recommend giving this game a shot. If you have some buddies to play it with, you'll have a blast. If you don't, this game is still a lot of fun on your own and is a good challenge.			"

												Hands down one of the most entertaining and fun indie games I've played in a long time, fun in both single player and multiplayer mode.Kudos to the devs for developing such an interesting gameplay and for the level design. Each stage was challenging in its own unique way and the end bosses were difficult enough while not being simple ""power creeps"". The strategic aspect of this game is what makes it great and extremly fun to play.These guys definitely have a thing or two to teach for what concerns design and gameplay.If there was an expansion pack with more levels available I'd definitely buy it.11/10 would recommend.Edit: Do not mind all those negative reviews that say that the game is too hard or badly designed and that one gets overwhelmed too easily and such. They're just people who didn't take the time to learn the mechanics of the game and are used to tunnelvision monorail playstyles where everything is already pre-cooked and easy.			"

												I tried this because it looked similar to gauntlet and could be played in Linux Mint/Ubuntu. The concept is similar to Gauntlet but the mechanics take some getting used to but once you get the hang of offers some enjoyable unique game play all of it its own. It is intended for co-op which was appealing to me but it is frustrating when I keep getting kicked from multi-player games which has been ruining the fun. If you get this game buy a couple as gifts to other friends you think will like it becouse it sucks being friendless for multiplayer.			"

												Ok, you may call me masochist, but i managed to finish the game solo, it was painful, i raged, i cried and boy was it frustrating, what i am trying to say is, if you are a masochist, solo it, if you still want to try it but you would like a less painful playthrough you should gather some friends and buy a four pack since the online is kinda empty by now. Graphics are nice and environments are diverse but nothing you haven't seen, you have dungeons, deserts, jungle/swamp and a greenfield looking gladiator arena. Controls (at least for xbox controller) work fine, they're responsive and accurate but they are not fully supported or should i say buggy on the menus, but on combat they're totally perfect. It's a hard to beat game that made me feel like playing a simplified top down version of dark souls, i really recommend it, ON THE OTHER HAND YOU COULD ALSO SAVE YOUR MONEY FOR FORCED 2 WHICH HAS ALSO BEEN ALREADY ANOUNCED.

This amazing game requires an high level of coordination between multiple partners working to complete complex puzzles while surviving increasingly hazerdous conditions such as rotating instakill death beams, nigh unkillable enemys, lethal progressing levels, and even combinations of such difficult conditions that are well beyond description. Each level will have you saying ""Well it couldn't get any harder than that."" just to eat your own words.

The main reason I bought Forced is for local co-op on days I have LAN gaming with friends.  My PC is mid-high performance, and I do have a problem running it smoothly.

												Buy? Maybe.When I first heard of FORCED before it came out, I was definitely looking forward to playing it: At the time, the latest Gauntlet game wasn't announced and I loved the Gauntlet games from the N64 and Dreamcast systems that FORCED was inspired from and I've plunked hours into them just on single player.You don't play FORCED in singleplayer. Or rather you can, and it is very functional from the little bit that I have played, but it's is rather difficult in singleplayer and while it isn't unfair (just almost so) and I would compare it to ""old school Nintendo hard"" which is a good thing, but fustrating when trying to clear your backlog and just get through the next level. The worst part of this difficulty is that you level up by completeing challenges for each level: Completion challenge for completing the level, a special ""objective"" challenge for each level, and a time attack challenge. Many of these will not be completed by players on their first run of a level, such as avoiding certain enemies or attacks, or completing an optional level challenge. Completing the challenges give you crystals which tie in DIRECTLY to your ability to unlock new active and passive skills. Some of these challenges are probably easier with ""less players in your way"", but others feel like you need them. This creates a great reward for completng challenges, but is likely the reason why many players were scared off from FORCED. After all, I never bought this game due to hearing reviews about the difficulty and it wasn't until I was gifted this that I got to play this. Unfortunately, I never got a chance to play the game with the gifter or anybody else. Only a few of my friends have this game, and only a couple of them have played less than 2 hours of the game. There was only one online game when I checked, which denied my access to join. You will have to schedule a game with friends to play this co-op,.In conclusion, I really like the idea of combining almost Zelda-esque puzzles and Gauntlet gameplay. It works rather well here, though it can be quite annoying to manage a spirit to solve puzzles while in the heat of battle or harsh environmental conditions and level traps. The combat feels like what a modern interpretation of the Gauntlet games should feel like, however, the overall difficulty is probably what kept this game from being a big hit like Torchlight II or Castle Crashers - Not a ton of people know of this game and those that do aren't playing it. FORCED is missing the pick up and play casual feel of the Gauntlet games it is inspired by and because of this FORCED has slipped under the radar of most players and has stayed there.FORCED a good game, even perhaps a great game, but it is a hard recommendation for a game built around co-op with a dead player base. You should only buy this if you can get some other core gamers to play this with to completion - it is unlikely you will beat this with casual friends and family.			"

												Well, its always doubting to buy a game with new concepts. Its still a good amount on money you have to spend on it. We did the purchase with 4 friends. And i have to say we all like the game. It was a good purchase. (i got it gifted, but still ;) )Now,I think its a good concept. A top faced hack and slasher puzzle game where you have to face diffrent trials. On each trail you can earn 3 crystals. One on completing, one on time, and one on a specific trial based challenge. The completion is not that hard. The time and challenge are sometimes a diffrent story ;) With the crystals you can upgrade your character to make other trials easyier. The game runs smoothly and has a very nice graphic lay out if you can put it on the highest settings. ( its not that hard for your computer) For the difficulty, like some people say its to hard. Well, in my opinion its not. Its just a good challenge. I like the dificulty.Its a great game, and it becomes better if you can play it with 2-3-4 players together and have some yelling over team speak :p A challenge for a gamer who wants to challenge his own game skills !

												A friend of mine suggested we buy and play this game because it was 75% off, just $3.75, and co-op. I saw it was Steam play and immediately text my brother and another friend. The four of us have been playing for a solid 6 hours of laughter, challenges, and fun.It seems that random game lobbies are sparse but do exist. So, you might be able to play with randoms. I suggest getting on some kind of voice chat.			"

												This is quite possibly, in my opinion of course, the greatest game I have ever played.  It has four very different and very fun classes, which you can switch between any time you want.  You can play it solo, or you can go co-op and play with both friends and strangers.  The game used to be almost entirely unplayable, as there were so many connection issues that it was impossible to play with others and this is an extremely co-op oriented game.  However, since then the devs have pretty much completely rewritten all network related code and spent a huge amount of time bug hunting, which shows a tremendous amount of dedication as this is the first and only game created by a new and very small company.  However, it did take a while for them to update it considering how much they had to fix, so many people who initially played the game have since forgotten it and not updated the reviews they left half a year ago, so the game's Steam rating is fairly inaccurate.If you like challenging, co-op based games that involve both problem solving and skill on an intense yet doable difficulty curve, I highly recommend this game.  However while you can play it casually, you will not get much out of it nor will you get very far, so if that's what you're looking for do NOT buy it.			"

												This is a fun co-op game where you can either play solo or with up to 3 other players (so 4 in total). Each player wields a different weapon. The further you progress, the more gems you get the more (passive and active) abilities you unlock and the more abilies you can equip (3 active and 3 passive abilties in total).This is basicly a puzzle game where you have to use your spirit mentor Balfus to activate or destroy items. Each person can summon this spirit to his/her current position, but while Balfus is moving to that location, another player might summon him and thus you can get very annoyed with each other :D Get ready to work as a team...

												I had fun playing this game. Having first played through the first few levels with some friends until we stopped for a while, I had decided to pick it back up on my own after a few years. Yeesh... this game is tough on your own!I found that many challenges took a lot of observation and some trial-and-error until I found the right setup of skills and passives to complete them. I never felt cheated or that it was impossible to do on my own, there was always a combination (along with some patience) that worked.You are given the choice to play as one of four gladiators, each with their own weapon type: archer, shield, hammer (AoE style), and dual blades (fast single-targeting). I played as the shield for most of the challenges, as he has the ability to heal himself while moving faster, reflect enemy attacks for a duration, make himself immune to damage (and immobile) for a while, and dash through enemies. Almost every level had me rearranging my abilities to complete them, and that's what kept me going; I never felt that I was doing the same thing every level.I'd highly recommend giving this game a shot. If you have some buddies to play it with, you'll have a blast. If you don't, this game is still a lot of fun on your own and is a good challenge.			"

												Force is a bit like a co op puzzle game and Gauntlet Legends. Quite fun actually, but I feel the challenge curve can vary wildly sometimes.I wish the system had more RPG elements, as it would allow certain parts to potentially be ""brute force"" instead of retried so often.Regardless, would definitely recommend the game for fans of Gauntlet Legends, and would still recommend it for most fans of the ARPG genre.

												Newly released on steam is a new indy action rpg game called Forced. It’s available for $14.99 and caught my eye. If you have not already seen it, check out the story of BetaDwarf. The makers of the game living together on a shoe string budget for the last few years (even eating together to save money) in order to fulfill their dreams is probably reason enough to plop down $15 on the game but luckily there’s more than just that to give it a try.Forced puts you in the role of a gladiator, who’s tribe is more or less only in existence to breed warriors who take on deadly challenges for the enjoyment of others. Now that you’re old enough to fight or whatnot you are sent into the halls of trials to await your destiny. Which is probably going to involve you being killed almost immediately. After a basic tutorial the game opens up into a series of challenges you can run each in growing complexity and difficulty. You have four classes of gear to chose from and the more challenges you complete the more skill points you unlock to become more and more powerful.As you get yourself into the game you will notice quite quickly, this game is HARD. But it’s not hard in a cheap OMG WHAT WAS THAT ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥T!?!? sort of way. No it’s hard because it is unforgivably difficult. The game doesn’t hold any punches and it hits you hard from early on and never lets up. You know how there are those crazy people who are addicted to spicy foods and must find the absolutely most spicy thing around? (Usually because they are addicted to endorphins) Well this game is like eating the spiciest of peppers with no milk to wash it down with. To a lot of us we’ll spit it out, frustrated by the game’s infuriating difficulty but there are some who will absolutely love it.Here’s the thing, with easy games you get less triumph from your successes. Sure they might give you a constant supply of ‘oh nice’ over and over again but eventually it doesn’t really feel like much accomplishment. Forced on the other hand is so brutally difficult that after failure after failure after failure when you finally succeed oh it feels so succulent, so sweet, so amazing. The game manages to walk a very fine line of being so difficult that success is amazingly rare while also giving you just enough hope that you might possibly figure out how to succeed, just maybe.One of the things I really like about Forced is the way they handle character progression. Yes there are four distinct classes to play but you can switch freely between them before each challenge. Also you can pick your skills freely each challenge as well. This makes choosing the class and what skills vitally important before each challenge as some are better at certain things than others. It’s also important to get familiar with each class as opposed to only playing one as you might be unnecessarily handicapping yourself in a challenge. The classes are fairly unique with a defender, a ranger, a brute heavy melee, and a faster more finesse melee. Each have their own weakness and strengths and if you are struggling with a challenge it might be time to switch up the classes or skill load out.Each challenge has three crystals (or skill points, really) available to be earned. The first is earned by simply defeating the challenge. A second is offered for doing some sort of optional skill mission and a third for completing the challenge in a certain amount of time. The more crystals you unlock the stronger your character gets, which should, in theory, make it easier to do more challenges. I like the skill system with active and passive abilities to chose from and having more options unlocked as you acquire more crystals. You are also able to have more skills active the as you go along, greatly increasing your character’s potency. Combat is also fairly smooth. Your character moves independently of the direction you’re aiming and combat uses a ‘mark’ gimmick. Each time you hit an enemy with your normal attack increases the effect of your special attack up to five times. So it’s best to prep enemies with normal attacks then hit them with specials, rinse and repeat. It’s fairly straight forward and works pretty well while adding extra tension as you try to get five marks on a big baddy before you unleash your awesome special attack.Now Forced is not without its flaws. I imagine the game would be really fun to play online (or really frustrating depending on who you play with.) But alas after trying a few times I was unable to connect to a game. I suspect the issue is probably with my firewall or something but just frustrating when internet connectivity gets in the way (seriously, why can’t online games just *work* these days?) Also if you change the controls the menus and options don’t update to match your custom control scheme which can get a wee bit annoying when trying to navigate menus or load out your skills. Also I’m not sure if it’s a big complaint or not but there is no loot in the game as the only rewards you get for completing quests are skill unlocking crystals. This can add even more frustration when you’re trying to unlock extra crystals and are unable to beat a challenge fast enough. I guess it is just how I am but darn-it I like loot!The game certainly looks a lot better than most indy games I’ve played recently. And everything is fairly smoothed and well polished. The challenges offer a fairly good variety and do a great job of mixing combat and puzzles. I can tell that the developers have put their heart and soul into the product and even though it is probably too difficult for me I can still appreciate their work. And it just feels so good to finally get a victory on a challenge that kicked my♥♥♥♥♥five times in a row! If you love a good challenge, get this game. If you can’t handle getting frustrated at a game, maybe you should pass.Final Score:Graphics: 8/10Game Play: 8/10Music / Ambiance: 8/10Story: 7/10Value: 9/10Overall: 8/10Read more indy game reviews on my blog!http://markofithian.com "

												Forced is an interesting take on a co-op hack and slash. The foundation of the game  is sort of like Gauntlet, a  top down game where you pick a class and then mow down mobs and move through the battle areana. But, fun as that is, that's not the point of the game. Each level has a puzzle or objective. Some of these are pretty tricky, and not only do you have to figure them out, but then you have to somehow execute that plan while still dealing with the monsters and fire being thrown at you. So, imagine solving group puzzles and tossing balls back and forth, all while trying to survive wave after wave of fairly difficult enemies.In any case this game makes for great co-op play, and while difficulty curve starts out gentle, it gets really high. This isn't a game you can just breeze through without a thought, it's a fun little co-op challenge.			"

												IMPORTANTE: Aunque en su momento era imposible jugarlo online, al fin parecen haberlo arreglado y puede jugarse sin problemas.Forced es un hack´n slash al que se juega al estilo ""diablo"". En un hack´n  slash y no un ARPG xq, si bien la mecanica de combate y el manejo es el mismo, en Forced vamos por el mundo aniquilando o que se nso pone por medio, looteando equipo y subiendo nivel, en su lugar tenemos que superar uan serie de pruebas y desafios, en las que si bien tendremos que aniquilar hordas de enemigos, lo importante será superar una serie de puzzles o enfrentarnos a dificultades añadidas en el  combate, con multitud de trampas, y otra serie de... complicaciones.El punto fuerte de Forced es su componente cooperativo (ni pensar en pillar el jeugo para jugar solo!) la compenetracion, comunicacion y trabajo en equipo no son una ""opcion ventajosa"" es una obligación.

												Well, its always doubting to buy a game with new concepts. Its still a good amount on money you have to spend on it. We did the purchase with 4 friends. And i have to say we all like the game. It was a good purchase. (i got it gifted, but still ;) )Now,I think its a good concept. A top faced hack and slasher puzzle game where you have to face diffrent trials. On each trail you can earn 3 crystals. One on completing, one on time, and one on a specific trial based challenge. The completion is not that hard. The time and challenge are sometimes a diffrent story ;) With the crystals you can upgrade your character to make other trials easyier. The game runs smoothly and has a very nice graphic lay out if you can put it on the highest settings. ( its not that hard for your computer) For the difficulty, like some people say its to hard. Well, in my opinion its not. Its just a good challenge. I like the dificulty.Its a great game, and it becomes better if you can play it with 2-3-4 players together and have some yelling over team speak :p A challenge for a gamer who wants to challenge his own game skills !

												Buy? Maybe.When I first heard of FORCED before it came out, I was definitely looking forward to playing it: At the time, the latest Gauntlet game wasn't announced and I loved the Gauntlet games from the N64 and Dreamcast systems that FORCED was inspired from and I've plunked hours into them just on single player.You don't play FORCED in singleplayer. Or rather you can, and it is very functional from the little bit that I have played, but it's is rather difficult in singleplayer and while it isn't unfair (just almost so) and I would compare it to ""old school Nintendo hard"" which is a good thing, but fustrating when trying to clear your backlog and just get through the next level. The worst part of this difficulty is that you level up by completeing challenges for each level: Completion challenge for completing the level, a special ""objective"" challenge for each level, and a time attack challenge. Many of these will not be completed by players on their first run of a level, such as avoiding certain enemies or attacks, or completing an optional level challenge. Completing the challenges give you crystals which tie in DIRECTLY to your ability to unlock new active and passive skills. Some of these challenges are probably easier with ""less players in your way"", but others feel like you need them. This creates a great reward for completng challenges, but is likely the reason why many players were scared off from FORCED. After all, I never bought this game due to hearing reviews about the difficulty and it wasn't until I was gifted this that I got to play this. Unfortunately, I never got a chance to play the game with the gifter or anybody else. Only a few of my friends have this game, and only a couple of them have played less than 2 hours of the game. There was only one online game when I checked, which denied my access to join. You will have to schedule a game with friends to play this co-op,.In conclusion, I really like the idea of combining almost Zelda-esque puzzles and Gauntlet gameplay. It works rather well here, though it can be quite annoying to manage a spirit to solve puzzles while in the heat of battle or harsh environmental conditions and level traps. The combat feels like what a modern interpretation of the Gauntlet games should feel like, however, the overall difficulty is probably what kept this game from being a big hit like Torchlight II or Castle Crashers - Not a ton of people know of this game and those that do aren't playing it. FORCED is missing the pick up and play casual feel of the Gauntlet games it is inspired by and because of this FORCED has slipped under the radar of most players and has stayed there.FORCED a good game, even perhaps a great game, but it is a hard recommendation for a game built around co-op with a dead player base. You should only buy this if you can get some other core gamers to play this with to completion - it is unlikely you will beat this with casual friends and family.			"

												I'm more of a solo player bun I have to say, you need to play Forced in Co-op. There are games that have Co-op tacked on by just increasing monster HP or numbers, and then there are games that change the mechanics completely when you play Co-op. I'm happy to say Forced is designed exceptionally well as a Co-op game. It's one of the most fun games I've ever played with a friend. On the first levels you might think ""Oh, only 3 active abilities and 3 passives, that's gonna get old pretty quick."" Well I can hapilly tell you that the number of buttons you can push will be the least of your worries. Almost every level has new mechanics. If it doesn't it will combine previously known mechanics in unexpected ways to kill you. In co-op the skill ceiling for each level is very high since coordination plays such a crucial role. The abilities and passives you get as each class also perform various roles and synergize well with both your other abilities and with those of your partners, making the execution of a combo that wipes out the room very satisfying and also quite necessary later on in the game.So if you enjoy amazing fight design, good class synergy and a coordinating with a friend I say pick this up. You won't regret it.			"

												I'm not sure how far I'd progress in this game single player but the multiplayer is a lot of fun and enphasizes teamwork in a way that can be alternately frustrating and rewarding. The level design so far is nice, the weapons varied, and the dialogue entertaining enough to make me want to continue. It's also a game that definitely benefits using a controller instead of WASD, provided you can map a key for push-to-talk on it. (Or have always on voice if that's your thing.)			"

												Great co-op game!  I played this LOCALLY with a gamepad and a keyboard.  Great controls on either end.  I found myself strategizing with my teammate(s) and generally having fun. Most levels after the first world (there are 4, I think) have an amazing level of difficulty.  Each level has three gems - beat the level, a ""challenge"" and a time trial. I generally skipped the time trial as that required you to really strategize in between waves and try over and over again to beat the level within the time limit.  Seemed like a waste of my gaming time to me, so I left it alone. however! Some of the challenges were actually really cool and most definitely add replayability.  For instance, a level would be about moving blocks around and solving a puzzle, killing some dudes, and then finding the end banner.  Easy enough, allows you to use your brain, and you get to fight quite a bit.  The challenge? Don't get hit by suicide monsters.  Adds some good challenge, but it isn't terribly difficult.  Strategy for those levels takes 1 minute or less, and a little bit of talking which is perfect.  Time trials are a different story - lots of strategy, retrying levels, and I would almost say are next to impossible with less than 3 players.In the end, I recommend this very highly to anyone that has even one other person they like to play games with. Netcode is great, no noticable lag, and steam has some great voice chat.Play!			"

												I have a very love hate relationship with this game. I unfortunately have only had the chance to play through the single player campaign, so I am not sure how much differs between it and multiplayer. In other words, what I say about it may not apply to the entire game, just the part I have played. Now this game is obviously geared towards multiplayer, which isn't bad but for those of us who prefer single player or can only do single player, it seems a bit unfair. Even in some of the dialogue it assumes there are multiple gladiators, rarely using singular terms when refering to them. But while it is probably more difficult to do this alone, it isn't impossible. Infuriating at times, yes, but possible. For those who have not played the game i'll try to sum up the gameplay real fast.There are four 'classes' you can chooe from, and unlike what you may be used to, you do not select it at the beginning, at least not permanently. You can switch between them before each trial. Of the four I have only used 3, but i've glanced over them all. There is the DPS dagger like gloves, with quick attacks. That one I never really used. There is the heavy hitter hammer which I ended up using a lot simply because of that. The shield I only used once for a challenge but he seems to be a tank like character, meant to avoid a lot of damage. Then there is the bow, the ranged attacker which I used almost as much as the hammer. Each trial may require you to use a different set of weapons, you can't just stick with one. And I mean that, I don't mean it'll just be more difficult, some areas I cannot see you doing without a certain character.An interesting mechanic the game brings into play is your spirit mentor, Balfus, a floating orb of light that acts as your guide and support. You can summon him to different locations, which you'll to do a lot as to activate altars you have to make him pass through them. These altars can do any number of things, some are required to be activated to continue the level, some give Balfus a healing aura, while another will actually push enemies away and much more. I really liked this mechanic as at times it required you to do some thinking, which is a nice break from the usual hack and slash. I just wish there were more puzzles that required extra thought beyond the second area. Balfus will also give you advice and tell you about new additions to the trials as they appear. However. One of my biggest gripes is that there are times where his advice and warnings come after the fact. For example, there is a part in the second boss in the very beginning where something is happening to Balfus but he says nothing. And if you stay close to him, you end up caught in a shockwave that damages you. No warning, nothing. Not until LATER does he warn you of the dark pulsing. And then there are times where he doesn't say anything at all and you have to figure things out on your own, like in the third boss with the eggs.You do not level up like you would in a normal game, instead you unlock new skills and skill slots by completing challenges and gathering crystals from them. There are three crystals in each trial, one for beating the trial, another for completing that trial's challenge, and the last one is for the time trials. I'm not sure if there are different challenges in multiplayer, nor do I know how the time trials scale with more characters, but at least in singleplayer they do not waste time in making them difficult to complete, and expect to experiment with different characters to be able to complete them. And some of these challenges are quite infuriating. And don't expect to be able to get by with just completing the levels because the final trial has a requirement of, at least in singleplayer, 40 crystals. These can be difficult to get and require a lot of patience(or sheer stubborness).Now there are some things I had a problem with regarding the classes. Each one has the same amount of health, armor and speed. The dagger and archer should be much faster then the shield or hammer in movement speed, it only makes sense and you are punished for using the archer because many enemies are much faster then you, even if you are running full speed(which requires you to move your mouse in the direction your gladiator is facing btw). What makes this more annoying is that while the weakest enemies don't do a ton of damage, each hit slows you down even further. So good luck on those time trials where you have to try and avoid enemies, you'll be doing them a lot. I also have yet to see any other character besides archer being able to safetly despose of those exploding enemies without the use of a skill, which while those skills help they don't do much in situations where there are lot of them and you can't just run away till the cooldown is finished because, that's right, they're faster and will catch up with you. This is where I started to feel like the scaling for single player wasn't quite right.What caused me the most grief, however, were the challenges. By the end of it all I was ready to slam my laptop against the wall. These trials require absolute perfection at times, sometimes being borderline impossible. And since it requires you to get an extra 15 crystals to get to the final boss you have no choice but doing some of the most difficult ones. I'd suggest not doing what I did by finishing this game in one seven hour sitting, and instead do these challenges in spurts, for the sake of your sanity.Speaking of the final boss, and i'm not going to spoil anything, I have to say it was my favorite part of the whole game. The game's music is great, but the music for the final boss really got me into the mood, it made me feel like I was in the middle of a legendary struggle, so much that even after all the frustration that had been built up prior to it, I didn't rage once at a death no matter how close I came to defeating him that run. Unfortunately it is where I encountered the only bug I found in the entire game, and made the last half of the fight childs play(he got stuck running in place in the middle of the room). However I still left that boss fight feeling accomplished, which is what really matters in the end.Now my favorite aspect of the game was not the gameplay, but rather the voice acting and story. Yes, the story isn't the main focus of the game, just a given reason to explain why you are doing all this, but I really enjoyed the bits of it you got after every trial. And the voice acting was just wonderful. Balfus was masterfuly done in my opinion, which is good considering he's with you the entirety of the game. However, while I do enjoy the story, it never felt complete. Slight spoilers in this next bit, i'll mark it for those who want to avoid it.Balfus makes mention of these being the 'new guardians' and this master being the 'new master'. But never makes mention to what happened to the previous ones, or how these new ones rose to power. It's left unanswered which leaves you wondering why they even bothered mentioning it in the first place. Unless there is something extra I am missing.For all my gripes and frustration with this game, it is actually quite good and i'd recommend it to play with friends, but only do challenge if you have extreme patience or like that kind of challenge. It's a challenge experience but one that draws you in and makes you want to complete it and it never feels old, you are always coming across something new and fresh in each trial. So if you are a very casual gamer, i'd stay away, but if you are one who likes being challenged, go for it.			"

												Well not bad. But if you got pulled in cause of the interesting combat system, and thought it was cool. You are gonna get some disappointment. They rely heavily on a puzzle solving mechanic, which controls like an octogenerian. Which is sad cause it makes some of the more interesting battle challenges be over way too fast. Im giving this a no recommendation. Because it pulls you in as an action packed game. And it is but it is also way too much a puzzler that controls really slow and annoying.			"

By this, I mean you can grow you char by a lot of ways, but only when you did things well enought to earn the point you need.

												I totally recommend this game, even though (and perhaps just exactly why) some levels are CRAZY hard (even annoying a times). The central element of the game lies in swapping between the different characters and maybe even changing the number of people playing (I finished all trials with in 2player, except for the second-to-last one, which I did alone).Graphics and music are standard in quality, nothing extraordinary, the story even a little sub-standard, but that's not quite the point with games like this one.The only annoying technical aspect is the network performance, which, even though it was improved with just about every update, still isn't perfect now.All in all, I award this game 4.5 stars, the half one being lost because of the lagging issues, the weak story and because some trials are just too hard.

												Man, I've played a ton of puzzle games in my days, but this one takes the cake. So get this. You get to choose 1 of 4 classes, all with unique abilities and such, and up to 4 people can play together. Every level has some kind of catch to it. Some are timed, some have puzzles you have to solve, and some spawn enemies constantly unless youcan find out how to stop them. After every 5-6 levels, there's a boss. The bosses are freakin cool as hell. And the combat is awesome. Those abilities I talked about? You unlock more by doing better in the puzzles. The only downside I can think of is that you are constantly followed by WIsp from DotA 2. And he talks. Wisp doesnt talk, he makes bleepbloop sounds. Stupid Wisp, learn your place.			"

												Brilliant game.  Simple mechanics implemented well.  With recent netcode fixes the game works well even on Australian internet connections (if you have a host with good upload ;)).One of the best co-op games I've played in years, and it can be played in small doses.  If you're missing Guardian of Light (and waiting for the sequel), pick this up.			"

												A very interesting game. Not the best I've ever played but surely provides a great co-op experience.Playing it solo doesn't show even a little of what this game can be, the combination of the characters powers and weaknesses make this game an awesome multiplayer co-op challenge. I strongly recommend it.			"

												was expecting more of a baldur's gate: dark alliance type game. this game is not a story driven RPG, rather its driven by completing challenges or trials. gameplay is redundant and only recommended if you play with friends. single player action is one of the most boring things you can do in your life with this game. there are NO weapon upgrades or armor upgrades. basically you choose which type of character you want to play when you begin a trial and thats it. you just go through the trial, pass, come back to the trial entry area. 5/10. 2 pts for making the graphics look ok, 2 pts for attempts at humour, 1 pt for making it co op at least. if i listed plot or dialogue this game would start to fall below the 0 mark.

												Force is a bit like a co op puzzle game and Gauntlet Legends. Quite fun actually, but I feel the challenge curve can vary wildly sometimes.I wish the system had more RPG elements, as it would allow certain parts to potentially be ""brute force"" instead of retried so often.Regardless, would definitely recommend the game for fans of Gauntlet Legends, and would still recommend it for most fans of the ARPG genre.

												This is a pretty cool game, with some annoying issues. You (and a few others if you play online) must complete a series of challenges to advance. You're afforded the choice of four different weapons - they all play quite differently and come with their own set of abilities and buffs. And each challenge gives you up to three crystals, and when you get a number of crystals, you get new abilities. It's a pretty unique take on this type of game, as you can't really 'grind' to level up, at most you can get a couple new buffs to help yourself out, if you master previous challenges. Because of this, it comes down more to strategy and skill, and can become quite fun in some segments. Sometimes, however, things can be a pain in the butt. Certain challenges or bosses seem to combine the most annoying parts of the game all in one, in seemingly unfair ways. And though the game says that it's balanced for either 1-4 players, more players simply make it easier in so many ways. That said, I really enjoyed the game, when it wasn't being irritating, and would recommend it to others who are looking for a challenging title to play along with friends.			"

												One of the best LOCAL CO-OP games, I wish it had more content though. At some point missions get too hard to complete and you get nothing for trying the mission over and over again. The problem is, every try is pretty much the same as you get no drops no buffs nothing different. Same script every time. So as long as you progress, you enjoy it. As soon as you stop, you switch to other game.Overall, not epic indeed, yet I still like this game and would buy it again. I hope for expansion.			"

												I'm more of a solo player bun I have to say, you need to play Forced in Co-op. There are games that have Co-op tacked on by just increasing monster HP or numbers, and then there are games that change the mechanics completely when you play Co-op. I'm happy to say Forced is designed exceptionally well as a Co-op game. It's one of the most fun games I've ever played with a friend. On the first levels you might think ""Oh, only 3 active abilities and 3 passives, that's gonna get old pretty quick."" Well I can hapilly tell you that the number of buttons you can push will be the least of your worries. Almost every level has new mechanics. If it doesn't it will combine previously known mechanics in unexpected ways to kill you. In co-op the skill ceiling for each level is very high since coordination plays such a crucial role. The abilities and passives you get as each class also perform various roles and synergize well with both your other abilities and with those of your partners, making the execution of a combo that wipes out the room very satisfying and also quite necessary later on in the game.So if you enjoy amazing fight design, good class synergy and a coordinating with a friend I say pick this up. You won't regret it.			"

												Great co-op game!  I played this LOCALLY with a gamepad and a keyboard.  Great controls on either end.  I found myself strategizing with my teammate(s) and generally having fun. Most levels after the first world (there are 4, I think) have an amazing level of difficulty.  Each level has three gems - beat the level, a ""challenge"" and a time trial. I generally skipped the time trial as that required you to really strategize in between waves and try over and over again to beat the level within the time limit.  Seemed like a waste of my gaming time to me, so I left it alone. however! Some of the challenges were actually really cool and most definitely add replayability.  For instance, a level would be about moving blocks around and solving a puzzle, killing some dudes, and then finding the end banner.  Easy enough, allows you to use your brain, and you get to fight quite a bit.  The challenge? Don't get hit by suicide monsters.  Adds some good challenge, but it isn't terribly difficult.  Strategy for those levels takes 1 minute or less, and a little bit of talking which is perfect.  Time trials are a different story - lots of strategy, retrying levels, and I would almost say are next to impossible with less than 3 players.In the end, I recommend this very highly to anyone that has even one other person they like to play games with. Netcode is great, no noticable lag, and steam has some great voice chat.Play!			"

												Very good Co-op, one of the best in a while.  After the ""tutorial"" levels it ramps up in difficulty quickly and won't disapoint people looking for a challenge.  As a retired raider this is the closest I've felt to the thrill of raiding without the commitment in a long time.			"

												A good idea for an Action RPG. The game is designed for 2 or more players, and is great fun with friends. Having the ""Orb"" to control for unlocking areas and activating traps requires some concentration and co-ordination, so the puzzles are challenging. The game has a beat-em-up feel and combat is quite satisfying.			"

												Finally one more game to add to my local coop game collection. It works with up to 4 players on one PC. And not a bad one either. I expected a little more senseless hack and slaying with a little less puzzling but it's really fun to get the challenges done in order to earn more skill points. Good concept, worth the money!			"

												This game is amazing for co-op. Action and puzzles are difficult in a good way. They gradually get more challenging and there are times when I just laugh with joy from dying because I had so much fun trying. It is definately a game based on player skill and the more players you have the more fun it is... because that just means more bad guys come streaming out at you! There is also a survival mode that I've not even tried yet because I've been too busy enjoying co-op campaign. Really fun and worth the low cost :)			"

												This is a pretty cool game, with some annoying issues. You (and a few others if you play online) must complete a series of challenges to advance. You're afforded the choice of four different weapons - they all play quite differently and come with their own set of abilities and buffs. And each challenge gives you up to three crystals, and when you get a number of crystals, you get new abilities. It's a pretty unique take on this type of game, as you can't really 'grind' to level up, at most you can get a couple new buffs to help yourself out, if you master previous challenges. Because of this, it comes down more to strategy and skill, and can become quite fun in some segments. Sometimes, however, things can be a pain in the butt. Certain challenges or bosses seem to combine the most annoying parts of the game all in one, in seemingly unfair ways. And though the game says that it's balanced for either 1-4 players, more players simply make it easier in so many ways. That said, I really enjoyed the game, when it wasn't being irritating, and would recommend it to others who are looking for a challenging title to play along with friends.			"

												Pretty fun!Basic gameplay is simple but fun, the combat system is not really that deep but has nice gimmicks. The presentation is really polished, there's non-grindy customization and coop is entertaining (don't buy for the singleplayer experience). Survival mode is a bit frustrating because I am bad at not ♥♥♥♥ing up and having to replay the slow starting bits.Overall I'd have preferred more engaging and varied combat challenges and less gimmicky puzzles, though the way the puzzly bits integrate with the fighty bits is nice. The good parts are kind of like WoW boss fights with frantic gimmick management while half the party gets eaten by ghouls. Hoping they'll churn out more content that's less linear and ""do the thing, then do the thing again with a gimmick, then do the thing again within 3 minutes""-focused.We had some weird technical issues with the game silencing mumble(???) on Windows. Steam voice or skype or whatever worked fine. The game runs flawlessly on Linux, though I haven't tried it with a gamepad.			"

Having tried to play this alone it's either stomping the level or borderline if not entire impossible to complete some levels. Still, if you have some folks to play with it's great fun, so much trolling around with the puzzles and whatnot and it gets really disorienting when you're trying to do a fight which involves rotating a mechanic between your group to avoid getting melted by a boss fight.I doubt I'd come back to this after a while, though still it's some good hours spent with friends.

It's like Skyrim, but with football, and zergling rushes, and EPIC RAGEQUITS and yelling in disappointment when you didn't get the time medal, and yelling in victory when you finally beat the level after 5 or 6 tries... seriously this is a great party game. I say seriously a lot...I would say only buy the 4-pack, send it to your friends or siblings who you see a lot, then bug them to pay you back.

												This game gets the principle of cooperating and lets you get killed by your greedy friends, whenever they want to be in advantage. What do I mean by that? Well, one basic thing about the gameplay is that the party carries one ""spiritual guide"", in form of a spectre, that has a specific range line. All members must stay inside that range otherwise they'll start losing health until dying. Do I have to say what happens when your teammates leave you behind and pull the spectre for their direction? :3 10/10 would make them eat dust again			"

Posted: July 8, 2014
												I have a very love hate relationship with this game. I unfortunately have only had the chance to play through the single player campaign, so I am not sure how much differs between it and multiplayer. In other words, what I say about it may not apply to the entire game, just the part I have played. Now this game is obviously geared towards multiplayer, which isn't bad but for those of us who prefer single player or can only do single player, it seems a bit unfair. Even in some of the dialogue it assumes there are multiple gladiators, rarely using singular terms when refering to them. But while it is probably more difficult to do this alone, it isn't impossible. Infuriating at times, yes, but possible. For those who have not played the game i'll try to sum up the gameplay real fast.There are four 'classes' you can chooe from, and unlike what you may be used to, you do not select it at the beginning, at least not permanently. You can switch between them before each trial. Of the four I have only used 3, but i've glanced over them all. There is the DPS dagger like gloves, with quick attacks. That one I never really used. There is the heavy hitter hammer which I ended up using a lot simply because of that. The shield I only used once for a challenge but he seems to be a tank like character, meant to avoid a lot of damage. Then there is the bow, the ranged attacker which I used almost as much as the hammer. Each trial may require you to use a different set of weapons, you can't just stick with one. And I mean that, I don't mean it'll just be more difficult, some areas I cannot see you doing without a certain character.An interesting mechanic the game brings into play is your spirit mentor, Balfus, a floating orb of light that acts as your guide and support. You can summon him to different locations, which you'll to do a lot as to activate altars you have to make him pass through them. These altars can do any number of things, some are required to be activated to continue the level, some give Balfus a healing aura, while another will actually push enemies away and much more. I really liked this mechanic as at times it required you to do some thinking, which is a nice break from the usual hack and slash. I just wish there were more puzzles that required extra thought beyond the second area. Balfus will also give you advice and tell you about new additions to the trials as they appear. However. One of my biggest gripes is that there are times where his advice and warnings come after the fact. For example, there is a part in the second boss in the very beginning where something is happening to Balfus but he says nothing. And if you stay close to him, you end up caught in a shockwave that damages you. No warning, nothing. Not until LATER does he warn you of the dark pulsing. And then there are times where he doesn't say anything at all and you have to figure things out on your own, like in the third boss with the eggs.You do not level up like you would in a normal game, instead you unlock new skills and skill slots by completing challenges and gathering crystals from them. There are three crystals in each trial, one for beating the trial, another for completing that trial's challenge, and the last one is for the time trials. I'm not sure if there are different challenges in multiplayer, nor do I know how the time trials scale with more characters, but at least in singleplayer they do not waste time in making them difficult to complete, and expect to experiment with different characters to be able to complete them. And some of these challenges are quite infuriating. And don't expect to be able to get by with just completing the levels because the final trial has a requirement of, at least in singleplayer, 40 crystals. These can be difficult to get and require a lot of patience(or sheer stubborness).Now there are some things I had a problem with regarding the classes. Each one has the same amount of health, armor and speed. The dagger and archer should be much faster then the shield or hammer in movement speed, it only makes sense and you are punished for using the archer because many enemies are much faster then you, even if you are running full speed(which requires you to move your mouse in the direction your gladiator is facing btw). What makes this more annoying is that while the weakest enemies don't do a ton of damage, each hit slows you down even further. So good luck on those time trials where you have to try and avoid enemies, you'll be doing them a lot. I also have yet to see any other character besides archer being able to safetly despose of those exploding enemies without the use of a skill, which while those skills help they don't do much in situations where there are lot of them and you can't just run away till the cooldown is finished because, that's right, they're faster and will catch up with you. This is where I started to feel like the scaling for single player wasn't quite right.What caused me the most grief, however, were the challenges. By the end of it all I was ready to slam my laptop against the wall. These trials require absolute perfection at times, sometimes being borderline impossible. And since it requires you to get an extra 15 crystals to get to the final boss you have no choice but doing some of the most difficult ones. I'd suggest not doing what I did by finishing this game in one seven hour sitting, and instead do these challenges in spurts, for the sake of your sanity.Speaking of the final boss, and i'm not going to spoil anything, I have to say it was my favorite part of the whole game. The game's music is great, but the music for the final boss really got me into the mood, it made me feel like I was in the middle of a legendary struggle, so much that even after all the frustration that had been built up prior to it, I didn't rage once at a death no matter how close I came to defeating him that run. Unfortunately it is where I encountered the only bug I found in the entire game, and made the last half of the fight childs play(he got stuck running in place in the middle of the room). However I still left that boss fight feeling accomplished, which is what really matters in the end.Now my favorite aspect of the game was not the gameplay, but rather the voice acting and story. Yes, the story isn't the main focus of the game, just a given reason to explain why you are doing all this, but I really enjoyed the bits of it you got after every trial. And the voice acting was just wonderful. Balfus was masterfuly done in my opinion, which is good considering he's with you the entirety of the game. However, while I do enjoy the story, it never felt complete. Slight spoilers in this next bit, i'll mark it for those who want to avoid it.Balfus makes mention of these being the 'new guardians' and this master being the 'new master'. But never makes mention to what happened to the previous ones, or how these new ones rose to power. It's left unanswered which leaves you wondering why they even bothered mentioning it in the first place. Unless there is something extra I am missing.For all my gripes and frustration with this game, it is actually quite good and i'd recommend it to play with friends, but only do challenge if you have extreme patience or like that kind of challenge. It's a challenge experience but one that draws you in and makes you want to complete it and it never feels old, you are always coming across something new and fresh in each trial. So if you are a very casual gamer, i'd stay away, but if you are one who likes being challenged, go for it.			"

												Buy? Maybe.When I first heard of FORCED before it came out, I was definitely looking forward to playing it: At the time, the latest Gauntlet game wasn't announced and I loved the Gauntlet games from the N64 and Dreamcast systems that FORCED was inspired from and I've plunked hours into them just on single player.You don't play FORCED in singleplayer. Or rather you can, and it is very functional from the little bit that I have played, but it's is rather difficult in singleplayer and while it isn't unfair (just almost so) and I would compare it to ""old school Nintendo hard"" which is a good thing, but fustrating when trying to clear your backlog and just get through the next level. The worst part of this difficulty is that you level up by completeing challenges for each level: Completion challenge for completing the level, a special ""objective"" challenge for each level, and a time attack challenge. Many of these will not be completed by players on their first run of a level, such as avoiding certain enemies or attacks, or completing an optional level challenge. Completing the challenges give you crystals which tie in DIRECTLY to your ability to unlock new active and passive skills. Some of these challenges are probably easier with ""less players in your way"", but others feel like you need them. This creates a great reward for completng challenges, but is likely the reason why many players were scared off from FORCED. After all, I never bought this game due to hearing reviews about the difficulty and it wasn't until I was gifted this that I got to play this. Unfortunately, I never got a chance to play the game with the gifter or anybody else. Only a few of my friends have this game, and only a couple of them have played less than 2 hours of the game. There was only one online game when I checked, which denied my access to join. You will have to schedule a game with friends to play this co-op,.In conclusion, I really like the idea of combining almost Zelda-esque puzzles and Gauntlet gameplay. It works rather well here, though it can be quite annoying to manage a spirit to solve puzzles while in the heat of battle or harsh environmental conditions and level traps. The combat feels like what a modern interpretation of the Gauntlet games should feel like, however, the overall difficulty is probably what kept this game from being a big hit like Torchlight II or Castle Crashers - Not a ton of people know of this game and those that do aren't playing it. FORCED is missing the pick up and play casual feel of the Gauntlet games it is inspired by and because of this FORCED has slipped under the radar of most players and has stayed there.FORCED a good game, even perhaps a great game, but it is a hard recommendation for a game built around co-op with a dead player base. You should only buy this if you can get some other core gamers to play this with to completion - it is unlikely you will beat this with casual friends and family.			"

Try this game, you'll find a way of meaning to the word challenge. You need to be quick, accurate, and you deserve what you got. By this, I mean you can grow you char by a lot of ways, but only when you did things well enought to earn the point you need. This isn't a level up system, this is a ""you performed well enought, you are worthy, so take this gift, you'll need it soon and for long"" system, and this feels GREAT !			"

												A fun multiplayer gauntlet-styled game, with unique characters.  Each level has three gems you can earn (very crash bandicoot-esque), which are used to unlock new skills.

												If you're a fan of Diablo-aspect dark fantasy games, you will like this; if you're also a tower defense fan, you will love it. You will seriously molest this game. If you're not into those things, maybe not so much; but it's well put together and if you've got the scratch and nothing else to do with it, it's still not a bad thing to have on hand.			"

												Great co-op game!  I played this LOCALLY with a gamepad and a keyboard.  Great controls on either end.  I found myself strategizing with my teammate(s) and generally having fun. Most levels after the first world (there are 4, I think) have an amazing level of difficulty.  Each level has three gems - beat the level, a ""challenge"" and a time trial. I generally skipped the time trial as that required you to really strategize in between waves and try over and over again to beat the level within the time limit.  Seemed like a waste of my gaming time to me, so I left it alone. however! Some of the challenges were actually really cool and most definitely add replayability.  For instance, a level would be about moving blocks around and solving a puzzle, killing some dudes, and then finding the end banner.  Easy enough, allows you to use your brain, and you get to fight quite a bit.  The challenge? Don't get hit by suicide monsters.  Adds some good challenge, but it isn't terribly difficult.  Strategy for those levels takes 1 minute or less, and a little bit of talking which is perfect.  Time trials are a different story - lots of strategy, retrying levels, and I would almost say are next to impossible with less than 3 players.In the end, I recommend this very highly to anyone that has even one other person they like to play games with. Netcode is great, no noticable lag, and steam has some great voice chat.Play!			"

												I am impressed by this little indie game. Betadwarf knocked this one out of the park. I like challenging and difficult games. It's been a while since my friends and I have had a good co-op game to play together and we've spent the majority of the past week playing it non-stop. My OCD/completionist nature kicks into high gear for the challenge and time objectives of each mission. I cannot move on to the next trial without completing its predecessor in its entirety. Forced is highly recommended to those who like a challenge and/or complex cooperative play.More Here: http://www.pixlmuse.com/blog/review-forced "

												+Coop+Coop+4 players Coop!Oh My God, isn't it the best coop experience I've had EVER!Imagine the combination of Diablo III (mechanics), Trine 2 (puzzles), Orianna from LoL (a floating ball that you share and control) and add arenas into the mixture. You'll get the idea of FORCED. The game is easy to learn, but hard to master, The level of difficulty is well balanced, which allows you to get basic rewards from maps without greater difficulty. Should you want extra prize... You'll have to think - hard. And be good with your controller.I've spent couple of hours playing just one map with my brother and, surprisingly, we did not get bored! And the satisfaction after beating it... I hadn't felt such satisfaction while playing a video game for a long time!This is a perfect option for you, if you are (just like me) a fan of coop games, where the aspect of coperation is really vital. If you like light coop games, where you can mke it solo without a problem (like Serious Sam 3), you might get discouraged by FORCED after some time.Nonetheless, I think I will spend much more time in puzzling arcades of FORCED, without FORCING myself to do that!See you in-game! :) "

												was expecting more of a baldur's gate: dark alliance type game. this game is not a story driven RPG, rather its driven by completing challenges or trials. gameplay is redundant and only recommended if you play with friends. single player action is one of the most boring things you can do in your life with this game. there are NO weapon upgrades or armor upgrades. basically you choose which type of character you want to play when you begin a trial and thats it. you just go through the trial, pass, come back to the trial entry area. 5/10. 2 pts for making the graphics look ok, 2 pts for attempts at humour, 1 pt for making it co op at least. if i listed plot or dialogue this game would start to fall below the 0 mark.

												Great, challenging gameplay.As you complete challenges, rewards are shared by all classes, which you can change before any challenege.Writing is decent, graphics are beautiful, and diverse abilities between classes mean that each challenge can be completed with several different strategies, and you will need to learn them pretty damn well to be able to complete some of the harder time trials or special requests.While built for multiplayer, still a very fulfilling single player experience!Also, runs very smoothly on my 6YO laptop (meets minimum requirements, haha...) on medium graphics. Some particle effects cause a bit of lag, but in general the experience is fluid and fast.			"

This game consist of 4 stages, 25 levels with 3 gems: 1 for completion, 1 for a challenge, and 1 for time.

												This is Danish dynamite! The game is really hart to beat but lots of fun! Yet challenging it never gets unfair for there is a way to master the tasks given. And - I guess it is the most important fact - it is impossible to win the game without your team. This is not a lame phrase but virtually the truth because sometimes you have to solve ridles while timing your movement avoiding death traps and combating enemies meanwhile. There is so much going on that you have no time to pause for you'll get exhausted. Often your friends are the reason for failing or dying which in many cases is the reason for failing. I guess casual gamers will be frustrated very fast but everyone who loves a challenging coop will love this one. Give it a try, it is worth the effort.Pros+ 4x Unique characters where no one is useless+ Very broad diversification of level design+ Great ideas and good humor+ You have to solve riddles by yourself with nearly no tipps given+ Balfus (players of the game will know why)+ Challenging but not unfair (may seem so at first but it is not, watch yt vids if you do not believe it)+ Extremly well balanced+ Fast matches of only some minutes (yet you will play for longer I'm sure)Cons- No double characters in the team- Skilltrees are somehow small and many skills do not seem usefull (or my team is just dumb)- The great game controls sometime need a really perfect timing- Some more monster types would have been niceOverall:Give it a try! It is a small Danish team who created an innovative, fast playing coop! They need our money and this game is worth every penny. I even bought copies for my friends who love the game as well.			"

												Clever and challenging action rpg but best played with 4 friends. Bought the 4 pack during the last steam sale and had a blast going through the levels. Each level is a cleverly designed arena with unique challenges. While difficult to beat the first time, each level also has a time trial and a bonus objective to complete. Beating levels, clearing under a time limit, and completing the bonus objective provides gems which unlock upgrades. Upgrades are unlocked at gem levels, so you can switch between any of the 4 playable characters at any time. Almost all the upgrades are useful and unique, so different players can have very different styles even with the same character.My only complaint about the game is that one of the later levels appears to be bugged in multiplayer and can't be completed.

												Despite lack of extensive customization aside from skills and the digital deluxe content, FORCED is the pinnacle of multiplayer co-op. The game both rewards and punishes you for bringing in friends - the enemy difficulty increases to keep up, but the puzzles are infinitely easier to deal with. Although from first glance this may seem like a simple hack-and-slash, this game goes far beyond that. Definitely recommended. Even better if you have friends to play it with.			"

Quite fun actually, but I feel the challenge curve can vary wildly sometimes.I wish the system had more RPG elements, as it would allow certain parts to potentially be ""brute force"" instead of retried so often.Regardless, would definitely recommend the game for fans of Gauntlet Legends, and would still recommend it for most fans of the ARPG genre.

												Do you hate using the mouse to both move and attack?Well FORCED is for you.The first thing you should know is that this isn't a straight up Diablo clone. The game takes place in many small trials that could take minutes to complete. Each trial contains puzzles and enemy encounters. Although usually boss rooms don't contain many puzzles.The pick up and play gameplay is definitely something that keeps me coming back for more. Also there are four classes with different skills, but they all level at the same time and you can jump between them. Which is nice, although I'm not quite sure how balanced this is.			"

												Had to buy after hearing the story on how it was made and the good reviews. So far I'm very impressed at how well they made coop work in every aspect of the game. You got a little spirit that you have to use to trigger certain events on the level you are on and all attacks work together with your teammates. It's also a game that you CAN beat with the bare minimum of skill but if you are really good and can complete a lot of challenges then it rewards you with more attacks/passives and increased slots. Super fun and wish more people had it because it works best with 4 people :)			"

Anyway, due to refund system, it's worth a try.			"

												Great Co-op game! The challenges are really balanced, the further you progress in the game. It also scales really well depending on how many friends you are playing with. I would recommend this game to people who likes a challenge, and likes to play co-op with their friends.			"

												Very challenging and requires good teamwork.  Bad side is that you get new skills but often your old skills are better than the new ones.			"

												Really well made coop game that requires lightning reactions. Found it quite addictive - probably even better when played with friends rather than just the single player. You MUST read the devs story: http://forcedthegame.com/story.			"

												Nominated this for the extra steam award I made up called ""Because you don't always like playing wtih yourself"" award, due to the excellent co-op gameplay of this game. Grab a few friends and you'll have a fantastic time playing this game together, as long as everyone invests in the value of teamwork in every situation and tries hard. Great game, especially after they worked out the disconnection kinks.			"

												One of the few true co-op games.You actually have to work together to succeed.Be warned though: this game will ruin friendships.Every tiny mistake will gnaw at your bond until there is nothing left.Some of the optional challenges are insanely difficult and will wreck nerves of even the most steadfast player.

												This game apparently lacked a game designer. There is a reason there are never any coop games listed. It's fun for a few levels purely for the novelty and then degenerates into a pile of visual noise and ""SPACE"" sprawled across your screen.			"

												I stumbled across FORCED when it was still in ""early access"" state.It was in these ""dark days"" where games would rarely see a native Linux port, so those few who did immediately drew my attention.I did not really know of what to expect of it, but it offered a Linux version, local coop and showcased some promising screenshots, so I decided to give it a shot -  which I have yet to regret.After playing a few levels I became aware of the fact that FORCED was about to become one of the ""most precious gems"" of my entire game collection!It offers interesting and unique game mechanics, that are easy to learn, yet hard to master - Just like a perfect game ought to be like!Moreover there is a strong focus on coop strategies which has ever since been an important aspect of video games for me.Thanks to the BetaDwarf team for creating  such an experience!I really enjoy your game and I am looking forward to buy addons or even a successor of FORCED some day ;-)			"

You might like if: You have the endurance to master grim, gladiatorial combat; either solo or with a tightly-knit team of friends who are willing to die a lot.Forced is a very polished game, both in its concept and execution. You play as 1-4 victims, moving targets, corpses-to-be... Gladiators subject to arenas spanning a superb mix of combat, puzzles and planning. The ability to align yourself to 1 of 4 weapons is also pretty fun - particularly mixing and matching different abilities and passive bonuses. Just be aware that, in my experience, some builds (or even weapons) tend to favour certain levels more than others - so be prepared to alter your build to beat each level, as opposed to finding a single, favourite combo to play the whole game with.The levels are delightfully varied and have their own unique twist. The 3 challenges (and rewards) for each level are also a great touch: 1 for just winning, 1 for beating the time limit and 1 for overcoming a special condition. As such, there's a lot to do and a lot to master.But therein lies the catch, it's gladiatorial in more ways than one... it's bloody difficult. After the first level or 2, the ante quickly ramps up and you need to be quick on your feet, well-coordinated and honed to a fine edge. So expect to die a fair bit and understand that completing all the challenges will require a fair bit of practice (or outright stubbornness).This, too, applies to co-op; this is most definitely a cooperative game... not a party game. The game scales the number of enemies, time challenges and even puzzles with the more players you have, so the difficulty is always there. Unfortunately this means that your team will all equally need to be sharp and willing to put in the time and communication to master the levels. The game will unceremoniously prune weaker players, leaving a harder level for everyone else - which can quickly kill the fun for casual gamers. As such, single player is considerably more enjoyable than playing with an uncoordinated team, so bear this in mind if you're looking for multiplayer games to share with your gaming buddies.The final catch is that (annoyingly) the network connections between players can be a little inconsistent (though this was a few years ago). I could easily create a party of 2 players - but would always have trouble getting the 3rd on board. A bit frustrating for a game specialised for co-op.But playing solo, I've find this to be a very enjoyable and varied challenge... if a little intense at times. It's unforgiving but equally rewarding when you nail it. One to dip into when you really fancy a tough gaming wall to climb.			"
