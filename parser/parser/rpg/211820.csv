												For people who like story, or fast, reaction-based gameplay, this game isnt for you.With over 200 hours on this game, i have come to a conclusion. You don't play this game for the end goal of saving the universe. you play this game for the journey it takes you on. I realised this when I was playing with friends, and we where doing nothing but sitting around a campfire on logs playing music on our instruments that this was my favroite game. If a game can make sitting around a campfire an experience that is memorable, it has to be doing something right.10/10, hands down.			"

												See my hours? I know this game, and i know that i say it's by no reach a perfect game or a horrible one.Congrats Chucklefish, if i could give a neutral review i would, consider this a close passmark of a release and even though this review is positive i'm still going to lay it down on you.After spending years in early access most people assumed it would never be released and that the devs abandoned, they didn't and in fact were actively working on it throughout the time it was in early access. Their only major falter was the lack of finalized updates. I would by lying if i said i didn't at least once or twice feel angry or ripped off by Chucklefish. After all its not the money we paid, but the promises we paid for. Development is slow, very slow.PROS:+You will probably spend at least 100> hours exploring and getting your gameplays worth.+Can capture any monster you find on a planet and use it as a pet (yes, its like Pokemon, but in space).+Procedurally generated weapons, very good ones too, you will be surprised at the variety of attacks and designs.+Building is easy, wiring is easy, painting is easy and there are hundreds upon hundreds of different blocks and decorations.+7 Starter races that are diverse and unique.+Modding support for this game is well maintained.+(near) Infinite planets that never have the same two types of monster or buildings.+Multiplayer through steam, easy to connect via the client (can be very laggy).+Professions are chosen by the player, you can play how you want HOWEVER some professions are blatantly more fun or better than others. The Farmer will never have that awesome shotgun the explorer does or the armor the miner has.+OST is amazing +Active devs, who also listen a fair bit to the community. Might even find them in the Discord or IIRC.+Customizability is insane, akin to Terraria's system (including dyes and social slots).+Liquid and Light dynamics are ""realistic""+Supports .ABC Files (You can play actual music in game from websites such as LOTRO)+Boss fights are unique-ishSEMICONS: (Things that the devs are likely to fix soon, or will fix eventually, or may not be encountered by everyone)+/- Can feel a bit solitary, especially in singleplayer+/- Game is unoptimized and crashes on startup occasionally+/- Mods are sometimes undetected by the game alltogether and you might have to restart multiple times to get them working+/- Obligatory semicon about the bugs and rush to 1.0CONS:- AI can be pretty stupid- The story is average, and cuts off pretty quickly with very little relevance late game.- Some significant unbalance in both the bosses and weapons. (For their level, some are incredibly weak or easy, or very hard/OP)- The tutorial explains gameplay fundamentals but lacks out some smaller things that people might miss- APPLIES MAINLY TO BETA PLAYERS: If you played in beta, you will notice that a lot of content is totally gone or inconsistent, especially in tiered species weapons and the story bosses.- Penguin crewmates are a pain in the ♥♥♥- No ship protection in multiplayer*- Besides farming, there is little incentive to actually build a planetary base.- Mining can get boring quickly, especially if you are used to Terraria's systems**- Game has a falloff point where you sit down and go ""well, what next"" (but that is quite some time later)- Some mechanics seem halfbaked, where its easy to see how to improve and you are frustrated that the devs let it sit there (some bad design choices and flaws)- Starting a new game on a server is almost impossible if the server is populated.- Seriously, the biggest con for this game are just design flaws. Like, the hotbar for example is arguably very unintuitive and some of the aspects are left out almost completely. You will be using a feature of the game and be scratching your head ""Why didn't they do ___ instead?""- Techs are now simplified and ultimately nerfed and more boring- Only 6 tiers? Come on, where is the 10 we had before.***- So what are ship pets for there exactly? They do like to stand in front of my containers.- Options screen needs a bit of a rework (if you need to explain a UI, its not a good UI)- Wiring things in your ship can get cluttered and incredibly difficult if there are many tracks- Matter Manipulator customization is a joke*Any member of a party can steal or break things in your ship even still. People are divided between ""simply party with people you trust"" and ""just give us some bloody protection options"". Personally, protection options sound better because otherwise whats the point of public servers if you cant show off your ship a little bit? EDIT: After some more thought, ship protection options should just be a thing, honestly. The existence of multiplayer comes with some things you need to take for granted and one of those things are ""not everyone will be a decent or honest person"".** Okay lets clear this up: Starbound is NOT a Terraria copy, YES it does have elements and inspired features that Terraria did but honestly, whats the wrong in that? Imagine how hard it would be to make a game that is nothing like any other game you've ever played. Terraria arguably perfected some aspects of the genre and there is nothing wrong with following footsteps.*** Tiers are an iffy one, they sacrificed having 10 tiers of weapons and armor for having 6 more specialised ones; Ranged, Melee and Staffs. On top of that, where the hell are the tiered weapons for classes? They totally disappeared! In a sandbox game the idea is you have endless content and things to do - this doesn't just mean a million different blocktype, just give us some more depth and flexibility. (Should clarify, technically giving specialised class armor instead of more tiers is flexibility but it just feels cut short and i cant be the only one)Last time i played this game on a server with friends, we didnt mine, explore, pvp, build or do quests. We all sat in a ship and played ""guess the song"", if that isn't simultaneously the most concerning (gameplay wise) but coolest thing then what the hell is it.The game's development could be described as a mix of ""one step forward, two steps back"" and ""missed opportunities"" because the thing is it's easily playable but frustrating.(removed score, decided it wasn't a good choice)Worth the money? YES...Runs on most computers? NO (as of right now, 1.0, which harbors some optimization problems)Honestly i want to love Starbound i really do. To me no matter what happens now it got far enough that i enjoyed it, but was constantly disappointed in the missed opportunities(25/7/16) Top review, didn't expect - gonna add a little more.(also edited grammar and reworded some stuff a little to better reflect my feelings_If anyone from Chucklefish reads this, what ARE you doing? This game is confusing, because it obviously has potential (and lives up to some of it) but falls short at the silliest of things. Look at some community mods and ideas, people are screaming at you to add certain things or change stuff but it just goes overlooked. When you make a game it won't be exactly how you envisioned it to be but thats because the people who play it want some input too. You added skyrails and some other features - hell back in the day i helped get modular matter manipulators in the game but prime example, the ""modular"" Matter Manipulator has 12 upgrades and no actual customization. I don't want to devalue or dishearten your work but there is nothing as helpful as constructive criticism, because you seem to only take in the good things about the game and ignore much of the big criticisms. I would hate for this to be another ""let the modders deal with it""All that being said, good job thus far not abandoning or totally messing everything up, you do deserve praise for a lot of the work you have done and i won't discount that.(word limit)			"

												EDIT: damn, top of the list... i hope this changes something.EDIT2: got sick of people misinterpreting the reference to No Man's Sky, so i removed it. sorry!Don't let the negative rating fool you - I don't hate this game, I just don't like what it's become.TL;DR Loved Koala, don't like Giraffe. Generic environments with generic dungeons and towns, repetitive and boring combat, shoehorned and unengaging story gates your progress constantly.Let me start this review off with a little nostalgia from my first experiences with the game. I played - and loved - the Koala builds. Every planet was different, with different creatures and different landscapes and colours. It was nice. I didn't know what I was going into, and that was great because each experience was a new one!However, I feel the direction the game's taken is downwards. Planets are now segregated into different types, and each one has essentially the same thing to expect.A lush planet has a mine and some ruins. A forest planet has a swamp and some frogs, maybe a few Avians. A snow planet has llamas and some monkeys.This happens again and again and again, and while the terrain is varied and gives a hint of adventure to the ""exploration"", seeing the same rebel camp or monster-filled mine or generic temple over and over again gets boring, fast. Seriously, on every planet, you'll be sure to find the same thing in a different shape.This is a weakness that demonstrates itself in spades when you begin to actually explore the universe.Additionally, there's the problem of the combat system. Throughout the course of your exploration, you're constantly thrown the same preset enemy with the same preset fly-towards-you-and-do-damage-on-contact tactic. (I'm exaggerating here, but still, there is a shameless amount of monsters which simply run, hop or fly at you and deal damage as soon as they touch you.)More creatures with mechanics like the Poptop, who come at you slow but do a lot of damage when they charge, would be a lot more fun, and would make the fighting more engaging than ""this creature runs at you and mobs you until you die, kill it"".There is so much more that could be done with the system, and it shows with the complexity and variety of weaponry in the game, but the way that every monster attacks you is insultingly and unfittingly simplistic! It's also annoying to get cheap-killed on a regular basis, and degrades the gameplay significantly when it literally starts punishing you for daring to venture from your house on your starting planet.Finally, there's the problem of the story being shoehorned into everything you do. I don't know about you, but I play Starbound to build pretty things and venture out into the unknown. Unfortunately, the game forces you into the shoes of a superhero, and it constantly rubs me the wrong way.I couldn't give half a damn about the fate of the universe. I play this game to build and chill out. Maybe that's an incredibly shallow way to play a game, but it's just the way I play. Unfortunately, the way the devs have implemented the story is annoying and broken, disallowing you to actually explore, instead holding your hand like a gameplay-long tutorial level.I don't care for the story because it's inconvenient and slow to work through, gating your progress while never bothering to actually engage you outside of ""save the universe from Cthulu"".I don't think there's any more that I can say other than please, for the love of God, Chucklefish. Make the worlds more wild and varied. Add more building configurations. Make some biomes NOT spawn buildings as often - people don't need to live everywhere. Reduce the spawn rates of your preset creatures and work on the combat - it's boring and it starts to grate after a while.And, please, make the story optional. It's so painfully linear and shallow that it feels like I'm trying to read a children's book than play a game.Please make this game fun again. I'm starting to get sick of installing mods and turning off monster spawning just to have a nice time.ADDENDUM:About two weeks of experience with the game later, and my opinion hasn't changed - though I can certainly list out some good aspects of the game:BASE BUILDINGThe wide range of blocks and items, and the option to have NPCs inhabit things you create, makes for a fun and relaxing to play. My only gripe is that the interactions are far too shallow, and the radiant quests have a very, very limited range.MODDINGModding is absolutely amazing in this game, and is exactly as advertised. While confusing and frustrating occasionally, modding is incredibly flexible and often instantaneously satisfying.Also, the ability to add mods to the game to flesh out your experience is rather pleasant.Unfortunately, it's the most fun I've had with the game thus far.If something passes my mind, I'll add it to this addendum. I would have written something on the community but I currently don't know what I'd say on it.			"

 Playtime and Time/money I'd say about 60 hours of gameplay maximum for the state it's in now. Thats what I spent on it while playing with 2 other friends doing absolutely everything.So even in that regard it's 25 cents an hour, which is absolutely fantastic. Exactly what is this game?  The good: This is starbound. The game that it currently is, is a space themed, construction and survival exploration game. Comparable to terraria, it has improved upon a lot of things from that such as the ability to use one block as a back wall and a forewall, there are more space related things like atmospheres (1) space creatures (2) space ships, a space story line etc. There are planets to discover (3), theres progress to be made through building a colony and adventuring through planets (4), Plenty of fun to be had with interesting tech mechanics (5) a very large assortment of vanity goods, and a nice multiplayer experience. The inventory feels not too full all the time as it is now catagorized into everything you need (such as an ore bag and a building materials bag etc), and it comes with a complete story which you'd have a hard time finding with such creative games (6). The Bad: The game is rather short with only 6 tiers of progression.You run around on planets and can easily move on to the next section by scraping the surface alone.The armor balance for players is slightly higher than the game seems to want, it's so mind numbingly easy that a toddler could sit around with a stimpack and a med kit and outheal any damage coming at them.It's so incredibly easy for other players to ruin the efforts of a server because the protection isnt in the game by default, in any way.The game will get extremely laggy for many players when there are too many entities in one area of a world. (which should be something obvious, however I'm saying that it's taxing on higher end systems even)It will consume many of your hours doing simple things like building, or gathering a crew/upgrading your ship/mining. (ok, this one isnt really bad, unless you hate that sort of thing.) The Unforgivable: this entire ""the unforgivable"" section will be gripes about features removed from the game, they will not impact you if you do not know about what was in the past. I advise you to keep clear if you are fresh and have never had your hopes high for the game.As much as I don't want to say this, I feel as though it has to be said, the game has been stripped of features. The justification for this is improved framerate, when honestly it is worse now. So I cannot and will not let it go. Lets start off with the numbers 1. They removed the heating system, and the complexity of atmospheres from the game. you now craft a survival pack that allows you to eventually traverse all territories, instead of how it was before, which was harsh and based on your selections. While this choice for sure makes the game easier, it takes out the fun survival part of the difficulty.1a. They also oversimplified the hazardous environments, so it doesnt matter if you take cover, or build a fire to stay warm, you will always be suffering the consequences of a planet, no matter where you are, if you don't have the correct survival pack.2. They drastically reduced the randomness of creatures that spawn on planets, there are now a total of 3 major variants of creatures, large, small, and flying and are trash monsters who have no meaningful attacks. There are now many pre generated creatures that inhabit every single planet in the game, and they are very common. I hope you enjoy going to the same 20 planets over and over again.3. unrelated to the creatures but stemming from the random generation, planets now are even genned the same, and the color of planets is only based on the planet you're going to, which you will find out are very limited in number, it's not a mystery of what you're getting anymore, you go to an ocean planet, you've seen them all, you go to a starter planet, you've seen them all etc. the only thing that remains are the random dungeons generated in the planets themselves.4. Adventuring is blindly easy, everything has been simplified down to looting all the surface boxes of a planet for ""EXTREMELY RARE"" matter manipulator upgrades and the ore the planet has that you want, along with tech tokens which allow you to buy whatever tech you want, never forcing you to try something out because it's your only option. shrug5. Techs. oh my god techs. They removed all the fun ones, removed all the flying ones, removed the mechs the cards and the interesting ones, and of course replaced the hazard protection ones with the survival pack. somehow, they took the worst tech of them all (the nearly useless morphball) and made it worse AND a focus at the same time (they removed the bomb feature and gave it trashy mobility options) (also I say this as a fan and a person who tried implementing 2 high tunnels in my bases for fun.)The current state of techs involves head techs, body techs, and feet techs. They are painful. 5a. The morph ball is the head tech. and it has several variations, one that climbs walls (at the cost of moving like a ♥♥♥♥ing snail), one that does ABSOLUTELY ♥♥♥♥ING NOTHING (it makes you float to the top of water) and one that makes you spin dash like sonic (without the damage, honestly that would be too fun). imagine being forced to use the morphball tech and it having no real use, ever. thats exactly what it's like.5b. The body tech. you remember the dash tech? the one that moved you several feet? that one will be your primary mobility tech, for 8 tech cards you can restore it to it's original state, being able to use it mid air, which is pretty ok. You can use it for a slightly-faster-than-running sprinting, which is pretty ok. and you can use it for a blink dash, which is completely useless and not a mobility option in the least. unless you like roleplaying tracer or something.5c. The feet tech. Double jump! Thats good! triple jump! that..... ok because they're smaller hops. wall jump :O now you can be super meat boy..... but.... thats never useful in a game like this except if someone build a map for it. and the roc(ket) jump, which will give you a decent jump that will clear gaps and stop you mid air without fall damage. Which is a good tech.6. The final gripe that I can think about while writing this lengthy review; you no longer have the mystery of an unknown story. there is a story in place, it's shrugworthy, and it gives your character a reason for being there. I don't like it, because it takes away our needed freedom of imagination. final notes: I don't have enough space to gripe forever here as there is a character limit, read the other reviews.So now the standard game rating:Story: 4/10 (it drops you in a generic story, and forces you to play through a story on a creation/exploration game in order to advance.)Gameplay: 10/10 (tennouttaten it's an excellent idea and plays very well)Presentation: 10/10 (The game is absolutely amazing looking, you'll love the game you're given with the absolutely massive selection of materials and decorative goods.)Soundtrack: 7/10 (It will blast in your ears at the worst times, and you will like it (mostly (if you like classical style music)))Replayability: 10/10 (Very, very very, very high. play it with friends, find a server to play on, play alone, build to your hearts content, explore till you can't find anything new, and enjoy the time that you waste playing on your computer.)Buy it, play it, it's a great game, but it could have been better. so much better.

												I last reviewed this in 2014, when the game was in early beta; It was really bad.I've come back now that 1.0 has released to see if the game is better. This review was earlier incomplete during a 1.0 playthrough, but after playing about 70 hours total of the release version, my feelings have not changed, only worsened.I couldn't even push myself to complete the story; I searched it up, and found it was more dissapointing then i could have expected, making me actually glad I didn't go through it. The rest of the review has been slightly modified, but only slightly.I pre-ordered this as soon as it became available and have been watching it for 5 years. I wanted this game to be great. So, is it good? is it bad?It's ok.The game has some value to it now; the building is fairly entertaining, providing a lot of options for furniture, and ways to progress through it with farming/colonies. As well, combat has a good deal of variety, and the bosses are pretty decent. There is a lot of variety in weapon types later in the game. The story missions are pretty good in design, and hold a lot of nice secrets. The fossil collecting minigame is a fun distraction as well. That's unfortunately where things fall off to being either poor, or outright bad.The exploration is awful. The biomes are devoid of content minus some rare biome chests, and that's how all of the biomes work. Enter biome, look for chest, hope it has an interesting blueprint. You can't craft anything of note from the biomes until luck does you well. Alongside that there are  procedural buildings throughout planets in the form of rooms and dungeons. They are sadly all handmade, meaning you will constantly find the same exact rooms/dungeons while playing. I never went through a biome underground without finding at least 3 of the same exact room; it was often 5 though. As a result of this lack of variety, lack of reward, and really a lack of anything else to look for, exploration dies rapidly. Every planet is mostly the same, and they can be grouped into a few categories; normal planet, ocean, barren, moon, and possibly asteroid.The story is also terrible. Collect the 6 special artifacts. Done.It's badly written, and the lore is lacking in every way. If you know any of the source material/theme concepts (cavemen for floran, 1984 for apex, aztec/inca for avian, etc), then the lore and story will not branch to any interesting point whatsoever. It all feels very generic.Weapon generation is also bad. Melee only has damage, firerate, and element, though 2 handed weapons have an extra special attack. Ranged is the same, though it has energy cost as well. There are also staves/wands, but they just change damage into level, a less varying stat. The weapons themselves are nice to use, but the lack of statistical variance means the procedural nature of weapons feels entirely pointless.Cooking = potions, but there aren't a lot of unique buffs.You can get crew members for your ship, but they aren't useful past the first few tiers, and they otherwise do extremely little. The toolbar is a mess.Crafting takes time for no apparent reason.Procedural quests send you to the same areas, revealing the way the system works, damaging play experience and providing lackluster repetition. As well, there aren't many actual quest types.Colonist rewards are lacking, and serve only as an alternative to normal play for getting items. As well, the thoughts and traits of colonists actually seem to do nothing in my experience.Character gear options consist of only 4 armor slots, a passive augment, and movement abilities. Customization is thus very limited in terms of character build depth. There aren't any passive gear slots other than the single augment, which are all very basic.Armor is also very lacking; there aren't very many unique sets with most being reskins, and they lack any notable special effects.Not to mention a lot of things from beta, like character customization options and techs, have been removed.And... Well, I could go on.But after all that, I still don't think the game is terrible, it's just lacking. Badly. I focused on the negatives a lot, but those negatives are a huge part of the game. It's a jack of all trades, master of none kind of ordeal, but its not bad. I wouldn't recommend it unless it is on sale, with exceptions;If you like animal crossing, or relaxed games about collecting and freeform building (like minecraft mixed in with animal crossing), I think you'll like it, but I'd say pick it up on a sale (say 5$). I was enjoying it for awhile based on the building and fossil hunting, but the rest of the game being so shallow pushed me to leave eventually. As well, I can say with certainty that my enjoyment value dropped rapidly over time; it wasn't even 10 hours in before I was watching youtube videos on the side to distract myself, and I only realised as of my last jump into the game that I wasn't having any fun at all, and it was just time killing due to how long it takes to find things.The game may be long, but it is not deep. I'm sure some will find enjoyment out of this, but it died quickly for me, so I reccomend it only if you are into that type of gameplay, and only on a sale... As on the slip side, if you want a game about fighting loads of different enemies, finding unique interesting gear, discovering a strange path through progression or exploring exciting places, you are likely going to be very disappointed.I personally hope for the sake of everyone playing (including myself) that they take the terraria style of updating and add massive swaths of content after release to fix these issues. But that's all I can do; hope. With a similar development time of 5-6 years as terraria has had (due to terraria's year hiatus in 2012), I don't know how much will change at this rate.			"

								Only a beta, but first impression seems good. Smooth controls, and it looks lovely. Text is a little hard to read though, and the controls are not rebindable (yet).

												Starbound was enjoyable, and I once used to regularly sink hours into it. Years ago, that is - in some of the earliest released versions, as I'd backed it since before release.The game used to be a fun, fantastic experience - each world was unique, and it was fun to share coordinates of interesting things or unique items with others in this huge universe. Everything had attention and care put into it. It was exciting - you didn't know what to expect. Back in the Koala versions, that is...then, it released fully. Good god, what a steaming pile of ♥♥♥♥. Every world is the same. There's nothing to go back to. The story is shoehorned in and gates progress arbitrarily, every world has at least two pre-created enemies (and the random-gen ones just melee and mob you stupidly), and the worst of all;   nothing's really random any more. This planet is forest. Oh. This is plains. Woo. Everything's the same. You can't explore one world type without seeing the same bloody decrepid tower, or a single high level planet without running into another resistance base with three specific buildings in a marginally different order. A huge load of content has just been straight-up REMOVED from older versions - the ship AI isn't even race-specific!The care once put into this game is dead, and things have been ruined, ravaged, and torn apart to save development time and costs. Most music present in the first releases has been removed. Combat is annoying and gets in the way, if only to serve as a distraction from the underwhelming facade of exploration the lackluster world generation presents. The shallow puddle of content is drip-fed through gating off entire planet types. There used to be a newsletter that highlighted the best of the community's creations - but that died along with any care that had once been put into the game.A space exploration sandbox should be something to replay, something with a substantial amount of content - you're in space, for crying out loud! And yet, it's somehow, through development, become more distilled and reduced down to a shallow unimmersive experience frought with grinding, arbitrary progress gates, and is generally an unsatisfying experience.Originally, you were just some random person in space - either your planet was destroyed, you were exiled, or were just an outcast, depending on race. Now you're forced into a hero role to save the universe, or some dumb thing.I regret playing through the release version of this game. I finished the story and was severely underwhelmed and disappointed - and haven't launched the game since. I'd explored everything. Done everything. The game has been cut down and had pieces hacked off since the first releases, and has been reduced to a shallow, unfulfilling experience that leaves nothing to make me want to return to it.It had potential at one point. At least the old music's nice. That's all I have left to enjoy from this shambling corpse of a once-good game - and most of the old music isn't in the game any more, so there's even less in Starbound to like.It's such a shame to see this brilliant concept be misled into the atrocious mess it is now.

Early Access Review
								This game got alot of flack because Chucklefish went silent for a while and people thought it was an abandoned project.Turns out Chucklefish was just working too hard to bother making any wab updates, they started up again a couple months ago and there is now three update branches, Stable, Unstable and Nightly. Nightly is the most glitched, as it's updated every midnight, so play nightly at your own risk. I play Unstable and they just gave it an update, the addition of quests has changed the game quite a bit, there are now quests as opposed to just 'get this ore, build this thing, repeat'. You need to prgress so far in the quests to get to a new solar system. This game used to be like a bigger Terreria with less point, now it's finally turning into what was promised and Chucklefish is giving us regular updates again. They're introducing new bosses, I've only so far had to tangle with Dreadwing(the penguin UFO) and they haven't tweaked him much aside from give him a bazillion and three HP and he has his own level you can't build on. So while he's not that much harder, he's ♥♥♥♥ing hard.If you got it and stopped playing give it another shot, I'm not sure if stable branch has been updated to the new quest system yet, though, I'm on unstable. If you don't have it and like sandbox tree punching sims definately give it a shot.EDIT:Hey Terreria fanboys, unless your crappy attempts at snarking can make me laugh like Sid1120's down there I'm deleting them. I'm sorry if this offends you. Also I accedently deleted a post from somebody who said Chucklefish was being 'condescending' to fans during the silence, didn't mean to, accedental double click. I didn't consider that a snark and can't comment on it as I was taking a haiatus until updates started again.ANOTHER EDIT!:I was completely unprepared for so many votes... My second most popular review has one downvote.			"

Early Access Review
My review...A few months ago, I would have written a negative review.Back then, I had stopped playing the game because I had hit a wall: I couldn't find the incredibly rare items required for the next two quests.  I had the highest level armor and weapon so powerful it could kill anything with one or two hits.  My rapid-firing high-damage assault rifle could hit birds at any range.  At that point the game had stopped being fun.  Even the extreme planets were too easy; meteor strikes were few and far between.But now?  You can start a colony.  Weapons are no longer ridiculously powerful, and the accuracy of some guns has been reduced.  Soon there will be hoverbikes.  Hoverbikes?  Hell yeah.  Colonies?  You're kidding me.Nope, not kidding.  Colonies.  Nothing like settling on a fiery planet, building a beautiful city inhabited by unique and endearing people, and watching it be obliterated by one giant meteor.  That taught me something... build underground.  So now I have my own little ragtag band of survivors, duking it out with nature.Pros: Epic gameplay, both at low and high levels Beautiful atmosphere, covering a huge range of fantasy and science fiction Creepy undertone; there are hints everywhere that there's some greater power behind all this BananasCons: The quests get tedious once you've gotten pretty far; it's eventually just ""get this"" and ""get that"".  Hopefully this will be fixed soon... The races could use some more differences; while it is cool that they have specific armor, weapons, and ships, it would be much more interesting if there were race-specific abilities, even if they only affected the early game. Still some balance issues with weapons, but this is much better than it used to be. This is a personal pet peeve, but I really want some more high-level bows.  After a certain point they're no longer useful, as they just don't do enough damage.  If there were more bows to go with the top-level gear, I'd be in heaven.My final rating: 9/10Great game, but not perfect.  Keep in mind, Starbound is still in Beta.  I'm sure they'll get at least some of these things fixed before the game hits 1.0.One more thing: I haven't yet explored all the game has to offer.  I'm sure there's tons more to see, and more problems too, but I haven't found any yet.EDIT: Nevermind about the bows, I just realized you can craft a Ferozium bow.			"

								I'm really glad I didn't listen to the negative reviews. There's a whole community of people who feel that life has let them down when it comes to Starbound. They seem to know all this history. They're certainly full of informed opinions. They've got a thousand and one reasons for you to NOT try or support or play this game. And they're quite vocal. However... from my perspective of a new player, none of that crap is important. Circa June 2016, Starbound is quite playable. Not very buggy. It progresses. There's stuff to do. Its story light like most Early Access games. There's a great platform to tell stories here. Lots of character customization. Its quite good. Don't become part of some communities trivial political agenda regarding the development of this game. Make up your own minds. Its worth a shot, and like so many things... its a matter of opinion.I like Starbound.			"

Early Access Review
								If you played terraria and survival/crafting/sandboxing games you'll know what this game is about. This sandbox adventure/survival but with an actual quest system being put in place which falls into the realm of space/sci fi genre. The game offers so much fun especially played with friends. You start off on a planet looking for crafting materials just to survive and get ship off the planet but as time goes on you start advancing through tiers through various tasks, quests, and boss battles which enables you to travel throughout different sectors and random worlds, offering you new  biomes,dangerous envioronment, and hazards which you'll have to explore to find materials to craft. More will be added  as times goes on, ship battles more quests, more hidden treasure in a planet etc. The planets themselves have very nice environment and fun to explore because it is randomized on a galactic map, by inputting x and y coordinates  which acts as seed numbers, you'll travel through endless randomized worlds and discover awsome adventures either by yourself or with friends. You'll dig at least over 24 hours into this beta and still finding yourself replaying it over and over with new content update. Winter update Gameplay As it stands right now the system for combat is still WORK IN PROGRESS but the there is an actual story to the game now that is flows really well. Quest systems and mining to progress. Once a quest is completed the character goes back to the hub to turn it in to gain a tech upgrade to visit certain planets i.e Radiated, Cold etc until the final tier. The bosses and quests are repeatable and hardcore and the fun of the discovery is back again with tons of new items and secrets to discover. The new biomes are fantastic. A long awaited update that took just way too long but glad that it is finally out so far in unstable build but hopefully we'll see a stable release of it this month.(I'll be working on the review for this game now and also giving out free keys on my stream each week. I fully support this great game. working on video review.  I do recommend this game but I don't have a full review on it yet since it is not a finished game, as the game update changes and progress I will throw a new updated review up.[pros]+ Randomized planets and biomes+ Organized travel system + Actual quests in the game+ Great music+ Great animations+looking forward to more+MOD SUPPORT!+addictive gameplay of mining and being able to build whatever you want through progression+Multiplayer with friends and strangers+ The Winter update FinallyCons- updates cant come fast enough! moarrr-if you dont like minecraft or terraria or those type of games you will probably not like this game that much,- Right now the game is in a stand, where its trying to shape itself into a better game, The devs moved close to each other and well, the game stopped updating for a while, with buggy nightly builds as far as updates are going which you can get your hands on the newest content to at least try out but remember, its tests and bugs, the game came to a dead stop atm. Awaiting a massive overhaul to the game and the things promised. I have faith in these guys so I'll leave this right here because there isn't anything more to do in the game after you acquired everything in the adventure. I hope to see great things when the game jumpstarts again for I will definently be there.			"

Early Access Review
								I won't lie. I thought this game was going to suck.I read most of the bad reviews saying that ""Chucklefish has bad management"" and ""This is just another terraria clone.""But you know what?It doesn't.After reading most of the bad reviews, I had already removed the game from my wishlist. Until a friend of mine said I needed to get this game, me being the open-world loving exploration enthusiast that I am. So I said, and I quote, ""Yeah, whatever mate.""And I got it. And I played it. And oh god did I love it. When I play a video game, I try not to get caught up in the developer drama. There are a plethora of stories on this game page about how Chucklefish ""missed their chance"" at increasing their popularity, and how the hype ""waned out and died."" I like to look past all of that. Same with Arkham Knight, the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ PC port that it was. I played it, I liked it, and I didn't have to get caught up in all of that developer drama. And it's the exact same with Starbound.If you look past the early access hell this game is going through, it's a really good game. It's fun to play around in, build in, and generally explore.And it would be telling a lie if I said that the whole few hundred billion or however many unique variations of planets there are fact didn't impress me.- Great music, although often repeats.- Tons of biomes on different planets to explore.- A surprisingly rich backstory, although the only way you could find this backstory is from randomly dropped codexes :(- Randomly generated temples, tombs, castles, villages, research facilities among others are always a blast to explore.- Surprisingly challenging for an open world platformer. (EDIT: That is, if you choose the normal mode.)- There is no story. Litterally. You're planet explodes, your ship is broken, you fix it, and do quests for people around an interstellar outpost. (Not a very impressive one, I might add.) (And I also imagine that Chucklefish will be expanding on the story as they go, if Starbound ever makes it out of EA.)- Randomly generated guns and swords are fun to collect. (also, the cosmetic armors are super awesome once you collect a full set.)- Easter eggs. Everywhere.In conclusion, you should get Starbound if you like exploring cool looking planets, collecting unique and fun to use items, and overall having fun killing unique monsters, looting enemy bases (and maybe a few friendly ones along the way), screwing around and decking out your space ship (Also, did I mention the ships? There are eight tiers to a ship, and once you get to your eighth tier, it's a blast decorating it.).If you play games for story, dialogue, immersion and sidequests with a lot of effort put into it, this isn't the game for you.You can listen to the bad reviews if you want, but what I'm trying to say is that it's not as bad a game as they say it is, for the reasons listed above.But overall, it's a great game, and I do recommend it.And it's not even finished yet!

								Starbound was released to kickstarters about a month after I lost my Grandfather.  I did 3 things for 6 months after he died.  I took care of my kids the best I could, I cried when they went to bed, and I played Starbound.The opening music still haunts me.  I still remember how unique and crazy this game was, and even though most of that eventually got removed, I can go back to old screenshots and invoke a sense of memory, of where I was emotionally while grieving when I took them.  Yeah, Starbound induced a few metric tons of negative energy in a lot of folk's lives.  Starbound is a ""toxic"" game by its own developer's description, because without the community, the people who loved it and wanted to see it succeed, there never would have been a place for any of the hate.I used to do frequent ""Starbound Adventures"" series in the forums where I'd detail all the updates.  I actually enjoyed doing that in spite of how awful Chucklefish and the Starbound community were behaving toward each other.  I got super mad, then decided one day to just dive in and play.  It was fun.Then nothing was updated for a long time, and as more nightly builds got pushed, I started seeing them remove content.  This is why I associate Starbound with Trees.My biggest distraction from tragedy came in the form of Starbound's trees.  It became an obsession, something to do feverishly while taking breaks from the swollen eyes and snot.  I collected almost 600 unique tree seeds and made an entire planet from top to bottom a farm of them.  I'm not sure how many could actually be generated, but they were all different, and it felt like I was playing this epic-level Harvest Moon as I farmed trees and food.  I can never rate this game down because the collecting and planet-hopping was some of the biggest fun I'd ever had in a videogame, period.Then they got rid of the trees.  The variety was slashed into fragments, and most of them became these dreadful brown/pastel mixes.  All of the color and imagination disappeaered.  They became background objects, the junk you ignore while you play any random SHMUP.  The farming sense faded instantly, and the wind was knocked out of me.  The one thing I was still enjoying in this game, gone.  I haven't played more than 10 minutes since the last time they made the experimental build a seperate library option.  I got on, made a character, warped around, I guess they decided the trees were ""axed"".  I don't know if it was a performance decision, but I can vouch that at the time I had my huge tree farm, I had zero lag with around 2000 trees on a single planet, around 500-600 variations among them, on an old 2012 system:Radeon HD 6970 2GB graphics cardIntel Core i5-3570k8 gigs of ram, no SSD.144hz Asus 27"" 1080p.No lag ever, the game just ran beautifully, and it looked beautiful too.  Now its just drab and unappealing to me.  I'm trying to make sense of why all the color was taken out, all of that art, what a waste.			"

Early Access Review
								Starbound is the perfect example of when ""Early Access"" goes wrong. I backed this game a long time ago with several of my other friends who couldn't wait for Starbound's release. After receiving a RIDICULOUSLY large sum of money for their pixel game, Tiy and the rest of the devs have failed to release a finished product after missing their release by over a year, coming up on 2 years. Because they have already been paid a ridiculous sum of money for their incomplete game, they do not have the motivation to finish their PIXEL RANDOM GENERATION game. I have played this game since day one, and it has barely evolved since then. Exploring planets seemed fun at the very beginning, but it gets old real fast. The different races mean nothing, and will maybe eventually have different effects. Gathering minerals is almost always the same and repetitive for each planet and sector, bosses are unimaginative, boring, and easy. The ""new"" questing system that has been added is boring and monotonous, the missions seem almost pointless in that they only exist to stall the player before more real content is added. If you are thinking about buying Starbound, turn away and play Terraria instead. You will have a much better time, with a complete game that is still receiving more content at a better rate than Starbound, an unfinished game. Chucklefish really needs to step up and finish this game, its honestly pathetic that it is still early access. Do not give Chucklefish any more money until they take the action to actually complete and polish this game. Until Chucklefish gets their ♥♥♥♥ together, this game will remain a disappointment to me and many others who were expecting much, much more from the lazy devs at Chucklefish.			"

												As someone who's been with Starbound since it entered open beta I can say that This game is, simply put, the best 2-d Sandbox game I've ever played.Picture this: An open, vast universe with 4.something quadrillion planets. each unique in their own ways.There are seven unique playable races, each with a rather vast ammount of lore behind them.I was a bit worried when the developers said they would be adding a storyline, but I'm sure glad they did. The storyline serves to direct the player and encourage exploration. There are plenty of weapons to destroy your enemies, with each type having several special stats. If you like terraria, I highly reccomend this game.  "

Early Access Review
								I would not recommend this game at this time. Perhaps in the future.I have a few reasons for not likeing this game, but mostly they break down to the game not being fun. For instance, the 'Randomly generated monsters' that are touted as a key feature just end up making the enemeys less unique. The combat system is slow, and unrewarding. Crafting, while the game boasts 'thousands of items' and 'a deep crafting system' that crafting system is really just a menu where it shows you every thing you can make, and you have to search out what you have the materials for.And while i do like the idea of owning and decorating my own starship, and going to diffrent planets, there really is no need to, nor is there a need to return to planets you have been to before.The farming, hunting and survival mechanics spoken of are simply a food meeter that ticks down, it dose not add anything. I think what really makes this game not fun is the 'free updates' part, this game hasnt been updated in two months, while in early access, why would they update it affter release?			"

								For an indie game of this proportion, it had a big budget, a sizable team and ample time, yet the game is 2 years behind schedule, still in alpha and doesn't come close to delivering a quarter of its promised features.As of now it's struggling to ape Terraria, which it was supposed to blow out of the water.Really a sad sight but a good lesson for everyone considering to invest in crowdfunding/early access games.I can only advise you to stay away from this game for now. Play Terraria instead.Time will tell if Chucklefish will deliver, but for now it's a 15 bucks alpha with scarce updates.			"

												I have played Starbound since its Early Access days, and it is easily my favorite game in sandbox exploration/building genre.Among the games of its genre, Starbound puts strongerest focus on exploration rather than fighting. Rather than adventuring in a single world, in Starbound you travel between different planets each not only belonging to a particular biome, but containing some of unique features from a fairly large list, from peaceful villages to dungeons filled with zealous guards. So you never know what you will find on each new planet you visit, which makes exploration very addictive: you will always want to explore “just one more planet”!In regard of building, Starbound offers one of largest (if not the largest) selections of both decorative and functional items to place in your house or base. It also has mechanics that allows you to populate your base with as many NPC as you like, potentially building a whole town with dozens residents.And uniquely among its genre, Starbound also has quests like one might expect of a RPG rather than a sandbox building game: a fairly long main quests and an infinite number of random quests provided by NPC in towns or those you've placed in your home or base yourself.Only one aspect of Starbound is somewhat lacking: combat, or specifically, its difficulty. While you may encounter some difficulty if you are poorly equipped (especially at the very start), as long as you are equipped with a gear of the same tier as the planet you are exploring, you will likely have little difficulty fending off local wildlife. There is some difficulty during boss fights, but bosses are still easy as far as bosses go, and if you expect challenging battles that Terrarria or action games offer, you won't find them in Starbound. Some storyline and random dungeon can also offer some challenge, but there it mostly comes from traps or indestructable dungeon elements, like flamethrowers or laser beams, not enemies (in fact, random dungeons often have few to none enemies, and focus on making you avoid dangerous environment).So, overall, the combat isn't that bad. Just don't expect constant challenge that Terraria or Edge of Space present.I fully recommend Starbound to anyone who likes sandbox games or want to give this genre a try.			"

Early Access Review
								Promises don't mean anything.Announced in 2012, Beta released in 2013. Officially claimed to be ""fully released"" by 2013, this game was pushed back in development because it was not properly finished. Through many updates at first, the game's difficulty was scaled down drastically, and was turned into something equally easy as Minecraft. Originally being made by the Developer's views, the game was changed drastically by community requests and incorporating user-created mods. Originally promised to have ""thick and fast"" updates, the game met a stagnant halt, only to be given a beta-beta release by the name of [Unstable]. This is where the small updates were to be shown, and for a time, they were. A very short time, at that. After a few small patches and one moderately average sized patch, stagnant development once more arrived. The crew behind the game moved out of the country over to Europe, and set up shop where everyone was close together. Surely the updates would be fast now, you'd think. The biggest update since March 2014 is that they have a small dog at the office.The game had such a booming and viral start. It was a game of promises, dreams, and a great pixel game; something incredibly rare nowadays. The game had a somewhat rocky start, being a cleverly disguised alpha instead of the stated beta release, but it was playable. Many features felt nice, and the gameplay fit well with the atmosphere and music. Then it got boring because nothing was new. Through lost promises and hilariously bad customer support on the official forums, many people believe this game is dead. It pretty much is, when the developers are spending little time developing as they once did. At first, we had developer streams. We could talk to the developers for HOURS, talking about everything down to the color of the kitchen sink. Then we had some streams of gameplay with less discussion. Then we had preorder bonuses, including some really lame things like a statue of ""you"" in the game. Then we had promises of fast updates, which has so far been a lie. It's been months since the last real update as of this post time, and there's no real sign of progress. There were people who donated HUNDREDS to this game, only to be shafted so far. By definition, as of the game's current and past iterations, this game is a scam. I still hold hopes that the developers will EVENTUALLY do something for the game's betterment, but I will definitely not expect them. It's obvious they ran with the money. If you want this game, look up youtube videos first. If it looks like something you'd want to play, then by all means buy it, but just remember that it's a buggy, unfinished game with no hope in the nearby future of completion. Other Early Access games are more likely to be fully released ten times over before this is out of the current be- I'm sorry, ALPHA release.			"

Early Access Review
								So, a lot of the reviewers for the game are giving it positive reviews because the devs have released an update. I felt like I should write a new review and focus less on the developers and more on the game that is available. I know a lot of you will look at my play time and think ""He has X amount of hours in this game, he must have enjoyed it."" But if I could have my hours back I would. Think of all those hours you spent in your last relationship and then try telling someone that the other person was worth dating and that you don't want a minute of your wasted time back. I tried to love it and I tried to be a beta tester and hunt down bugs, but it just wasn't worth it.Right off the bat you'll notice that the game is very grindy.  Now, a little bit of grind is okay in a sandbox game as long as it's well paced and it never becomes tedious and boring; but Starbound does just that. The game becomes go from this planet to the next looking for another tier of ore and a boss to fight. You'll spend hours mining away, looking for the next ore. You run the risk of brain death while doing so, but it'll all be worth it in the long run, right? The boss fight and new enemies will be amazing, right? Nope and nope. Many bosses just feel like regular enemies on steroids, and the new enemies are just variations of the standard ones you see regularly.Secondly, the game doesn't excel in any particular field. It's a jack-of-all-trades, master-of-none and each mechanic has been done somewhere else much better. Minecraft had better sandbox building, Terraria had less grind, more interesting bosses and a better sense of progression , and the combat is only adequate for what it is.In the end, this game is merely a poor man's Terraria that manages to be more expensive. You're much better off playing that instead of Starbound.			"

Early Access Review
								This review is based on the state the game was in when I played it, and these issues are ones that were a problem back then. If the issues have been fixed, then this is a good thing.Only reason this is still up here is because it's the biggest thing I have done on steam.After the early access phase ends I may play the game again and write a new review whether it will be another negative review, or a positive one I am unsure. Here is the original review:This game may look like the Terraria lover's dream come true, and indeed it did look so to me at first, but after playing through the game and aquiring the final tier of tools and armor, I discovered that all is not lollipops and unicorn farts as I thought. These are my reasons for why the game lets me down:*The game has terrible gear scaling to the point that you can skip entire tiers of tools and armor and not miss out.*There is no reason to create a permanent settlement on any planet, as when away from that planet, time does not proceed. Meaning that a farm on that planet will not grow. Causing you to have to make a farm in your ship, so that it grows everywhere you go.*While the first planet may play like terraria, once you get the ship modifications to go to other sectors, you will likely move your storage and crafting stations on to your ship, so you have it available easily.*Poor difficulty scaling. The difficulty on terraria scaled well. Making what was previously the best armor the lowest quality armor for the next section of the game. Where in Starbound, the next tier of armor gives you slightly more health and slightly more energy.*Weak guns and unavailability. For a game that boasts randomized guns, they are quite unavailable until later in the game. All of the guns I ever found in the game felt like I was toting a piece of cardboard. They consumed far too much energy for their damage output.*Farming endgame. After about the second tier of tools, there are no more hunting knives or hunting bows, so the collection of leather and alien meat becomes a lot harder than it was on the first planet. Causing the player to slump into a farming lifestyle for all their food.*Stale combat. All of the enemies hop around the same, use similar attacks or cheap tactics that allow easy hits on the player. *Inconsistency between clients. When playing with others, the creatures are not consistent between clients. You may think that an enemy looks like a Pikachu, which makes squeaky noises. But for your friend, it looks like a puddle of custard with seven brown eyes on a round head on a long neck, and it makes noises like a sheep. This makes it hard for players to convey to their allies or friends what they are seeing/being attacked by.As I achieved the final tier of gear, I feel no need to play it again unless it changes dramatically. As such, I have not played to the end in every single update, so I am unaware if any changes have improved on the problems I have outlined in this reviewHowever, this game is in early access, and it should improve with time. I advise letting the super fans help the developers kick the kinks out of the game for you, and grabbing the game at a later time, when it is out of Early Access.When the game fully releases, I may play it again, and revise my review.

												Video games don't exist in a bubble. They don't exist independently from their makers when they're as horrifically unfinished as Starbound. The game itself is deceivingly shallow, having a huge lack of content, especially compared to Terraria. On top of a lack of content, it has tons of issues that still aren't fixed.It has been months without a substantial update for a game that they swore would be released in 2013.https://i.imgur.com/J1zHrOB.pngOn top of that, the developers and moderators have taken to blaming the community for their disappointment.https://i.imgur.com/M3JBlk8.pnghttps://i.imgur.com/2zJax3Q.pngThey've gone so far as to blame ""vote brigading"" for negative Steam reviews.https://i.imgur.com/91TgOme.pnghttps://i.imgur.com/YY0UmkZ.pngAnd of course, they don't want you to get refunds anymore.https://i.imgur.com/sDGmkYM.pnghttps://i.imgur.com/egHvklC.pngDon't waste your money. Buy something else, and don't support rotten indie developers.			"

								Don't buy it. At least now. Devs haven't implemented even a half of cool stuff they promised. And it's already half a year since early access began. Wait for the release patiently and only then decide whether to buy the game or not.I really hope they'll make it though, but now it just doesn't seem so. If they ever finish it 100%, it won't be soon that's for sure.			"

Early Access Review
								TL:DR: Avoid this game at all costs. For now.So, I really liked Starbound. I love the CONCEPT of Starbound. The idea that you can look around countless worlds and find new and weird randomly generated stuff is such a great concept to me. The races are appealing too from a character design standpoint, and the worlds (at one point at least) were fun and interesting. It was the makings of a perfect game, at least for me.So, why am I not recommending it?In short, the problem is that the developer, Chucklefish, has seriously mismanaged the project. Let me be clear, it's only the developers that are holding this back. The concept and world they've built is strong. They just seem to enjoy pulling anything unique out and making the game bland and generic. I would strongly recommend this game when Chucklefish either goes bankrupt and sells the assets or if a new development team comes in. Let's go through a list of changes.1. Monsters are no longer all randomly generated. They added ""hand-crafted"" monsters to most worlds. If the ridiculous hipster name didn't turn you off, the mundane attacks will. They add nothing to the game, but they were heralded as a great feature.2. Damage on contact. This was in the game when I first started and it was annoying. They removed it in favor of combat using tells from the monsters and dodging attacks. They then added this back in for no reason. This is the biggest reason I have for abandoning the game. The game is not built for damage on contact. You have to move the (barely visible) cursor to one side or the other of your character, otherwise moving backwards makes you crawl like a snail. When the combat was all about dodging, this was great because it meant you could jump out of the way of an attack and use that time to get yourself back under control. Now, that's impossible because, if you jump, you then have to spend all your attention trying to NOT land on the stupid thing. Keep in mind that almost all monsters are faster than you and will run to your position making this a futile endevour. FUN!3. They're taking the exploration out of the game. What used to be a fun trek to see what you could find on a planet's surface has devolved into exploring a world to see what micro-""dungeons"" (loot rooms) have spawned there. Given that there are only a handful of potential microdungeon themes, you're done pretty quickly. As a minor side note, they went over random weapons and turned them from cute rusted weapons that made sense... into a series of pallate swaps. ""Oh boy, I found a random axe! Unlike my current random axe, this one has a blue spiky head instead of a red swooshy head.""4. They've taken out interesting summoned bosses and have given us bland, fairly easy boss ""quests"". Don't get me wrong, the summoned bosses were terrible. Mostly because you could cheese them really easily. But they needed tweaking, not removal.5. Content removal. There used to be tentacle planets. There used to be a lot of things in this game. But it's just gotten blander and more generic every update. The races are even getting blander. They SHOULD have had racial traits that made each one interesting to play. They don't. In fact, in the next update, you're losing racial themed weapons. So, you're losing anything identifiable about the race outside of the sprite, and even that's covered up by armor most of the time.Verdict: Get this on sale for >80% off.			"

Early Access Review
								Do not buy - the only thing the developer is doing is filling their 'dev blog' with empty promises, poor excuses and fake 'progress updates'. Game didn't receive an update in at least half a year (recently they added ""experimental"" ""updates"" that add almost no content and STILL break the game without fixing the old issues, so you get 1 exp. update to fix the one that came before it) now. Most recent update on their 'blog': a picture of a mob without much context and ""Well I don't feel like typing much. See you later!"" at the end. This just explicitly shows how lackluster and amateurish (or simply lying) their whole team is. On one occasion I had an unpleasant talk with a few of their devs and I can only say that if those people worked in any real company, they'd be fired by now.  Combat is extremely tedious and boring - hit stuff with swords and spears. For ten tiers. In a sci-fi themed game. Stuff kills you in two hits. Then you equip for that tier. Then you kill stuff in two hits until you go up a tier. Bosses are all incomplete and bland. Have trouble with one? Encase it in a dirt tomb and stab it/ blast it with turrets or underpowered guns. The only challenge in this game is dealing with the blatant lack of any though in the combat system EVEN THOUGH it was already redone to make it seem ""better"". One bad design decision leads to another and leaves the player frustrated, bored or simply regretful when he realises that he could have spent his money on something better (like a couple of actually good games). (as of 09/08/2014 this is STILL the case)Exploration is bland. Run around the planet, looking for labs for tech, cutting down trees. All planets feel exactly the same with a different colour palette. Best thing you can get out of this is some uniquely coloured blocks if you like building (but if you do, there's Terraria and Minecraft where you can do as much and more) (as of 09/08/2014 this is STILL the case)Tech is limited to new jumping mechanics and mechs which have a very limited window of usefulness. If any at all by the time you get them.If you ever wondered why the Early Access programme should have more restrictions and a refund policy in place then you can take a look at this game and find out. This project if we can even call it that is a cash grab by many standards and it reminds me only of one other game that was in the same state - the infamous scam ""WarZ"" now known as Infestation: Survivor Stories. Not to dwell on this for too long but if I am to be honest: this is the only purchase on my list of over 150 games that I have ever regretted and asked for a refund (that was refused because bah, early access shield).

In short. I still don't recommend Starbound. Really? fetching coffee for a npc? Is the best quests they can come up with? They making are making this game linear and boring. Let's not forget how long it took them to produce this low qaulity work. Modders have pretty much added all this content already for free! in way less time. These guys were paid millions.

Early Access Review
								Starbound is a sandbox adventure game that has been hailed as a long-awaited successor to Terraria. Unfortunately, I am applying the ""sandbox"" bit very loosely.At first glance, Starbound looks exactly as you would've expected it to look like. A game about building stuff, exploring countless alien worlds and generally killing ♥♥♥♥ for the hell of it. While in a literal sense, all of this is true, Starbound makes it apparent that all of these aren't going to be of any use to you throughout the game, and you're not going to have any fun trying.Starbound's linear progression system is a blatant contradiction to the term ""sandbox"", and mind-numbing amounts of item/material grinding don't help either.You see, while Starbound also bases its core elements off what has made games like Minecraft and Terraria so successful, there is also a very apparent lack of actual freedom-- the very same freedom that made the aforementioned games so enjoyable. Starbound's not-so-subtle linear progression is basically landmarked for you in small steps, telling you what you have to do in order to get ahead in terms of equipment. And by landmarks, I mean boss fights when you've done everything that the game tells you to do in a particular sector --basically just an area of space where creatures and items are all locked on a particular ""level"", so to speak. The sectors themselves are essentially levels, backtracking earlier ""sectors"" being completely useless; as most materials/items you'd find there would be of no benefit for use or crafting equipment of your current tier. And let's not forget that because these landmark bosses drop items that are absolutely necessary for crafting items of a higher tier, in the flavor of some advanced crafting station.Starbound also features needlessly complicated requirements for some basic items. For example, a device that allows you to breathe in space - in a game about space! - requires you to kill a mid-game boss, hunt down midgame minerals and have a crafting station that in itself requires some irrelevant materials. And mind you, this sort of pointless grind is necessary for a great deal of practical items such as armor, weapons and other equipment. While some weapons and armor are simple to create, those particular items are usually sub-par, if not utterly useless for the sector you'd be using them on.Exploration and the gathering of resources are pointless and incredibly unenjoyable, respectively.For a game about gathering resources and exploration, Starbound is still incredibly bland in both of those aspects. Of course hunting down minerals is a must, but Starbound seems to make even that a frustratingly boring experience. (I'm not saying it's amazing in any comparable games either, but Starbound somehow makes it even worse.) And don't even bother digging deeper into a world, it's easier to just find a different world and dig for whatever resource you need there. Also keep in mind that there are certainly no unique resources on particular worlds that would be of any use to you. And the only variation of equipment comes from the fact that most of it is randomly generated, with the exception of legendary or otherwise named items. Speaking of other worlds, and exploring in general, I can't say Starbound doesn't make it somewhat memorable to find some secret lab or mining complex hidden beneath the ground. But overall, these really don't help you at all in the long run. Functionally, almost all worlds are the same, they have trees, they have minerals, you should look to see if there's a structure that you could loot. If so, loot it and move onto the next world, if not, just move on. The only exceptions are asteroid fields and moons, which have no air, low gravity and more minerals. NPC villages basically exist solely for you to raid them, buy things from them and/or rest in themCombat is a slow-paced mess with unnecessary amounts of difficulty in places.On combat, Starbound is just plain bad. There's just no other way of putting it. It's arguably the most incredibly boring part of the game, either being an awkward cover-based ranged engagement or painfully monotonous melee combat, which consists of little more than ""click to swing thing"" until either your enemy dies or they knock you off a cliff and you die. Movement is teetering on 2 extremes, it's either a slow gait around your enemies with a bit of small hopping, or being knocked around at high velocity by the said enemies while completely helpless. In both cases it's extremely unenjoyable and very stiff, while some ""implants"" have since been added to remedy this terribly static combat (Such as higher jumping or quick bursts of speed), the fundamentals remain almost completely unaltered.The rewards of combat are almost completely null; regular enemies will not drop anything aside from a few bits of currency. Bosses will give you some necessary material to progress in the game, while mini-bosses occasionally drop some form of decent weaponry. That being said, boss fights as I've had them are crouching in a spot where the boss can't hit you and attacking them until they die, because it's simply too hard to attempt to attack them head-on. When I say hard, I mean they'll just kill you in 2 hits; combine that with the fact that combat is unredeemably boring and you're set for the most unenjoyable fighting you've had in a while.The fact that healing pots (known as StimPaks) are inexcusably rare and expensive do not help this at all. While highly effective, you'll burn through whatever miniscule amount of them you have left incredibly quickly. And with the pathetically small health pool you're given, (which does not scale to the enemies you'll be up against, even with appropriate armors equipped) you have little choice but to rely on them.Now, I'm going to be forthright here so pardon my unprofessional choice of wording, but Starbound's dev team is ♥♥♥♥ing incompetent.Chucklefish has done a lot to show us how hard they work to make Starbound what they promised it to be. Which to say is taking four million dollars of kickstarter funds, taking a long vacation after releasing their barely passable early access game, playing bloody Mario Kart instead of working on their game, and let's not forget acquiring a puppy for the office. They had promised game updates to come incredibly quickly, yet the last big update was six whole months ago. When they attempted to work with ETAs and failed, instead of taking the inevitable backlash they got and trying to improve on it, they just used it as a further excuse to not do anything. All official Chucklefish sites are heavily censored, any sort of criticism is flagged down as ""trolling"", regardless of how valid it actually is. And better yet, the devs take time out of their non-existant schedule to whine on Twitter, blaming ""trolls"" as the reason they're not getting their own work done.Chucklefish should be receiving no further support through Starbound or any other game, they're irresponsible, incompetent and show what little they care for everyone who had supported them.Feel free to disagree with me, but Starbound is a train wreck of a game. I give it a 3/10, there is enjoyment in the game, but it burns out way too fast. Linear progression in a sandbox game is downright unacceptable, grinding for items is an unnecessary meatfest, exploring nets you little reward, and combat is unreasonably hard with little health, disproportionately powerful enemies; also being painfully monotonic and boring. And it has also become quite clear that every dollar spent on Starbound is just another dollar Chucklefish is going to run away with.Starbound is a journey into the skies and beyond, and according to Starbound, the skies and beyond aren't very enjoyable.Thanks to Flashtirade for being my editor once more.

								I'm not even sure how to begin.It doesn't suck, it's not that bad, I can dig the space travel and the overall theme of the game and like anything else; having friends makes the experience pleasant for everyone. But that's where it ends for me. Five months have come and gone with nary a word of an update to fix the glaringly obvious issues that this game still has and the most we've gotten out of it was the manure splattered onto the windmill and the community has all but completely annihilated itself because of it and the joke so funnah maymay of a gods forsaken Horse AI with enough backpedaling to by the Community Managers that it would knock off miles from any car when the poll was “accidentally” deleted.I put down $15.00 in hopes of this becoming a big thing and even though Chuckles and his crew grossed nearly $20 MILLION in terms of funding. THIS is what they have to show for it? I expected better from them. I'm no developer but even I understand that leaving people high and dry with nothing but empty promises is a d!ck move.Don't get this game. There are plenty who have, there are plenty who held out hope for something. It's not happening and it never will.

If you really want to play this game just pirate it.July 2nd original ""review""--------Edited review December 29thModding somewhat works but 1/3 of the mods do not work for the nightly builds of this game.The people who give positive reviews of this game go on about how the game updates there is some truth in this lie.The game has updates when you switch it to the ""nightly"" version of the game which isn't a buggy mess but it certainly has some glaring flaws to it, some ui components do not work, can't rebind keys properly, some balance issues with the game, the framerate takes a dip at random intervals in my play time (framerate may vary), And Nova-Kids have such a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ computer interface on their ship it makes me want to puke and never play their race.I do find my own nickel of fun when I'm playing this game but as I have said in my original review I would strongly recommend pirating this game before you purchase it.If you like this game then I wholly encourage you to buy the game.I DO NOT regret buying this game.Sure Chucklefish is a sleazy company but I think they have taken the consideration of some of its community backlash and are actually trying to make this game at least enjoyable for its fifteen dollar price tag.--------			"

								The devs promised daily updates... there have been maybe 4 updates since December, with little change to the actual game. While the game is considered ""Early Access"" the core part of the game - the progression -  is hardly developed. There are multiple great aspects to this game, but once you reach the tier where there is no more challenge, the game becomes boring and pointless. I can't recommend this game as the basic foundation of it is not complete. Save your $15.			"

Early Access Review
								A prime example of why people should stay away from Early Access, when this game is complete it might be truly fun however in this state its a definitive DO NOT BUY. Some games are capable of being fun in unfinished states but Starbound is not, what is currently offered is a sandbox, a very dull sandbox. It's great if you want to build or just stare at the same procedural environments over and over. Sadly even the core feature of the current alpha is lacking, the combat.The vision for this game is sweet, however it's far beyond the horizon and I don't get how the game could be finished in even a year at the current rate of development, I think perhaps 2 updates in total so far have come out, ones which didnt add content but rather just remixed the barest progression system ever. There might be some turn around with this due to the recent restructing of Chucklefish, I have seen some interesting progress in their daily updates (showing us what they're working on, not actually playable).I have seen some negatives of the game just from this alpha and they don't bode well for the final release. If you are a fan of Terraria's tight controls and graphics they are not to be found in Starbound. The graphics are fluffy as well as player movement and combat.To elaborate I feel as if all movement in the game is slow, from the velocity of bullets to fall speed, as well as the hitboxes of monsters being somewhat strange, probably in part to their procedural generation. I have a hard time believing the game will have a high difficulty lacking of frustrations, whereas in Terraria due to its good performance it can ask much of the player in it's boss fights. My current outlook is that more fun will be gotten from the noncombat experiences of the game. Those experiences however apart from building are nonexistant in the current build, features such as trading, questing, farming (plants are in but the full extent of the system is missing), and storylines are still in development.

Early Access Review
								I decided to update my review due to the influx of comments I have recieved on it. First the game is not worth the money you pay for it. Not by a long shot. Early game is fine, very playable, but mid/late game is extremely bare and unfinished and the game progress is very linear. There are no options when it comes to gear choices as you simply build the next tier of gear then fight the next boss.All the planets FEEL the same. You run across the surface, find a few chests, then find a NPC building, kill the mobs inside then move onto the next planet, each planet follows this same pattern. They do LOOK different, but its the FEEL i am talking about. Digging seems pointless as you can find all the ores you need above ground and the weapons you get as drops are better than the ones you can craft. Combat is fun at first but very samey. All the weapons seem the indentical. Some have a few gimmicks but there isnt much difference whatever you use.  My biggest problem with this game is the lack of updates to the STABLE BUILD. There has been 2 tiny updates to the stable build since February, which added virtually zero content. The game has 2 other beta options which are the unstable build and a nightly build. The unstable build is updated once in a while, but again no sizable updates. And then there is the nightly build, which apparently gets updated nightly, but it is very broken. I have yet to see a sizable update to this either, its always just little things, like a new AI interface which is purely cosmetic and adds no content. When I did update to the nightly build I couldnt even start the game for a while. To conclude with the beta options: updates are tiny and irrelvent, they are badly broken sometimes, so you are left with the choice to play the unfinished game from febraury, or a even beta beta build which might break your game and saves everyday. So yeh, in the description they say ""UPDATES WILL COME THICK AND FAST"" but the updates have been neither thick nor fast. Buy this game at your own peril.I will also be deleting comments off this review, good or bad. If you disagree, go make your own review and dont waste your time commenting on mine.			"

												Since this game attracts the Terraria crowd, here's a review about what you should expect out of this game compared to Terraria. For starters, Starbound is kind of like Terraria on steroids - it's bigger, far more involved (it actually has a quest component to it) and it's way harder.+++++++++++ Starbound vs. Terraria: Gameplay Differences Even on the easiest setting, Starbound plays like Terraria Hardmode from the very beginning. There's a difference between 'hard' and 'obnoxious', though, and in my opinion, this game is in the 'hard' category. You'll have to get on your feet and learn how things work, but thankfully, this is easy to do as the game will guide you with a tip every time you discover a new item or action for the first time. You really appreciate every item you find, because you're going to be very weak for a long time in the beginning, and your first desire will be to get rid of that crappy starter weapon. If you've already played Terraria, you'll know how to jump right in to Starbound. The game mechanics are practically identical when it comes to mining, taking items, building houses and fighting enemies. It's bascially ""another take on Terraria,"" as you'll see very quickly. Terraria's controls are simply better - jumping and curving in mid-air to reach a narrow platform is frustrating in this game, and you'll have to get used to how its ""gravity"" works, as it is far more unforgiving. Couple that with the fact that you'll get seriously hurt (or killed) from falling.Starbound has a bigger emphasis on food than Terraria. Food seemed nearly worthless after awhile in Terraria (except for pumpkin pies), but it is a necessity here -- especially on the harder tier, where you'll starve to death...this doesn't happen in the easiest mode, though. You'll start off finding and knowing about basic food, but different recipes will unlock as you discover other ingredients and make new items. Food not only increases health, but gives perks and stat boosts as well. Even on the easiest setting, food rots if you hold on to it for too long. +++++++++++ Starbound vs. Terraria: CombatCombat is highly simplistic in Starbound, it is nothing more than hack & slash for the most part. Some monsters attack by nature, some don't, but the majority of them will simply chase you down and slam into you when attacked, making combat predictable in this game. Unlike Terraria, you'll be able to access guns and other exotic items pretty quickly and not far after getting started, rather than in Terraria where you have to complete a good portion of the game to unlock certain NPCs. For the most part - one handed swords swing quicky and allow you to use a shield in the other hand, but they are weak and will require many 'hits' to kill an enemy. Two-handed swords are slow, but do far more damange than a one-handed. Other weapons like axes and hammers require you to pull back the weapon with your mouse, and release to swing. Guns allow ranged attacks but are extremely weak and will require many shots to take an enemy down, but will allow you to do it from a safe distance. In the beginning, you'll want to stay far, far away from any enemy that has a gun - especially if it's a sniper rifle.+++++++++++ Starbound vs. Terraria: Look & FeelStarbound has the look and feel of an early 90s PC or SNES game, kind of like something made by Ocean or Sierra, as opposed to Terraria's more pixellated NES feel. Starbound's music is more predictable and uniform - lots of quiet, soothing piano music. Starbound's ""monsters"" look like Pokemon rejects, which kind of gave the game its own characteristic. I personally like the huge range, style and diversity of Terraria's creatures way more. Landscapes are far more detailed then Terraria, especially backdrops, trees and other elements. Trees fall sideways when cut, and you'll be surprised when you see your first landslide when you're mining underground and hit a ceiling with loose rock or slime. This game has the same ""biome"" style regions as Terraria, where you'll venture from a forest to a jungle, or from a cavern to a slime pit, and eventually down to magma. From experience, it looks like digging too far down will result in an long drop that leads directly to an infinite ocean of lava - be careful when you're digging a Starbound ""hellevator"" as you won't get the same results as you did in Terraria...Terraria's building mechanic is more involved and intricate than Starbound for the simple reason of hammers: they allowed you to hit blocks into ""angles"" and make tons of different and unique designs, corners and slopes in Terraria. No such thing exists in Starbound, where you can only place items in square blocks. However, Starbound's graphics are more detailed and beautiful, and you'll still be able to create great looking structures. There's no ""corruption"" or ""crimson"" style event that you'll have to worry about in Starbound, so, create what you want and don't worry about what will happen to it mid-way through the game.For the most part, you take take or steal almost everything you see in Starbound, just like you can in Terraria, except on missions (for example, your first real mission, The Outpost, where all of the chairs/beds/consoles/etc are locked down and immobile). For items that you can't craft, you may come across blueprints which are one-use items that instantly add the item to your list of craftables, one you have the necessary tool to do so.When it comes to crafting, everything works pretty much the same between the two games. Craft a workbench-style item and it will allow you to create new items. In Starbound, you can upgrade these existing tool stations with specific materials to make better items. You'll find that in order to do this, better ore from outside your solar system is necessary.Negatives: you can't pause the game (WHY?!)+++++++++++ Starbound vs. Terraria: My Favorite ThingsThere are a few things that set Starbound from Terraria in my mind - the game's universe seems bigger and more ""involved,"" because it simply is...you're no longer standed on a single game world of small/medium/large that's created from the main menu, but an entire 'universe' is created for you when you first start a Starbound quest. You'll get your own space ship, which can be decorated like a house, and will take you around the solar system without costing you any fuel. To see how big the game world is, zoom out of the solar system and take a look at the universe to see the other star systems and the planets in them. It's an exciting thing to figure out on your first playthrough.The game has objectives and a questline for you to go through, which makes the game interesting rather than Terraria's ""grind and get more powerful"", which becomes stale through time. While there are plenty of boilerplate ""fetch"" quests in Starbound, they'll force you to check out locations you haven't seen yet. I actually like the increase in difficulty that Starbound has vs. Terraria - it's easy to adjust to, and it makes you appreciate the simpler things more. Getting a better weapon is a gigantic milestone in this game, since they are far more difficult to find than in Terraria, and random chests don't usually mean uber weapons are in them...but, mediocre ones, or weapons that are only marginally better at one thing, but worse at another (damage vs. speed). You won't be crafting better weapons and armor for quite awhile - at least, until you get the courage to leave the solar system - so, you'll spend a lot of time mining and looking for abandoned outposts.Overall, if you loved Terraria but got tired of it, you won't want to miss this one - it's a bigger 'take' on Terraria with a lot of bonuses that keep the game interesting.

												*TL;DR at the bottom*Look at the most popular reviews for Starbound and 90% of them are negative even though the overall review is 89% positive. While many of these negative reviews do address issues with the game, I do not think they are giving Starbound enough credit.""Starbound is space Terraria""I do not think it is fair to compare Starbound and Terraria. Yes they are both 16-bit adventure/sandbox games, but each plays very differently. Terraria is more about the gameplay and having fun. Starbound is about the experience. This game throws you into a universe and gives your character a story. Each game is fun in its own way. (On a side note I actually like the combat in Starbound a bit better. Terraria's combat is too ""arcadey"" for me, but that is the appeal of the game for some people).""Progression is too fast""I got this game years ago when trying to progress through the game was like trying to swim through maple syrup while handcuffed. I would spend hours looking for enough fuel to jump to the next solar system. Now many people feel that progression is too easy. There is a fine balance between too fast and too slow and it is hard for developers to get it right the first time.""Interesting things have been removed""I agree with this to some extent. A while ago there was an update to starbound that added new food and farming mechanics but removed hunger. I was sad because I really liked hunger, but they added hunger back. The devs can always add back old things if they feel like the game needs it. Sure, a lot of cool content was removed, but does anyone mention all of the cool content that was added? Ship upgrading, the outpost, new combat mechanics, etc. Yeah some cool things have been removed, but far more ccol things have been added. Most importantly there is something called modding. If you want temperature back, someone has made a mod for it. Chucklefish has a vision for their game. They felt like Starbound did not need temperature, so they removed it. If you like temperature and feel like it would make the game better, you can add it. Modding is not meant to fix the game, but it can enhance it or alter it towards your specific tastes. ----------------------------------------------------------------In the end I think people are more vocal about what is wrong with the game than what is right, and Starbound doesn't deserve that. Does anyone mention the amazing soundtrack or solid 16-bit graphics? Very few. Yes the game needs critizism, every game does. That is what allows a game to become better. Just remember that this game can be a great experience if you don't just focus on the bad.TL;DRThis game has issues but it also has many great things to offer. Look at more than just the negative reviews and you will find an amazing game.*Edited to clarify my comments about modding.			"

Early Access Review
								Before reading this, I want you to keep in mind one thing, one core fact that drives this review: I LOVED Starbound to pieces, for the longest time.The first time I picked up this game (on the recommendation of a friend, I might add), I was exploring planets left and right, finding creatures that spit shadow, dragons that could one shot me, fish that looked like submarines, and dogs that vomit rainbows, on the surface of worlds made of purple eyeballs. It was the best thing I had ever seen. Then the updates came. I figured ""oh, they'll probably make it easier to find civilization"" (at the time I had only found 3 settlements, by my 30th hour of gameplay. I was still happy.) The game started to lag for me. I was used to it, I had a bad computer at the time.Shortly after, there was a wipe. I lost my character and my favorite server went down. I couldn't play with my friends anymore, the custom ship I was building (thanks to a lovely little mod bundle a friend and I assembled), the planet we were terraforming and the MASSIVE ice-world castle I was building...all gone. I saw what they did with the game and I said ""ok, I guess that's a reasonable update."" and began my base and ship anew.Then there was another...and another...Then yet another update came and I couldn't play anymore. I was looking at enough lag that creatures wouldn't move on my screen and I could walk right through hostile dungeons without firing a shot.For six months or more, I abandoned this game. A few weeks ago, I got a new computer. I immediately thought back to starbound, one of my favorite games of all time. I boot it up, all excited! Then I remember...oh, the server is gone now. Oh, my base is gone, my ship is gone, my loot is gone, my character is gone. I accept it and move on, perfectly content to start a new character and terraform everything from scratch.That's how amazing this game was.My first planet, I'm happy as a clam. I had a new bazooka that fired guided missiles and a nice sword that that spins around and massacres everything. Then I found a house! YAY! A neighbor! Then another one.....YAY! TWO NEIGHBORS!*next planet* oh hey, a village!*next planet* oh hey, 4 villages!*planet after that* Its the garden of Eden, holy crap!*fifty planets later* Jesus, another village? This whole place is filled with lava though...At this point, I've noticed that nearly every planet has a village on it. Most have several and most of the ones that have several, are completely covered in tiny little wooden villages. I didn't like that fact much, as it took away from the previous, unique feeling of awe and accomplishment that once accompanied the discovery of a settlement. Quickly becoming bored with that, I did something I had never done before. After just a few hours, I decided to run up a few levels on the main campaign (time was, I never needed to go beyond durasteel, I just explored and built). Even with all my goofing around and time wasting, I got the max tier of armor and weaponry, killed every boss using just my chakram (first weapon I ever found. It scales, but really badly...still the best weapon I have somehow) and I hit a wall...""what do I do now?""...""OHH! I KNOW! I'll capture a bunch of pets and start an illegal animal fighting ring!""...oh...wait. Nope, cant capture ""combat pets"" anymore. Only...you know I'm still not sure what you CAN capture...all I know is that its something not worth the effort...I threw those pods at literally everything interesting.""Ok, well, how about I do what my friend was doing and collect cool trees?"" Nope! None of the non-basic ones drop saplings anymore...ok...I had nowhere to really go, nothing to really do and all of a sudden I realized just how hollow the game had become.I considered building a base. I mean, every planet does have a massive cliff somewhere that I could just dig into now...Then again...that's every planet.I could go on an ice planet...but survival has been removed for a long time and all the upgrades make everything safe. (oh, minor note, I haven't found a single background that struck me as more than mildly interesting. They used to have some really gorgeous ones, like aurora backgrounds, particularly on ice planets. Now, at best, we get a mountain range. At worst, a bunch of mildly weird trees that really muck with your depth perception.)what about a lava planet? No...It takes eons to reach the floor and I'd probably just find another village.How about I settle on a planet with lots of those cool creatures the procedural generation always comes up with?...oh...wait. I haven't encountered a single procedural creature since I re-installed.It used to be hard to find a perfect planet, with a nice background and dangerous weather (seriously, meteors used to be everywhere, it was awesome!) and cool animals and a nice hillside to carve a castle into. And when you finally did, you WANTED to build there. You were COMPELLED, to build there! Now, every planet is...bland and identical. Everywhere, the same dopey rock throwing crab, the same weird, super annoying spider/rock hedgehog thing and the same...is that oddish from pokemon? ((0))_((0))This game used to be amazing. And I mean, AMAZING. It looked like terraria, granted, but it was in my top ten games of all time. Since the updates, I hesitate to say its even on par with terraria. The balance was lost. The devs left out most of the features that they were supposedly building (custom ships, being a big one. Wouldn't even be hard to do, its one file and a couple of tile types. ENTIRELY feasible and easy to make completely optional!), they increased chests, ore deposits and village areas to ridiculous levels and all but REMOVED procedural generation. Where are my shadow dogs? Where are my eyeball trees and strange giant, lightning spitting, barbarian hylotl? (I want to take a moment to impress upon you, the importance of this last bit here. The procedural generation was about 80% of what made this game amazing. Its gone now.)And where are those danged ship raiding pirates that we were promised? Congrats, you added a rail system...something that the community did for mods... in a few days...years ago.There wasn't a single second that I regretted purchasing this game before I reinstalled last week. Now, I'm not sure I'll ever play it again.So here I go, onto the next game that promises to be exactly what this game used to be.			"

												This game ended up being surprisingly stale, they cut a massive amount of functioning content that made the game more entertaining, leaving the game with little to stand on compared to it's predecessor or other games in it's genre.-The weapons are overbalanced and stratified (Magic is a joke, swords can attack in a combo but they get a huge delay afterwards if you do, all melee weapons are around the same level of slow etc.)-All the interesting flying and movement options are removed, the morphball is the only surviving relic of this stuff, but its useless and is never necessary out of dungeons, and because it lacks any special abilities all you do is move through tiny holes with it. Like how hard would it have been to make it drop a little energy bomb to solve switch puzzles or something? -The main questline requires you just running through same styled planets and clicking on furniture until you luck out enough to be able to play a dungeon. This could happen on your first try, or only be possible after around 5 hours of gameplay going through towns and planets per quest.The worst part of this is, the game USED to have interesting and fun content, there used to be more than one reason to go to a moon, there used to be fun flying techs and movement modifications. Weapons used to attack in reasonably diverse ways, and actually good ones used to exist. But all this functional and fun stuff that people enjoyed from early access was taken out.The only reason I could see, seeing as how all the stuff worked and was finished, is that they wanted these things to ""fit"" in the game. Like they wanted the morph ball to be useful, so they designed dungeons and levels with holes small enough to require it. But if say, someone had a jetpack, then any dungeon with a jumping puzzle would be trivialized. Thing is, they still have jumping techs in the game, because the ""meat"" of the game is still exploration, so you still can cheat at jumping puzzles, just not to the same extent. So in addition to failing there, this also means that you will never really be able to explore as easily as you want to, because the ""meat"" of the game is crippled by the devs inability to work around flight mechanics when designing pointless single item drop puzzle rooms.This game's skeleton is still a metroidvania, and do you know what metroidvania's AREN'T beloved for, platforming and balanced combat. Few people played Castlevania Symphony of the Night and then commented ""Wow I hate the crissaegrim, magic, and being a bat, climbing this tower while fighting the 800 medusa heads that spawned should have been WAY more tedious for me.""The changes made seem to reflect the dev's desire to make the game feel ""whole"" on release, no loose or frayed ends, and with mechanics at least ""loosely"" fitting in with what they've done, but the aspects of the gameplay they sought to preserve by removing content are the least palatable parts of the game, and now were stuck in a crippled snoozefest.In summary, the devs goofed with their decisionmaking and the game has suffered for it.Its a space game, throw in black hole guns, giant orbital beam cannons, jetpacks, lazer swords that can attack rapidly and in huge arcs, put in nukes that can unexist whole planets, either yielding huge mineral rewards or releashing eldritch terrors I need to fight with my ship. Throw in short range blink teleportation that doesnt suck. Make light not be an Issue for god sakes, I know the monster hunter logic of ""the more we cripple the player the more mechanics we can have to uncripple them"" and that makes sense for that game, but were in space for christ's sake, ALL suits would have A light on them, and there's enough other things going on that this wouldn't be missed. Put in high gravity planets, put in planets with poisonous food so you need to stock up. Throw in floating sky cities that hover on high density gas planets(real scientific possibilty for venus colonization). Or at the very least just put BACK in some of the fun that was removed. The game as it stands is you double jumping around samey rocks while swinging a sword one time a second and clicking alien pots to get to the next dungeon. All other content is either nigh pointless or removed, and what's left is boring.PS: This is reposted from a community discussion.			"

												I'm going to keep this short and sweet and get straight to the point.IF you're expecting terraria in space, or some form of a terraria clone in anyway, don't buy the game because you will be disappointed. Starbound is to Terraria as TF2 is to Overwatch. Meaning while they look very similar in visual style and gameplay, they're nothing alike. Stop comparing the two.If you're expecting something that's a bit more metroidvania styled in gameplay and looking for a game more focused on exploration, this game is for you.If you have grown bored of terraria and want a new 2D expereience, this game is for you. If you're not a fan of building and want a home right off the bat, this game is for you.Do note, the story is great but the scan quests suck. You can skip them via admin commands, there are several guides on how to skip the scanning quests.I do wish the developers would add more techs, especially ones that enable flight and unique movement boosts, same with vehicles.If you dislike certain aspects of the game, the workshop is your best friend and usually patches most of the problems you may have. While many vanillaists complain that the workshop shouldn't be responsible for ""fixing things the develeopers failed"", they're not really patches or fixes but more so useful tweaks and additions. Do note that anything that add blocks or recipes to the game will break your character once uninstalled.One thing i suggest is to disable vsync. Browse local files, go inside of the storage folder, in the file starbound.config, set it to false. It'll massively improve the FPS. There's definitly room for optimizations though (especially on windows).Overall, i love this game. I've enjoyed playing it so far and I do hope the devs improve certain aspects of this game. Given that they have an unstable branch for testing the game, and the newest patch is alright so far. I'd if i were going off the negative reviews alone, they're slowly getting back on the right track.			"

								Update: Enjoyed toying arround with the community for a long time. That plaything got old and I moved on. Being a pain in the ♥♥♥♥ to CF and the community was worth the 15 dollars. The game itself is not worth it though.Disclaimer:If you prefere a more objective, better written review give this guy a chance: http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198082557773/recommended/211820/Its far less vulgar then mine and he brings up proofs of CFs mistakes and censorship.Check him out.IMPORTANT: Going to do a full scale update completly revamping the review. You can call me whatever you want or create as many alts you want to disagree just because you want to defend your little ""poor innoncent indie development company"", I dont care. The forums are turning into a corrupted sinkhole and are de facto banning users for no reason. Its the 18th December 2015 now. This game has been in early access for... 3 years... 3 damn years. And not a single bit of decent progress. Instead people who were fans of the game get banned on their forums for saying that their combat ""update"" is bad. Instead they add useless furniture, tedious fetch quests and a useless colony system instead of propper content like a functioning, balanced combat system or the actually promised dark and mature content. Instead this game gets DF9'ed so they can forget it as fast as possible. What a waste of money and time...This review is outdatet. The game is ♥♥♥♥ now after certain ""updates"" (2 noteworthy updates changing the game objectivly to the worst.)--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Alright after some serious thoughts on the game and recent posts of the devs calling negative criticism invalid I would like to disencourage from supporting Chucklefish and any titles they are developing. They called people with valid points trolls and idiots. Valid points are for instance that the game developement is by far too slow, alot of broken promises, no ETAs anymore just because 1 or 2 done by the devs backfired, ignoring the official community almost entirely (inofficial communities like Reddit get all the attention) and if they interact with the official community on the official forums it is just minimal and not saying anything.The game itself was suprisingly good for the way it was back 1,5 years ago and honestly I was hoping that devs would keep up the good work they had when initially starting the public <<Beta>> back in december. It had nice mechanics (all gone now), 6 interesting species which are quite original (except for humans maybe, because well thats us) (2 of them still not being fully implemented), a decent weather system which can blow away your mind at some point (which game offers nowadays weather with really destructiv abilities and forces you to think into your buildings, what materials you use and the whole design.), and most important ALOT procedurly generated things, mobs are random, weapons are random, blades are (almost) random, planets and envirements are random (partially, means dungeons and certain presets are there and selected on generating a planet) and pretty well done on the code you could think. Nope its a pile of garbage.But for the ignorance and sorta mean spirited comment on quite a few negativ feedbacks on the official forums done by a good chunk of the community I would not recomment supporting them just for the Devs to wake up. I got the impression that they are not providing anything good at the moment. What we got is a relativly good game whatsoever. But the Dev team is currently a, excuse my words, horrible cluster♥♥♥♥.If they intend to change that behavior at some point I will retract the negativ review of course and turn it into a positiv one, but that must be said, the current state of developing is not really satisfying and you are pretty much tipping in the dark of knowing what will be added at some point. If you just want to have a good sidescrolling survival game in space which allows you to build awesome 2d structures and some fairly interesting, very different alien species to choose from (which game has humanoid canivorous plants nowadays, again really good design decision by them) then its something for you. And if you are into weird tentacle porn/pr0n then there is also a whole biome you will like. Get a <<sexy>> female character (probaly alien species aswell for the extra weird guys) and have your wildest Phantasies on said biome ;). So its up to you: If you want a relativly good game now and dont care about future developments, consider this as thumbs up and go ahead and purchase it. If you are looking a bit more skeptical on things I would wait and see how things develope and not purchase... specially after the drama the past days the devs caused in the official community. Oh and mobs look like Pokemon sometimes, thats also a nice little plus. And you can actually catch those mobs aswell and use them as critters for your own purposes (the feature is still not fleshed out but still pretty cool). That should sum it up, thanks for bothering to read.Update 1:So apparently the dev team managed to move all together after roughly 4-5 months. They are now located in great britain and are feeding the official forums with news and on what they are working on... though after another ""rant surge"" of the official community of not being updated on the forums, and reddit again getting all the attention. They posted then a ""Status Update"" which involved nothing but an advertisement for a game they are publishing. That caused more trouble finally getting them to post on a daily base since monday. Lets see how long they continue and when we will see an actual patch... If they keep their word and ""big content patch"" is on its way then the game might have a chance to get better soon... getting better reputation wise.Update 2:CF is censoring now their steam subforum.Update 3: Mod who is censoring hard got removed, Finn is quite ok to be frank, other one ""Shoehead"" intruded steamforums, got turned into shredds within a few hours.Update 4:CF has a subforum on their official forum hidden from regular members. Its not a moderator forum.http://i.4cdn.org/vg/1407014460583.pnghttp://i.4cdn.org/vg/1407016724018.png http://i.4cdn.org/vg/1407016900953.pngThe people in that section are all hardcore defending people. All of them. And presumeable out of the rules posted by ""Sledra"" they are allowed to ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ there. So why dont I get an unmoderated forum... like they got... why is steamforums not moderated by their mods so people could post whatever they want.			"

												I liked this game back when it first came out on steam. When 1.0 came out, I figured I might enjoy it again. That wasn't the case. A lot of content was cut and even exploration feels much more bland and stale. -Temperature system has been removed. This was one of the nice features back during the beta. Most clothing had function (Snow Infantry set was very useful) and it felt very relaxing sitting by a fire on a snow planet so you could warm up.-Sectors have been removed. You used to only be limited in exploration by the temperature system and how warm or cool you could get. A forest planet in a sector would be just as dangerous as a lava planet on that same sector, and you would find the same resources on every planet in that sector until you moved on to the next one. This was a favorite feature of mine and really enhanced exploration because there was just as much incentive to going to the forest planet as the lava planet. -Most techs are gone. I remember all the vehicle and flying techs, and how you'd have to find them to actually use them. Now that I can't use my bubble tech, I have to build giant pillars to get on avian pirate ships. And this isn't all, there was also a mech and some other vehicles. The only surviving tech vehicle is the boat, only now you have to waste pixels buying it instead of being incentivized to explore to find it.-Randomly generated monsters and weapons have been removed. I enjoyed this because it added to exploration and had you wondering what kind of creatures and crazy weapons you'd find on a planet you'd land on. Every creature was unique and every weapon was unique, down to the name and function. This also added a lot of fun to exploration because of course, you wouldn't know what you're going to find.-Story isn't that great. I honestly had more fun back when you'd build the bosses yourself in order to advance to the next sector and unlock more equipment and crafting tables. I thought the beginning of the story was fine, but the rest felt repetative and boring. ""Find a ________ settlement and scan objects"" gets very annoying and I tend to just drift away from the story altogether. I have yet to face the final boss because of this. -Plenty of weapons and armor have been cut, and I don't mean the randomized ones you used to find on planets. I mean weapons and armor you crafted at tables. Copper and gold almost seem to have no use anymore, and I quite enjoyed those armors, as bad as they were, and copper armor and weapons were easily obtained in the early game, allowing you to take on more dangerous things. It felt like I was legitimately getting stronger and every ore had a use. Almost any type of weapon could be made from any type of ore. Feel like making daggers? No problem. Spears? Yep. Instead now, there are too few craftable armors and weapons, and it seems ores have gotten even more scarce.-Further cuts include certain dungeons (USCM bases are a prime example), and you can no longer attack NPCs unless you break all their stuff. If I want to be a murderous psychopath and purge xenos, just let me do it please. On top of all that, there's little reason to go to moons or asteroids anymore. Asteroids would be one of the most dangerous biomes in the game with the best resources, but now there's pretty much nothing. I will repeat, I LOVED this game in 2013. Telling people to mod it in is no excuse and it's the wrong mentality to show to developers.  I'll change my opinion if some of the good features are added back into the game or some of the many promises Chucklefish made are implemented. Starbound simply feels like half the game it was when it first came out on Early Access.			"

								I have really enjoyed playing this game with my friends and family for 1000+ hours. It’s easy enough that my 5 year old son could understand the controls and play for hours. I like being able to play LAN with my with my family or on a private server with friends. The variety of planets, items, building materials and monsters is great. I do like all the updates the game developers have made. I wish there was more mission and story content but the developers are working on it. I'll have to wait till end of game development till I can truly evaluate the content amount. My favorite thing to do in this game is play with my young son and help him build houses, go looking for ""buried"" treasures and fight monsters. I think this is a great game for young families.What more could a little kid want, then roaming a galaxy is his spaceship, finding treasure and fighting bad guys. "

								No meaningful updates have been released for about two or three months. Developers ban people on their forums for expressing any kind of negative opinion about Starbound. While the core mechanics of the game are in need of serious work, Chucklefish is interested only in creating more useless different hats and reworking old characters models. The game is terrible and every single component of it requires a lot of tuning and balancing. Release date is being pushed forward again and again. When Starbound was released on Steam they promised they would release the game in 2013. After a few months they said ""well, maybe we will release it in 2014"". Now they say that it's impossible to release it earlier than 2015.			"

I do not think you should buy this game at this moment, but you should watch.TL;DR:Wait for release, and perhaps a little while after! See how the final stages of development goes! Make sure implementations of vital features and the way they intertwine are up to your par! Things have been improving, accelerating, and shaping up a lot lately...but you never know what one thing could ruin it all for you as an individual. As always, be wise with your money.Do I at this point think release (or a few big updates after) will be worth your money? Yes. Do I think that it could also potentially be held back by a poorly implemented feature or two? Quite possibly. So if you have already purchased starbound...maybe it will soon be time to give it another go! But if you haven't...hold on to your wallets for just a little longer.======================================In-depth Feature Critiques:The Beginning:You start out on a pretty planet, with a lush, colorful, friendly background. The terrain is usually mild in variation, making navigation fairly simple and quick. You are outright forced to dig down to the bottom of the planet--gathering ore along the way for gear--to acquire core fragments so you can fix your ship and go elsewhere.Now, this may sound pretty annoying--and it is, however, many steps have been taken to make it a relatively quick and easy process. There are more caves and tunnels, making digging down to the bottom easier, as well as ore deposits that can be broken up to get a decent amount of a certain ore type. Underground sub-dungeons can potentially provide interesting loot, or just a needed change of scenery or some pixels.The Planets and Exploration:Upon gaining the ability to venture further, you may wonder just how good the new sights will be. The answer to this question: a mixed bag. Many planets seem boring and pointless, just a new color or different dungeon/settlement type. Maybe a cool biome or two...maybe a bunch of annoying biomes. Maybe there's no good loot. Maybe ore generation makes your desired type hard to find. To make matters worse, certain planet types tied to getting through the later tier are by nature incapable of being fun and unique. Ocean planets, for example. Mostly water atm.On the other hand, it is very possible to stumble upon a planet with cool terrain, a cool settlement or dungeon with good loot, awesome looking background parallax and kickass trees, and an abundance of ore. Regardless, there needs to be more unique elements and reward/incentive to exploration. Things to make individual planets stand out and be special. Rare biome or dungeon variations, a strangely safe and beautiful planet of a dangerous harsh biome type, a different day/night cycle time, dangerous creatures and minibosses.The Combat and Creatures:Combat in starbound is fairly well setup. Weapons have unique properties and styles that generally enable you to fight however you want. Monsters now have better tells and more sensible windups, so blocking, dodging, parrying, and tanking are now all viable options. Since monsters are mostly generated off screen, and generally stay there, the end result is that combat often feels like a chore you do to get that one creature with that one annoying attack to stop impeding your horizontal progress around a planet.There is much room for improvement in that regard:Loot should be more rewarding, fun, or varied. Monsters should seek you out and display unique behaviors. Perhaps some herd up, or fight in small roaming packs, or try to avoid you. Even if nothing at all is done to make it more engaging and fun, rather than like a popup when trying to surf the net, the spawning needs to be tweaked. I would like to see hardcaps on the amount of creatures that can spawn within a set distance of each other, or while you are busy killing other mobs, or how quickly it will populate the area past your sight with new monsters when you've just slaughtered five so you can finally resume moving forward.The Functional Mechanics and Building:They actually nailed this one. The matter manipulator is not only a lore-friendly tool, but an essential one. It is a way to have an item bound to your character at all times, not taking up inventory or hotbar space, that offers a big improvement on the utility found in most sandboxes. Digging and placing blocks can be precise, with ugprades to speed and tiles covered, the size of which can be adjusted on the fly. You can remove and relocate liquids, and building is quick and easy as well, thanks to the handy ability for your matter manipulator to hightlight relevant blocks. As a protip: You can even use it to help search for buried ore in the dark!Building is quite good. There are many objects and styles of blocks to play around with, and you can now colonize planets and rent out rooms of your design to NPCs. The building materials chosen for this process directly effect what you will get. This gives more purpose to the various biomes, and the exploration of them, because there are tenant NPCs that are based specifically on certain biome types. This was also very well done. Unfortunately, the availability of unique and varied building blocks in terms of aesthetics is limited. Aside from stone, many can only be scavenged from settlements or dungeons, no less! There are plenty of blocks that will end up having 100 recolors, as well, due to the nature of their planet, like sand and dirt. So why is there not a similar change in color and style not found in wallpapers on settlements, the color of bricks used in temples, and so on? Maybe one day.The utility of the sci-fi exploration sandbox genre typing doesn't end there. A ship AI personal to your race is a clever way to dispense introductions to the game and quests, tips, and inform you if you try to do something like pay for an upgrade with too few materials. There are many other instances of starbound's mechanics being very well designed, so the foundation is strong.======================================I've maxed out on space to the point where I can't even finish the following section. For those who want to read the rest, I threw up a silly wordpress site: here[fakersrealreviews.wordpress.com]======================================The Sandbox, Progression, and Professions:This one is a bit more difficult to comment on, because it's in a pretty heavy state of flux lately, and especially going forward from here, so I'll cover the basics from where it has been to where it is going. Back in my day, when we had to walk to school uphill in the snow, 10 miles, both ways...you could simply load up your ship with coal and take off to the great unknown. This was pretty cool, but honestly, from a design standpoint it did allow you to exhaust content quickly and kill off the novelty of the sights to see. The starmap at this point branched out with similar planets, and you had to unlock the next tier to see new types. This was pretty lame, actually, and it conveyed an extreme feeling of artificial walls and progression.			"

												I dig this game way way more than Terraria.There's just way more roleplaying potential to a game where you explore the endless Universe, as opposed to a game where you go right or left.I just want to manspread my Galactic Empire.But fine i'll specify the finer points that tip the scales for me:- Artstyle is less chibi and more ""visible"". I know that sounds like not much of a differrence in a pixel game, but it's going to have a much bigger merit after hours of gameplay.- Size scaling. Everything in Starbound is visible and more up close, whereas Terraria seems ""tiny"" with a lot of ""wasted"" space. I don't know if Terra scales with monitors, but either way.- The flashlight. Sounds silly, but it makes exploring caves in Starbound much more fun. You no longer have to spend most of earlygame on putting torches around.- Varied races, but that's a given.- Varied worlds, but that's a given.- The main building tool in Starbound is much more convenient and versatile. But that might be a negative point for people who prefer heavier roleplaying.- Workshop- Weapons and animations are much better in my opinion. There is absolutely no stiffness to attacks.- Building is much better as well, you can freely choose between using the same material for either the foreground or the background. Not only more realistic, but more convenient as well.- The Starship HUB.Look at that. Points.			"

												Edit: Review Addendum for 1.0 release:It's official, for their grand finale, Chucklefish has totally ruined Starbound. They finally settled on one tedious game mechanic and a generic ""collect all the macguffins"" plotline for the ""1.0"" release. Then they took all the hit or miss content they had tested and either vetted or removed over the last 3 years, carelessly ground it all up, and poured the resultant slop over the bland shitcake base game. Kinda like a chef who mulches an entire thanksgiving dinner into a soup, bones and all.It seems like they couldn't decide how to properly implement all their old content in the face of the re-re-re-invented design, but rather than let it all go to waste, they just hastily rebranded and pasted bits of it everywhere. The slurry pulp that used to be sequential mission instances and technology unlocks is now an incomprehensible pile of broken gameplay chunks, haphazardly slapped everywhere without reason or direction. The result is a horrible, disjointed, unplayable cluster♥♥♥♥ overflowing with inexplicable changes, even when it's NOT suffering from game-breaking slowdowns and fatal glitches. Unfortunately, this is the mess they've decided to settle on, so this is the mess we're stuck with. Even a dozen brilliant 3rd party user mods aimed at mitigating the damage aren't enough to salvage this disaster. Good older content like the portable pixel printer are gone, while ridiculous, nonsensical additions were made, such as giant, unkillable ghosts that haunt every empty moon in the universe. Why??In fact, that's the question that best sums up this entire ""official non-beta release."" WHY.--Beta Version review follows:I fear Starbound will turn out less like Disneyland, which is a functional masterpiece that will never be finished but constantly improved, and more like the Winchester House, constructed haphazardly and proceeding aimlessly without direction until its owner's death. The game has a more than decent framework, but the developers keep changing the game's premise, leading to a circuitous lack of progress and wasted potential. It's gone from a Terraria-like 2d space exploration game with procedural worlds and craftable bosses, to a story-driven series of instance dungeons, all the while killing off promising older content while adding more and more unfinished (and/or unnecessary) features. This slash-and-burn development has left the game unfocused, long after the point where it should have been crystallizing. The initial hype has died down, releases are fewer and longer between, and content is stagnant for months at a time, leaving players wondering if there's any motivation or momentum left to see it completed.The playstarbound website seems to feature lots of regular updates, but most of it seems to be showing off graphical blandishment and experimental features, few if any of which have rolled down to gameplay or promise to offer much in the way of functional content. In their eagerness to demonstrate that they are still actively working on the game, they're offering a lot of gravy and not much meat. Players will quickly burn through all the existing gameplay content and acquire all the useful craftable equipment, leaving you with nothing to do but wander randomly generated worlds in search of treasure chests. Judging from the comments here and at other sites, many players have walked away due to the lack of content, and with them goes word-of-mouth support. After all, what good is an increasingly graphically refined game world if there's nothing new to do in it?			"

Early Access Review
								Not recommended. But it has potential, so it may – possibly – be good once it's finished.The biggest reasons why you shouldn't get it yet:– It's pretty boring. Yeah yeah, some fanboys say they've invested 500 hours into Starbound, but unless you're also a fanboy, you'll probably run out of interesting things to do pretty fast. – There is a pretty high risk that your worlds and/or characters will be wiped or corrupted in software updates, which is pretty disencouraging for investing time and effort into this game.There are some troubling aspects about Starbound. Some of those things have to do with the failed promises of the developer. Around 6 months after it was released as Early Access, it's still basically in alpha, and who knows when it's going to be released? With few major updates, it's also hard to know if the game is on the right track. Put simply, I don't think we should reward developers who can't live up to their promises.But I also have some deeper concerns about the concept of Starbound itself. Starbound is basically Terraria in space, and one reason it's taking so long to finish is because it's so damn ambitious. An endless amount of planets with lots of various biodomes, what's not to like? Even in the Early Access, there's a lot of variety, but unfortunately it seems to be rather superficial. And that is the problem: that despite the massive amount of content, most of it may ultimately feel rather generic and not especially meaningful. In other words, my concern is about quantity vs. quality. And furthermore, why invest time in building stuff on a planet, if you're going to move on to other planets anyways? As a result of these things, both exploration and building are hurt – arguably two of most fun things do to in games of this genre.Can they solve this, and create both quantity AND quality? I.e. create a good game? It should definitely be possible, but we can't know until they've gotten further into the development. As of now, they haven't solved it.			"

												Okay. We should be fair with Starbound. I will bs nobody.First off, I am a supporter from back when it was on Early Access.The game has been dramatically changed since then.I had to play through the whole game again, since my savegame was not compatible with V1 but who cares really?So, what IS Starbound?Well it started as an open world sandbox game. KEEP THAT IN MIND PLEASE.So, since then a lot of stuff were added.We got a great set of unlockable technology upgrades, so you can craft gradually stuff you are gonna need.The game introduces you gradually to its universe with a set of missions, to do some essential things.The whole tutorial is the lore of the game. Yup! A sandbox with lore as tutorial, how do you like that?One step before going against the final boss, you know you are ready to explore whatever you want.What a great idea! You also carry a codex, where you can collect a lot of wrriten stuff, like journals, stories etc etc, very rewarding for readers.You can collect various stuff, like bugs, fish, fossils, and make collections out of them.Randomly (?) generated quests occur all the time, with always interesting rewards and not useless stuff.Challenges are available and a lot of stuff to do.You can farm, you can have your own pets... what else can I say about this awesome game?Oh! The world!Well basically you start on a solar system. Then you go outside of it to another star. Stars are solar systems with planets inside them. Imagine that stars are generated gradually as you move through the universe map. And believe me, there are LOTS of stars, full of planets to explore.Favorite changes (for early access users that wanna see what's new):A] The pixel compressor has no penalty.B] The fuel gathering became an interesting challenge instead of a freaking boring process.C] Optimized not to lag. So let's see:Graphics: 90% Fantastic pixel art Sound: 90% Great music but too emotional for my taste. Still great.Gameplay: 90% It is very polished, the game seldom lags even on my old PCReplayability value: 90% With so many races, I bet this can be played many many times.Value for money: 90%  I played 300 hours already, including the time before V1 was released.Scenario: 70% Interesting scenario, but that's it. <<< This is considered an EXTRA on a sandbox game.Do I recommend this?Well yes. It is a great game, just don't take it for an RPG.It is a sandbox.			"

												Absolutely fun and lovely game. Very addictive and a lot of fun to play with friends. The soundtrack is amazing as well. The only real gripe I have with Starbound is that there aren't racial traits that effect gameplay. You would think with all these amazing different races to choose from, and the background they've given to them, there would have been special traits/abilities given to them that would add a bit more depth to gameplay.

												9/10Starbound is a procedurally generated universe where you can plunder endless amounts of dungeons, build colonies, and mod the ♥♥♥♥ out of it. It's a cute indie with co-operative multiplayer which makes up for its unassuming appearance with the sheer amount of content the developer provides, supports and continues to shell out.Both the pixel art and soundtrack are both easy on your senses, creating an immersive atmosphere and inspiring ambience for late night galactic voyages. Especially fun if you have some friends who want to build a settlement or tag along for an adventure. Prepare for a time-sink.			"

Early Access Review
								The good:-Great soundtrack and use of instrument items.-Randomly-generated enemies get amusing designs sometimes, with those in higher tiers gaining new abilities (curse you barb spray).-Backstory behind all the races can influence how they interact with eachother, though only in dialogue currently.-Randomly generated, but consistently so, allowing coordinates to be shared between players to find cool stuff.-Pokemon.The bad:-Bosses can be cheesed pretty easily, sometimes by accident.-In fact, the entire game can be cheesed, really. Between burrowing just under the surface, walling myself off from enemies, and using a movement tech to fly over stuff, I soloed the game all the way to the final tier, crafted endgame armor, and found a tier-ten legendary sword without ever crafting a chestpiece, which means I had 1/2 the armor and 1/5 the health I should have had for the entire game and still managed to complete it. Shouldn't something prevent that?-Gameplay gets repetitive. There are different planetary and underground biomes, but even the tentacle and heck biomes still play the same as the others, just with cosmetic changes, and any biome-specific loot is fairly inconsequential.-There are STILL dungeon/NPC instances I have yet to encounter, but I don't really need to, because they're all roughly the same (except the Portal-based one, that's pretty neat, but finding it without coordinates can be a chore, and it lags like hell even in singleplayer).-Lackluster tutorial only briefly mentions some critical gameplay elements without actually showing them to you (Cooking? Bed healing? Pickaxe? Anvil? Nah, you don't need any of those, you'll be fine).-Players in multiplayer can destroy your ship decorations and steal your locker items unless you build your base on an asteroid far above the planet's surface.Conclusion:If you like building stuff, play Minecraft.If you like fighting stuff, play Terraria.If you like exploring stuff, play Starbound.

Early Access Review
								Oh Starbound...I wish I could recommend you.This is going to be long, guys. Grab a Seat.I'm going to start with what Starbound was a while back. Starbound is something that I was so excited for, and was so hyped for. After playing So much Terraia, I flipped a ♥♥♥♥ when I heard about Starbound back in 2012. I constantly followed the Dev Logs and the Roadmap (We'll get back to this) to see how close the game was to their initial release of Summer 2012. Then...That didn't happen. Which is all fine and Dandy, I understand some games need more time to work on them, they can be overly ambitious and overestimate time. The Problem here however, is they Lied. Quiet a bit actually. Time to get back to that Roadmap, one of the biggest lies. The Interactive Roadmap they had posted, showing all their progress, was removed, and I realized this as soon as the game actually came out, that this was because they had such little actually functioning/complete. The Game that they called ""Beta"" was pretty much Alpha. Randomly Generated Planets, The Progression, The Weapon System...They were so very simple. Because of my initial excitement, I was able to pour over 90 hours into the game before I realized the universe of Starbound was really...Generic. None of the planets, monsters, or weapons felt unique. Sometimes It might be a desert planet. Sometimes It might have lots of trees, or sometimes It's purple. They were all ""Randomly Generated so they're all unique"" But that really tore away attachments to everything, Monsters Especially. When Combined with their small aresnal of abilities. They effectively became walking attacks with a randomly gen'd monster skin.This was early starbound, and it was honestly a total a complete mess. But Lets talk about Starbound Today, and why I still don't recommend it. A lof of issues I've stated, they are working on fixing, which is great. They've added more handrawn weapons, Monsters, Microdungeons, and unique planet atmostpheres. They've added Progression, Colony's and farming. They've honestly, added a good wealth of stuff!But honestly, I still can't recommend this, and here's why:. There's STILL an inherent feeling of incompletion, emptyness, and genericness you get when playing starbound. Sure there is more of a drive now with a early quest system finally added, and you have the initial explorative drive to push you into caves and microdungeons to sink some hours. But after a while, it still begings to feel very stale and incomplete. Which again, wouldn't be an issue, but this game has been in Early Access since 2012, which is well passed it's origional Release frame. With Developers as Untrustworthy as Chucklefish, this is a huge issue. The game verywell could get the Early Access sticker removed from it and sold as it is now. There would be nothing stopping them from claiming the next update to be the full version of this game, and have plenty of promised features still missing from the core. This is one of the main reasons I cannot recommend this. This game will have you left feeling empty, like something is just always missing.I of course do realize though, this may not be a problem for some of you. Some of you will look at starbound, ignore it's developers, and have tons of fun regaurdless. If you know for a fact that Starbound is a game you can enjoy at it's current state with the possibility of this being it's final release, by all means. Go ahead. I will say multiplayer does make the game much more enjoyable. But I personally, cannot recommend this game still. After following it's development very closely, and witnessing all the decietful behavior these dev's have exhibited, anything can happen. I've already seen some features like Hunger and Heat removed. Maybe they'll bring it back, maybe they'll remove something else. If they break something they can't fix/balance, they might just remove it.Overall, in combination of the game still feeling inherently empty, The Developers of starbound are untrustworthy and that is a very scary thing. I can't willingly recommend you a game that does not feel finished, might one day never even be finished.			"

Early Access Review
								Please.. please.. please for the love of glob don’t buy this game. This is another example of early access done badly, first of I was initially patient for the updates when I bought this. I mean I enjoyed the game but the lag was killing me, each time I entered a dungeon my framerate drops to the 10s and 20s and was either not fun or just unplayable. I asked a couple of times when will the game be stable I mean honestly never cared for the fluff like new items or biomes I just would like the game to be more stable. Those posts got ignored. So okay fine I’ll wait they did promise faster updates.. 3 months more or less and we didn’t get a stable update not one just broken builds not meant to be played. So I wondered what the hell happened.I checked the forums and apparently I wasn’t the only one worried and people voicing concern or resentment for what’s happening are getting banned. They apparently don’t take well to criticism and will ban anybody on whim. So yeah, unless you’re willing to play through this broken shell of a promising game spend that $14.99. But I hope you don’t because this is (for me) the worst Early Access Title I bought and I bought a few. Just wait and spend that $14.99 and buy a complete game and wait for this one to come out, from the looks of it that will be a couple of years or more.   "

												I've been playing this game for a long time, a little too long. On and off.I was fascinated by the premise of the open-ended story, with each race's unique start-off.But now it's just some linear cheesy gobbledigook nonsense. Not to mention the changes they made, and the things they removed from the game simply made the game less intuitive and creativity driven.Now, you're not a Glitch that realized the futility of it's pre-programmed existance, a rebel Apex running away from it's totalitarian masters, an Avian that was shunned and ran from the fanatical cult life of his kinsmen, No.All of that is gone, those are the stories of NPCs you see every now and then. You're the CHOSEN ONE. You, and you alone were decidedly important enough to be sent to gather a new alliance of races to defeat an evil star entity that was sealed away by another star entity who now shattered in the process to produce the Novakids. I could go on, and on about how much worse this cheesy, one-directional story telling is, but the bottom line is,You've replaced one of the most interesting, intuitive and self-creating open ended sandbox adventures into a linear, boring, cheesy, and frankly quite childish futuristic fantasy game. Which there are countless numbers of out there that do a better job.And this is only mentioning the lore aspect of this game.Gameplay wise, yeah they added a lot of features and optimized the game a little better than what they had previously, the planet specific biomes, poison pools, light showers and volcanos are really nice to explore.But what grasped me on top of everything else, was the combination of that with the Interesting boss fights, there were no gimmicks other than the ones you could think of on your own, there weren't any railroaded fights, you fought the bosses if you had the technology or had a means to beat him on your own terms. Just like Terraria, only less exploitable.If I had to take an example, I had the most fun when I first called the penguin UFO to fight the first boss that would help me advance to the next technological stage. I panicked and died, but had the idea of building myself some cover, a bunker if you will. I was THRILLED when the UFO crashed down to try and kill me, only to take a chunk out of my bunker and I had to be careful his penguin soldiers didn't try to get in, while still chipping away at his health.All of that, gone.And replaced with some new instance - unbreakable arena that they pre set just so you can fight him and his cronies, in the open, relying solely on your weapon and armour - which you had to upgrade enough just to get through the boss. No reward for intuitive play, or creative flares. Just mindless gear grinding. Doing that, for all the bosses was a huge mistake.Not to mention the RPG-esque quest system. For the most part, it works out fine. But it really took a lot out of the original version when you feel so detached from the fight itself. Because the first penguine fight, which used to lead to your technological ""level up"" would happen on your first planet, your first base. Where everything you had could've been destroyed by the UFO body slam.Honestly, all of that, all the changed, removals, and needless editions added up to a game that was far sub-par to what it was before the ""final"" release.Seriously, way to drop the ball chuckle♥♥♥♥s.

Early Access Review
								At release, Starbound was promising. I was hyped. It seemed like a good purchase at the time, because I had been waiting for four months prior to purchasing the game.Upon the beta testing/release date, several things became completely evident to me - 1. The game is uninspired and lacked any of the features that were promised on the Roadmap.2. The game lacks features - it cannot be called a 'beta' by any means.3. While the engine is robust, stress testing the engine without using the 'mod' system is impossible anymore.Moreover, all of those things come in addition to multiple problems with both the developers and the way the developers act - that, unfortunately, is not going to be discussed here. What they say and do does not concern me, because I'm not going to give them any more of my money after this.The game is uninspired. All of the planets are palette swaps of prior planets with background changes and very little varied topography, ocean planets are not implemented, water does not work properly, combat is unaimed and very clunky, movement is slow and practically unresponsive until late game, the space game doesn't give you guns until 3/4ths of the way through...There's really more I can expand upon, but I don't want to spend all day pointing out every little flaw: while that my be what I signed up for, people tend to throw hissyfits whenever someone does that.The game also lacks many pivotal features and items that were told to be in the game. Now, before everyone tells me 'it's a beta!'...Tough luck. A beta is a game that is feature complete and does not have content added until post-release, this game is an alpha. Features are still being added and looked at, which means that the game is nowhere near ready for beta testing.Now, the third is a personal gripe. I do not want to modify and add content to this game because I did not pay to develop code for the developers, nor would I get paid for doing so. I paid to test a beta, which involves moving variables, creating events that lead to crashes (like the 8x8 matter manipulator that hit as fast as your FPS), and even manipulating drop tables so I can check and see if newly implemented items work as-intended. With the devs putting a 'beta' into a .pak file, it removes any and all ability for me to properly beta test the game. It has no reason to be within a .pak file, because it is not a release copy.Overall, the game is flawed, the developers have no idea what they're doing, and paying for this game is not worth it. Not until the game is released.Edit: It has been a year and a day since I have written this review. Happy Independence Day, America, and the game is still not out. Abandonware, do not buy.Edit 2: IT'S BEEN TWO YEARS NOW. PEOPLE I KNOW HAVE HAD CHILDREN. THOSE CHILDREN ARE NOW OLD ENOUGH TO WALK. SOME OF THEM HAVE SAID WORDS. YOU KNOW WHAT I TAUGHT THEM TO SAY? ""STARBOUND ISN'T OUT YET.""HAPPY THIRD YEAR OF WAITING. ARE THERE MORE TECHLEVELS? HOW ABOUT DIRECTIONAL SPEARS YET? WHAT OF GUNS WITH AMMUNITION? WATER PHYSICS? REAL MOUNTS? A STORY? CHUCKLEFISH, GET IT TOGETHER. DO NOT BUY.			"

												ironically the game was way bigger when it was just starting off in early access. there weren't any missions or crewmembers or anything, but every single planet was a completely different adventure. now you just have a handful of biomes to explore that all have the exact same areas and loot in them. i've played about 20 hours of it since 1.0 came out and i'm already bored of it			"

												I got 400+ hours out of a game I paid less than 15 dollars for, I've played it since Early Access, I have had my character wiped 4 times, If that is any indication on how long I've owned it. The game has a feel that not many other games have, the music is similar to the music of Morrowind, the weapons/combat remind me of Castlevania and the abilities are like the ones you get in Metroid or Mega Man. There is an endless galaxy to explore, a character to customize from various races, colonies to build, quests to complete, crops to grow, a ship to enhance and customize and monsters to capture. I think it is very worth the price. Oh, right. Hoverbikes.Edit: I didn't receive the game for free, I have no idea why it says that or how to remove it.Also, the modding community is extremely active and is on Steam Workshop/ Nexus Mods. I highly recommend Frackin' Universe and the XS Mech Mod. There are also mods that add in races and their communities/colonies which are really well done too.			"

Early Access Review
								Basically abandonware at this point. Early access scam. The developers raked in 12 million and haven't put out any updates of substance since Febuary. One of the few devs who actually did work quit and the rest of the team used the money to relocated countries and explore life. Buggy game, animations are simplistic at best, enemy AIs leave much to be desited, bosses can all be bugged easily and have terrible AI. There isn't much of a sense of exloration as all the planets basically have the same things on them. Terrible letdown after all the hype that Chucklefish put behind it. Don't give Chucklefish your money. Stick with Terraria for your 2d sandbox fix (keep an eye on Edge of Space for a SciFi themed game, still shakey at this point, but could be amazing).			"

								Incompetent Devs making an incompetent game.I bought a 4 pack of this when the game came out, I regret it. I wish I had never given them any money. My biggest reoccuring thought when it comes to starbound is that I wish I had gotten a refund when I had the chance. The gameplay in this is shallow and weak, the combat lacks impact, the movement controls are laggy and imprecise, the crafting system requires ridiculous grind, the game lacks content, the procedurally generated planets are all the same,  all of this the game promised to deliver through updates after the beta released, updates which never came. The devs squash any criticism of the game or their failure to deliver on their promises both here on the steam forum and at their own home base hugbox forums.If this game interests you I STRONGLY recommend you instead look at Terraria. It is quite clearly the better game made by a game developer who cares about the product they make.			"

								EDIT 2: I mean, I don't know what more to add. I'd qualify with ""it's not dead"" but I never thought it was truly dead, it was just taking it's sweet time and it would end up being nothing like promised.This remains true. Updates were a long time coming and have all but removed the USP for most people - the ability to explore. Sure you can run around a few planets and dig but it gives me nothing that other games don't, and they do it better. Sure there's quests but these come in 2 forms - the mandatory questline you have to follow to progress. This is long, monotonous and spoon fed whilst offering no challenge and the only reward is the game becomes playable. There's also procedurally generated quests but as expected it's ""Go x-planet, dig dirt, return"" ""Fetch x item"" ""Kill x Miniboss"".Can you mod this into decent game? Maybe. Probably. Solid 6/10 is acheivable with mods. For me that's not enough, I don't want to *have* to mod games for them to be enjoyable.Sure I'm bitter because I wasn't given what was sold to me, luckily new customers can't be. If, when all is said and done, you still want to buy this game then you should. Go for it, you will probably get your money's worth, but at the same time I wouldn't ""recommend"" it by a long shot.-EDIT: 4 months later, my review is still entirely accurate. For a game in development that should tell you all you need to know about the pace it's being ""developed"". No changes at all.-A very pretty game with a nice soundtrack and a lot of potential.Very little community interaction from anyone aside from the Community Manager who makes poor attempts to ""troll"" customers and is forever playing the ""victim card"".Development updates come in thick and fast, but entirely in the form of promises and gifs as opposed to any actual update to the game. There was a 5 month break in production, 1 month was a company vacation and 4 months was due to moving a few artists and the Community Manager to London. They also adopted a puppy and have used the backers money not to fund Starbound, but each take up work on individual projects and then publishing other's games.Should be good if/when it's finished. Slated for release in 2013 - that's officially moved to 2015 and will probably be moved again. If you like repetitive grinding you should buy this game, but do not buy it to support or follow development. Chucklefish has already made over $15 million from Starbound and owning the game doesn't give you any extra idea of how development is going.If you want to support this game not buying it is the better option - falling sales is the only thing that may get Chucklefish to buckle down.

								I loved Starbound. Played for hours and hours. Then. Then game changed. There used to be beta, gamma and delta sector. The planets were fun to mine down into. There were outfits to find bird people to kill, apes to kill. Now...I like the missions they give a little bit of fun. I really don't like that the pickaxe is now so darned breakable. I don't like the way the biomes and different segments of the planets are set up. It isn't nearly as fun to mine the planets. I miss my planet that I was making into a really cool house and having rainbow, crystal, mushroom, flesh, etc rooms with all the blueprints and such that I was finding. I had planted the whole surface in different trees that I had collected. It was awesome. I didn't mind the losing it when the update happened, I would have loved making it again. But now there are no sectors, I really miss that. There are crystals in the bottom of the planet that you have to get 20 of, and then never need for anything ever again. but they are at the bottom of every planet. Mining isn't nearly as fun. digging to the core of the planet you don't discover a bunch of neat biomes. I keep trying to play the new starbound. I'll give it a Friday night every now and then, but I always end up sad, missing how it used to be. I find it to be boring now. It's no fun to go to a planet that is already lifeless to begin making a home. takes the fun out of taming my own planet. I miss the way the dungeons used to be, where you could accidentally come up on them while digging. I will probably keep trying, but please bring back the different sectors, and get rid of the stupid crystals at the bottom of the planets. make it more fun to find things. And back to repairable pickaxes. Right now I don't recommend this game. when people ask Terraria or Starbound I am forced to say Terraria.			"

								The biggest dissapointment in 2013. I was so hyped for this game due my love for terraria but as i played it it turned out to be a bubble, looks really nice but is filled with air.I have never had a game where opening chests (those wooden things that usually contain awesomeness) is such a dissapointment to a point where i despised finding chests becaus i knew that it would just contain another bunch of useless crap.It looks really nice as said but if you dig in a planet you just find nothing its always the same crap its gets more dangerous to the core but you dont really have any reward of going deep (yay better ore for a forced armor tier system).You only have one active abilty slot so where in terraria you could triple jump, higher and even fly and sprint all at the same time, here you have decide wich one of them fits you and go with it. If you want another thing go in the menu and switch it out.The weapon system is rather boring and the random enemy generation is unneccessary.Also no contentupdates whatsoever. Terraria, the game that was said to have no updates anymore by the time this was ""released"" had since more updates than this.I know i compared it to terraria a lot but honestly this games has the same target audience and terraria does EVEYRTHING A LOT better.TLDR.: Dont get this overhyped piece of nothing and stick with terraria.EDIT: Played the recent version in coop: much better but always depends on your coop partner. As 2+ player game might worth the consideration but still cant think of playing it solo.EDIT2: Finished the game coop in 16 hours (means we got ourself the best armor in the game) nearly all bosses can be exploited thus no real challenge. after ~10 hours it was just a grinding for ore still wouldnt recommend overall under any circumstance.... honestly i cant understand how anyone can enjoy this over playing something else :/			"

								This was a great survival and exploration game. It had monsters that came out at night, weather that made you cold, and you needed to eat or you would starve. There were old ruins with traps that you could either deftly avoid with jumps or build bridges across or even dig around.Now dungeons are sectioned off and can't be tampered with so only the jumping option exists, all npc villages follow the same rule, you no longer need to eat, weather no longer affects you, and the monsters are almost nowhere to be found. So if it's not a survival game and it's not an exploration game, then what the hell is it?As my friend put it:It's a base building game where I have no need for a base. It's a survival game where the universe isn't trying to kill me. It's an exploration game where I can't swindle the natives blind. It's a problemsolving game where I can't use lava to smash my way through a dungeon. It's such a MESS now. And everyone is praising it for having so much more ""content"" now because they added one-line-of-dialogue NPCs and fetch quests.			"

								As a devoted player of terraria, I say this one is not there yet. If you haven't bought terraria, buy it. If you have,  don't buy this until v1.0.Comparing to terraria, starbound has more detailed graphics, but no soul. - Randomly generated monsters means no difference between monsters. A few different parts meshed together, they behave more or less the same. Loots are nothing to expect too.- Randomly generated worlds and dungens? It's fun to have a few of them, but when you've traveled a few planets in alpha sector you know there's nothing to surprise you anymore. The materials you dig up from different bioms can't be used for anything special either. - Dungens are boring. Guards either charges towards you or shoot at you, pretty much the same everywhere. There're no challenges, from the beginning to the end the dungen is the same. What's more, there's no loot in dungens.- Digging, digging, digging, and all you dig up is ore. Nothing surprise under the earth. There're a few micro bioms, but they offer nothing special.- There's NO story what so ever. Basically, you combine random things into bosses, and beat them one by one. That's all. The villages do nothing other than looking pretty and sell you something you barely need. So basically there's no ""meaning"" in anything you do, the entire world is terribly unified in every aspect. Unless the developers reshape half of it and put loads of content, it's nothing comparing to Terraria.			"

												I'll be honest here, if you've never heard of starbound before, and you like the idea of a sci-fi sandbox survival-ish game, then you'll probably enjoy starbound. I however am giving this a thumbs down, for reasons I shall go into.Long ago, in the early access days of starbound, players glimpsed what was a relatively complete game that was clearly a framework for something greater. Something complex. Hidden behind it's grid-based construction/mining engine was a surprisingly complex universe, complete with six unique races all of which had their own history, adversities, asthetic style and personality. For once it seemed like the character's species was actually going to matter, with even the descriptions of food items hinting that different species would have to eat different food, which is a very cool idea in a survival game. This type of complexity was, for me, what set starbound apart from other games in the genre, it wasn't just a sandbox, it was it's own world with conflicting cultures and people.The earliest sign was that racial bonuses (abilities unique to what species your character was) was planned to be in the next update. These bonuses were later changed to be tied to the race's armoursets, where wearing the full set (head, torso, leggings) of a race's armour would confer it's bonus. This was apparently done for the sake of balance, and keeping each of the races equal. Sure, I thought, but to this day racial bonuses are still not part of the game.Starbound's development has been slow. Very, very slow. I was ok with this, as it was the developer's first game, and after dabbling in game dev myself I am aware that it can be a very difficult thing to do. Things were fine at first, a slow creep of new assets and features, adding more content to the world's random-gen system, etc. Everything you'd expect from an early access title.However, somewhere during development, something changed.Everyone was hype for the next big update (as updates were incredibly rare) and it'd hit, sure there was all this cool new stuff they'd shown off in screenshots, but they would always come with a number of game-breaking bugs that would severely impact gameplay, and would sometimes take months to be fixed. But the most bizarre part to me was that CF would often just cut assets entirely from the game. Items, furniture, gone. no explanation given. Just gone, and for a game about exploration, collection and building, this seemed like a very odd move.The last few updates leading up to 1.0 were the worst offenders at this. The previous diversity and characterisation of the game's six races were severely stripped away, racial weapons, and ship AI were removed for seemingly no reason, which is very strange considering the racial AI often featured in the game's devblog. This, along with the removal/altercation of several other features (the game's UI being one of them) pushed things over the line for me. I had hope, I had patience, but I look upon the finished product that is the 1.0 build currently on sale here and can't help but feel utterly disappointed.In summary, what first appeared to be a surprisingly complex twist on the survival sandbox genre was dumbed down to rush it for release. Also, the game costs $5 less now. It's nice I paid extra to experience this disappointment.There are actually a number of other issues I could go into as to why I'm giving this a thumbs down, from reckless spending to the developer's reaction to criticism, but this review is already long enough.=================================================================EDIT: Since everyone seems to comment on this. Yes, I have 1600+ hours played. This is because the early access builds had a launcher that was very easy to leave open for long periods of time, also I did actually enjoy playing the game, however, now that 1.0 has been released, many of the things I enjoyed about it have been removed, and I am doubtful they will ever be restored, hence my negative review.

												Which one is better, Terraria or Starbound..? It's hard to say as both play out very different from one another. Where Terraria's main focus is on combat, Starbound is mostly about exploring and building. So just because you liked the former, doesn't mean you like the latter and vice versa. In the end it comes down to your personal preference and what you expect from them.So what sets Starbound aside and makes it unique.. For starters it offers a huge galaxy with thousands of planets. Each one with its own different themes and the possibility of a wide variety of cities and dungeons. This can be everything from underwater metropolises to small farming villages, ruins of forgotten civilizations, creepy dungeons and hightec research labs. Even beneth a planets surface there's strange settlements and secrets to uncover as well.These places will be populated with different races and animals. There are seven playable main races who all got their own lore and backstories. This is mostly presented in the form of different codices you can gather and read (some of which are pretty hilarious). Besides that there are numerous sub-races and factions running their own agenda. Some peaceful, others not so much. It's even possible to have some of them move in and offer unique supplies or serve as guards. This combined with some beautifully hand crafted metroidvania like missions where you undertake puzzles, dodge traps and fight bosses helps make Starbound a really interesting world to explore. All in all its a very colourful and diverse univers.Starbound also allows for very different playstyles and almost everything is optional in order to progress. You can build villages or huge farms for profit, explore for resources or mine them, become self sufficient or survive by trade, do quests and gather a crew or roll as a lone wolf.. All valid options in order to survive. This also means your expected to find your own path and as such, there's very limited handholding. Which might throw some people off as there won't be a clear indicator on what to do next besides the overall objective. It's sorta like a ""create your own adventure"" story wherein the missions only serve as stretch goals.Now combat ain't as streamlined as in most games of this genre. It's more a part of a whole, rather than the main focus. Building, farming crops, questing and exploring is as much a part of Starbound as combat is. So if your looking for a hack'n'slash combat focused experience, then you'll be disappointed and proberly find the game lacking as it can seem a little simplistic.Don't get me wrong, combat in Starbound ain't bad. It's just different. For example there's no ammunition to speak of, instead every weapon draws from a commen energy pool. Also most weapons come with a special attack and the ability to dual wield them in almost any way you see fit. There's a wide variety of awesome and crazy weapons to help make it interesting like swords, spears, hammers, pistols, shotguns, sniper rifles, 'nade launches, flamethrowes, rocket launchers etc etc..Starbound is a game suited for people that like to build, explore and create their own little adventures. If you take the time to enjoy its univers and all the different concepts it has to offer, then you'll get a plesant and enjoyable experience.Closing argument and metaphor..If Terraria is like a lego technic set, where you have to follow a specific schematic in order to achieve your goal. Then Starbound is a huge box of lego blocks that requires your imagination to reach it instead. It really only comes down to what you prefer.			"

								What can I say about starbound? It was meant to be the spiritual successor to Terraria, but I fear that at the time of writing this review it seems very much the other way around. The content is cool, but after you get past the slightly differentiated looks to a lot of it, it really is all the same. That's the issue with procedural generation; it's all new, but it's all pretty much just feature x paired with appearance y. Cool game, but I'd wait to see if it develops more. Anything else you want to know about can probably be found in the reviews below this one.			"

								One of the worst scams I've gotten myself into. This is an early access review, so I might change this review in the future.I used to play a lot of Terraria back in the day, and when Starbound was announced, I was pretty much hyped already. Not only it promised more of everything that Terraria already had, but also better quality. When it went into the pre-order stage (have in mind that it was a pre-order for a beta access... which is hilarious in itself) I got convinced by a friend to get it. So I did.Once I started the game, everything looked much better than in Terraria, but really, once I got to the first enemy, I felt really put off. The starting gear you get deals almost no damage, so you spend minutes trying to slay an enemy IF the enemy is hostile. And that you never know, because all animals react differently. So you basically gamble.Getting your first gear is nice after some scavenging, but really not at all rewarding. You get some basic stuff, dying multiple times on the way because of the tedious and horrible combat, just to die some more with the new gear. Get used to the respawn animation, because you are going to see it a lot.I was also promised exploration. I hoped for more digging, well-built cave systems, like in Terraria. But I think they meant running across surfaces of various planets, because that's what you are going to be doing 90% of the time. Exploring caves? No point. You'll find better generated loot in abandoned laboratories, but it will also save you time grinding resources. This game offers you so many things, but without a Wikipedia open in another window you should forget about doing anything meaningful. It just looks like a flawed mod for Terraria, that keeps promising more of loot, better gameplay and expanding, generated universe, but lacks the polish and finish.Not to mention that the multiplayer requires 3rd party software like Hamachi or Tunngle to connect with friends, because a few months ago when I tried, I couldn't connect to any public server.The games is being continuously developed, yet I see few changes to the actual gameplay.Wish I could get my time back, if not the money, because it isn't likely that I'll go back to this game. It's plain boring, so unless you like long-♥♥♥ Minecraft-esque grinding, don't bother. Combat is tedious, exploration unrewarding. If anything, the artstyle helps this game, but if I want to look at nice things, I can just watch a good movie.			"

Early Access Review
								Remember the rather boring early-game grind of Terraria? Collecting ores for armor, getting boss items, and dying every so often got a bit stale before you finally unlocked the awesomeness that is hardmode, full of amazing enemies and items. Starbound is like the early game grind of Terraria the entire time, with nothing cool to look forward to. Tiered armor is boring- each set is incrementally better than the last, and that's it. Randomized weapons ensure that only a very small amount of them will be interesting- however, none of those randomly-generated weapons will be as interesting as weapons like the Golem's Fist in Terraria. The devs said they had a great story in the works, one for each faction, but that hasn't come through at all. Even the opening cutscenes for the races still aren't finished almost two years after release. I desperately wanted to enjoy this game, but it looks like I'll have to wait for Terraria Otherworld to satisfy my fighting/storying/building game itch.Edit: I wrote some stuff in response to comments on my review, so I'll add them here.First of all the game is not at all in an early stage of development. It's been a year and a half since the beta began, and the developers were aiming to release 1.0 last year: ""We’re going to be releasing a stable update once the tech tree can be progressed through from start to finish, after that we’re going to be focusing on finishing up this todo list for 1.0. Which we are aiming for this year, but could go into next."" from Tiyuri on September 19th. With that said, the game ""should"" be pretty close to done by now. We've had previews of the cutscenes from before the beta even came out. But whatever, story doesn't matter I guess.The gameplay is just bad in almost every way. Weapons are bad. In Terraria, every non-tiered weapon is made to be fun, so they're fun! In Starbound, they're created from an array of random parts. As far as I know, melee weapons have NOTHING to make them interesting- the only thing that matters about them is attack animation and DPS.Armor is bad. Each tier is better than the last, but only from a numbers standpoint. In Terraria, the armor's set effects make it more of a personal preference- you actually have a choice between which armor you want, because they're actually different! What a novel idea. For example, on one run through I used meteorite armor for a good while into hard mode as a challenge, almost exclusively using my space gun, and it was damn fun. If you use a different armor in Starbound, you'll just die faster. Also the racial armor bonuses are pretty dull.Building is bad. There's no real point to building anything other than decorating your ship since you need to hop planets pretty frequently. In Terraria, you have a reason to build houses (NPCs) and you even have more of a reason to decorate and care about your world because, well, it's the only world you have! Maybe colonization will help this a bit, but somehow I doubt it.Mining is bad. There isn't anything cool or dangerous about it. There's stuff underground, sure, but the novelty of poop monsters, useless frog merchants, and ruins with no story behind them wears off pretty quickly. In Terraria, there are whopping great enchanted swords and pig monsters coming through walls trying to kill you, and treasure rooms, underground mini biomes with unique enemies and drops- it's quite a bit into hardmode that mining becomes farm-status without much to worry about. Even then, because you can actually make interesting items with the stuff you mine, Terraria still wins out.Combat is bad. It's just really bad. Enemies have poor AI, are generally samey and boring (thanks again random generation!) and are weirdly balanced to either kill you in one or two hits or never even damage you even on the same world. There aren't any interesting drops either- meat, pixels, maybe a weapon, but that's it. Movement in combat is pretty boring, especially with the slow backwalking. The techs barely help in this respect because they're pretty clunky to use in combat.Exploring is bad. Once you've seen one of something, you've seen all of them. There's not enough variety for a game which has exploration as one of its main selling points. I can think of maybe 12 types of big explorey things (avian temple, apex obstacle course, human prison colony, etc.) off the top of my head, and you'll probably find all of them within the first 10 or so hours of play.Tech is the only interesting thing about the game, and even then it's because of their unrealized potential (which will probably remain unrealized in the future.) Accessories in Terraria have much cooler effects anyway.So tell me, why would I recommend this game when Terraria does everything better?			"

Early Access Review
								First a short clarification, this review is aimed upon the last stable version (Enraged Koala (Update 8)) released on 26.04.2014 and the current development. So don't expect this review to take a look at nightly builds or anything released after today ( 08.08.2014).In it's core concept Starbound is game aiming to combine the element of Metroivanias and resource gathering + building games like Minecraft. Because of an indie developer, the size of the team and naturally wanting to be a sides-scroller the game was developed as an pixel-art game. In these respects it's quite similar to Terraria, which isn't that suprising as the lead developer (Tiy) was an artist in the team behind Terraria.The premise of the game was to be that your character (which would be customizable and choosen out of 6 +1 races) would own a spaceship with which he'd be able to explore nearly infinite amounts of planets, which would be precedually generated and experience some sort of story. In this adventure you'd be able to expand your ship, gather a crew, get quests and generally  use things you found during exploring to tech-up.This premise would naturally allow quite a bit of freedom, making it somewhat of a sandbox style game, whereas builders could concentrate on building stuff, while adventurers could fight monsters...So if you dislike the premise, go and ignore Starbound.If you like this premise, keep on reading as i saddly can't advice to buy this game.Metroivainins life through well designed dungeons and interesting enemies, something Starbound isn't currently offering. The few dungeons in game look nice so far, but there are only a handful of them and they're not offering anything really valuabe, so there's no real reason to visit them.Also Metrovanias live from the fact that your character gains new abilities. And while there are few abilities to gain, they feel pretty weak, unbalanced yet and quite often very similar. Giving the player the ability to fly for a few seconds doesn't is the same, no matter if it's represented by leaving a trail of bubbles or butterflys behind.Overall the combat doesn't feel balanced at the moment. There are, for example, a few end bosses. But the best tactic against them is simply building a small shelter out of some hard material for oneself poking a hole in said shelter and than shooting upwards, till the boss is dead. You can gather resources and build stuff to get some progress. The problem with that progress is that it feels like a grindfest, so to build a better armor you not only have to mine some coloured ore (10 progression levels equal 10 or so differently coloured ores), but you've to gather pixels (which is some form of currency) which is mostly dropped by monsters, and only in small quantities.There are really a lot of nicely done items one can place in the backdrop if you want to build your own outpost and there are really lot of different of materials to build a house out of. But for builders the game suffers from to many monster spawns to get said materials in bigger quantities and the pixel costs for crafting some of these items. Also Chucklefish saddly added the possibility for a meteor shower, which bears down to one big meteor hitting your base and destroying large parts of it, while not adding any way to defend against that.I personally hoped, from the preset of vast procedually generated planets and media pictures shown from Chucklefish, that exploration was going to be really interesting. They implied that different planets have different weather. Some are warmer, some are colder, some have oxygen, other lack in it. There would be cities and dungeons scattered around in the universe. And while there are some bare bones of that, the planets really don't feel that different and exploration isn't really that rewarding. Instead of spending time to find a Apex laboratory (the laboratory of some planet of the ape like ape race), one can actually better use the time mindlessly mining for some ore or hitting some monster over the head with a stick.You can find techs (read special abilities) and some minor loot in some chests, but it's not really worth the whole thing. It only really is worth searching for such things, if you want to build a home out of that materials. Which again becomes a bit of a grindfest.Now as one can clearly read on the shop site, Starbound is an early access game.This means that a lot of my assessments might fall short in the future, as the game gets finished more and more. But that's just one possibility. And therefore it's important to take a look at the developers themselves.When i first read about Starbound in 2012 i got the feeling that behind Starbound where highly idealistic developers with just a few minor games under their belt. It was one of those typical indie-dev teams which a great vision. That Tiy himself worked on Terraria, which was allready a good game back then, lead me to believe that the team was knowing what it was doing with a 2d sidescroller with a pixel look. So the goals seemed achievable.Back than it was implied that Starbound might be released in 2012, which as you can see, it wasn't.The team developed a lot of precedual aspects of the game, saying by that it would become bigger than Terraria. Procedual weapons, planets, universe, monsters...Also it was often mentioned how the player could terrarform planets, use his ships to interact with the world, meet and even gather a diverse crew and live through something fascinating. They showed mock-ups (not really labled as such back than) showing huge ships, small drop-ships, sea planets, crews and whatnot.Then 2013 came and Chucklefish started taking money to speed-up development for the planned 2013 release. They gave some stretch goals, which got achieved within only a few days and kept on openly thinking about how one could be able to use mechs and other vehicles. Or how the player would influence the universe with his quests. In 2013, quite early as far as i remember, they added a roadmap to their homepage - which is still there. This roadmap, as far as i remember, wasn't labelled specifically as a beta road map and soon got filled to 50% finished in most of the areas. When Starbound still hadn't a real release date in summer of 2013 Chucklefish began hinting at a beta release in three phases before a full release - you can find the plans and phases for the beta on the starbound homepage - http://playstarbound.com/how-the-beta-is-going-to-work/ .In autumn they then opened up pre-ordering the game again, with the promise of an early beta access to the game, while still implying a 2013 release. While time went on the bars in the road map good filled and filled more but there was still no release date. Then in fall 2013 (only a few days before new years eve) chucklefish released the beta.I played this beta a few minutes and it felt like a somewhat solid base, which hopefully got expanded on soon. It had no quest, no terraforming, no real vehicles, no recruitable NPCs and no real balance.And it pretty much stayed that way until now. CF more or less announced the game as advertised wouldn't get released this year, but then their lead developer started to question what a 1.0 version really meant and how he was the one to decide what that means. And how people misread a lof of things as promised features, while it was only them thinking aloud.They're releasing (highly bugged) nightly builds and blog posts, but a lot of that isn't nearly reaching the advertised features. And given the leads questioning one has to wonder if they're still planning on adding such. Overall Starbound as concept might even suffer from the procedual monsters and such. Because it make the game feel stretched.So overall i'd say don't buy it, at least not yet. And really be critical of CF as they suffer from the same illness as Peter Molyneux does, overpromising and under-delivering(yet).			"

												It is a very sad day indeed when the people that play a game know more about what makes it fun than the people that made it.  I have played Starbound from the very beginning, before it was an early access game on Steam.  It was awesome!  The things they had planned for this game, the things they had already available for this game was very exiting indeed.  Every time you went to a planet, you got a different palette of trees, rocks, soil, water, monsters and food!  They had the promise of different abilities for each race.  At the very beginning they had a system where you had to build a fire to keep warm until you could muster enough resources to make yourself warm clothes!!!  Then the combat update came! The game they where designing then was very promising indeed.Sadly most of this stuff has been taken out.  Along the way they lost the vision of the game they had and 1.0 is what we got.  A very boring and empty game.  What the devs fail to understand is that the community was playing the last stable update, and loving it, look at the ratings!  All I wanted was a sort of story and lore to be created for the universe I was playing in and that would of been awesome!  But instead I got 1.0, a shallow, stripped down version of a game that I was promised.  To top it off, it’s full of awful bugs and optimization problems!  It’s funny when you think about it, the beta was more stable and more optimized.  I wish I could uninstall 1.0 and go back to the last stable version, I had more toys to play with in that version.  My sensei once told me that to be successful you need a posture in life.  When you do something, you have to believe in what your doing and stand by it, even when the waters come rushing against it and try to bring it down.  They should of kept their initial vision, the game would have been a lot better.  I can’t recommend this title in it’s current state.  I’m happy that you sold over 60 000 copies since 1.0’s release guys, but once the community has a taste of what they bought, I don’t think your gonna sell much more, just look at the new reviews coming in.

												I've clocked 380+ hours in game.  I've played vanilla and modded versions.  I've played through every mission the developers put in the game, and all of the missions from Frackin' Universe.  And yet I keep coming back.  I keep putting time into this.  I have spent hours and hours amassing materials and creating multi-tier gardens with glowing glass walls, so I could plant and harvest day and night.  I've fought cultists and abominations, post-apocalyptic survivalists and primatives, and every other thing inbetween.  I've committed village massacres and protected stoic swamp-dwelling frogmen.  I've sailed seas of acid and alien juice, and drifted to the bottom of oceans of liquid nitrogen.And I'll do it all over again, in 1.0.  Just to see what's new.  And to start my dream of settling planets and creating thriving civilizations on them.  The haunting piano score calls to me.  If you want to know where I am, I'm in-game, ""Protecting the Universe"".			"

Early Access Review
								I have had this game for about 6 months (Around christmas when I got it), and never seen a difference or any updates for about when I got it, the developers completely lost interest in it, and those who protest against the developers, those people get banned and censored off the website. I'm dissapointed in the developers, it was extremely hyped up and the developers said it would come with many updates, as in being a beta game with a lot of hype for future things to come to make it even better, completely dissapointed. I would not recommend buying this game due to the fact it is unreliable that the developers will ever work on it again. There hasn't even been patches in the past 6 months. Completely the same game. I recommend you read the other negative reviews. Chuckefish would of been a good developer, if they ever showed dedication towards Starbound.			"

Early Access Review
								The game has progressed but not much. They've changed some systems around and added quests, but a lot of the game's core issues have not been addressed. I think the game is better but because they keep ignoring the glaring problems the game has, my opinion that people should wait if they've not bought it has not changed in any way. They've spent a very long time promising change and the amount of the game that has been fixed or updated is not substantial considering the time they've taken to get Upbeat Giraffe out to the public and into stable. In a year, one would expect most of the game to be done after having been released to the public for beta. Call it alpha all you want, it was a beta.-Before I get to my points, something needs to be said here. There are accusations going around Steam (because the people here refused to go to the official forums and learn anything and then just repeat what they read here in review comments) that Chucklefish has scammed and lied. Not once has this ever happened. They are a small indie company, they're not EA. They can't just puke out a game with 50-200 people working on it. The unstable updates were consistent. If you were not aware of that and that was why you thought no progress on the game could be found, then your ignorance is to blame for your opinion. Go to the official forums, educate yourself.-Here we go:Rain comes through off screen blocks and causes indoor flooding. Large quantities of water do not persist as it randomly drains both  off screen and on. These bugs have been around for a year and it is shameful that they're still there. I created a decent sized tub of water and the surface continued to drain over the course of 10 minutes despite my thorough placement of backdrop and border blocks.Game still suffers from crippling framerate problems. The more blocks and decorative entities in an area, the worse the framerate drops. It gets more severe over time until it is unplayable. Using the 64 bit experimental launcher helps but not entirely. They've stated that they're going to optimize the engine when they're done adding new systems but, with their reputation, I would not hold my breath. It's definitely better across the board (especially server side) but it still gets bad. Server latency issues from CPU and memory not releasing properly still exist. Fresh reboot -> Guy logs in right after that and moves sand or water -> 2,000 ms latency on high grade server hardware with fios connection.Mob spawning is extremely annoying. They spawn over and over even in areas where you've built lights and man-made materials. So, in towns you make, monsters spawn everywhere. I've not seen them spawn indoors but for them to spawn in such vast numbers right outside the door is unnecessary and irritating. Their behaviors were tweaked so fighting them is less annoying but that turns out to be a wash when they made up for that by increasing their spawn rate. Their behaviors are less annoying but they spawn way more frequently... no advancement made.Building is still useless. There is no reason beyond aesthetic and creative reasons to ever build anything or revisit planets. The only form of protection we have is /settileprotection which utilizes 2 different area IDs I've seen. The IDs are 65535 and 65532. One stops damage to naturally generated objects and the other stops damage to player-placed objects. It affects the entire planet you're on when you use it and can be sort of useful... but randomly feeds back a 'Failure' error in the chat log when used. The error stops after a reboot but randomly comes back. So, if you're staff on a server and you're not the host, you may not be able to issue a restart since there is no method for remotely doing that. Meaning, if you toggle the protection one way and you need it the other way, you might get it stuck that way til you can contact your host for a reboot. Which also means if you turn protection off for editing purposes, can't get it back on and can't get in touch with the host, your server could get attacked by griefers and you'll end up screwed. There is currently a massive outcry on the official forums for more attention to be shown to server-side systems. Hopefully more than Linux will see attention.We have to rely on thirdparty wrapper software made by fans like you and me in order to properly administrate servers. These wrappers often cause more problems than they solve. For example, StarryPy crashes users if they look inside of chests or other container objects on a planet that has protection enabled provided they are not on the planet protection list. These wrappers also cause latency issues because they use up more memory than the default server software. Having to rely on thirdparty software to fix problems that exist in the basic game is a problem gamers have had to deal with for decades. It, to me, is unacceptable for game developers to shoehorn in a multiplayer component to a game and then leave it up to shoddy thirdparty software to fix the problem. It never does fix those problems and, most of the time, the creators of the thirdparty software (Starrypy, Starrybound) end up abandoning the projects or not being able to keep up with demand for one reason or another; usually their personal lives prevent them from being able to find the time or motivation to work on the projects. The programs end up outdated and useless. If the developers themselves would just fix the server-side components to their games, we could avoid that problem ENTIRELY and a lot of frustration would evaporate. Anyone remember Tshock for Terraria? Getting support for that game meant dealing with extremely hostile community leaders and developers who literally said they'd be nicer to people if someone paid them more. Don't even get me started on Minecraft's Bukkit. Developers create the online component then forget it exists.Developers: fix your own damn games!NPC guards have this behavior where they will follow you and assist you which you can toggle with the interact key. But, this variable does not persist off-screen. They will say they'll follow you automatically (annoying) then when you tell them to stay, walk away and come back even a couple minutes later, they've forgotten you told them to stay and they follow you again.Novakids are very creative and the theme is interesting. Melding cowboy aesthetic into the 'Starpeople' race is pretty clever. Their weapons are revolvers and rifles. There is also a new delete button on the character screen, a welcome addition.The quest system offers a very refreshing take on progression. Now, you talk to your ship AI in a console on your ship and are given quests to complete. These quests help you progress through the game instead of you just digging for ore -> making object -> crafting item to summon boss -> killing boss for drop -> repeat X times as it was in the previous stable update. Quests change this up so it isn't nearly as linear. Though, there is no option to skip the tutorial and once you've done it one time, you'll be sick to death of having to do it on other characters.My previous review saw this game sitting at 5/10 and I suggested people wait it out even though the time it takes Chucklefish to do anything is questionable. The fact they have hired a group to sell Starbound T-shirts when we still have so much in the game that needs fixed shows that they have a problem with priorities. Liquid exists in the game but can't settle if there is too much of it, rain goes through blocks and hackers still make hosting a server a nightmare because files are still clientside... but we get t-shirts and some near useless outpost vendors. Fix the game, stop adding things. Focus your attention on making server hosting feasible without using a whitelist. THEN go add whatever you want to the game.Singleplayer ends.Multiplayer is your replayability. 5/10, no change. Wait it out.			"

Early Access Review
								This isn't even Beta. Pre-Alpha is more like it. Everything in this game is a placeholder until the ""real thing"" comes along. Main story quests, progression, exploration, etc. Everything's going to change. Selling items isn't even implemented into the game yet so it's difficult to make money. There are tons of biomes and monsters are randomly generated but they're literally all the same. The only difference is what the background is and what blocks generate. Everything becames stale after a while. We explored a magma planet, tundra planet, desert planet, and jungle planet, and the layout for all of them is basically the same. Nothing memorable. Monsters all have the same AI and therefore, not memorable. You'll fight the same things whether you're in deep caverns filled with magma or on an asteriod field.Developement on this game has slowed to a crawl which sucks because it's not even close to finished. Beta means that the game's mechanics are finished and just needs bug fixing, stat balancing, polishing, etc. This isn't even close. Half the features and mechanics are missing. This version of the game is just a mechanics test; everything else will come later. That's how it feels.EDIT AS OF 1-21-15I reviewed this game back in July '14 (haven't played since May '14). Steam says I played for over 600 hours, this is due to the launcher bug, actual playtime is about 180.Developement team has implemented an ""unstable build"" update system. So great, we get a beta of a beta (a beta that I still believe should be called an alpha). Selling items still not implemented. Still no story or quests beyond the first 4 or so tutorial quests. Races still don't have unique features implemented. Oh but the game has a new text font so there's that.			"

								I highly reccomend this game if you enjoy space travel, exploring, and creating your own story. While incomplete in its current state, the 1.0 update introduces a huge story line which took the devs 40 hours to complete without doing any of the side quests. You can play this game however you want (once the 1.0 update comes out you will have even more freedom) as of right now, you have the ability to explore countless planets and discover a myriad of unseen locations. There are custom monsters in specific biomes and the art is incretible. I started playing the day it came out and i have seen it develop over the years. I have to say that they are going in the right direction. Though i fiind that i am unable to play until the 1.0 update becasue of the features they are addeding (which is a good thing!) i dont want to play the game untill they add the story line, the new biomes, the new farm animals, new gadgets, new mechanics, and so much more. Though that is just my opinion because i have done everything that they game has to offer as of today. If you are looking to buy this game now, i can tell you that you will really enjoy it! This game has had my hyped since 2012 and im still super hyped to play it. i sometimes find that i get lost in the music as im walking through a planet and stop just to listen to it. Nothing comes close to the feelling you experience when you touch down on your first planet. The excitement, the wonder, and the enjoyment. There is nothing like it. This game can be played alone and dont get me wrong it is still a whole lot of fun. But it is way better if you play with a few friends. Ive looked at a number of the negative reviews and i have to say that a lot of their complantes are being addressed in the umpcoming update. Many of the survival aspects are being added back into the game. The 'incompleteness' is always going to be an aspect in a game that isnt finished i dont realy understnad why people get so heated about this. When 1.0 is released, all questions will be answered; all the secrets will be revealed. I am personaly waiting till 1.0 is relased to play again but the game is very playable and very fun in its current state. Hope this was helpful			"

The game is nowhere near finished, even after all this time that the developers claimed for daily updates, yadda yadda. Progress has all but halted (in order to facilitate the company coming together in one office to be more ""efficient""). They have forgotten on who's backs they were able to get their company together to begin with. On the backs of people who supported them when they promised a game that will be their labor of love. Now it seems they just got their hype money, and are sitting back enjoying the ride. Well it shows, and thanks to this game, I will never invest in another early access game. It breeds laziness and mediocrity among developers when they can promise whatever they want and not follow through. Maybe in time this game will become something great, but given the progress so far, I highly doubt it. I have gotten my money's worth in enjoyment, but a lot of enjoyment was seeing it grow. I can't in good faith recommend anyone buying this game now in it's current state. It has promise but feels totally dead in the water, and sinking.			"

Early Access Review
								Dissapointing. I was hyped for this game for a solid year, and preordered it the second I could. It promised to be an exciting game much like terraria can be, but sen in the distant future, and on new worlds. While the latter is true, the former is not. This game, to put it bluntly, is boring. After I mess around for a few hours, it's just not as fun as a game like Terraria. You explore, walk around, explore some more upgrade your gear, just so you can explore more. But, its not exciting exploration, all you do is walk in one direction for a while untill you find something, then you loot it and move to the next planet. That's it. The balance of the game is horrible as well, things are either ridiculously hard or mind numbingly easy. This game has potential, but in its beta it is a waste of money.			"

Early Access Review
								Nothing I can say hasn't been said already, but I'll start by saying why Starbound is sorely-♥♥♥♥ing disappointing.In short, Starbound's embarassingly incomplete, and claiming that its Early-Access status is the cause of this is purposeful ignorance. As of the time I write this, Starbound has been available on Steam for over 7 months, and there hasn't been a worthwhile update in at least 3 months. No self-respecting individual, short of the impressively arrogant or willfully blind, would consider this a positive aspect of any game, and I find myself wondering how anyone involved can defend it as anything but a tragedy.Oh, right. But this is a GAME review, and I've only gone so far as to criticize the developers passively. The game itself, it's pretty fun for a while. Get some friends and enjoy the bloated sandbox environment offering 4 whole bosses, a bunch of randomly-generated monsters, and some admittedly fun mods. The development of a player relies entirely on a ""carrot-on-a-stick"" method of baiting that player into making equipment with higher numbers than they had, strictly so that the poor sod can beat enemies who deal bigger damage numbers than those previously encountered. It's like the worlds worst MMO, but with even less lore and far fewer people with whom to play.In short, don't buy this game. Don't consider buying this game. Don't even convince your friend James to buy the game for you. Convince James to buy KFC for two with that money, instead. Then you, too, can experience the crippling gut pain associated with paying for Starbound, except you'll be fed for a few hours instead of disappointed for a figurative eternity.			"

Early Access Review
								This is a game that I loved. I loved it. I was enamoured by everything that it promised, and I played and played and played back when it had been recently released into early access. Everything they promised sounded so cool, and everything the game already had was awesome. I played a very early version of it (which was still awesome) and had to deal with a few wipes, and it was reasonable. They were improving it all the time, but a lot of things were still broken, or didnt work. crashes happened, things got deleted, files were lost, but it was perfectly alright. After all, it was an early access game. So I decided, alright, I love this game. So let's wait for it to be released. And I waited... and waited... and waited...Almost three years later, it still hasnt been released. Now I am looking at what is being said of the changes that have been made in the time I have been away, and quite frankly I dont think I even want to bother with it anymore. I stop and wonder if this would have happened this way if this game hadnt been so successful on early access... and honestly I dont think it would have gone down this way. And that is the real problem.Early access allows small developers with good ideas to get the financial backing to complete their awesome and creative projects.orIt allows small developers to earn money, procrastinate, and prolong deadlines until they forget what the hell they were originally paid for.This was a ripoff. They sold me the promise of a game, and four years later it still hasnt been delivered. In fact the product that is now being offered is quite different to the original game that was sold to me. So, really, do yourself a favor and stay away from this and any early access game.			"

												its basically a 2d version of no mans sky with no spaceship piloting, but far deeper gameplay elements thats inspired by terarria and minecraft. if youre not interested in sandbox survival games as such, you can also play the game as a story driven planet exploration game with light platform and rpg elements! i been playing the game since its early beta phase, im glad to see it got out of the beta hell. this is a fantastic game for the $15 price.

Early Access Review
								I bought two copies of this game before it even came out. I gave into the hype because I loved terraria so much and I loved space so much. I've learned the hard way to never buy a game that is not out yet. This game has many many small cool aesthetic features. There's already more furniture and different blocks in this game than all of terraria. The torches flicker. There's villages and the npcs talk to each other and say ""I'll get you for killing Billy"" and what not. There are monsters that make fart noises. All in all though, the game is just an amature mess. The real meat of the game is boring and incredibly uninspired and it makes me so sad to say that since I was probably hyped for this game for years. Pixels are the in game currency and pretty much used only for crafting and I do not understand why. Say you want to make iron armor. It takes like 10 iron armor and 500 pixels. Why? Why do you need money. It should be enough that you grinded the materials for it. Ontop of all that, you lose 25 percent of your pixels on death and can't get them back even if you go to where you died. There does not seem to be a sell feature either yet. (game has been out about 6 months now) and there is no way to trade pixels with friends either. The monsters and planets are all randomly generated which sounds like an amazing idea. till you get to a few different planets and realize everything is exactly the same as the other planet. sure the enemies look slightly different but they act almost completely the same. It's much more exciting to find the non-randomized enemies around but they're rare. The music is great and relaxing. That is until you come up upon a level 1 bird and suddenly you are assaulted with this strange epic boss fight music. It's unbelievably jarring and really takes away from the mood. When you actually find a cave and go underground there is just flat out no music at all. I found a nice flesh biome underground but it was made completely dull and uninteresting as there was no music no sounds or anything to make it sound like it was hell. There is also an unbelievable ungodly amount of grinding. I have already mentioned that with pixels before, but it actually does get worse. Even with a diamond pick axe, going down into say the heck/flesh biome? The blocks will take about 5 or 10 seconds to break. Sure in this game you break 9 blocks at a time but it feels so incredibly boring to sit there holding down left mouse button in complete silence while you break some flesh blocks that have copper ore in them. The second boss summon took about a total of 100 steel bars. (thats 200 iron ore and 100 coal ore.) Thats not even counting the thousands of pixels spent or the armor and weapons you absolutely need to progress. The boss itself was bland and took about 3 minutes to kill and had only 2 attacks. on its death, it dropped a key which let me progress to the ""harder"" levels. I went to the third galaxy set and just couldn't take it. Every planet is essentially the same. Gather the resources in complete silence, fight the random monsters that all do the same thing, and then summon a boss and repeat. Ah, I forgot to mention. Building in this game is great. It's well thought out and extremely easy to do. However, there is no reason to. It's incredibly depressing. In Terraria you build houses and homes for yourself and other villagers and you see your home flourish into a village depending on how you build it. In this game? There's no benefit to making a single house. You have a spaceship. You put your crafting materials and chests in it. Whats the point in building a home on a planet when you're just going to leave it and go exploring tons of other planets? You can spawn villagers and guards, but its all aesthetic and does nothing to benefit you besides being cute. It's actually a pain to go back to any home you make on a planet since you have to go to your ship and then use your precious fuel to return back. All for what? A chance to look at a shiny castle you made? A place to find all the different colors of dirt you stored? I just can't reccommend this game right now. I thought 6 months would be enough to make the game at least a little better but i guess its not. Maybe in 2-3 more years this game will be amazing. I really hope it is. But right now it's only good intentions that are not implemented well.  "

Early Access Review
								Do not purchase, until the final release, which might be never.Chucklefish has grossed over 21+ million dollars with Starbound, and as a publishing company, they certainly are no longer indie. Their nightly build demonstrated that they have indeed accomplished nothing over the past 3 months.They have been completely disingenuous with their spending and funding of the project. Leaving their failed deadlines aside, all money pledged to the game promised that it would speed up development of the game. In fact, it has actually slowed development down, as one of their 3 coders spent time interviewing candidates for their new ""pirate game.""Instead of taking the time to actually hire the necessary personnel needed to finish their initial project in a timely manner, they instead chose to fund an entirely new game project.They are incredibly shady, as only a week ago, we found out that one of their three coders (Barwe) quit back in April, which is really huge news to keep hidden. (His twitter still said he was an employee, and their home page still lists him as an employee.) Chucklefish only came clean about it when the community really pressed them for answers. It is very likely that they had no intention of every saying anything about it.As a whole, they are very unprofessional. I'll list a short summary to make my point. One of their coders (Omni) went on a banning spree on their forums, reddit and steam page, lashing out on everyone due to ""stress."" He then made an apology post, and banned himself, claiming that he would be removing himself from the public outlet. Not three days later, he unbanned himself from their steam forum to say that a poster there was legitimately mentally handicapped. Then rebanned himself. Then, due to the massive conflict his idiocy stirred up, he unbanned himself to reply yet again, making any credence he could ever have evaporate in the wind like the promises of their unfinished mess.Molly, who is the community manager has almost zero community interaction. Often, we find out important news through Tiy, Omni, or Bart. Molly spends her time using her twitter account as a personal account, promoting ideology. As the coup de grace, their whole ""horse-♥♥♥♥"" fiasco was recently announced by her to be ""just a joke"" after a large portion of their community was banned just by being outspoken against the idea. (Which according to Molly was the point of the entire ""trolling."")Tiy, the lead developer is a very derogatory and snide individual, who belittles those who ask simple questions regarding the health of the game. Less than two weeks ago, he took to twitter in a self-proclaimed ""drugged"" state, belittling people and berating those who question their competence.All in all, I don't think these are the worst people in the world, but I would definitely say that they are easily the most unprofessional bunch of developers I've ever seen. Honestly, the biggest problem is their inexperience and lack of ability to accept criticism. The amount of cash flow they've seen has caused them to forget their humble origins, and the people who believed enough in them and their vision to part with their money on a promise.I'm sure I've missed some of their chicanery, and if you're interested, here's a bunch of helpful links that will verify all that I've said.http://pastebin.com/jAWKJnHyhttps://docs.google.com/docume...http://i.imgur.com/bajxe4L.png***The above information was written by Billy T and not my own words. While I enjoy what the game already offers, I will not recommend another Steam Early Access game which is far behind schedule and may never be finished. Many of these ""indie-devs"" need less money and more accountability.			"

												A lot of people have been saying this game is like Terraria.Now, I'd like to clear up the misunderstanding here.Yes, maybe with some features, gameplay, pixel style and 2-D side scroller, it is like terria. But other than that, it doesn't FEEL like Terraria at all. In fact, it's better.Terarria fails to capture the subtle beauty of Starbound, with it's amazing sounndtract and the wonderlust that we all have for space. It's simplistic at first glance, but dives much deeper than you'd think.It has a story ark for those who like set missions and goals, and a certain path they have to follow. Explorations dominates the game, and the world of Starbound is ridden with lore. Each race is whimsical in nature, from robots being the ones the least technilogically advanced, and flower-people being the most carnivorous and ficious species alive.For those who like to let creativity soar, you can build whatvever your heart desires. From tall futuristic buildings scraping the sky, to a small wooden cavern laying behind a line of trees.And the best of all, if you'd just like to relax, you can always just grab your handy dandy manupilator module and chop some logs, or go mining and listen to the tic-tic-tic of ores ppopping out of foreground and background alike. Chill with some friends around a campfire jamming out to 12 days of christmas on your various instruments, or team up to find legendary (and curiously awesome and even more awesomely named) weopons, and battle tiny penguins who got their flippers on asault rifles and tanks.I don't think Starbound strives to be a spesific game. It doesn't strive to have an ending either. Not being able to call it quite a sandbox, I'll call it an adventure you have to play, and experiance for yourself. I can never tire of this game, and doubt I ever will. Billions of unique planets, creatures, species and collectables hover at your fingertips. All you have to do is try not to think about scary purple ghosts as you get the fuel to power your spaceship, and explores stars across the galaxy ;)Starbound is such an unique game, putting it into words is both a challenge, and an impossible feat I have attempted and failed. Just know that it is worth every penny and far more, and that it is, and always will be, one of my very favourite games.~Toodles, 2D-Bunnie			"

								Pre-ordered the game the first second that I was able to do so. The game looked very very promising. ""Terraria in Space"" is what everyone was saying. Few months later, few character/world wipes happened. I had even been paying for a Starbound server so that my viewers on YouTube and Twitch would be able to play around with. We had one last update in Feb 2014 and then all the updates completely stopped, literally right after the devs spoke of a daily update schedule. The devs decided to move themselves all into an office and that was pretty much the last we had heard from them. By April, I stopped paying for the server. No new content meant nobody wanted to play it, and I'm not paying for an empty server. The game is still in Alpha. It's barebones. There are bosses, there are planets, theres a way to cheaply duplicate thousands of sentry guns. Then there was an article talking about all these planned upcoming changes, like farming progression and an actual story. This game is garbage right now in it's current state. Don't buy into the hype. Don't give the devs another cent until they finish the game. Starbound is just another example of why Early Access games should be avoided at all costs, which is a shame because there are many Early Access games out there that are shining examples of what we want in an early access game, like Broforce and Hack n Slash and Contagion.

								When I originally bought this game, I thought I was buying something that'd improve on what Terraria and others did, that it'd use the ""space"" theme as a blank canvas to have plenty of randomly generated worlds for one character instead of having the two seperate. A good while from then, and as I play the game now it still feels the same. Nothing has changed. There has been plenty of talk and promises, and none of it has come to Fruition, whereas we're supplimented with filler and daily blogs like they were lets players playing their own game. What they're updating us with is nice, but I'd like to see some actual results, if you don't mind. The nighty build wans't the best idea in the world.			"

								Please don't give Chucklefish money.To expand, this studio has proven over time that they have no clear vision or direction in the development of this game. Useful, fun, quality of life improvements have been ignored (or even removed) in place of boring, tedious, repetitive tasks. For instance, the latest update made smelting ore take time instead of being instantaneous. There is absolutely no reason for this beyond a weird attempt at chasing ""immersion"" in the name of monotonous busywork. Many flocked to Starbound (myself included) because of how impressive Terraria was and the seemingly limitless potential of this game. That potential has been squandered with poor decision after poor decision. How many times has combat been reworked? The fact that the game has been in development for so long, and made the amount of money it has, and is in this shoddy and unfinished of a state speaks volumes. I really want this game to be good someday, but I think it will take new blood with a fresh eye coming in to save it.			"

												At this point I'm not really even sure why they give you swords or guns. I have so many shurikins, and javalins, and moltovs that I end up spending more time throwing things than your average Fed-ex employee.It took me a while to figure out why the game just wasn't working for me. I did like it to some extent, but it just didn't end up capturing me the same way something like Terraria did. First off, your base doesn't matter except for farming and building the packs that help you explore other worlds. I never had to craft a single weapon or peice of armor because I could always just buy something about as good off whatever vendor I happened to stumble across.Uprgrading your ship doesn't matter. ""So, you're saying I can spend $80,000 to put a couple more rooms in my ship instead of just spending five minutes building them on a planet somewhere? Sign me up!""The fighting is incredibly stale. And even most of the boss battles can be entirely broken by using the spike ball to stick to part of the wall where the boss can't do so much damage to you until the best opening presents itself.Actually doing the main quests is quite tedious, as it revolves around hitting world after world in hopes that this forest world or that ice world actually has the species your looking for.In the end it just felt repetitive. It felt like I was grinding for something that ultimately wouldn't be that rewarding anyway.			"

Worth the wait? Promised to be released all the way back in 2013, Starbound was a prime example of ""how you DON'T do early access"" for a long time. Did it change with the release? Now, don't get me wrong. It isn't a bad game - would you expect someone to play bad game for >400 hours? But it's... shallow. It doesn't have a decent amount of content that it had, but that was cut just for the sake of cutting. Example: tech system. Bubble field that negates fall damage and lets you bounce off the surfaces; badass rocket boots; on-demand teleportation to another point of the screen; health and energy regenerators; friggin power mech suits! Sounds sweet, right? Well, if you liked this assortment of power-ups then sucks to be you: all of that was in the game, it IS in the game's files even now - but it was cut right before the 1.0. Current available tech system consists of ""lower-your-size"" skill with some variations, ""jump-higher"" skill with some variations, and ""run faster"" skill with some variations. That's all. Before i could fly from the ground all the way to the board of Avian Airship with rocket boots alone, but now? None of these new techs will give you anything similar. That applies not only to techs - there are various codex entries, weapons and entire biomes traces of which still exist in the files, but you'll never find them - unless they're reimplemented with the later update, but then you'll wonder - what's the point of ""1.0 version"" anyway? (By the way, if anyone can confirm that Uzis, Tesla Spears and Lightning Coils still can be found legitimately, i would greatly appreciate that - those were my weapons of choice for the most part of my Starbound playtime) Next point is, they promise you ""7 playable races"", That's a lie. Game has 6 playable races and 1 playable character. If you play as any of the 6 vanilla species, you'll meet a lot of towns, camps and just stray folks of your kind while exploring stars, as well as some written pieces of history. That is not the case if you are to choose Novakid. I just want to point out that saying ""they are nomad race so they don't have any settlements and/or recorded history"" ISN'T the same as making them ""fully integrated into the lore!""[playstarbound.com] and it ISN'T a valid reasoning to the fact that player's character is literally one and only Novakid in the entire universe. And at the same time, developers really don't like to give players a choice in small things. Not always, yes, but when it happens, it is on the edge of stupidity. Community didn't like the hotbar change to less intuitive version? Well, we will implement new one anyway, although it could be easily selectable in settings. People liked need to warm them up through fire and clothes to survive on cold planets? Aw shucks, let's have this ""craft once and forget"" system. Don't like the onboard pet that just sits here, doing absolutely nothing? Too bad, beause you HAVE to hold this useless pile of pixels on your ship instead of acquiring one if you want to. And god forbid you to build a colony without taking into account the fact that NPCs can't close the doors after walking through them - one stray monster, and entire settlement could be wiped out. It could be easily changed with a few adjustments to the script. But it isn't. Why? Beause reasons. Honestly, after looking at main features of release version (storyline, fossils, backers' items) i can't help but think that the main vector of work for 1.0 was ""Finally put in all stretch goals and be done with it already"". I may be wrong, I WANT to be wrong, but simply can't shake the feeling. Also, some of those cut codex entries implied that storyline will be something more than ""find six keys and kill a monster"". This and Novakids' ""implementation"" busts immersion in the game's world for me REALLY hard.But if you have some friends to fool around with, or want to roleplay as your character with complete disregard to intended atmosphere of the game, then grab Starbound. Despite all negative parts, it is still a real deal for its price/content ratio. As to me, i'll wait until there's enough mods to restore and fix what was cut and broken.			"

												I paid for early access as soon as a working demo was released years ago. Over the years, they added and promised a lot of exciting features. I saw a lot of potential in this game, and I still do. This game is very feature and content rich, and the art is great quality. Unfortunately, a lot of the features are pretty disappointing, and a lot of things that were promised were never added or just not executed very well. Some survival features can be completely negated, such as heat, cold, and breathable air, all that's left is the hunger mechanic which is not balanced well in my opinion. Despite all of this, I would still recommend the game, because it's very fun with friends.However, this game is very poorly optomized. I believe it's the pathfinding of enemies and NPCs that cause severe FPS drops in crowded areas of the game. Weather also drops FPS, making me think it's the way ponds appear during rain. Nothing can be done about this. I'm confident that the graphics are not causing the low FPS, a beefy GPU won't help. It requires good CPU, which is not typical for most games. It runs poorly on my desktop with a 4.2MHz processor, and it causes my laptop to overheat and shut down. This makes the game completely unplayable in some cases.			"

								Although this game is in beta, and is very fun to play at the begining, I highly suggest waiting untill it launches out of beta for better gameplay and a lot more content. It has the mechanics in it, but for now, its hardly a game. 5/10			"

The galaxy need saving and you're all we've got. Starbound is a 2D space/extraterrestrial sandbox game from Chucklefish that, after several years in Early Access, has been released as a full game. Earth and an organization made up of seven races, the Protectorate, have been destroyed by an ancient and powerful foe. As the last surviving member of the Protectorate, it is your responsibility to defeat this evil foe! Or you could completely ignore the main quest, go to a far away planet, build some houses and get rich from the rent payments. It's up to you really.  You see, when Chucklefish describe their game as a sandbox, they really mean it. Sure, there are limits to it, but there's a hell of a lot of stuff you can do. Starbound does have a story, and even if you want to focus on other stuff you're probably going through the story quests. The story is a tad bit ridiculous but then so are the Novakids, people made out of neon gas. These quests, the first few of them anyway, are also used to teach the player about core mechanics and they do a fairly good job of explaining the basics. You can focus on the story if you want to or you can do any number of things, perhaps you just want to build a house and a farm on a faraway planet, or maybe you want to create a colony of Avians, hell I've heard there's someone trying to recreate the Death Star so you could even do something crazy like that.  One of the most important parts of the game is your character's ship. You have the ship from the get go but its FTL drive is completely caput, you can travel within your starting system but that's it. Completing a few story quests will get your ship repaired and then the game gets interesting. Once you have your ship you can do whatever you want. Your ship is fueled with a resource called Erchius Crystals which can be found on natural satellites (you'll need special breathing equipment before you can survive on them). When fueled, the ship can be used to jump to different star systems and then can be moved to positions over whatever planet or satellite you wish to visit. The ship is quite small to begin with (still big enough to build all of the crafting stations) but you can increase the size of the ship by hiring new crew members and then using upgrade modules at certain numbers of crew. Your ship ends up being pretty big so if you want to go for the whole space nomad thing it's possible.  When it comes to the planets themselves, there's a reasonable amount of variety. There are quite a few different types of them, ranging from lush forest worlds to worlds so cold you'll freeze to death without the proper equipment. They all have risk factors, the safest worlds are classed as Low Risk but they also have the lowest tiers of ore (Copper, Silver and Gold). You'll be wanting to visit more challenging planets fairly quickly so you can upgrade all your different crafting stations to access new armour, weapons, tools etc.  From what I've seen so far, all planets have some wildlife, most of which will attack you but some animals don't pay much attention to you. Sometimes this is all you'll find on a planet apart from some random chests and the odd travelling vendor. However, some worlds will be home to some pretty cool stuff. Perhaps you'll get lucky on an ocean world and find an underwater Hylotl city or maybe you'll find a Floran settlement in the middle of a jungle (completing quests for NPCs in settlements is how you get new crew members in the vanilla game). Some worlds are home to Penal colonies full of prisoners armed to the teeth, others are home to long abandoned Apex Labs. There's no way to know what a planet will have before you get there (something I find a tad frustrating) so it can be tough to find what you're looking for but when you do find them whatever it is you want, it's very satisfying.  No matter what you decide to do in Starbound, you're going to spend a fair amount of time collecting resources with your Protectorate Matter Manipulator. The MM is basically a combination of the basic tools you usually find in this kind of game, it can be used for mining chopping down trees etc. It can also be upgraded with special upgrade modules that improve its effectiveness. Unfortunately, mining for ore is one of the weakest parts of the game. The mining itself isn't so bad (though the lack of a quick way back to the surface sucks), the problem is that you never find large deposits of ore, I've never seen more than seven or eight bits of ore together. Not a huge issue by itself but when you consider the fact that you've probably gone to that planet specifically to look for ore it can be aggravating to spend half an hour doing it and ending up with 30 or 40 ore, that’s not going to last long.  Another big issue with the game is its performance but it seems to be a case of luck of the draw as to whether or not you'll actually have any problems. Some people have had issues that make the game unplayable, other have had issues with the game simply not performing as well as it should. I've been pretty lucky and the only performance-related issue I've had is some trouble getting fullscreen to work but there's no guarantee that you won't have any performance trouble. The only way to know if you're going to run into trouble is to buy the game and see if it works, not particularly helpful I realize but worst case scenario you can just refund the game and wait for fixes.   A couple more things I'd like to mention. Firstly, Starbound has an awesome modding community. Starbound is definitely enjoyable if you're playing Vanilla but there are some fantastic quality of life mods as well as complete overhauls out there that make it even more fun to play. Secondly, the game's drop-in multiplayer works very well and while singleplayer is a lot of fun I find the game even more enjoyable when playing with a friend.  Verdict  Starbound is far from perfect but that doesn't stop it being a super enjoyable space sandbox game with plenty to do. It's well worth the price of admission.  Lone Ranger Reviews.  El K.

												Honestly, this is the best game of the 2D genre in my opinion. Are you able to make an orchestra with a huge amount of musical tools in any other game?PROS:1. A ridiculous amount of planets to explore.2. Musical tools. They are absolutely amusing. And there is so much of them!3. The crafting system is amazing, so much different stuff to craft. And as you craft something, you learn new recipes. In addition to a huge crafting system, you can find blueprints in chests and also learn new recipes.4. The planets aren't as big as I would like them to be, but they are still huge. You run around planets and you find buildings, ruins and stuff like that. It is so interesting to explore them!5. There are side quests. You find a village on one of the planets and the NPCs can give you quests, and they reward you with a bag with random stuff! In addition to that, you have a chance to recruit them!6. Different types of items. By that I mean common, uncommon, rare and legendary. Not sure if there is something between rare and legendary, but it makes the game so much fun for grinding.7. Fishing. You have a chance to catch each fish, from common to legendary. You can craft only two fishing poles, and that's a bit lame, but they might add it in the future. You have some upgrades to the fishing poles, but you can't craft them, only catch them from uncommon fish and higher. With a chance of course. Which again, pretty lame, but at least they have a fishing system that looks absolutely sweet!8. Vehicles. There is like, 4 ""cars"" and one boat, that you can purchase with pixels, but they look very cool.And more stuff that I probably forgot to mention.CONS:1. The main quest is the worst. You need to explore planets and scan random stuff to get points, and after like 50 points you complete the quest. You return - get a quest to beat a boss - you beat the boss - you get the same quest but for another race. ???2. Not hardcore. Why do I say ""not hardcore""? Because I've beaten two main story boses, and went grinding for the best equipment (second to best), got some legendary weapons, and then beat all of the following bosses without having a challenge at all. Even the last boss wasn't that hard. I did not die to any boss, except one time that I fell into a trap and died. Basically, what am I trying to say is that the main story bosses got no effect on your gameplay. They're just mobs with more damage and HP, similar to some you find on planets. They do not affect anything at all, except your progression throughout the story, which, in my opinion, could've been done better.Overall, the game is amazing. If you exclude the main quests, and look at the game without it, you can see a game that is better than Terraria by its design. 9/10.			"

								First of all, yes this game looks similar to Teraria, and it has the same concept of 'Mine, survive, craft', but it improves on every single aspect of Terraria. 10 tiers, one boss per tier, extra other bosses scattered everywhere, and the selling point, an infinite number of procedurally generated worlds. With its own random ecosystem of plants, animals, fish and more. And you can travel the universe and also, its MULTIPLAYER! Please get it, even though its in beta, and bugs are bound to appear, it is worth the $15.			"

								I can only hope, at some point in the distant future, that there will be an update to this game adding half of what we were promised. I purchased on day 1. I regret that immensely. It has been approximately 10 months since the last update to the main game. Just remember that.Edit: I am aware of the ""unstable"" and ""Nightly"" branches. The problem comes when the baseline game, the one people paid fifteen dollars for, is unchanged. They can update the other branches all they want, but until they update Starbound itself, with official, supported content that has been promised since day one, I feel as though I wasted my money.2nd Edit: Yes. I have played 166 hours. I feel like my money was wasted. I feel like this game has so much potential, but Chucklefish is just not a company that can bring out that potential with their current policies.3rd: Still not worth it. Buy 1.5 copies of Terraria instead. It got a full release and is STILL receiving massive updates.			"

												Pros-A huge universe, probably impossible to explore it all in a lifetime. There's a lot to explore. -Nice story. -Steam Workshop support. -Good pixel art style with a nice character creator (Which can be expanded further with mods from Steam Workshop.).-You'll sink hours into the game, not just by advancing the story, but also by upgrading your gear, building stuff etc. (Which can be expanded much further with mods.)Cons-Story progression is too linear and can sometimes be too frustrating. -Not much endgame content. You are just going to build more stuff and then that's it. -I personally don't like the ""Type the IP adress to join the multiplayer server"" thing. Something like a server browser would make the game's multiplayer much more active. Overall score:8/10It's a good game overall and worth buying. "

								Waste of time and money. Maybe Chucklefish will finish this game, but probably not. With well over four million dollars in the bank you'd think there'd be a decent update in the last several months but I guess not.I'll remove this review if they ever actually get their ♥♥♥♥ together.EDIT: My original review wasn't harsh enough, I think. This game is an utter disgrace. To spend money on it would be an insult to yourself and the entire community. From misleading advertizing to devs censoring any and all criticism they can, this is the perfect example of everything wrong with Early Access. Stay the hell away from this putrid filth of a game.However, I like to believe that things (and people) can change, so my original statement still stands. By all means, if Chucklefish gets their ♥♥♥♥ together, I will remove this review.EDIT 2: http://i.imgur.com/uiFdrY5.jpgIt seems Chucklefish has decided that rather than actually fulfil their promises, they'd just astroturf the Steam reviews, posting literally tens of thousands of fake positive reviews, most 1-3 lines of nonsense and a thumbs up. Starbound went from Mostly Negative to Very Positive in a span of less a month. This results in the game having ""Very Positive"" reviews despite the entire first page and beyond of Most Helpful reviews being negative. I've purchased a few bad games in my time, but Starbound is my biggest buyer's remorse. I will never get my 15$ back. ♥♥♥♥ Tiy, ♥♥♥♥ Chucklefish, and ♥♥♥♥ Starbound. Starbound is a scam, and will likely never have even a quarter of the features that were promised. Maybe if they actually worked on the ♥♥♥♥ing game instead of throwing parties and writing up positive reviews to manipulate the store page they'd actually get ♥♥♥♥ done.With how nasty Chucklefish have been towards any and all criticism, I expect to be banned from the forums for this review if I haven't been already.

								I entirely regret buying this game.I would not reccommed this game even if it goes on sale for $0.99. In fact, don't even install it if it's available for free at some point in the future. It's just that bad and the developers do not deserve to be supported for this project and how they have behaved toward their customers, and even on their own forums.I sadly purchased the game awhile ago when the project was still early in development, although you can't really call what they have been doing for the last 5 months development. For me, regardless of the progress they make or how good or bad this game turns out to be they have alienated their customers and deserve no support whatsoever.The only thing that has kept me from putting in a refund request is that I know nobody could have planned from the start to do this bad of a job. I do hope the creators of this game read all the negative comments and realize just how awful of a job they have done and hopefully make good changes in the future because of it. I personally will never buy another Chucklefish game again, at any stage... alpha, early access, beta, completed or otherwise. And not just the publisher, I will most likely avoid any future projects of the development team as well. Progress on this game has been abysmal.Starbound is THE lowest quality project on Steam I have come across. Hands down.			"

This is a review of the current state of things.I, like everyone else, was super freaking excited for this game. I snagged it up the day early access became available. I was so excited for a game that would be terraria, only with new animations, awesome looking guns, tech, mechs, the whole nine yards! So what happened? I can't be bothered to play it for more than 30 minutes at a time, and even then, I only feel like playing once a month. Everything is there. Crafting, building, mining, fighting, even features that terraria doesn't have, like quests, NPC's that don't live with you, actually being able to aim your melee attack. Yet it still falls short. It lacks something Terraria just, has. The IT factor. Maybe when it's done I'll change my mind, but it just feels impossible at times, and by the time it doesn't feel impossible, it's just boring. I mean, at it's current state, it's gather resources, build beacon, fight boss, build map upgrade, go to new planet, gather resources, build beacon, fight boss- You get the point. It's repetitive, it's slow, and it's just boring. I get excited every single time Terraria gets a new update. I'm not even aware of the current dev state of Starbound anymore. Again, things could change, the promised finish project sounds really great, and if you've got 15 dollars just lying around, sure, pick it up, but I just can't recommend that you buy it unless you meet those parameters. Sorry Starbound, but until you pick up the pace on your updates, and give us something worth being excited over, I think you might be a dud.			"

												100% Recommend this game. You'll see as of the official 1.0 release, the majority of reviews are negative. I respectfully disagree with them. Did the devs make some shortsighted decisions while pushing the official release? They sure did. Are there things that used to be in the game that have been removed? Well yeah, you bet. Are there new mechanics that seem tedious and hold back the player, simple for the sake of holding back the player? Pretty much.But guess what? This game is still. Not. Finished.The 1.0 release isn't ""The End"" of Starbound, these devs have been with us since day one, the game has always been fun and has always been changing. Sometimes things get nerfed into oblivion, sometimes things are game-breakingly strong. It's a delicate task to balance something with so much content! AND THEY AREN'T DONE! I have faith that this game will only continue to improve, at WORST this is a rough patch and in no way do the devs deserve the amount of flak they have received these past few days. If you're a little worried about purchasing this game right now, then hold off until it's on sale or until the majority of recent reviews are positive - it's your call. But don't let all the nay-sayers scare you away, this game is phenomenal and provides many MANY hours of fun. I'm sure I'll get a lot of hate for this review but this is just the way I see it. I love Starbound through thick and thin, and I am deeply saddened that so many people turn their backs on it after being loyal for so long. The devs work hard and deserve praise, everyone makes mistakes. Now let's be positive and provide feedback, and see some changes for the better!Thank you for your time.			"

								The game is really not worth it in its current state. Yeah sure, its fun for a few hours or days but then you realise that theres not much to do. The devs havent updated the game in almost 4 months, the planet hopping gets moretedious and boring once you realize that the only major differences are that the planets  come in 4 presets and sizes, the dirt changes and the enemies change, not much else really. Games been out  for like almost 2 years now and they have barely got anywhere. This game is a perfect example as how Early Acess can go wrong, people pour thousands of dollars into a game they think will be the best only to receive scraps or nothing at all. At the rate the games going they wont even be out of beta in the next year. Hold your money on this one, it has potential but the devs dont seem to have an plans for the game, just adding random things. Like i said before the game isnt worth it in its current form.			"

								It's very good, a lot of planets to explore and a lot of customisation however..There is nothing to actually do, as in there is no purpose. Nearly all the items in the game are simply decorative sprites and since you have to visit other worlds to mine rarer resources there is no real reason to build a base anywhere with them.So while you might think ""Hey I want to build a huge space fortress"" you quickly realise that it will serve no purpose and you will end up abandoning it as you travel further into space.<<<UPDATE>>>Due to the comments below I should probably state that this review is based upon the last time I properly played the game which was in late 2014 so experiences of the game may be different now due to recent patches, I recommend reading the comments attached to this review to see the changes as there seems to be some recent developments which address the problems I stated.

												I just finished the game, must say the disappointment still sinking in pretty heavily.They went in so many directions during the development process and a lot of them had so much personality an flair, sad to see that in the end chucklefish ended up pretty much handpicking the most bland uninteresting pieces they had over all the years of development and called it the final product.I've played the very first version of starbound and came back to check on how it was doing from time to time. Ironically enough, the finished product looks like almost a full rollback to their very first early access version.Ultimately this is just a shadow of an absolutely amazing game that could have been.

Early Access Review
								As many other players who pre-ordered Starbound, I was quite hyped and happy. ""Finally a Terraria in a sci-fi setting - just up my alley"" - I thought.The game itself has potential in many aspects (sandbox creation, roleplaying immersion etc). You get to create your own character with some basic customization - then you start on a broken spaceship and have to descend onto the planet below to gather resources to be able to continue on into the galaxy and other planets. A lot of exploration follows, but most planets are very generic and alike.Rince and repeat.Currently the gameplay and content is very limited. You will keep collecting resources like ore/wood, fighting monsters that pretty much do the same thing over and over again. The combat mechanics are pretty plain. There's not much point into making any houses on a planet with the ship being a viable storing and farm-option. The same thing repeats over several tiers until you hit the end-tier.What prompted me to not recommend this game to any one new to Starbound is the lack of updates from the developers. They've not been upfront or honest with the community and their backers - dates keep being pushed, updates not appearing for many months and a constant change of development strategies (like reworking basic core features, re-prioritizing content creation and contradicting earlier statements quite often). And there has also been a harsh censorship going on on their forums, where even people who aren't rude nor trolling - but raising valid questions and concerns are getting suspended. I shall also not mention how certain members of their staff have been rude towards the community, which is very unprofessional from a business perspective.There are many other examples of early access developers (be it indie or otherwise) that have handled their projects in a much more professional way.All in all, if the developers at Chucklefish get their thing together one beautiful day - this game might be worth investing in. Until then, do yourself a favor and do not buy this product.			"

								Let's be clear from the start - most of this review is going to be about poor business practices by Chucklefish. Having said that, the game itself isn't worth your money. The content is all extremely repetitive, and if you find yourself checking back for any reason after the initial 5-10 hours, it'll be to see if any updates have taken place. You'll be met with disappointment. Avoid leaving the launcher up when you leave the game, as that trumps up your playtime as well, and Tiy loves to run to Twitter citing higher playtimes as reasons his game must be better than it is.Now, on to why you REALLY shouldn't play this game:The company behind it, Chucklefish, is among the most unethical and dishonest companies around. They're setting themselves up to be a miniature Electronic Arts. They're just as greedy, except they produce less.They released nearly 7 months ago, and thus far have only produced two updates of questionable value, after taking in four million dollars in funding. From the moment of release it has been plagued with excuses for why development stopped, such as taking a month vacation after Steam release, then another 3-4 months so they could move a few members to London for communication purposes (which hasn't solved anything yet), to knocking off early for, ""Mario Kart"" sessions. Development remains in a state of limbo, and nobody is really sure what's going on.Luckily, they don't communicate with the Steam community either, so the ignorance is shared among their company and investors. I mean, sure, they make loads of money on the platform, but when it comes to updating the folks that supported their 7 month vacation, you have to paw through every social media site known to man to actually locate information, and when you do, it's usually about everything BUT ""Starbound."" Wondering when the next update will be? I hope not, because their site, Reddit, and Twitter - the places they direct you to for announcements - contains everything from their new office dog, to employees playing in trash cans, to excuses for ranting on Twitter, such as them being under the influence of surgical drugs following an operation, yet managing to spend the entire day on Twitter.Speaking of communication, unless it's blind praise, they don't want to hear it, and they WILL censor you. They'll claim they don't, and sure, you'll hear reports of their official websites being highly censored, and probably not think too much about it. ""Two sides to every story"" you'll tell yourself, until one of their developers comes through Reddit, Steam, and the Chucklefish forums and goes on a massive ban wave of critics, while allowing the harshest fanboys to remain, and you'll quickly learn it's true. The one responsible for the project, Tiyuri, even dedicates a significant portion of his day on Twitter calling all criticism ""trolling"" in an attempt to garner sympathy. If you head to their forums, they'll label ALL criticism - either done well or blatantly trolling - ""flamebait"" and lock it immediately... if you're lucky. Often enough, people have been banned for it, regardless of post quality.There's more, but what I'm trying to say is, no matter what goes on with this game, don't support it. We've already funded the vacations of some of the laziest, most condescending people imaginable. They make promises they can't fulfill, spend most of their free time Tweeting and blogging about wasting time between complaining about the investors critical of them, taking the development money and spending it on other publishing ventures, and generally treating those that supported them with disdain and contempt, whilst simultaneously running off to Tweet about how everyone is mean to them and they don't understand why.There are PLENTY of good indie companies out there, and Chucklefish is the exception to the rule. Give them your money instead.			"

								""A delayed game is good eventually, a rushed game is bad forever"" -Shigeru MiyamotoThe original release for this game was to be December 4, 2013. A bit late, eh?Sure, Chucklefish may not have been able to deliver on time, but look at Valve's record. They weren't bashed for being late because of Valve Time.  The game is getting much better, and is almost to it's official release (2 updates until) and is really good compared to what it may have been if it released when planned.So what I am saying is that putting this game off because of the heaps of negative reviews in the ""Most Helpful"" section isn't what this game deserves.Now that I got that out of the way, let's make an actual review, shall we?Overall: It's doing what it's set out to do.When the beta first came out, it was so much different, monsters actually need to do attacks to damage you, the snow infantry armor was overpowered, and you could die of hunger, and freezing.The Novakids didn't even exist in the game.Today, that's all changed: Questing, ship upgrades, colonies, and really smooth generation of planets. This game managed to keep me interested in mining, which for some reason, Minecraft couldn't get me interested in that.This game has done exactly what it aimed to do in the first place: let people explore.Although, it is still in beta, with many additions, bosses, quests and mechanics yet to be created in the universe. (with whips being planned in the next update, upon writing this.)However, this game is not flawless; the AI is quite stupid, with pathfinding that matches an acrobat missing their inner ear, and the game making some parts of itself feel unneccessary, and the framrate dying at certain buildings made by the devs (which is being fixed).Conclusion: You should try it, sometime, at the least.So, it's an 8?

Early Access Review
								Short review: I liked it at first, and it definitely had potential once upon a time... but the repetition and a few other factors have taken away the fun. I don't think it will improve- wait until final release or until it goes on sale if you decide to buy it at all. It was a tough choice for me to mark Starbound as not recommended because I used to really enjoy this game. However now, taking a step back, some recent changes and underlying flaws have taken that enjoyment out of it. 1. My biggest issue: repetition. I was initially attracted to this game because of the exploration factor, but it doesn't take long before you see the same thing over and over, and the recent changes to the game have only made this worse. Each planet is almost a carbon copy of others of its type, down to the of monsters that spawn there. The dungeons and towns become tedious after encountering them time and time again. The unique charm of exploring different planets' surfaces is almost entirely gone. The over-abundance of microdungeons and rare items has made the feel of the game shift from exploring to grinding for loot. Even the dungeons themselves and the loot within eventually becomes mundane and useless (Oh boy, a new cool weapon! Just like the other ten thousand I found and won't ever need!).2. Further, the progression feels wrong. NPCs give quests that guide you through the different tiers of armor- but it winds up boiling down to finding some ore, making some armor so you can beat a boss, so that you can find different ore to make more armor so that you can beat another uninteresting boss... rinse and repeat. That's essentially the only progression system, which ends up feels very grind-y. Overall, the old boss system felt much more rewarding. (There is some progression to be had in upgrading the size of your ship, but this provides little to no real challenge at all other than more grinding planets.)3. Kind of goes along with the lack of the progression, but the game lacks any real point or purpose. Okay, so it's a sandbox game, maybe it can get away with no real substance, right? Not really, as exploring gets old fast and the sandbox aspect withers up fast.There are, of course, more issues (why was damage-on-touch added??) with this game, but these two stood out the most to me. Now, there are still plently of good things that made the game enjoyable. There are neat little easter eggs and plenty of cool things to find. I've enjoyed it for long enough to feel as though I've gotten my money's worth, but lately Starbound seems to have taken a turn for the worse. This game has been in early access for years (wasn't it supposed to come out in 2012 or something?) and somehow it doesn't feel much closer to a finished game. Overall, Starbound feels like a very poorly developed game- it could have been great but something went wrong along the way.Granted, this is still an early access game (which it has been for years since I bought the game...) so these things *could* be subject to change. However I don't think they will, and the game has lost some of its fun. If you are going to get this game I would strongly encourage you to wait until it is out of early access, although that may take a few more years at this rate :/  or wait until it goes on sale.			"

Early Access Review
								Edit: Read the comments for some high comedy and amusing assumptions.TLDR: Great potential, abandoned by the devs. Sadly becoming the norm for Early Access.Bought a 4 pack for the family and then we waited months and months to actually play. A year ago we were having great fun with it, but the content was shallow, we put it aside to wait for the advancement stuff to come in...and we waited...and we waited......and we waited..........so far this game has been waiting, a teaser, and more waiting.Well now it looks like the wait is over, the game is dead. Sad.(disclaimer: statement that the game is dead based on _RUMORS_ (that I believe) that the Devs are going to ""Pull a Schafer"" and make the next stable release version 1.0 and exit early access. This would amount to releasing a game as complete as Towns and Spacebase DF-9, thus killing the game.)			"

												Ironicly enough, The Developers play in trashcans.EDIT: Since My time playing it from 3 or so years ago it hasn't changed much, A half baked story, Same-y and bland planets, and boring quests, its all the same. The developers are incompetent and couldn't program a toaster without throwing out all the code 3 times.Notice how the changelog looks very impressive, but if you take a second and look at it no real gameplay has been added. Terraria is a much more compelling and rich experience and that game didn't need a million ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ dollars. A possible Alternative to starbound is to slam your head against a wall while playing terraria, The best part about that is when (If) your concussion heals you will have an actually good game to play.An Entire Universe to explore, and yet every single planet feels the same.Water, Water, Everywhere, And yet not a drop to drink.

								Please don't give chucklefish any money.  This game is exceptionally incomplete, on the cube world update plan (i.e. almost never) and was originally to be released in 2013.  The lead developer has even said what is they are selling is a tech demo, not a beta.  The combat is horrible.  The worst part is that the developer is now actively removing and locking threads that meet the Steam guidelines but are critical of the game and developer.  Save your money and buy something that is actually finished or gets updated regularly and is developed by people who can take criticism.For the current gameplay I recommend this Let's play.

								This game is one of my favorite games of all time. Period. It's so fun, so addicting, so immersive, even for a pixel-y sidescroller, I can get lost in these worlds and lose hours of my day. The combat is kinda ""ehh"", but the weapons for combat are ♥♥♥♥ing ridiculous. Borderlands could never top this ♥♥♥♥. You can get a gun that spurts out tentacles and a rocket launcher that shoots fireworks. You can fight by holding a garden gnome and have him shoot rainbows from a pistol. There's a playstyle for all types of fighting. Wanna use a staff? Melee? Gunslinger? You can do any of it. Bows? Spears? Wanna just be an ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and throw snowballs at people? You can do it!The worlds are these huge randomly generated marvelous planets that you can go to freely and explore however you want. You wanna go to a snow planet and zoom throughon a hoverbike while jumping out to throw bones at animals? You can do it. You wanna go to a flaming lava planet and toss water balloons at fire-breathing dogs? Do it up. You want to go to planets torn to  shreds by constant war and fight weird corrupted humans while exploring the remains of the civiliation that lived there before? This ain't Fallout, baby, but you can ♥♥♥♥in' do it.Playing the different races is so fun. I ♥♥♥♥ing adore the Novakid race and the crazy-silly lore they have. I love learning about how the apex are complete nazi ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s so I don't feel bad about breaking into their labs and stealing their stuff.The ability to randomly find instruments and play midi songs, even custom imported ones, and being able to do it without everyone having some weird ""extra songs GRAND DAD JOHN CENA MEME MOD 2k17"" ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t is ♥♥♥♥ing amazing.My only real complaint with this game is compression. My computer is just a step above flaming-potato level, and the game still runs amazingly. But some areas in the game, mostly the Outpost, can cause frame drops for the stupidest reasons.Also the Unstable build of this game is ♥♥♥♥ing glorious times 10.Un-nerd the Bone Rifle, make it shoot blood again, and put it in Unstable, and I will give you both of my lungs Cuddlefish.All-in-all, you're paying $15 at the time of writing this for a game that'll last longer than 99% of high-retail $60 games.This game is amazing in so many ways. I extremely reccomend giving it a try. It's more than just ""space terraria"".			"

												Edit: added more fresh memes and minor text editsYou read the reviews of negativity, of all the old days of Starbound and old people ranting about how it used to be better back then.But if you're really new to Starbound, why should you care? You weren't there in the old days when you had to walk uphill and downhill in the snow, when the koalas were furious, and when everything was all cream and gravy.I'm not going to lie, I'm an old person too. I miss those days of temperatures being able to kill you.I miss the days of sectors and the map upgrades.I miss being able to cheese the bosses when you used their spawn items.I miss my bubble tech and my old characters.I miss when the toolbar only had one L and one R.But that's for the old people to mope about. Sure, I miss it, but that time has passed long ago. New things await ahead, and I can't complain about that. It'll never be Old Starbound, but it'll always be Starbound to me.I think if you started here, you'd find something you would enjoy. You wouldn't be dragged down by the good ol' days. You would be happy and free, like a child experiencing the world for the first time. Just sit down, relax, and try Starbound for yourself. Why let someone else tell you what the world is when you can see it for yourself?Go out there and explore Starbound. You might find something you could never imagine. There's also a race of Harambes. You can explore galaxies without pants. You can slaughter innocent people of towns you find. You can kill your friends. You can play pokemon and enslave small creatures. You can be a weeaboo fish man. You can get anime blades. You can hire hardcore penguin mercenaries to ""ice"" people. (BAHAHAHAHAHA) You can even download an absolute overabundance of mods you don't need.   YOU CAN EVEN BE A PRO GENJI LIKE YOU ALWAYS DREAMED OF WITH MODS TOO HOLY ♥♥♥♥ JUST GET THIS GAME RIGHT NOW  "

								I am currently the owner of the biggest multiplayer community of starbound.And Gosh, since this game released, developers always acted like multiplayer didn't exist, no stability, crashes, exploits, ridiculous resource usages and more make a real challenge both run a server and play the game on multiplayer. However i recommend this game. I saw pretty dumb negative reviews, from complaining that the game crashes / lags and that they wiped saves on last update.... you are on the wrong steam section then.Development isn't fast, but this developers are committed to this game, i prefer them to take their time doing it right than rush it and end up on something poor for everybody to play. Side of them made the mistake of give dates, i believe you would agree with me on that.They need to focus more on make the core features they have solid enough and not fell into the temptation of add shiny new items/gear constantly it's pretty much what i would point at the current status of starbound. But i think this game still has a lot of potential for its future, even if it releases without all that firstly intended to have on, it's said to have a post-release team to maintain updates to the game, so the 1.0 doesn't mean it ends there.So just have patience and have good hopes for this game future, it isn't abandoned. :-)			"

								I love the concept of Starbound.  The promised features, the visuals, the music, even many of the functioning mechanics.I've been cautiously optimistic despite all the setbacks and drama and, frankly, horrible decisions on Chucklefish's part.  I've been hoping that deep down they want to see Starbound completed as much as any of the players who jumped in early.  Even if jumping in early was supposedly going to speed up the 2013 release of the game that was going to happen no matter what, which not only didn't happen but that particular FAQ item was removed from the site and Chucklefish seems to think no one noticed or remembers its wording.Still, I've held onto hope.  Then I read this.""I feel 1.0 is an arbitrary release number and it’s down to us to decide what 1.0 means in the context of our game.""That's Tiy, in a recent post to Starbound's website.  Stating his philosophy of what ""1.0"" means to a game release.  First they redefine what qualifies as a beta, which is apparently the state Starbound is in right now (it's alpha, very early alpha even).  Now they're redefining what qualifies as a 1.0 release.  Because it's down to them to decide these standards, since they've earned that privilege.This is exactly what everyone in my situation has been fearing.  That with Starbound being declared a beta when it was clearly not in any way close, it would be declared released when it was finally in a beta state, if even that far (it is still not in any way close).  And now Tiy has basically announced that Chucklefish will do just that.I can no longer in good faith recommend Starbound.  I recommended the game it was supposed to be, despite it being unfinished, because I had some faith that it would be completed.  And maybe if you cram it full of mods it can approximate that.  But Chucklefish may go down as the worst developer ever, if they keep this nonsense up.  They've redefined the industry standards for what qualifies as ""alpha"" and ""beta,"" and now they're doing it again with ""1.0.""Tiy mentioned all the good reviews Starbound has received.  It shouldn't be receiving any reviews.  It's not done.  Early access impressions, maybe, but any critic who reviews Starbound as if its complete should stop writing reviews because they've failed pretty hard (especially if they won't acknowledge how that incompleteness hurts the game).  And any critic who writes an early access impression that doesn't factor in Starbound's rough history is still failing pretty hard.They've made over $20 million on this game (over $4 million just through preorders on their site), and they couldn't be bothered to put that money towards a development team that could help them fulfill their promises, or at least make up for those they've broken.  This has to be a record for poor financial management by a game developer.  They not only didn't expand their team, they defended that decision by claiming it would actually make things harder.  And in some contexts that might be true, it's probably possible to have too large of a development team, but Chucklefish wasn't and isn't close to having that kind of problem.That money is also why I don't feel bad about giving a thumbs down.  They've probably made more money on this game pre-release than most indie devs can hope for after they release their games.  They've made EA-level money, and really don't need more of it.  They don't deserve more of it.  They need to start properly using what they've already made as they explicitely promised they would (before removing that promise, anyway).I am legitimately depressed by this development.  The reason Starbound brought in this kind of money is because so many people want what was promised, and those people hyped it to other people who also want that.  This is a game people want, it's very appealing, and they paid for it in an incomplete state because that's how much they wanted it.  But they also paid for it in that state because Chucklefish promised so hard that it was going to be completed last year no matter what.  It was so going to happen, just trust them.I want the game that was supposed to be released in 2013.  Any claims that we got what we paid for because this is early access, or because it's beta (it's not), are ridiculous.  And with this talk about what 1.0 means for Starbound, it's not clear if we'll ever get what we paid for.I'll write a more positive impression or review if and when I get it.Which I really hope happens.  It's just really, really hard to believe it will.			"

								It feels as if it were released to the public much too early.  Early access is one thing but this is another.  I've had it for quite a while and it is very far from complete.  If the developers don't forget about it(they already made money off it, so they might 'forget' about it if they haven't already) wait until it is fully completed before puchasing it.  At the rate that they've made updates and the progress of these updates, it'll be a few years at the very least before they finish it.  Appreciate it from a distance, at least for now.Update:  I've only begun to touch the winter update and so far it is a much better game then it was before.  It gives a good view of what they've got in mind for the game as a whole but its still something that should've been around much sooner then this.  At least, I'm no longer stuck wondering if they've abandoned the game or not.Update:  There hasn't been much of anything added in any decent amount of time.  Just more promises and ideas thrown out from devs.  It feels like the devolper has more ideas then follow through.  If you're considering buying it, be warned that it'll probably be in ""early access"" forever or close to it.			"

build it. want a giant tree in a sea of tentacle monsters? build it. want a base at the center of the earth where only the monsters that dwell dare approach? do it man its your world(s).when you explore in this game you dont have to worry *oh man am i gonna get lost?* nope. not at all. planets loop back around giving you a sense of the finiteness of a true planet. there is a center to each planet. there are multiple biomes to each planet *though i feel the poison biome needs to back up a bit. its in every planet and the tiny pools are a pain to avoid* ive run into tentacle planets, ice planets, forrests, jungles. ive run into brain planets people, its pretty intense. mechanics? oh yeah.jumping in this game doesnt slow or speed you up but when you find a planet with low gravity it changes your perspective of movement. trust me the first time will take you for a ride. there are also things in this game called tech which of any other game would pretty much be special moves but they can open up whole new worlds for you. some techs can let you fly, some just let you move faster. some give you an awesome mechs and others give you the ability to make travel systems. fighting mechanics in this game play alot like terraria in the sense that your mouse controls where you shoot, your mouse controls the direction you face and swing and the weapons decide the type of attack you do.did i say its like terraria? oh my its such an upgrade in fighting mechanics. your weapons alone can be so many variations to speed, swing type and secondary abilities. ive played this game for a few weeks now and ive found lightning, fire, poison, knockback, explosions?! and thats just swords!! i havent even started on guns yet!guns. the backbone of range. currently there are no recepies to make guns in the game as it stands but the guns are hillariously different. your friend can find a gun that shoots bullets, pretty fast speed and all, you on the other hand may find a bazooka that shoots lazer missiles that light up the sky and explode in blue glowy goodness. each gun has the potential to have different colors to different abilities. the ammo types alone make guns rediculous. i found a gun just the other day that shot stick mines, they fire pretty fast, stuck to walls, and exploded on impact. it was rediculous. soundtrack.oh my the sound track in this game just makes you feel like you really are on an adventure. i will say that there isnt MUCH music as of yet but it is very appropriate when it does play. you get certain music at night, certain music in day. when youre underwanter the music muffles itself so you know, when youre to low in the world the music stops so you know just how deep  you are. battle music is intense, but needs more variation. considering this is only beta and they have this well orchestrated music im dying to see what they do with itnow on to dungeons.have you ever just walked around and thought *huh this place is pretty barren, i feel like the only person on this planet* starbound can do that, but with a reason. dungeons in this game can be as small as a little trapped apex hut all the way down to a subterranian military base. you can find tombs, bases, ruins, hell i found a dungeon after running into an outhouse all by itself in the field and noticed....is that a sewer down there? indeed it was explorers. packed with poo monsters and sewage blocks. i found that absolutely hillarious.npcs. as it stands now there arent that many things to do with npcs though you will find in later levels having a chef in your home will be useful since it can sometimes be hard to farm up the necessary food to make the items you need to survive. you cant sell right now but they intend to add that into the game *thank god* and make more functions for ncps. more personality, more function, more life. to put it bluntly i ran into an avian temple with friendly npcs and i climbed all the way to the top. at the top of this building there were two avian saying *im not ready for this* *i thought i had stealed myself for this* they were preparing to jump from the ledge in an act the lore explained simply as ""fly or die"" thats right. the lore in the game actualy is presented by the races that spawn. i found that little story in a book i found in a city of avians, read it, then ran into them afterwards and was astounded by the depth of these people. currently there arent really that many races cities finished but the ones that are are huge. races have their own dungeons as well which can be pretty fun to explore and understand more about them.bosses and enemies.the enemies in this game litterally are never the same. they can look similar but never the same. the fun part about this is not all monsters will come up to attack you, some are friendly. the actual fun part about this is that cute little squirrel looking creature over there will come to rip your eyes out but the giant spikey girrafe will leave you alone and go about its business. never judge monsters by their appearance, they will always surprise you and their attacks in some cases can be pretty devastating. flying monsters are a pain even with guns sometimes as they can move pretty fast and have pretty hard hitting attacks but little hp. the only thing about them that i find lacking is the attack functions compared to the variety of monsters. most will always charge, few have attacks other than that and they are usually pretty predictable.bosses. there are only a few bosses in this game and truely they dont pose much of a threat given the right amount of preperation. the problem i find with this is you spend ALL that time getting resources and then when that fight comes up its just like fighting any other monster just way bigger and harder hitting. i would like to see these bosses upgraded in some way or at least the ones implimented later add in some other features. and to my second point there arent enough boss monsters YET for the entire progression of the game. i suspect they plan to add in bosses for each teir of gear *currently stops at 10* which will be amazing but i hope they make the monsters a little harder to handle giving you a senese of progression. BUILDING!!!as many people who have played minecraft and terraria there is a certain time when you want to settle down and just build a home. fantastic idea. the building in this game is actualy very similar to that of terraria. you have foreground and background to play with. the only real gripe i have about this game so far in this aspect is you cant craft alot of materials to build. you are kinda stuck right now with cobblestone wood and sand for the most part and other terrain materials you pick up as you gather, but the other materials like castle blocks and tomb stones maybe even just some fancy bricks all come from cities and take a HUGE amount of time just to break. now i dont want to be able to make the special stones from dungeons, thats just giving me the game, but there needs to be more than you can make in the ways of craftable building blocks for a player, even if its just by schematic, im cool with this. the smal little decorations you can remake by adding to your 3d printer on your ship and to me, thats good. it keeps my crafting window clean and free of junk that i wanted to store but not see every day....

								The unique planet of Terraria beats the entire universe of Starbound in therms of fun. And yes, its an early acces. Terraria was more funny in her first stage, with only one boss to beat. Wait for sales offer or v1.0... or re-play Terraria again!On the other side, two points: Graphically is the best terraria based game in the market, and soudtrack deserves a parallel review, its awesome!

								Early progress lacks. The team may be lacking leadership or direction.I bought this game a while ago, enjoyed it enough to make my friends get it. We played it, got all the techs, beat the bosses and did a little planetary exploration. There was cool dungeons and random villages, but there was no unique loot or anything that made it original. nearly every planet has some village or dungeon, and they all had the same loot.Fast forward 10 months, I went to play and it is pretty much the same game. Except now I am experiencing more crashing issues and a slight lag/unstability. Hold off on the purchase until there is some direction and progress made, not concepts and ideas.			"

								As much as i love the idea of Starbound, in It's current state and with the current speed of development I just can't recommend it.Progression through the game is just a grind to make the next tier of weapons and armor, and then a easy bossfight to unlock the next tiers. Mining the planets is slow and unrewarding, which encourages the player to just run across the surface of the planets to find surface ores. Most of my time in the game ended up being spent on running, which got boring fast. The speed of development has been extremely slow, and several months has passed since the last stable update. And progress still seems to be slow.I don't recommend the game in it's current state, if the idea sounds interesting, check it out when it's been completed.			"

								Oh Starbound... The game of massive potential with nearly zero progress.I really want to like this game, but the developers make sure you can't. From the absolute awful forum management, to the abysmal updates, this game is going nowhere fast. It takes the development team a month to implement one update, and they are usually all the things you don't care about this early on, like Flickering Lights.The storyline is currently 1/10th complete, and it has been out for nearly two years. If that rate of progress doesn't scare you off, don't worry, it gets worse. The company has since moved offices (to a different country), expanded their team, and started over 5 new projects. I wonder where all the Kickstarter and Steam money is going?Nearly every patch will wipe your character and world. In the 50+ hours I have played, I have completed the game three times (and I wasn't rushing to end game). I strongly recommend you avoid this game. Terraria while older is still a million times better.			"

								 I liked this game and it was fun at first, I eventually stopped playing it and said ""hey ill wait for more updates and it will be even more fun to play through!"" yeh, no. It seems that the devolopers have almost completely forggoten about this game. I checked for updates but few had arisen. In the span of 4 months that I waited for these updates I got minor bug fixes and a few in game""details"".My advice dont buy this game unless its on sale or if they complete it, not to mention if they ever do. I was looking for a game like terraria with a cool mix of space and endless word exploration but what I found was a abandoned game thats general gameplay at the moment is rather bland. "

Early Access Review
								Overall thoughts: There is no denying this game is extremely fun at the start. I easily played 4 hours a day for a straight week in the single player portion of this game. The game has enormous potential but the developers seem to have cashed in and hit the door running. There used to be a steady stream of updates for the game with more content monthly, but that has completely stopped. This has left me and others I am sure with a game that is boring to play because you have done everything that can be done with the game. I don't see the point of purchasing this game in its current state. Gameplay 7.5/10 - The game runs great and the combat is smooth and easy to master. Environment/Graphics 8.5/10 - The environment is beautiful in this game. The graphics are what you would expect from a 2D game, so there is nothing to say about them really.Length 5/10 - As I stated before, the developers have essentially given up on the game. The development of the game has basically ceased to exist. They try to make you believe they are honestly working on the next patch by releasing snapshots, similar to snapshots in Minecraft. There are mods, but I was never really motivated to try mods in this game for some reason. Overall 4/10 - The environment and gameplay is still not enough to give me reason to rate this game higher. The developers silence criticism on their forums and result to bully tactics. Funny enough, they started to post development blogs on the starbound homepage on their website daily to give the impression they are working on this game. Please do not fall for it! Do not buy until the development team actually starts developing more content (good content too!) and stops bullying customers that offer good, honest criticism.			"

								Buy the game at your own risk, at this point of ""Development"" it is not worth your money, it can be fun but that will get burnt out quite fast and with the lack of updates since months and drama it keeps having this seems more of a ""Stay out until it's safe situation"".If you are wanting to reflect complaints or constructive critisism towards the game I encourage you to avoid any official Chucklefish forum, as of now the Dev and Mod team seem to be on a rampage of banning users for speaking against the game, even with fair claims such as the previous mentioned lack of updates,critisism silencing and even trolling their own community(even if it was said to be a ""joke"" quite alot of people got banned because of a Staff member joke), most topics on forums are locked as the sight of any incomming bad view of the game or developer team.The development of the game has been quite poor as of lately with alot of shady non-transparent announcements,including the FAQ changing after people paid for the game removing the date of release(that has been delayed twice since 2 years already),""publishing"" games abusing of the game's hype and crowdfunding as their way of publishing is to make the users back the projects up instead of the normal business of their company backing them up, Tiy has also been accussed repeated times of ripping Final Fantasy sprites and selling them to Reddigit(that at the time had no clue about them and almost made Terraria get sued and shut down.) then leaving Terraria to advertise himself as ""Creator of Terraria making a game"",""Terraria in Space"" which was turned into the massive hype we got for Starbound.The Modding community has also been turned down quite alot of times as the mods themselves claim to be a really complicated game to mod quite ironically for the advertised support they would give mod creators, including that alot of times mods have been included to the game and released as ""updates"" even if they weren't done by the Devs themselves trying to sugar coat the lack of real updates the game has been having since months.""Thick and Fast updates"" where never released.This should also help to see the timeline of development: http://pastebin.com/jAWKJnHyDon't believe the hype.

								A great game which can be described as Terraria in space, though the game is not as big and content-filled as Terraria.

Early Access Review
								Short Version: A pile of wasted potential and shattered promises. A thoughtlessly-designed mess of features that all look great on screenshots but fall very short in execution. While the hope with Early Access titles is that they will be improved and the issues will be fixed, I have no hopes for this happening. Despite the claim of ""thick and fast"" updates, the last meaningful one was six months ago. To go into detail: Despite being a sci-fi title, most of your weapons will be swords or hammers. There are guns, but they're rare and impotent. If you want a mobile light source you can craft a candle-lantern-on-a-stick, rather than a shoulder-mounted LED or similar. These are examples of things that end up making the setting feel more like a fantasy setting with spaceships arbitrarily tacked on.Exploration, which should be the game's strong point, is ruined by the sheer vastness of the randomly generated planets, the tier system, and the coordinates system. Why should I build a house on this planet, over the one next to it? Why should I build a house on this tier-2 planet which only has iron on it, when I can wait and build it on a tier-5 planet with better materials? Why even explore at all, when I could just go on the forums and look up the coordinates of a planet with amazing weapons?Combat is weak, and floaty. Can best be described as two people on a trampoline hitting each other with pool noodles. Progression consists of mining ore (with a pickaxe, of course. What do you think this is, the future??) to get armor and weapons. When you first enter a new tier, enemies will be killing you in only a few hits. When you get the armor of that tier, you become very resistant to their attacks. It results in a game where you're never properly challenged: You are either fleeing helplessly from the sky demons, or crushing them in one hit.On top of all of this, the game is bizarrely resource-intensive for a 2d platformer. I have a fairly powerful system capable of playing full 3d games (Crysis 2, Max Payne 3), yet I have gotten consistently poor framerate.			"

								Games like Starbound are why I will never purchase an Early Access Game ever again. The developers did not deliver on their promises, have released little to no recent updates, and have seemingly just up and abandoned the game. I should have just set my $45.00 on fire because that would have at least provided me with a small amount of warmth for a short period of time; spending it on Starbound was a foolish mistake. Pre-ordering the Gold Tier, and giving these scammers even more money, was an especially foolish mistake.Do not buy Starbound. It's already like a year, if not moreso, behind schedule with no signs that the game will ever be finished. What the developers promised sounded pretty good but it's very apparent that they now have no interest in following through on those promises.Do not buy Starbound; it's a waste of money. I cannot stress that enough: do NOT buy Starbound.			"

								Had high hopes for the game when I first saw it. Played it the first time around and it was hard as ♥♥♥♥. Mobs would 2 shot you, you had to worry about freezing to death at night and on cold planets, hunger etc. But with recent updates the game is too casual 4 me. They give you an OP starting weapon, mobs are weak as ♥♥♥♥, the only thing that ever kills you is the environment. Even the bosses are easy. Planet temperatures are a useless gimmick since you get the suit for it anyway. You no longer starve since the hunger feature was removed and you can no longer freeze to death at night.Too linear gameplay. They guide you through a questline along with boring filler sidequests. The way you obtain gear is too linear also. The only things worth a ♥♥♥♥ that you find in the surprisingly bland planets are cosmetic items. All the weapons and armor you find are never as good as what you can craft.Building is useless because your ship provides everything you need.Devs only ever add ♥♥♥♥ing furniture in updates.Has absolutely no replay value at all.Would not buy again.Save yourself $5 and pick up Terraria instead.

Early Access Review
								I first bought this game when it became available. I played around 41 hours then. Recently came back and have put in about 44 hours now.Back when the game first came out, it involved many of the survival aspects that other games had. Such as hunger, being too hot/cold, certain creatures coming out at night, and so forth. To progress, you would mine down into the ground of the planet, gather materials you needed to craft a certain object, and summon a boss with said object which would give you an item to progress to the next ""tier"". The next tier would provide you with better crafting options in armor and weapons, which would require higher tiered ore, which in turn would usually require going to a more dangerous planet. All of this involved the survival mechanics as well. Dig too far down into a planet, and it would become so cold that it'd begin to affect you, so you may need heat to survive. If you died, you lose all your items... I think. It's been so lnog since I played back then.Now things have changed. Currently there are three difficulty levels. Casual, you lose 30% of your currency when you die, called pixels. That's it. The next up in difficulty makes you drop all your items when death comes for you. Then the last, Hardcore, makes it so that once you die... your character stays dead. Keep in mind, that many of the survival aspects were removed. You no longer get hungry, food slowly regens hp when eaten. There is no longer a hot/cold gauge when mining down into the depths. Day/Night doesn't matter creature wise, aside from being harder to see without sufficient light sources.Keep in mind, that the Devs have stated that the survival aspects will be returning in a ""Survival"" difficulty mode.Progression is now different. I hear they are going to change it further, but for now I prefer it this way instead of the old way. Instead of building an item to summon a boss. (And cheese the boss, by simply placing dirt in a way that makes you untouchable while being able to kill it), you are now given a mission in some form. These missions will bring you to a dungeon that's preset, and you aren't able to simply mine and tunnel your way through them. At the end of the mission, you fight a boss, and are usually given knowledge of some kind. Usually to reach the next tier of technology. Before any of this happens, of course, you have to repair your ship using the resources from the first planet you are stranded on. This serves as a way to ease someone who may have never played into the game, as it explains some of the mechanics through quests.Ther are some other things you can currently do. Like creating your own village/city and populating it with tenants, who will pay you with rent in some fashion. They also provide randomly generated quests, which at least gives something to do once you hit the final tier level... aside from ransacking outposts for materials and objects you want in order to expand your colony. Which reminds me, the ""mini-dungeons"" can't be ransacked and mined apart until you fight through their guards/puzzles and destroy the shield generator that's protecting it. This can add some variety when jumping around planets and searching for things you may want.In closing, I've read about the planned changes coming up in the release of Starbound with version 1.0. I'm honestly excited for it. Since the full story is going to be available, I'm probably going to delete my older character and start fresh. I hope you have as much fun in the stars as I have! Remember, the adventure is what you make of it.			"

								3 years ago, heard a rumour of Terraria meets Borderlands in space type game. Devoured all the lovely material on the Chucklefish website. Got very excited. Very pretty roadmap released - game looks almost finished! Most things on there are at 90 percent. Woohoo! Early access, of course I will buy this game ahead of release, it promises to be amazing. Fast forward to release of beta.What a tragic waste of time. It's like someone modded Terraria badly. Nothing in terms of functionality is new, everything that was promised is missing and everything that is there is very very dull. Joylessly mash through the tech tiers. Wish I was playing Terraria.Weeks pass, no sign of updates. Voicing concerns on forums is met by a cloud of Chucklefish interns beratting you for asking when the thing you have paid for might be ready. The beta gets renamed. Apparently the beta was never a beta in the first place, it was an alpha. Chucklefish start implementing mods supplied by people desperate to make the game interesting. None make it to the actual playable game as it is never updated.Woefully and bitterly I resign to never pay for early access again. Chucklefish start working on other titles. Cobwebs start to grow over an angry dwindling community who had hoped for so much more.Let's not get fooled again.			"

								It's fun with friends, but after 40+ hours of gameplay it's really not all that memorable in its present state. Even for early access, the game itself is really buggy. There's no reason to ever set up a homebase on any planet since you're constantly moving around (the only really ""permanent"" location is your ship), really reducing how fun the building is. In addition, the whole game (even late game) just feels like a search for more fuel for your ship. This was really over-hyped and not worth it.The devs rarely, if ever, communicate with the players. Updates have virtually ceased.There is no reason to buy this game in the state it's in, and I'm not at all optimistic about its future. Terraria is still vastly better in every aspect.			"

								When you first start playing, I must admit it's pretty fun, and the possibilities seems endless, but you'll soon discover that the immense amount of pixel grinding and ore mining is too much to enjoy. On top of that, at a certain point the game stops giving you objectives, and simply throws you out into the worlds with nothing but some simple weapons and a handful of resources. While I don't want to be babysat through the entire game, I was barely able to begin to understand how everything worked before I was put completely on my own. It took internet research to discover that the next boss was acquired through the robotic crafting table, which previously was just some thing that I saw in the menus.Overall, I wouldn't recommend the game like it is. Should Chucklefish make the new-player experience much better, I may consider jumping in. While I say this, I was never able to play this game with friends, even with simple instructions on how to set up a 'server' for the game. It simply never worked. This is one of those games that you should buy if you can catch it for a couple of dollars on sale, and that's only if you feel confident that you will be able to understand the game with no help.

								I pre-ordered this game for both me and a good friend.  I was so excited when I was reading up on it.  I was excited when I played it with my friends.  I was excited for great content updates to come out.And now I'm just incredibly disappointed.  Those big updates? Didn't come.  Features that the devs said they were going to put in? Not there. My good friend told me that the devs are full of ♥♥♥♥, but I said they just needed time.  I said that a good long time ago.  It's July 2014 now and this game is still just not going anywhere, and I feel a little bit like a dumbass for believing in them.On top of that, the mods of both Starbound steam discussion forum and the official forum seem to be a bunch of butthurt 14 year old kids who can't stomach the fact that they deserve all the negativity they're getting.  Censoring their community is their way of coping.Save yourself the disappointment.  Just get Terraria.			"

								The game is missing almost all of the promised features, so it's nowhere near beta. This is an alpha release advertised as a beta to increase sales. After months without any updates, and no significant updates at all since release, they're finally overhauling the game by making it more gated and linear than ever. Updates were still promised to be ""thick and fast"" until a month or two ago.Fans will tell you ""It's just in early access!"" to excuse the detestable behavior of the developers, which has been to lie. Two of the screenshots on this very store page are from mock-ups; the art assets exist but are unavailable. Notably, the depiction of an underwater Hylotl city simply does not exist, because, almost a year since release, the Hylotl race still does not have any cities or villages. This game really shouldn't be allowed on Steam, since it uses fake screenshots to advertise itself even on the store page. Earlier versions of the website also featured hand-made mock-ups instead of screenshots, to deceive readers into thinking the game was farther along than it really is.The procedurally generated enemies are boring to fight and the procedurally generated weapons are boring to find. Features announced as complete on the blog years ago, like the frozen ocean biome and the complex weapon generation system, are nowhere to be found, either having been simply removed during development or outright lied about. A system listed as ""50% finished"" on the Starbound Roadmap in December 2013 was only just being initially prototyped in September.This game is a mess, and the developers are dishonest fools who do their best to censor all dissent. Don't give them any more money.			"

								I hate typing bad reviews but I didn't find much enjoyment playing this game, I know it's an early access but compared to others i think it lacks certian things that would have made it a better game in my opinion. Maybe in beta or full-release it would have the sufficent features and tweeks so that I may find it fun, but for now it hasn't.You're welcome to try it out but I think it's not the best game on my pc by a long shot.Not Recommended!

								Alright. Do not buy this game. This game is far from complete and if you did play it you would get bored of it really quickly. The only reason I have a good amount of hours on it is because of all the hype this game had when it released. Alot of people think that the devs abandoned this game. Well they didnt. If you go to there website they have a started to update it a ton the past few weeks. So just wait a few months or a year and I bet this game well be much better and be what its suppossed to be.

								Don't pay for an incomplete game.So many features were promised, as was a 2012 release. We have recieved very few of these features and the game still remains in beta (but admittedly it feels more like an alpha, due to how unplayable it is).Simply put, buying this game is like buying a pizza base and eating it uncooked with any toppings or sauce, but halfway through snacking upon the base, Chucklefish arrives and throws ice cream toppings in your face.Don't buy it.

								This game is not done. It is far from done. And it's not being updated. It hasn't received an update in half a year now. At most, it's gotten something cosmetic, but that's it. But that's still not all. When originally advertised for its closing in to early access release, the game was ""almost done.""Here's what you can do in Starbound currently: explore planets and find out how empty they are, dig up ore to make armor to go to new tiers of planets which are equally empty and dead, fight bosses that only have one attack each or are just generic enemies and are visually totally uninspired, enjoy the quality damage balancing as you're one shot in the highest tier armor by enemies on the final tier of planets, admire the diversity of Pokemon styled enemies that only run at you or jump at you and rarely stop moving entirely to try and shoot something at you.If Chucklefish asks to publish your game, tell them no. Many other games have and are now just seen as Chucklefish games, dev names lost in a limbo often.Avoid this game at all costs. Get a refund on your card if you've bought this by mistake if Steam won't give you a refund. This game is a confirmed scam and has been reported for fraud multiple times now.			"

								Judging the game on it's own merits and not bringing the developer's... Less than perfect PR and habits of only updating the broken Nightlies branch, I'm finding it hard to reccomend on it's own.Combat is boring, gameplay can pretty much be summed up with: Start on planet, mine for hours, realize you need pixels, kill monsters, get good armor and weapons, fight boss, go to new planet, realize you're just as weak as you were at the beginning, rinse and repeat. Weapons don't feel different unless you get a legendary, and even those are often just retextured versions of another. One legendary shoots bubbles when swung, another shoots poison. The only reason I have so much time on this game is because I'm a massochist and I tried to soak everything I could out of the game. Its fun factor pretty much only comes from shooting your way across the galaxy, but that also takes coal, so have fun digging more for those resources. From what the devs are saying, 1.0 will be much better. If you want to buy the game, do it then, or whenever the devs feel like actually updating this game like they promised on the store page with ""Thick and fast updates"".			"

												I bought this game when it was originally released on Steam. I gave it some time, and understood that being Early Access it would feel incomplete. I'm no programmer, never done anything of this sort, but after 11 months I was expecting a lot more content and polish. I might recommend this game eventually, but based on the progress they've been making that may not be until next decade.			"

												This game is essentially a really cool lego set with a rather poor story and some cool dungeons which you need to grind boring crap for hours to actually do. Many of the items that actually made it into the game are useless...Hoverbikes are practical, but awful. Boats.... why would you ever want one? There don't appear to be any oceans to traverse other than the ones on ocean planets. And on those everything worthwhile is underwater. By the time you can afford either you'll probably be sick of the game.Farming is too tedious and nothing can be automated. There's a cool wiring system, but not a lot useful you can actually do with it. Colonies are simply player made sources of the same crappy fetch and escort quests that non-player villages can do. Colonists won't farm for you.Your crew are more of a pain than a help and will constantly block crafting stations. This looks like an excellent game engine upon which a great game could be made using mods; but by itself it really isn't a great game. It's certainly not what we were sold in the kickstarter nor does it live up to the promise of what was in beta.			"

								Forum mods and game devs that dish out the hate, but can't take criticism. I've never been banned anywhere, ever, in my entire internet life--but I've been banned on the Chucklefish website, Starbound Reddit sub, and the Starbound forum here.Tens of millions of dollars in preorders for a 2D game, yet it's been getting worked on for over three years and is still hilariously feature-incomplete. If you're looking for a cheap knockoff of Terraria (with FAR less features), and a devloper base that takes your money and treats you like garbage, this is absolutely the game for you.And just a heads up, the massive Starbound play times you're seeing on most peoples' accounts is actually due to a bug with the game not completely closing down. The devs have known about the bug for a while, but have conveniently forgone trying to fix it...for obvious reasons.Three years for a cheap knockoff of a popular 2D game.Three.Years. YEARS.			"

								Starbound is pretty much the poster child for why I won't buy any Early Access games ever again. Stated as almost complete when it was first released the devs pushed out some big updates shortly afterwards ( like changing how the planet progression very drastically) so you were all like, 'wow, they seem to be able to change things pretty quickly!'. Then they decided to go underground for the next 6 months to a year. Imagine my shock when I came back to the game a year later and the promised ship upgrade system they were tweeting about ages ago still wasn't in.The game was released as a Very feature incomplete Alpha, and since then the devs seem to have no idea what they want the game to be. They seem to be randomly throwing ideas at the wall and Years later this game still isn't at a 1.0 state. Man what a scam.Even if this game does leave Early Access I'd stay far away. The Devs seem incompetent so I wouldn't expect anything like Terraria or Don't Starves ( now There's an EA game done right) post-release support. IMHO, stay away from Starbound and stay leary of any game Chuckfish developes in the future.			"

Early Access Review
								Hmmm what to say about starbound, well first off i'm going to make this clear. I don't mean in any way to insult the developers of this game, this review will only state my honest opinion about that game at  it's current state Now thats out of the way it's time to begin.This next part is kind of first experice and first thoughts, skip it if you want to get to my opinion as of nowSo, starbound, an early access game that I thought of as being ""Terraria in space."" I had played terraria a lot with friends before buying this game and loved terraria, so I assumed that this would be the next terraria. A friend of mine had bought the game and I had watched him play it a bit, everything looked awesome, from the tools he had to the things he did, I was convinced. I bought this game at its full price at the time, which was 15 dollars and started to install and play. The gameplay seemed odd and clunky and unfinished, but i convinced myself it was fine and played on with my friends. I then put the game down for probably 4 months. I finally started playing again around may.Ok now on to my opinion nowI came back to the game thinking it would be completely different in terms of new content, being away from and still growing game for 4 month you would expect that. I found the game nearly identical to how it last was, it felt odd and unfinished. Me and another friend had the same feeling towards the game and compared it to terraria. Now terraria has a fun, not very complicated feel to it, you can get into the game in minutes. Now starbound on the other hand I had a hard time getting used to, I knew about the game and how to play, just playing it wasn't enjoyable.I'm not sure how to explain it but it just was not fun to play at its current state, it was odd, seemingly unfinished and just overall weird. Because of that I can not recommend this game at its current state.Edit: So I wanna add some things that I forgot. This game has some potential, If we get updates more and with more content this game could live up to its ""Terraria in space"" image. I think this game could be salvaged but I feel due to the amount of negetive reviews, they have lost most of their current player base, unless it is slavaged, they lost me as well.			"

								My review is not completely negative, but for how much it costs it doesn't seem worth it..tl;dr - it's ok but seems like same content is repackaged in many different shapes without adding to game mechanics and complexity thus making game less interesting and fun :(Game is smooth for a beta.. but after playing for some time it gets boring..It seems like it's missing some fun elements..It would be cool if they added more machines for things like automatic mining and just to make bases more complex and fun to have.. We need something more complicated to craft.. Also adding maybe enemy waves that attack your base at some points and build more on that concept..Enemies seem a bit dull.. Combat gets too repetitive etc..Make it more important to have a main base, maybe have some setups that can give you abilities or something from your main base if you keep them powered..Make farming better, maybe animal herding etc (alien crossbreeding things like that :) )Maybe make it so you can have production facilities on some planets, that would be nice..I really hope they make this game more interesting..All in all it's an ok game, but it promised to be a very fun game with elements of games like minecraft, terraria etc..but improved and made more interesting, but at the end it's a nice looking (visually) and kinda boring game with little innovation..My view might change if they give us a nice big interesting update..EDIT: I have played this game for many hours because some of my friends bought it so it was more fun playing together.. also we added many mods that improve gameplay, add missions, quests, items etc.. but if we are talking about vanilla (unmodded version) then the text I wrote is still a very honest opinion.. Next update does promise huge improvments, but come on devs.. we have been waiting many months and will wait maybe a whole year until we get it.. I also don't like the fact that chuclefish and some employees were working on some other crappy games, I know they say they are only working on Starbound, but I find that a bit hard to believe.. I think they used the money aquired for Starbound to pay additional salaries, bonuses or whatever to their employees and team to make other smaller games.. (u know like the way that unprofit organizations make their salaries huge and take money from donations, but still say the company doesn't have profit, which is true, but doesn't mean they don't take any of the money you donated and put it in their own pockets..)

								A couple months ago I gave Starbound a thumb up.... can't do that anymore. The updates that were talked about never came and the game has little to no point to it. They have plenty excuses like  "" Moving "" the bussiness to a new location.... who does that right in the middle of designing the bulk of a game? There was supposed to be paths to follow, like being a builder or a farmer or adventurer. Ship upgrading and all kinds of stuff that would really complete this game. Instead they have worked on revamping the entire combat system for like the last 3 months... steam player base has went from like 20,000 concert player to 2,000. That should have been a really go sign that things are not moving along AT ALL.			"

Product received for free
												[EDIT; READ BEFORE COMMENTING ABOUT MY PLAY TIME] People are pointing out how I've spent 250 hours in this game, and therefore don't have the right to not recommend it. Most of those hours were spent in the pre-release builds, back in early access. Post-1.0, those hours were spent in a heavily modded version of the game, with me avoiding vanilla content because it just wasn't fun to me at all. I'm reviewing the game solely based on my experience with it in its current vanilla form. Right now, as the game stands, I do not recommend it. It is a completely different game from what it used to be. It is not the same game I poured 200+ hours into. [/done]I've followed the development of this game for a very long time. A friend bought me this game as a gift a long time ago, around the time the game was supposed to have been finished. I have played and enjoyed this game. I played the nightly unstable updates back in the day, I was there when we had nightly character wipes, and I watched this game grow and change. There have been some steps forward, but some steps back too. There are merits to this game, and it's not bad if you enjoy this game at all, but there are also many reasons why you should not buy this game at full price. I had high hopes for this game, but at the end of the day, I can't help but feel like they rushed towards a full release just because people were getting angry that it was taking way longer than they had initially said.If you want to understand why I feel this way, please keep reading. If you want to discuss with me, please remain civil. I don't want to cultivate a hostile environment. I'd love to hear everyone's thoughts. Anyway, on with the review, I guess.OH ALSO THIS CONTAINS SPOILERS FOR THE PLOT SO PLEASE TURN AWAY IF YOU DON'T WANT THAT SPOILEDI've put about 300 hours into this game, if you combine my hours here with the hours put in the separate unstable release. I have played and enjoyed this game, but most of my enjoyment has come from using various mods to enrich my experience. That isn't good. I have tried and tried to go back to vanilla, to no avail. It isn't captivating or interesting for me at all.The main thing that's wrong with Starbound starts with the storyline. It's... generic and lacking. Nothing you do in regards to the storyline actually affects the universe in a meaningful way. In the beginning, the giant tentacle monster attacks the Protectorate. You flee. You're a sole survivor. But you never see the tentacle monster again until you hit certain points in the story missions. That's... a problem. If this malevolent space god is so hellbent on destruction, shouldn't you see more of it? Shouldn't the destruction of the Protectorate be the beginning? You should be attacked by minions of this thing. You should see invasions, you should see people fending these monsters off from their home colonies. You should see places destroyed and ravaged and taken over by tentacles. But you don't, really. In that regard, there's no real need to build colonies and defend them. There's nothing actually happening in the universe.While we're talking about the story, let's just say for the record that I do not like the story. They did away with the different racial origin stories and gave us Generic Starfleet. They didn't give us a chance to bond with the characters, get to know the organization, or familiarize ourselves with any of it. They just destroyed it all within the first five minutes of gameplay and expected us to care without giving us a real reason to care.In the description of the game they tell you that you can forego the story and just... colonize planets...? For what? Why? your options are to either follow a very narrow storyline without choices, or just aimlessly populate planets? What about giving us different factions to join, different starting scenarios, invasions, raids, an ability to gain reputation among people. Hell, maybe we could even join a cult whose aim is to serve the tentacle monster and spread its minions to other planets? There are a lot of possibilities here, but instead we get a very narrow storyline in a game that claims to be about choice. Why not, after so many years of development, give us more than one storyline to follow? Why just the one?It doesn't make any sense. You do not create your own story. You get forced into a storyline that you can't part from until after you fix your ship (which I hate because, like so many others, I have played that first ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ mission more than 50 times without exaggeration). And then afterwards you can go on and do what you want, but... y'know. There's nothing to do. It's just a vast lonely universe that has... a lot of stuff in it, but not much to /do/ with it.It has little substance. Abundance does not equate to substance.Another problem I have is with what happens after you escape the Protectorate. This might be a nitpick, but it would really go a long way in making the universe feel less cold and lonely. You're orbiting a planet that just happens to have a massive ancient gate on it...? Why not just mine to create parts to repair the communication system on your ship so you can send out a distress signal? Then someone comes along, tows you to the nearest civilization, and then you can find a way to pay for ship repairs? Why is it that we instead orbit a planet that's mostly barren, with the exception of a mine and some campers, with a Big Plot Device that happens to be sitting not too far from you. Why does it have to be so lonely? And so forced? Since a main focus of the game is building, why not have the player themselves create an outpost? With the option of rebuilding it in the Protectorate's image? Or theming it after another possible faction?I don't understand why you're the only person to survive the Protectorate attack, and I don't understand why you're TOLD the plot instead of being allowed to discover it through your own exploration. I don't understand why the people you pick up from the story missions just sit around at the Outpost instead of being crew members on your ship. I don't understand why the Plot Device Gate on the outpost is even on the outpost. Why not have it at one fixed point in the universe, that you find the co-ords for and eventually teleport to? Why not have the ruins be sprawling, vast, packed full of lore, maybe thick with the presence of the alien monster that destroyed everyone you loved and held dear? Why is everything just spoon-fed to you without any REAL need to explore?Also, all of the planets look the same. There's almost no variance. There aren't enough random structures to make planets fun to explore. Some of the structures are placed in places that don't make any sense. I miss the old planet generation where you'd get extremely crazy and weird variance.I'm sad about the lost potential of this game. I could go on for days about all of the problems I have with the way development has gone. I desperately want to love this game again, but I can't. It still feels unfinished even though it's said to be a full release. It's not in early access, but it feels like it is. I don't recommend this game at full price. I recommend this game for about $5. $10 is pushing it. $15 is just way over the line.I think Chucklefish has a great template here for a good game, but holy crap they have a lot of work to do before this game actually provides the adventure that it boasts about. For now, I'll just stick to heavily modded SB til the developers make progress and actually flesh out their skeleton. Or I'll just go play a game that has a more cohesive and satisfying experience.I really wanted to love this game. I used to be an apologist. I used to make excuses for the state of the game, but... yeah. No. I cannot recommend this game. I'm sorry.			"

Early Access Review
								TL;DRCrafting Variety- BBase Constuction- BExploration- DCombat- FFor and older version: Really enjoyed the breif period of updates, but here we are 2 months after the devs promised almost daily updates and all is quiet. Since that point this game has stalled out, and random exploration is only so rewarding when the worlds lack character. Terraria managed to keep things feeling fresh even after hundreds of hours of playtime, but after spending a dozen hours hopping from planet to planet it feels like the game is really lacking in content. Pass on this one for nowUpdate: Nearly a full year later they finally update the game as promised, not the daily updates they promised mind you, but a significant update none the less. Unfortunaly it still feels devoid of soul, which i personally blame on the randomly generated enemies and lack of variety per world, as in, each individual world dosent have more then 5 or 6 different species, and almost all of them just drop meat. exploration per planet is pretty bland too, sure there a few temples, labs and the like, but most of the worlds just seem empty. Caves are uninteresting, the core of the planets are devoid of anything but some special ores and most planet surfaces are just one or two rather uninspired biomes. Sure there are funky trees and lots of species specific furniture to collect, but it just dosent connect with me for some reason. Combat is the worst, as it feels like there is really only a couple variations in creature abilities, and none of them particularly interesting. I really want to like this game, but as it stands its just enough to keep me checking back for updates and improvements.			"

Also, devs barely update it (nightly builds dont count because most of the time they are unplayable) and have been really shady lately (firing a lot of the staff and forcing the others to move into ONE HOUSE TOGETHER)Overall, given the amount of hype this game generated, not impressed.

												Hi guys! HappyDays here looking at Starbound 1.0!

Having played Starbound prior to the full release I was excited to see what the developers had changed moving in to a full version 1.0 release.Initial impressions seem positive, movement and combat seem more dynamic. The intro is enjoyable with a few hidden items along the way. The developers have introduced an enemy the player must hunt throughout their adventure which is a nice addition!One big thing I immediately noticed is that the initial healing item is now 'salve' instead of 'bandages.' I LOVE THIS as it gives a slower heal rate and makes combat more tactical rather than 'tank hits and spam bandages for massive healing. Salve heals 50hp over 10 seconds which means you cannot simply tank groups of enemies early on.I will update this review as I explore more of the content but initial impressions seem great!			"

												I have to say, I'm amazed with Starbound.I bought it some years ago just out of duty because I started playing on an old version downloaded from somewhere. Let me clarify that the reason for me to do it was because at the time Chucklefish removed the hunger and environmental hazard factor from the game, which are two major points that would drive me towards a game, but I'm a guy of principles who buys the games he downloads and happens to like. The art was great, but the game heavily lacked direction, feeling a lot like a sci-fi terraria, hugely directionless where you just plopped on a planet, built a nice house, and ransacked other species for decor items and maybe some weapons. I was not impressed.Recently I decided to give it a try if anything because I  owned the game and hadn't taken a look at it since two years ago. And honestly, the game is great now. Not only there's a story, but there is a great sense of progression through quests aimed at improving your character, tech to unlock, and a plot that drives you to explore and push onward.The art is gorgeous, and now that there is a reason to explore the different planets meeting the gajillion of pokémon scattered throughout the game is both exciting and fun. The survival elements are back and although I can see why they took them out of the game, feeling like more of a nuisance than anything involving (there's food everywhere and you'll have no problem staying fed), the element of preparedness and routine gives another dimension to just going down every hole you'll see.The objectives are distinct, and the exploration is tense since you'll have to double back from whatever hole on the ground you dove into and death means losing a huge swathe of items. A lot of the equipment you'll find is more aesthetic than anything, and weapons are kinda meh, but it's super satisfying when you find that weapon combo that works. Action bars are somewhat small but you can switch between two bars, making the overall hotkey capacity alright. The techs are fun and meaningful, getting a morphball or a double jump that greatly helps with exploration, and weapon abilities are varied and useful most of the time.The only problems I really have with the game is that the controls could be a bit better for me, like for instance when jumping down a platform you'll keep on going down subsequent ones until you release the ""down"" button, making it possible to hurt or even kill yourself, or that double tapping in a direction can trigger Dash and send you careening down a hole to your demise. Sometimes you'll also find yourself in some really hard to win combat scenarios, but taking it slowly will help with that so it's not too bad.Overall though, I think it's  a great game and that it has improved leaps and bounds from its SEA phase. The sense of progression is tangible, the settlements are fun, the exploration is intense and the story is nicely told in great pixel art scenes. From an aimless Terraria in space to a proper metroidvania, Starbound has propelled itself to the stars of my library.9/10.			"

								Starbound starts off feeling like it's going to be a great experience when you finish your tutorials and beam down to a planet to explore/build/fight Pokemon. An hour in and you're feeling pretty good about your decision to buy the game, you're feeling like this is a solid experience. A couple hours later, you've explored and seen quite a bit. Maybe you've built yourself a shantytown or a castle. However, you have noticed that the game can sometimes be very plain. Eventually, the idea that the game is rather plain becomes so persuasive that you feel you need to say so or recommend a great idea for new content on the forums. There is only a short time now before you realize why Starbound has so many negative reviews. Enter Chucklefish, the developers of Starbound, some of them came from an optimistic place like Terraria and even more of these devs came from parts unknown. At first we wanted to give Chucklefish our money for Starbound, we even practically threw it at them and told them to shutup and take it. They were more than happy to take our money from us, as any company would probably be.Days went by, months went by, we're very close to a year now, less than a month at the time of this review. There have been no updates to the game. Oh but wait, there are ""nightly builds"" which tout daily updates to the game, what you get when you opt into beta nightly builds is a mess that crashes so often that it should be a new meme. There are also Devblogs that advertise things that have already been in the game since it was added to Steam as something new they're adding to nightly builds. That's right, they're pretending old content is new content.I wanted Starbound to succeed, I pre-ordered it and couldn't wait for all the rewards with pre-order. We were promised a new class and fossils you could dig up, we still don't have the pre-order rewards after all this time. If you go to the official website you may see a different tale, but I assure you that's only because they delete any bit of criticism from the site, no matter how honest it is. The developers of Starbound also have a hallowed history of flaming and insulting customers they disagreed with. Couple all of this with what they're doing now (advertising old things in the game as new) and you're left feeling that Chucklefish is just a gang of con artists.I'm sorry my review is like this, but it's the truth. You would do well to stay away from this game until the developers in Chucklefish can be mature enough to deliver what they promised with no drama. If they don't deliver what they promised in this game, I will be buying nothing from them in the future. I might even do that anyways to make an example that it's not okay to do the things they did to your customers.			"

								The game appears solid from the get-go but quickly becomes very repetitive and stale.Added to that, there's virtually NO updates for this game. The makers promised weekly, even daily, content updates but I haven't had an update for a month (or more). Atleast, not any updates that change or add anything.This is a half-finished game with empty promises and after a good 5hours you're decked in max tier with maximum items.			"

								Bought this game as soon as it was possible to buy it. We were promised a definite release in 2013 as the game was apparently already 90% done!Right now the devs are working at the game, but it seems like they keep on remaking the base of the game, changing things that were 6 months old, reimagining the game every month. If it continues like this this game will stay stuck in limbo never to be finished.Be weary of early access games, and with that in mind i definetly cant reccomend this one, i had way more fun with terraria and even tough terraria is already a finished game they are still adding a lot more content than this game is getting.

								Why do you still have faith in this game? No really, why? Ever since the winter update, Chucklefish thinks that slapping on a bunch of unnecessary quests and systems counts as an ""update"" when in reality, it degrades the game. Tell me, who wants to do a bunch of pointless quests in order to actually play the game? Nobody. Why exactly do you want to make a colony? For pixels? Because you're honestly better off grinding for them. The winter update two years ago was the last step in the right direction for Starbound, because, shockingly, CF was trying to make an open universe sandbox game rather than some ungodly horrid hybrid of random features just stapled onto each other so CF can say ""We're making vidya gaems!""

								***New info added based on ""Winter Update"" patch towards bottom*** This game and company is the perfect example of why we should all stop tossing our money away on the early access explosion.Seriously. Remember the days when we all purchased games that were released buggy, broken, and incomplete? Most of us complained. Some of us played the games anyways. Very few of us were not disappointed by the garbage we purchased.This game cured me of purchasing early access promises forever.While the game is playable and fun for a while, you really do get the feeling its over ambitious and will never be what you hoped for. I got my money out of it, but the disappointing updates tarnished that mild entertainment.Its a fanboy title, and don't let their message boards suck you in.Buy something complete and be warned very few developers of this stuff will give you quality titles like Terraria, SPAZ, and Dungeons of Dredmor.***  ""Winter Update""  addendum ***More stuff, fixes, but still bland. Read on.First I want to say I really want to like this game, but honestly, I can no longer stand the poor design choices and the incompetence of the people behind this company. They also like to delete posts created by people with legitiment complaints.The patch didn't change the core problem with this game. It has a incredibly large star map that does nothing to add to the gameplay. There is so little incentive to explore this massive universe, because each system has very little to offer. You seen one desert planet, you have seen them all. None of them feel unique. They are only different at a glance.The progression is also borked beyond all recognition. Progression is only artificial. Its just another color of ore to make a slight variant on the armor you just had. The weapons end up being the same, just diferent colors and graphics.Gameplay consists of landing on a planet, digging for the next ore, and then going to the next planet. Thats it. There are some minor adjustments to your equipment. For example, a tech that allows you to breathe on a planet without an atmosphere. Exciting as this all may sound, the ""yippee factor"" then dies off when you meet the next form of alien life that is pretty much the same as the last boring group of aliens you shot on the previous world.The inexplicable change to the star map baffles me on why this change was implimented. Sure, you want progression. But now, it made each star system bland. Why? Because there are few planet types in each system now. Why someone thought this was a wonderful idea seriously should question his own ability to make good decisions when it comes to game design.You can now have a ""Frozen"" star with eight ""Frozen"" planets in the system. There is also ""Eccentric"" stars, which is a new one on me that makes little sense. ""Radioactive"" stars are now present, which, well, is what stars are. Almost forgot the ""Firey"" star type. Gee. Imagine that...a star that is on fire. Did it really take a whole year to come up with these names and overall silly idea?The new food system is also a joke. Its got a ton of recipes, but they are all the same. This is the central theme to Starbound. That theme is ""mindless variety of tiny variations."" The buffs the food gives you are minor, and they don't last long. What makes it worse is that you can't even eat more food to replace the short buff because of a poorly implemented timer.I could go on and on about how poor and disappointing this title is for as long is it would take to discover every unremarkable planet in this botched attempt to create a universe.The ""Winter Update"" is just a mish mash of stuff thrown together in an attempt to possibly bring in more unearned income. Believe what you want, but this game is lacking quality design people.I will add on this this review when the next update comes along, which will probably be next winter.			"

It has potential, but as of now, it sometimes feels a bit barebones and just broken.

								So many things wrong with this and I don't even mean the actual game.- No actual updates to a game that is effectively in alpha and should see changes to its core frequently considering in how rough of a state even the engine is- The so-called ""Nightlies"", unstable versions of the most current code made available every evening, are either viewed as updates or not, depending on what is more convenient for the person that is talking to the community- Developers stated multiple times that anything currently in is just a placeholder when it was first released as an early acces game, yet none of the promised features have even been talked about again since then- Merely having the launcher (which serves no actual purpose) open counts as ""playing"" the game, thus resulting in plenty of inflated game times (I have not even spent half of the time Steam says I've spent on this game actually ingame and at least half of the actual time spent was me testing simple item modifications)- Moderators on the official forums, Reddit and Steam have engage multiple times in censoring of criticism, both regarding the behavior of developers and community managers towards the community as well as the current state of the game and the direction it is heading (if it even is going anywhere at this point)- Quite a lot of money was spent on trying to relocate everyone to a new office in London, which would be a good thing if it was even remotely required to have all your employees in the same location for a completely digital product. This move came with a multitude of problems, as not only was important equipment stuck on a ship(!) in the middle of the ocean for quite some time, but also the only seemingly competent coder on the team was stuck in visa limbo for an extended period These are just some of the problems surrounding the game, not even the game itself.Now the actual game... the only positive thing is that it is relatively bug-free in its current state. Mostly there's nothing that could have any bugs, as in, there is no content. If you are looking at this and thinking it will be Terraria in space, you're mistaken. There are currently three bosses, which are all heavily tiered and either impossible to beat if you don't have the appropriate gear and total pushovers if you do. Beating one rewards you with an item required to unlock the next tier of space, which you are forced to go to if you want to get anything new. And yes, it includes mining up tons of ores for every single tier. The ""space"" aspect, as in moving from planet to planet, discourages building permanent structures on planets, since you will be moving from one planet to another constantly. Since there is nothing on lower-tier planets that you can't also find on higher-tier ones, there's no reason to go back to them either. Even less so when you consider that you also don't need any of the previous resources for later items and blocks. Moving from tier to tier also plays out exactly the same every single time. You arrive at a new planet, beam down and probably get almost oneshot by the first enemy you encounter, as whatever armor you have from the last tier will provide effectively no damage reduction from your new foes. These enemies meanwhile take barely any damage from your old weapons. Thus you hole up and dig down, hoping to find enough of this tier's new ores to make new weapons and armor, at which point you will be god again. You kill the new boss, get the item required to move to the next tier, then return to my first sentence. This progression is supposedly going to be split up into three paths, which are essentially the usual tank/melee, ranged and mage archetypes, as seen in Terraria. However, this is not in the game yet and was last mentioned a couple months ago[playstarbound.com]. In fact the current development focus seems to be entirely on two things: terrain generation, which is the only thing that has been brought up multiple times in recent news posts, and decorative and vanity items. Both things that most definitely should be on the backburner at this point, as there is an already functional terrain generation, but barely any actual interesting content, be it progression-related items that would offer some choice instead of a forced path, well designed enemies and especially competent enemy AI, or a quest system that is more than just a glorified tutorial. The only thing Starbound currently has over its content-heavy predecessor Terraria is modability. Materials, blocks, weapons, enemies, biomes, effectively everything you see can be changed by you with minimal artistic effort and a basic understanding of LUA. However, this is also where it ends. A lot of core structures that would be interesting to mess with are hardcoded, like an enemy's body composition, world interactions, status effect hooks and, mind-boggingly enough, inventory access. This reflects in just what kind of mods are currently classified as containing new ""mechanics"": Minecraft-style tech mods, which deal with a basic power system and ore-processing machinery, as well as some defensive mechanisms. One of the few mods that managed to create something unique with some mind-bending codework, considering the limitations, added ""Bioshock Infinite""-style skyrails within the first month of the game's initial opening to the public - which were added as ""official content"" and the only new content in one of the few updates following that mod's release. Take that however you will.All in all Starbound is at best a promising proof-of-concept, if trying to copy a Metroidvania with building can be called that. It has potential which I firmly believe Chucklefish is not capable of realizing, considering they have failed to even manage a community without banning voices that were offering valid criticism. Avoid at all costs.			"

								I want to like this game. I played a good chunk of it and it was fun. I want to like this game so much. I am incredibly upset that I have to recommend against buying it. I don't want to dislike it, and I suppose I don't; What I dislike is the idea that the game is dead in the water and looks like its going to be that way for... Well... Forever.I got this game before it even came to steam. I bought the four pack straight from Chucklefish's main site. Played around in it, did all there was to do- I even have some hilarious screenshots of bugs that were fixed very early on. It was fun but eventually doing the same basic things over and over got very boring. The progression was basically broken past tier 2 (and there are 10 tiers) and if you wanted to make a nice base you had to luck out and find the right building materials on some planet. Which is fine, it was an alpha, I accepted it.Fast forward to now. Almost nothing has changed. There is a little bit of tweaking here, some touch-ups there, but nowhere NEAR the amount of progress you'd expect from this amount of time. So I went back to their website and a wave of dread washed over me as I saw what I knew was the death knell of this game:Several of the key developers advertising their personal pet project.I heavily suspect they are using Starbound as a financial springboard for these projects. There is literally no other reason to do them besides ignorance. A studio as small as chucklefish can't AFFORD side projects like that, because all they do is take away from their primary project. Either they know this, and we're all being swindled so they can fund their pet projects (which, by the way, will likely be DOA, if not DNF, as most one-man projects turn out to be) or they do not realize this and they need to get their act together and put their personal projects on hold until Starbound is ready for release.I am upset that I have to give this game a no-go. I wanted it to turn out good so much. The concept is here but the staff keeps side-tracking and delaying so they can work on petty dead-end distractions.			"

								Whoo boy, what can I say ? Don`t buy into this yet, possibly at all. Development has been downright glacial and halting. The game itself is, contrary to what is claimed, not in a Beta state. It`s not even in an Alpha state. It`s, and this comes straight from the project heads mouth, a tech demo.The actual gameplay, what is in place at the time of this review anyway, is shallow. So very shallow. Grind ores, grind money, get gear, kill boss. After the 4th boss even that`s gone. And that is more or less it. You can build a base, farm vegetables etc, but there`s little to no point in any of that. Racial differences ? Are going to be armour based in the future and non-existant in the now. Settlements for the majority of the races aren`t even implemented yet.Unless the idea of a much shallower, slightly prettier Terraria clone appeals to you, give this a berth the width of Australia.

								Not as of now. Not yet.There's hardly any significant content and at this pace it seems it might not live up to expectations.Why do people compare this to Terraria so much? Well it's because it fed off the success of Terraria and basically promised itself as Terraria in space with more customization and unique worlds. It still not there yet, far from it.Terraria occasionally released patches, with one guy doing most of it, that added content for free and pretty much added hours of longevity to the game. Seems like Starbound's updates are mostly cosmetic. I really want this to succeed, I really do. However, if you've played Terraria and expect a better experience you won't get it right now. Bosses, planets, systems, dungeons, weapons and items aren't all that interesting and you will quickly grow bored. Customization isn't that varied either.  Basically, if you played Terraria through and through then there's not much in this game that will keep you engaged or surprise you. Wait for the game to be officially released. Keep your cash for now. "

Early Access Review
								Visually, Starbound is amazing. The animation is smooth, the lighting engine is GODLY.The problem is that Starbound is shallow and empty. Combat is awkward, the UI clumsy.For all its worth, Starbound feels like it was made by graphics designers. There's randomly 'made' moster sprites, lots of weapons and tilesets, but none of it does anything special. Starbound is COD. A looker, but it leaves you empty.If you want a deep, amazing adventure with excitement and action, play Terraria, or try Crea. Crea's also in Early Access, but the polar opposite of Starbound. It looks a lot less (but still pretty great) but has a lot more mechanical depth in it. EDIT:Let me add something else. Starbound doesn't change over time. Terraria gave you potions and weird weapons, but Starbound keeps being obsessed with mining and crafting. Crafting, however, is clumsy, and mining very boring (other than the pretty tileset). The worst part is that, despite its focus on cool monsters, being underground makes the floaty movement choke on itself. And unless you're hunting for dungeons, there's no reason to be surface-side.Starbound is a sightseeing tour (like I mentioned with COD). Once you've seen the sights, you lose a lot of luster. Destiny is better, because at LEAST Destiny's combat and core gameplay is enjoyable(?).			"

								Chucklefukks lies and broken promises. Do not buy unless you want to be dissapointed by a sub-par terrraria made by a sperglord who wears a fedora and codes ""le ebin may-mays xD"" into the game. Not to mention this game hasn't been updated for 4 months. I bought into this game by funding it $40 when it was still in concept and they have completely and utterly let me down. All my hopes for this game are dead and the cherry on top? I can't even get a refund for the product they didn't even deliver.			"

								Feels like just another crafting chore to me.The random worlds don't give me good environments to roam, but rather uninteresting terrain where I will always do the same mining, and enemies that I handle more or less the same way on every planet.Multiplayer works well, and I understand that this is in early access, but I would not recommend purchasing it at this point. I don't see how it could get better.			"

Early Access Review
								Game NOT recommended.This negative review is a placeholder, and is still in early access.*(*May be subject to change, and may change in any number of different directions. While this review may be a dry wall of text not recommending it now, it could change! Maybe into an exciting picture, an action adventure platformer game, dating sim, puzzle, VN, 3D shooter, blockbuster movie, critically acclaimed best selling epic trilogy of books, or even a positive review! Hype, hype, hype! Features may be added and removed. Such is Early Access. Better like it now, and like it even if it changes, 'cause your stuck with it.)When I got this game in 2013, it was little more than a planetary strip mining sim. Now, it's also an annoying tutorial fetch quest game, too. They had a great idea, but has never gone beyond ""meh"" level for me. The base game should be great alone. My only hope is that modding doesn't die off completely, and modders can make something good out of it. Shouldn't have to be that way on their flagship title. It has not lived up to it's potential or hype.A game is nothing with out its developers. So I don't recommend anything they touch, now, either.Everything in the game is a placeholder as said by the developers. Placeholders are a staple of tech-demos, early alphas, and alpha games, not so much for betas. Some betas may have placeholders, but not as every feature! And what beta game has everything been stated as a placeholder? Only Starbound. Some people paid to playtest, to help them out. What is the point if ""everything is a placeholder""? They can't make a commitment to what will be in the game, or what the game is supposed to be? Sure seems like it. So much for a design document. Keeping that 'secret' only gives them a great excuse to keep doing, well, whatever it is they do. They don't want to spoil the end? Is it going to be that bad? Why even sell it, then? Perhaps the rumors are true. There never was one. Would explain all the changes of story and game direction. Best they have shown is a flow chart. A simple flow chart is not a design document.One of the points of early access is to playtest, bug test, and give feedback. Note the absence of the developer presence on the only legal distributor of the game. The place that hosts the Early Access program that protects them. Everyone has to have Steam to get a legitimate copy, don't they? Don't forget this game had a pre-order, with no definite word if there would even be a beta release, or if there would be anything other than a finished game.(Or even be on Steam.) I'm scared to even think what little broken content there would have been had they released it back then. Good thing they found Early access! It is probably better that we'll never know what a they wanted to sell us originally. There is also is/was the launcher bug that tracks additional time NOT played. They knew about it, and did nothing. It is in the developers best interest to let other people think owners are playing far more than they really are. I only wish this game was fun enough to put 300+ hours into. Not even close. Steam game tracking is notorious for being wrong, but being a smart cookie, you already knew that. Or maybe you have a magic crystal ball of science magic? Then you also know what my other games real times are, too? I have many that have been played but haven't been tracked. I have games that should have even more time on them, too. You must also have that research paper/scientific study done on hours played equaling fun, too. Oh, that one doesn't exist. Sorry.Indie used to mean independent of a publisher. CF is now a 'publisher'. Don't worry, they like to redefine words a lot, as they are a special snowflake. They sold a tech demo/pre-alpha as a beta. One year is soon in chuckle-time. Almost done in 2012. A road map that showed far more completion of things not yet done. Mock-up of things that were never to be in game. A bit of honesty would have gone a long way! Seems more marketing and hype was done, rather than work on the game. One of the worst thing is really all the whiteknighting fans who have no understanding of the Early Access program. They are allowed to troll other fans and attack any feedback that could possibly be negative, even if it isn't. If someone has a problem or idea, they can expect to be attacked. These trolls don't even get a warning. Very poor moderation at best, even when they have their own moderators on the Steam forums, that is. They do come by and do forum cleanups, got to make the forums look 'clean' for a sale or update. Other developers have good and helpful Steam communities. Too bad they fostered the very toxic community they ignore. They must want it this way, as they have the power to change it, but don't.But hey, it's all a placeholder anyway. Wonder if we will ever get the REAL game? Maybe that will be good?Just remember, it's all your fault. Steam and Chucklefish have said so.Two good things did come from Starbound for me. 1) I met a lot of cool friends, (some who like the game, some that don't) many who I would not have met otherwise. Can't put a dollar value on that.2) Looked into the Steam Early Access policy. Learned that it's just some toothless guidelines that allow for developer misbehavior. Steam cares more for it's real customer, other game developers, than the consumer. Some developers have great work ethics and can deliver. The other bad developers are protected, and they get a golden parachute. Only the worst offenders get pulled from the store. Pity, the idea is good, but its implementation has no consumer protection. Perhaps Early Access is in early access, too. Regardless, I won't make another purchase for a 'maybe' game. Saved a bunch of money and disappointment by not buying many program failures. Like: The Stomping Lands, Spacebase DF-9, StarForge, among others. Sucks for the good developers who use the program as intended. If I cant trust Steam and VALVe to stand by the products they sell in early access, I just won't buy them. Simple.Still wonder when I'll get that game that was hyped. What I have now is not that game.TL;DR: For those who don't like to read, online forums tend to rely on the written word. Seems like all forums are filled with words. Why are you even here, then? As for walls of text, libraries and books must not be your thing, then, too? Are you such a vidiot that the presence of written or typed words make you angry? I don't disagree that the reliance on only one form of media is the best rout, as one should seek as many outlets as possible to make a truly informed decision. I don't personally put a lot of stock into youtubers that get free games to test and positively endorse. Nor does peoples monetizations of their YouTube accounts give me any confidence that the goal of the videos is simply to inform... only to entertain and make money. Take everything with a grain of salt, even this wall of text. Yet, information is power. Had I and others known all of the available information that was buried and hidden out there at the time, not listened to people who held only positive opinions, and not seen positively slanted 'lets plays'... many would not own the games now, myself included. Much info was found in hindsight looking for answers that few seemed to have at the time and the developers would not take the time to answer. But why does one even need to spend countless hours researching all of the internet, when a honest developer could lay out an informational bonanza of truth in one place? Seems odd over a game, down right shady, in fact.  "

								If you want to give your hard earned DOLLA BILLS to a comapny that uses them to go on vacations and buy property in london for a SO called office this is the game for you! Chucklefish is by far on par with the production team behind the famed TOWNS failure. taking your monies and then promising updates every month, but only 1 in the last 10 months? i have had this game for some time now and its a joke. you really cannot even progress through it without getting mods to componsate for the lack of a game that is starbound. Its a tragedy to say this game in the same sentance as Terraria when talking about anything besides how unlike and ♥♥♥♥♥♥ it is compared to Terraria. The chucklefish staff should pull a 180 and get to work, or simple divide thier scam earnings and give them to the hardworking modders who have made this game playable. seriously do not waste your monies, wait and see if they ever get to work. I know its hard to find games like Terraria and MInecraft, there is not many that are good, but do not be fooled by this scam.			"

								Here comes the negative review. Yes a review that has been about 3 months in the making now. Ok, let me start off by saying this game does in fact have a lot of potential. The graphics are really good in my opinion. The building and crafting is fun. The exploration and space travel is a good touch, and the over all feel of the game is great. The problem with all the really good stuff is there are a few things about this game that are currently ruining all the great things it could be.I’ll start out with the playability of the game. The game engine itself is system intense. So much so that even with the game settings set to low the game has a tendency to bog down, or freeze. Yes, this could be my system, so I’m not that upset about it. The problem is with the second and most game-breaking problem with this game. 5 months with no patching, no progress, and no updates as to what or were this game is going. An embarrassing amount of Nothing, I’m not just talking about content patches. I’m talking about anything that is bugged in the game. It’s as if this game has been tossed aside by the game company because it has already made its money. Worst thing is I sense a quick to finished product coming for this game. I’m not talking one that will have all the bells and whistles. I’m talking a game that will be released as done just the way it is currently. No switch character option, no delete character option, no achievements, no performance patches. Because it will be the convenient way of handling things for the company if they’re burned out on make the game, and have already made their money off of it.Truly I want them to prove me wrong. I want some content patches that will fix the bugs that pop up every so often in the game. I want the glitches fixed, and the needed menu options added. In short I want them to show that they’re working on this game. Months, and months, and months of nothing from them to the point of it being a blemish on their company.So please Chuckle Fish if you read this review I would beg you to rectify this situation by (yes I’m yelling) DO SOMETHING. I may change this review if anything worth calling a patch is done, but for now I would recommend people thinking about playing this game to stay clear. It is grossly starting to smell like a dead fish. "

Early Access Review
								I'd like to start out by saying this is a friendly ""Not recommended"". In a lot of ways this game is MUCH better than Terraria, but in a lot of ways it is MUCH worse. Pros:Conceptually nice graphical detail/graphic setting.Graphics and music really immerse you into that planet that you're onLots of content already to craft and findStructures are pretty nice on the planets, but do get repetitive after a while.Animations are great for the quality of everything else.Music is nice and immersiveCons:Painfully repetitive combat. The monsters are essentially the same on every planet, if not the same on two, the next will have identicle monsters. Combat is drastically haulted by the fact that every single monster jumps 45 feet into the air constantly.Depth lacking crafting system that hand-holds you through everything, and takes every bit of the fun out of crafting things. Take a note from minecraft and please revitalyze your crafting engine. It's basically ""Find this, find that, push this button"" where it could be ""Find all this stuff and see what you can make by trial and error!"" The second system would be much more rewarding survival/immersion-wise.Content lacking in comparison to terraria/any game like this. It's just the generic ""iron Shortsword"" or ""Silver pickaxe"" type content. The best thing about terraria was that you could always find something different, unique, and just plain awesome at almost any point in the game. Starbound really needs special tools/weapons/items to differentiate from every single other crafting game in existanceThere's no meaning to this game, no goals, no objectives, no epic loot to look forward to, no new mystifying planets that widely differentiate from the last to look forward to exploring, just a basic point and click crafter. I still really enjoy this game, and see that it has immense potential, but it needs a lot of work to ever match up with terraria or any crafter in the genre.			"

												The release of 1.0 has been met with both negative and positive responses; largely negative, as early-access players feel that the game lacks some of the content that previous builds promised. And honestly, I'm inclined to agree with this sentiment. Prior to 1.0, Chucklefish presented us with mechanics like racially exclusive weaponry, temperature variants and even space stations. There was a lot of great content that has since been removed. However, the game still has the potential to change, something that a lot of people fail to recognise.  PROS:- Visually speaking, this is one of the nicest looking pixel platformers I've ever seen. - The crafting system is rich and complex, but does take getting used to. You now have the ability to upgrade your crafting stations instead of building newer models. The scan function on your M.M now means you can craft any item you've scanned prior, which is handy. - Each species gets its own unique ship, armour sets, dialogue and lore (with the exception of the Novakid. Seriously. Where are my Novakid towns, Chucklefish?)- There is a lot to explore, both above and below ground. No two planets are alike. - If you have the incentive, building houses and buildings is a fun and rewarding experience. You can even summon settlers to occupy your builds for you.CONS:- The new HUD and item bar are difficult to use and look ugly. The old one worked fine, and wasn’t in need of a makeover. - Combat swings between being enjoyable and insufferable. The ‘damage on contact’ system is stupid, especially when coupled with the number of monsters that spawn; I’ve had ten of the things on screen, and died because of lag because I was crushed in the middle.- Five years and there’s still no ‘store all’ option for item containers. - The story is weak, flimsy and repetitive. As a sandbox survival game, Starbound is brilliant. There is a lot to see, millions of planets to explore and a great deal of depth to building and creating, as well as the reintroduced hunger mechanic. As an action game, however, Starbound falls short. Combat is weak and laggy (the game has trouble running when there’s a lot on screen) and the story falls flat. Personally, I love this game; I love it because building and creating and exploring is something I enjoy. I’m quite happy to spend an hour or two gathering materials to customise my ship or house with. However, this isn’t for everyone. If you’re looking for a more balanced experience regarding combat and plot, then there are other games which are much better suited!			"

								The lesson for me is to wait until game premiere next time before purchasing.Nothing happenes on the Early Access of Starbound and developers annouce several new games they are working on. I hope at least one of them they will decide to finish...I am sick and tired of listening to developers, who are only active and ""productive"" on their dev blog. Sure, they announce tons of new stuff ""in-progress"", but since February Starbound have not recieved ANY new content. And some features were announced even earlier.They tried to introduce nightly updates, but they are mostly unstable, unfinished and unplayable.I tried several times to ask them about any hint when the next stable update will be released. Its all about excuses: ""oh, we are currently moving"" ""watch! I was working on something today but I've just started this new idea and didn't finish previous ones!"". Ok, guys, but it's SIX MONTHS and nothing changed. Great effectiveness.Stay away from Starbound. They promised too much and didn't keep it. And now they work on new games. Soon they will announce they stopped working on Starbound improvements. Mark my words.3/10(it would be 8/10 if I've just bought it and had no idea nothing is happening on the game)			"

												So I see a lot of bad reviews since the new 1.0 patch. I get people are upset that things got wiped and things have changed. People must also remember that these games go through massive changes to make the game more polished and run/ work better. With that being said here is my review as a new player so far. I love everything this game has offered since the splash screen. My friend and I have completely lost all sense of time and direction while playing this(both of us came from terraria). Amazing soundtrack, gameplay, art style(yes I know it's old school but it's still pretty), crafting system(huge and tons of variation), weapons, clothing/armor. I could go on about all the great things we have seen in just the few hours we have played. I highly recommend this for anyone who is a fan of Terraria. I fought a penguin flying an UFO. Soooo yea play it and I promise you won't be let down if you are new to the title. A lot of the older players from early access(or w/e it's called) don't like some of the changes but coming in new you won't know those changes and it won't matter purely because the game is fresh to you. Do yourself a favor and try it.			"

								Got the game about a year ago, beat it in a few days.What did I notice?Past tier 3 or so (there's 10 tiers) the gameplay is extremely gimmicky- go to this planet, get this ore, get this armor, beat this boss, move to a new planet, get this ore, etc. I really wanted the game to be good, it was not that great.They claim to be working on improving the game, but it has been released FOR TWO ♥♥♥♥ING YEARS (Yeah, it was released in 2013, it's ridiculous).They censor anyone who points out that they're doing a god-awful job of providing what they were paid to in a timely fashion. Due to the unprofessionalism and laziness of the devs, I would not recommend this game to my worst enemy. P.S. devs stop being ♥♥♥♥ please			"

								Not yet.It's fun for the first few hours, but like all games you eventually realise you're in it to finish it.Starbound forces this because it's linear.""But wait!"" I hear you cry, ""It's a sandbox game about space exploration!"".No. It's a linear game in a sandbox. They give you a huge world to explore, and very little to see. Some chests with free weapons (and it's almost always a case of it being a better-or-worse yes-or-no take-or-not absolute), villages where people spout repeated lines and give you stuff for pixels, random encounters where you kill people or people kill you with little to no variation or outcome.To progress, you have to beat the bosses. This requires upgraded armour and weapons, or you're stuck in a hole firing a terrible bow in the most tedious hour long battle ever... This gear in turn requires a lot of mining. Obviously you mine for better minerals, and make better mining gear too.You explore for free stuff, you mine for minerals to upgrade, you beat a boss, you do that 4 times, and then you upgrade a further 5 or so times without beating bosses, just so you can survive. Exploring serves as a nice break from the endless grind, until you know all the encounters, facilities, and villages and can see how meaningless and stale they are. All the planets are kind of the same. Sure, different monsters, different colours, different gravity, different weather... but a forest planet is a forest. The trees might have eyes, or they might look like candyfloss, but they function exactly the same. A desert is a desert. A tundra is just an endless expanse of depressing snow. You want some variety, you have to up and move. Not only that, the starmap interface is horrible, and there's no way of remembering where you were save writing coordinates down somewhere manually, which means that you're stuck with 2 places; your current planet and you home. If you accidentally fly away from somewhere forgetting you didn't have home set well... say bye-bye to your house.So, that's the exploration and progression side of it. What about the building and the decoration? Well a lot of the stuff isn't available to build. You have to ""steal"" it from places (read: dig up the lifeless sites) and scan it to get the recipe or, more often, the ability to pixel print. So in order to make what seems to be 90% of the building materials, you do not in fact craft them with raw materials, but instead refine all your raw materials to magic pixels and then use them to print out everything. Want to make some steel furniture but have no steel? No worries, refined copper will do! Yay for the I-Win Pixel Printer! (In case you missed my cynicism here, I see the pixel printer as nothing more than a device to reduce the number of interesting recipes needed in the game and make it easier and simpler...) Not only that, pixel compression loses you slightly over 30% of the pixels... but dying does too. So there's no reason to not compress all your pixels away and store them for when you want to do mass printing sprees!I understand it's Beta, but I'm concerned regardless. It all seems to be a show for the player. You're the focus of the entire universe. At this stage, it's a linear RPG where progression is enforced by starmap upgrades and later your gear choice. You have to get better to progress, and you have to progress to explore more interesting places and get more recipes. Pixels are a universe XP-like currency for limiting your upgrades if you haven't killed or mined enough. The entire design philosphy is centric around giving the player this final goal to get to (Impervium gear) and eventually, when you're there... there's not really anything to do. It's lost the sandbox, because you've been told to progress all along.Too many games of the last half a decade or so have been centric on surrounding the player and telling them to keep pushing forwards. My suspicion is that it's because if you keep pushing forwards through the forced progression, and then reach the end and treat it as ""done""... then you don't really notice how little of a game there was.So much potential. We'll see how this one rolls and I'll update as appropriate.A rating? I dunno. Probably a retrospective 4-to-6/10.-- Edit from 10th Feb 2014 --With the recent(ish) news of director mode, along with a total rehaul of the sector system/bosses on the eventual horizon, my interest in Starbound is beginning to build once more. It seems they wished to showcase the base features and engine, and the final game will in fact be structured very differently, which is what I was waiting to see. Pre-emptive review is probably out of the question, but once it's released I'll update once again.			"

Early Access Review
								I've expected so much of this game. I think everyone did, and that is this game's biggest flaw. I wouldn't usually pin ""overhyping"" an indie game as the developer's fault, but boy did they make promises; and boy did we swallowed them all.However, development and forum's drama aside (there's quite plenty of it, for the gossip-fond people), I still wouldn't consider this game fun or challenging. The good The art direction: this game, if anything, is gorgeous eye-candy. I love the environments, the different races and their associated furniture and the building decoration; certainly the better aspects of the game.The farming and building: So relaxing. I could have just a game made out of building a farm from the ground up if it was anywhere near to Starbound's system. The farming might not be the most complex task and might not have a lot of variety to it, but I think that's where it's charm resides.The exploration: all the different buildings scattered around the planets are wonderful, and give you a nice sense of adventure whenever you break into a lab building or enter the depths of a pyramid. The badThe exploration, 1 hour later: After exploring for a while a few planets, you start to realize something. There's a certain pattern to what are you going to find in the world. Big structure or a city to the left, scattered people to the right, and the planet loops around (which would be in a different situation kinda neat). After visiting once an Apex's city, you already saw everything there is to them. The next one you find is going to have some ""randomization"" throw in, say adding a building or making it longer, but the cookie cutter feel is there.The AI, both NPC and enemies: from a wide range of idiotic to non-existant, the AI leaves a lot to be desired. The citizens in the cities you find have the charm, wits and usefulness of a paperweight, and the same is to be said of the enemies AND BOSSES. I really couldn't care about killing enemies in this game when you can easily outrun them, or just leave them trapped in dirt. The only reason you kill stuff is because the progression requires grinding, which brings me to...The ""progression"": kill mine kill > craft or buy stuff to go new place > repeat. There's not point to the currency in Starbound (pixels) when you can just kill everything and everyone to get new stuff. And getting to a new place/solar system/galaxy/sector just means the enemies absorb more bullets. Not a smarter AI, not a more challenging task, not even better finds: just a longer health bar for enemies. Hoo-♥♥♥♥ing-ray, I guess; that's what I've always wanted.The combat system: you click on things until they die. If you are using melee you need to get closer first, but that pretty much sums up all the combat. We are Terraria, except we are not: What's the point of having mining in this game? There's nothing to be found down there (nothing interesting at least), it's just another part of the elaborated grindfest that composes Starbound. The uglyThere's a lot of drama and finger-pointing in the community, but im not going to dwell into that or the Starbound mods might censore me. Wink wink nod nod.There hasn't been any updates for FIVE months. Why is it even in early access? HOLY ♥♥♥♥ TEXT WALL Long story short: just buy Terraria. It might not look as beautiful as this game, but gameplay-wise Starbound is a dumbed down Terraria.			"

Early Access Review
								Wow. I bought this game the second the beta was released, I had followed it's dev process prior to that for about half a year. It's now been out on beta for approximately half a year, and almost NOTHING has changed. There has been such a long list of promises by the devs, and there have been 0 deliveries. Just daily updates on their website listing what they did that day (Even though it is never implemented into the stable game). On the day I am writing this they added ""big flying creatures"". They promised 3 phases of beta, its been half a year of phase 1, at this rate the game will NEVER see full release, seeing as phase 1 has no end in sight. Chucklefish currently has been given 4 million USD to get this game made, and right now it looks like they just are keeping the money and working on their game at turtle pace with no apologies, or reason for why their progress has been insanely slow. I could write this review for HOURS listing every pointless update on their website and how little they did with their work day according to the update, but that would be a longer novel than every George RR Martin novel combined.Basically Chucklefish is a scam company. They've used their 4 million USD to publish indie titles for more motivated developers so they can sap their profits. They aren't even updating their own game, and I'm waiting for it to just disappear and their company to be rebranded as only a publisher. It's pitiful that Redigit of Terraria could accomplish more in a single day than these clowns can in a week. TL;DR Buy Terraria and avoid this game. It's a long list of broken and unheeded promises made by a company that does nothing all day except use their insane amount of cash from fanboys to play video games and screw around instead of working on their game.

								I can't reccomend this game at all. It has been all but abandoned. I followed this game for years, even before they had a working forum. It has been a total let down and i dont think it will be finished in the next two years. The devs got to exited by all the money they raked in for early access. Some of them moved to a new country and they spent 6 months opening an office.The entire time we hear ""OMG guys we are so sorry, moving and opening an office is hard work!!"". The entire time no progress is made on the game, yet they continue to publish other games and rake in money for that.As for the game iteself... Its buggy, unfinished and very linear for a ""sandbox"" game. Like i said earlier its at least two years out for a finished game to come out of this mess. The only additions to the game are from modders. Any good mod is quickly picked up by the leaching devs and put in the game. So instead of doing any actual work they let modders do it for them. I love Steam, LOVE IT! But this early access game crap should not be allowed unless the dev has a release date planned already.Early release is an easy out for companys for many reasons...1. They get money now.2. They can play the ""it's only a beta"" When it fails horribly.3. They can take as long as they want to work on it now because they are paid.4. You test the game for them AND YOU ARE PAYING FOR IT.The list goes on.In the mean time Terraria has blown full steam forward and is so much more awesome now. Each play through for that game is a pure joy. Use your money for a game were the Devs still care. And save your money for Terraria 2.			"

Game: It's a very basic game, there's nothing to do in the game but fight monsters and build housing. Every single world is the same, there's just pallete swaps.I don't reccommend getting the game in it's current state, as there's absolutely nothing to do in it.The Dev group, moderators, and community I tried to cover everything, but I'm not good with words, I HAVE covered the main aspects everyone has been having problems with in here, so now it shouldn't be as cluttered.Read this for all answers to mostly everything , it was NOT made by me, but I am getting the word out:https://imgur.com/a/QgkPtSide note: https://i.imgur.com/1aoVrb8.pngThis is just the best.I've only two questions:Why are you ignoring people? Where's the update explaining all the issues?I should point out to people ignorant towards what's going on that:They continually do shady ♥♥♥♥, and controversial ♥♥♥♥, then censor people with questions about said shady and controversial ♥♥♥♥. Please, explain to me, if you want the ""trolling"" as you put it, to end, why do you continually do things like this? Someone leaves, nothing is said from you personally, you hire moderators that are/were ban happy and censorshippy as hell, you move to the most expensive place to live, England, you insult consumers and the community (lost my respect on that one, though you don't care.) There's a Laundry list In no way am I attacking, or insulting, being rude, so on. Just a worried customer. Although I don't feel safe putting this here, everytime someone has, you seem to be more ban happy than ever. (or warning happy, whatever.)Examples:~~~Long as hell, but no insults made, faulty ban given regardless of a second account.https://i.imgur.com/N3iDyft.png~~~~~~~~Just how legit are these bans? A coin toss:https://i.imgur.com/Ki8ezBP.png~~~~~~~~This is a legitimate response when you see what they've said:https://i.imgur.com/clXuOGR.pngResponses made:https://i.imgur.com/sIwB3Mu.pnghttps://i.imgur.com/EaEDNQb.pnghttps://i.imgur.com/7Dim04R.png~~~~Response to:https://i.imgur.com/UxoE4Xg.pnghttps://i.imgur.com/XQAw3CQ.pngSo a few toxic people got pissy at the lack of updates, and are now taking what you're saying out of context for their own, I guess, ""self gain.""So you're essentially ♥♥♥♥ing the consumer over because the lil bully on the play yard is spreading lies. You're kidding me right? This is a joke correct? Are you serious? I'm literally taking pauses just to process this, SOME ♥♥♥♥WIT IS BEING AN ASSHAT SO YOU ♥♥♥♥ THE CONSUMER OVER?Alright, just, I'm going to let this sink in to everyone reading this.The developer of the game doesn't want to work on the game or inform the consumer on what's happening because some lil ♥♥♥♥ is doing something he doesn't appreciate.Haha, it's almost as if he's making up a fake excuse.Oh wait, it is a fale excuse, nvm, can be safely ignored as ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. Listen, if you want all this to stop, then stop hiding the truth, stop hiding behind a ban or warning, stop abusing your powers, don't ignore the ♥♥♥♥ing questions at hand:Answer them. Make an update, say somewhere what the real reason is. Don't keep tip toeing around it, it's VERY obvious that's what you're doing, if the truth is that you're no longer working on the game, then just tell Steam you're no longer working on the game, they'll keep it up with no change to it at all, they allow scams anyways. Especially E.A. ones:Proof: http://www.gamespot.com/articles/steam-early-access-games-may-never-be-finished-valve-warns/1100-6420151/But if this isn't just a really ♥♥♥♥ing lucky cashgrab, do the community a favor and put their worries at rest. If you have said something, I sure as ♥♥♥♥ haven't seen it anywhere, especially on steam. Get it at your own risk as Steam allows Scamming. Not just in the E.A. part, but in games in general, such as Towns, Day One Garry's Incident, War Z (Now known as infestation Stories.) and pretty much more than half of what's on Steam.			"

												As someone with a substantial amount of playtime and experience in this, it's morbidly entertaining to watch this get/have gotten progressively worse with each update.EDIT: Starbound 1.0 is out! Come back and do all the fetch quests all over again! This time there's removed content and still a large disparity in balance. There have been some improvements such as scanning objects to your 3D printer now, but they're immediately counterbalanced by setbacks such as needing to (nearly) max out your ship first before you can start custom decorating everything with 3D printed furniture.All variety between biomes and racial storylines have been completely consolidated and forced along linear progression now. The arid, deserted, ded landscape that was Starbound's ""endgame"" is now slightly more decorated, but to compensate, all the other biomes are now as empty as it used to be! Hooray!Oh and don't consider multiplayer until a few months after this when people may get third party multiplayer servers working, the official executable is currently a hot messy pile of insects and arachnids if you get what I mean.

								This review is heavily edited from its original, imprecise iteration.I dislike this game because to date I feel like the amount of visual content in the game far outweighs the actual gameplay.The visual style is, by the way, quite good, but the game simply isn't all that fun.It gets repetitive after a very short while, and feels too limited to be a true sandbox-game.I also have my concerns about the development schedule. Speculations as they may be, I implore you all to look this up on your own.I would not spend my money on this product until it is fully released.			"

												Game is finally out... but it seems to be rushed and incomplete.version 1.0 is extremely poorly optimized. Game drops to 15 fps and fluctuates wildly depending on your environment. An RX480 is just as good as a laptop GPU.Crafting wise, it seems to have a lot of ornamental things, but actual useful items... not that many. In some 12-15 hours you can upgrade everything you need, leaving you only to follow the main quest.NPC sidequests are rather stupid, take note/resources to some other NPC nearby (if you're lucky) or go to some area in the world and get some NPC back to town. Not sure why they thought ♥♥♥♥♥♥ MMO type quests will be fun.Given how long it took for the developers to actually release the game, justifying it as ""we don't want to rush it, we want the game to be great, we don't want to offer a half baked experience"", I can't help but think that chuckle when the game starts is a sort of "" you idiots paid us 3 years ago for this game, bet you feel smart now"".Very disappointed by what the game delivered vs what it promised (to be honest, I might have gone past the content if the game wasn't performing so awful).

												First, I recommend checking out Tystarchius' review here, since my thoughts are basically a continuation and elaboration:http://steamcommunity.com/id/tystarchius/recommended/211820Like him, I wish there was a third ""neutral"" option: I can't recommend the game in its current state, but that doesn't make it necessarily a *bad* game. I want to be able to come back to this review in a year and just replace the whole thing with ""edit: nvm"". As it stands, however, there are simply too many flawed design decisions and silly/stupid mechanical mistakes to enjoy it.There are numerous small missteps, so I'm going to just go for the big ones here:* The gameplay loop is broken.Quick definition: Gameplay loops describe the core set of repetitive actions that make a game fun, and are composed of multiple disparate elements. For example, in Doom, you're not JUST shooting monsters; you're also searching for secrets, which lead to treasure, which enhances your ability to shoot more monsters. Stardew Valley has a half-dozen systems that interweave - farming, fighting, socializing - that all positively influence and enhance one another; any given activity provides benefits to other activities, meaning time is never wasted and you're always making progress.In Starbound, this loop is broken, as all of the various systems are disconnected. You can complete the game without ever creating a single settlement, planting a single seed, or taking a single randomly-generated mission to gain a crew member. For some reason, Chucklefish thought this was a *selling point* instead of a massive design failure. Being able to skip entire elements, systems and game mechanics is not good game design! Not only that, but these extra systems are completely superfluous, as they are *less efficient* than the core element of planet exploration. You can just run around collecting the resources, which is usually a much faster method than farming or questing.The point of a gameplay loop is to give the players a break and let them focus on other activities before returning to the main progression. This keeps the game fresh longer and prevents burnout/fatigue, which is incredibly important in long-running games like this. Terraria's gameplay loop balanced this well: exploring (fighting, looting, digging) would lead naturally to the other elements, like farming (critically important buffs from potions) and building (new NPCs at a steady rate need housing), without forcing you to dump more time than strictly necessary if you didn't want to get fancy.* The survival mechanics aren't fun.First, hunger. This mechanic has never been fun for me, and its implementation in Starbound is no different. ""Use a consumable item every X minutes/hours"" is just an annoyance. Fortunately, food is generally abundant (defeating the whole purpose of the mechanic...), but more importantly, more complex and rare foods give you a ton of bonuses, which is pretty fun.However, the Environmental Protection Pack as a gate to planetary exploration is incredibly lazy. It's just an armor slot that unlocks a few more biomes at a time, which are all coincidentally around specific stars. There's nothing interesting about it, just ""oh, I can go to a jungle planet now, which was apparently radioactive before"". This is likely to make each new biome feel exciting and fresh, but instead it just makes them feel uninteresting. This is exacerbated by the fact most mini-biome and ""dungeons"" (including villages) can appear in *any* biome, leading to Floran villages perched between volcanoes, Avian villages set in frozen wastelands, and beautiful flower gardens springing up on eternally dark horror-planets.Speaking of randomization:* The procedural generation is lackluster.This is a doozy. I will grant that the planet terrain generation has improved *significantly* over the years since the first playable alpha, but it's still not as robust or interesting as Terraria's. Granted, Terraria has a few years' head start on Starbound, but it still needs a lot more work to be competitive.My main gripe is that all of the ""dungeon"" spawns are literally identical, down to creature spawns, aesthetic decorations, and even treasure loot tables. (I once found two underground abandoned Glitch dungeons with an EPP mod in the exact same ""random"" corner box.) This means that if you've seen one Hylotl town or Apex resistance base, you've literally seen all of them. There's no mystery or excitement; it's just ""oh, these guys again"". This is pretty much inexcusable, given the game prides itself on randomization and the nature of these changes are trivial. The game generates entire planets! Why are all the dungeons wholly static?! If you need some suggestions, Spelunky released an interactive tutorial that explains how their rooms are put together! Why is this a problem for Starbound?!* Progression and solar systems are goofy.As mentioned above, the EPP is a silly, lazy content gate to different solar systems. I should be able to see icy planets toward the outer edge of a system while those toward the center are hot, and find a mixture of biomes and challenges across them for me to discover if I can or can't handle on my own. Just a handwavey ""yeah you're good bro"" to the next color of star is boring.This also means the planets all feel samey, with some different art assets but the same gameplay. There's no difference between mining on a volcanic planet or a frozen planet, other than getting down from the surface initially. The progression of armor tiers is just basic stat increases, with a very uninspired range/damage/defense decision in endgame. It's the same process to collect ores from every planet with no differences in threat or difficulty once you've reached the appropriate gear tier. It's almost a microcosm of the game itself: dig past the shallow surface and underneath it's the same, over and over again, until you win or get bored.This is where the survival elements could tie in with the colony system, had you any reason to build one. Except colonists don't care if they're on a lava planet or tropical paradise; their quests don't change, they don't ask for structural protections from the elements or anything, they just stand around like every other NPC villager and do little cute things until they're either attacked or have a quest for you. No ""build a weather machine"" or ""help us set up a farm, but the soil sucks because it's a toxic planet"", just ""Billy got lost"" or ""there's a bunch of cultists out by that random lawn chair, can you go investigate?""This review has rambled on long enough, so I'm going to end it here. I critique because I care; I *want* Starbound to succeed and get better, and the only way to do that is to complain - at length - about the numerous problems in hopes someone notices and starts to fix it. Mods will help in the future, but right now there aren't any to address the deep and jarring issues with the base systems themselves. Maybe in a year, it'll be finally finished, but right now...tl;dr pls make game better tia			"

								I'm going to do what others are afraid to do. I recommend this game. Why? because afte reading the reviews I had thought that the game was going to be one of those games where the developers never update or work on that would quickly become stagnant.That may have been true, or it may have been a outright lie told by butthurt people who are mad its still early access, but in short time of playing the community and the developers have been very active on the forums and the game just got a massive update the night I choose to buy it. so you can see how my first impressions of the devs kinda debunks the negative reviews. I even researched to see how often they do these massive updates and its actually pretty often like once every other month.Pros+Huge updates at a good pace+Great modding community+Huge universe to explore+Space ships IN SPACE!!!!+Good but constantly evolving combat+Some of the best pixel art on the market.+Fun with a friend+Easy to RP+Makes you feel like a space rogue (screw han, I shoot first.)+as fun if not funner than over-rated counterpart -cough- Terraria -cough- -cough-Cons-Huge updates at a good pace makes your favorite mods obsolete-Mod community has to constantly update mods to stay relevant-Universe sometimes feels too big-Character creator has options you cant even see when selecting (Im looking at you Underwear Color and Belly button!!!)-Online play would be nice if you didnt have to go through so much to make it work (Port Fowarding!)

								In a galaxy far far away... where technology can still only render 2D graphics...:::::Intro:::::Starbound has one of the most commited developers I have seen since warframe. They update content constantly and try as hard as possible to inform people of how they went about adding the new content. If you were to put all their posts together it could be the best dev diary of a game yet. :::::Updates and Building:::::The way you build in this game is very intuitive and easy to understand. The amount of content for a beta so far is very large from what I seen in-game and on their website when I was following along their posts. :::::Difference from Terraria:::::What I think sets this game apart from Terraria is the sheer amount of locations you are able to go to each with their own unique feel. So if you want to go to a desert planet or one inhibited by aliens you are free to do so and quite easily at that. Each planet in a sense has its own atmosphere as a result of different soundtracks and unique landscapes and items bound to them. This gives a player a greater sense of exploration on a wider scale seeing as how they will want to travel from planet to planet to see what kind of resources they can gather and use to create various different things!:::::Races:::::Every race has their own planet. Being able to beam to other players ships really encourages multiplayer seeing as how its a fun way to see what other races have constructed on their own unique planets. :::::Conclusion:::::If your looking for something like Terraria but on a much greater scale with NPCs, quests, and a hunger for exploration you should look no further than Starbound.Warning: Some people are referring to this game as Deathbound due to difficulty.

												I've waited 4 years for this game to come out.I was really devastated to find out they succumbed and released it out into the Early-Access, because it was around the timewhen Early-Access was getting a lot of love, and only so much hate. This was before stuff like Towns development stopped and stuff, people didn't yet see the trouble in it all.Well, it came out there, and I played it, along with others. I walked around, I killed things, I did the lame penguin boss fights.I was unimpressed - Rightly so I would think, it's not fully developed yet, it's not released, I couldn't judge it well in it's state.I noticed things were getting added by community requests, and this is where I started to shy away from it, I didn't want to see what was gonna be one of my dream games, altered and messed around with by the community - for good or worse.So I ignore the dev blog from there on out, and waited my extra, I guess two years.Lo and behold, right there on Steam, it's out.Let's give this a proper go.(ignore 30 hours of gameplay, that was with the betas, my actual playtime is no more than 17 hours, also, Steam didn't have enough space for my full review, I trimmed where I could)The intro to the game is very slow and sluggish, it gives you the basic tools you need to get started, and you start mining away at the surface for goodies and oddities, pretty classic compared to another game of this genre. I amassed my metals and my tools, made myself new weapons and armors, and got to more killing.Then your first real quest is to go really deep into the planet, get a certain type of material, and teleport to the ""hub"" of the game.Well god damn if that didn't take me forever, it didn't feel that exciting.After you find out about the hub, you find out you have to mine moons for fuel to jump tonew planets out of your reach. Might sound cool at first, but it gets annoying very fast.You tend to hop planet to planet mining the next tier of resources, and making stuff, but withinthis whole mess, you have to go around to certain planets, and find each of the six races and their civilizations, and go into SCAN mode, and start clickingaround for green highlighted objects, and talk to people, to learn more about them, and eventually get the next Mission to go on.The Missions are like adventure instances, a pre-made map with an objective and puzzles with monsters all over the place.They're fun, but after you do a few of em, you just want it to stop. They lose their interest quickly, when the bosses later turn into bullet sponges, few of them are unique with cool fights.The main storyline itself just felt, too forced. I thought this was sort of a primarily exploration and sandbox based game. Well, multiple aspects and shops etc. are blocked from you, until you progress enough in the storyline, so it feels forced and boring rightoff the bat. Normally to me, this would have been fine, but this felt unnecessary and everything else just gets flat because of it. (It gets really annoying trying to find the proper planets to just scan some more and more)Onto the gameplay aspects and mechanics, progression in the game is done by crafting. You craft the first tier of armor and weapons, and then you tend to go find new, randomly generated weapons to kick ♥♥♥ with, and crafting new toolbenches and armor to go along withthe new materials. It's a little sad, being that making your own weapons is a waste of time, because all the strong - and unique - ones are all out there in the universe, not on your crafting screen. There's only a few tiers of actual equipment as well, it's very short lived. By 8 hours into the game I had already acquired what seemed to be the best armor out of the materials you find in the game.Onto the UI of the game, it's just, annoying. I don't feel like it's presented very well, it could have been much cleaner. Opening your inventory always gave me a headache, as it opens right in the damn middle of your screen, blocking your character and things around them.You can move it around thankfully, but it doesn't maintain that position the next time you open it, so it's just a constant struggle trying to open it up in the field. There's a sort function for it thankfully, but not for chests, which gets very annoying, becausethere's simply so much ♥♥♥♥ you pick up in the game, that you need to constantly reorganize it all if you're picking it all up.With chests not being able to be sorted, it just causes you a whole hour of frustration, trying to reorganize it all.The difficulty of the game is modest. When you make your character, you have the choice of Casual, Survival or Hardcore.Casual has no real penalties for dying, you only drop a small percentage of pixels, and you can just walk on back and get right back to it.Survival seems to be the ""normal"" difficulty, you need to eat to survive, you drop certain items on death, and you drop more pixels.Hardcore is Survival, included that, when you die once, you're dead forever.In the end, I honestly just felt stupid for playing Survival, my other friends just chose casual because, having to keep up with food all the time just sounded like an annoying chore. It really was. I would constantly just be chowing down whatever I found to keep my meterhappy, and the drop items on death penalty just made it all the while more boring.There's a lot of other little attractions here and there, you can own a farm, and make shipments (homage to Harvest Moon I would assume), there'sa Pokemonlike capturing system for pets. Upgrades to your ship along with crew. Vehicles to ride around in (though, no promised mech sadly), little challenge rooms out in the world.They're neat, though ultimately, I never gave em a chance. I got my hotrod and rode around and that was that.Sadly, there's a lot of bugs in the game, more than I was betting on. Food sometimes became infinite, planets generated too slowly for me to traverse, and I've had the game crash on me and freeze several times when I'm just moving about.The FPS however, takes the cake. It would CONSTANTLY keep dropping and screwing up, I looked around and tried the fixes people suggested, andto no avail, and I typically don't have technical issues with games on my end, so this was a huge concern of mine. Dropping to 30 frames when just walking around, really sucks.Graphicly/Aesthetically, it's awesome, and the soundtrack is amazing along with it. Good listening in and out of game.All in all, at the end of the day, the game feels like it's just a bit of a repetitve cycle with no clear reward at the end. Hop from planet to planet, hoping to find something cool next time, and get annoyed that you have to keep mining fuel to continue on. I beat the game, and it just didn't feel satisfying in the least.I've felt like I haven't covered enough about the game, but at the same time, I can feel (and see) that I've written too much already.I don't feel like this game is a worthy spirtual successor to Terraria, as some would like to claim. I had that notion back when it was indevelopment, but no more. I just see this as another blotch on my game list that I want removed.If you read through and at one point just said ""but there's a mod for X"" or ""wait for an update"". Then no, and no.The player shouldn't have to resort to mods to fix an issue, and I've done plenty of waiting, I thought one of the points of the betawas so they COULD fix things, and polish it all up. Sadly, it still feels quite raw and buggy, and just not worth my investment. I don't want to wait around longer for things to get better - That was suppose to be now.I dunno if the wait was really worth it is what I'm getting at.tl;dr This is a one way trip out into space. Wether you want to stay up there, or land somewhere else, well, you might get displeased either way.			"

								Starbound is an excellent 2D exploration game.  It contains features from Terraria, Borderlands, as well as many original and unique attributes. You get to explore a vast galaxy of randomly generated planets.You can raid colonies and dungeons for their loot. You can quietly farm on a safe forest moon and explore the galaxy for crops.You can play as a cute pink flower person that eats people and shoot robotic knights on robot horses with a laser cannon.10/10			"

								With extremely uncommon updates that focus on adding more and more useless crap instead of improving gameplay, lackluster world generation that can't produce anything interesting aside from a few pre-made dungeons, poor optimization and devs who are dedicated to multiple projects at once, I currently cannot recommend this game to anyone but roleplayers - it sure is a pretty chat room. Starbound has a huge potential, but if you want a fun, randomized side scrolling adventure with building and crafting, better stick to Terraria for now.			"

								I'm gonna have to not recommend this game. On further note, it is early access and not finished. The game just doesn't really feel right to me, in my opinion its more of a clone of your standby games that say to be sandbox. Its feel is just ""weird."" Sorry to say, I just wouldn't recommend it for the price, I would say to buy it to support the developers. Other than that, the game is pretty solid for an early access, the game plays out a lot better with friends.			"

								For two years the developers have done nothing but talk talk talk about how great the game is going to be. There are far larger and more complex games that have been developed in that timespan by fewer people. These people have taken the 2 million and run for the door. The game simply is no longer being developed and has been utterly abandoned by the development team. Bad investment. I will never do early access games again after this. What a scam.			"

A Brief History of Chucklefish and the CommunityFirst, people complain when the stable updates are too frequent to keep your save for very long.So, in response, they change their updating routine and create a nightly channel to see a snapshot of their progress every 24 hours.Nobody switches, ♥♥♥♥♥ing commences because they don't see any progress and assume the game is dead.In response, the dev team starts frequently blogging in order to show everything they've been working on, including the arduous task of refactoring code (which is very important, but you can't have snazzy screenshots to show for it)People don't read the blog, and proclaim that the game is dead.Those that do read the blog complain that the latest releases are buggy.Entitled gamers want everything now.Where is that picture of a triangular diagram showing fast, stable, and fun with the caption ""Pick Two""?Christ almighty people, you can't have frequent updates, have those updates include lots of features, and have them be stable. Either be patient, or help them bugtest by playing nightlies. Otherwise you'll leave them no choice but to halfass the content!What's that? The game? Oh, yeah, I think it's pretty good. I like the setting and character design, the procedurally generated content is impressive, and it's been getting better over time. If you're into voxel-like survival/design games, then this is a good choice. "

								The game looks much more amazing than it actually is. After the initial fascination you are quickly met with the very bland nature of this game. It's very barebones, similar to the first iterations of minecraft survival mode or the first release of terraria, if not less.Developing leaves much room for improvement, as the developers seem to spend more time tweeting and blogging about their COOL NEW AMAZING STUFF™ or whine about the upset customerbase instead of developing the game. When you see all the  ""previews"" they post daily in their blog you are excited at first and according to their roadmap the game should be about 90% finished. Yet there's not even half of the features implemented. Most of the screenshots are simply mockups, luring you with content that doesn't exist yet.This game sells solely on empty promises and mockup screenshots for now. I definitely don't recommend buying it yet and strongly advise you to hold off until Chucklefish actually has a plan on where they want to head with this game and it actually feels to become a game.UPDATE August 2015:It's been a year. They still haven't added anything significant, just more useless furniture. Meanwhile guns are still underpowered, mining yields no advancement past the first stage and planets are still shallow resprites with no interesting aspects. It still completely lacks mechanics, story, progression etc to make it a game, it's still a techdemo-stage sandbox without gameplay.			"

								The lack of a grasping point, and clear direction, leaves the game feeling incredibly stale. If their was more of an emphasis on expanding your ship thrugh space exploration, or colonizing a single planet and morphing it through the planets you come across, it may lead to a more satisfying experience.

								I followed this game for a long while. Checking blog posts on their main sites daily. Squealing over every single update. It looked smexy. The music was smexy. The hype was real.Heck, I even remember when the devs posted this video claiming it was their actual official trailer.

It was wonderful And when I first played, I can fully say I enjoyed my time. However, it did lack something that kept me from getting really into it.And so I waited. and waited.Update after update.All I can say is, that feeling of emptiness... like an incomplete game... it is still there; if not more strongly than ever.I feel that the progress and development of this game stagnated and slowed a long time ago, despite the constant updates.Don't get me wrong, the art and the music is still fanhioaejgajfafFgnbAfOMG <3, but it's everything else that doesn't quite click.Things that make me cry They removed the survival elements, so it's pretty much just exploration with little consequences. There used to be food, temperature, but none of that anymore. Apparently they're adding it back in for 1.0 so that's really kewl. <3 They said you would be freeeeeeee to explore. But you are restricted by quests to pretty much unlock all the important stuff. So you have lots of boring fetch quests or otherwise combat quests to even bother to progress. It feels unnatural and forced; these quests feel like a wall between you and the super cool stuff like big ships and stuff. That might be alright, if the combat didn't feel dreadfully awful, and if the mining wasn't 'grindy'. Hitting and killing enemies doesn't feel as satisfying as Terraria. The combat update did little to address this, there is not a lot of feedpack or impact when you do hit things with your giant future sword or awesome space shotgun. Just a little crinkle which I presume is the monster dropping gold, and poosh, nothing. Every monster feels the same, and is it just me, but where are the procedually generated monsters? You could bring up the arguement that the system just created similar monsters with the same components, but surely that's at least a bit better than seeing the same 'unique' monsters that spawn?This probably explains it better than I do. Planets all feel the same, and besides, you're just there to mine anyways. The planets feel copy+pasted honestly, and exploration becomes repetitive; eventually, all you'll do is pop onto a planet and mine. And the underground is nowhere as near as interesting as Terraria's, no matter how many dungeons they implement... it just doesn't have that charm. Although modding for this game is clearly an awesome and redeeming feature, I don't think that modding should have to fix the game. Playing without mods soon gets bland, and without them, there are problems within the games that aren't addressed. Such as contact damage with enemies even though they have attack animations I don't even mrgrgr.The idea of building a base among the stars. A planet claimed to be yours. A fortress filled with every single cool lil' trinket you found on your stellar voyage! It excited me. But I soon came to realise that base building was ultimately useless. The universe is ultimately harmless, and you have a ♥♥♥♥ing spaceship to put stuff in.As this game is nearing release, my hope for this game ever fixing the problems that stick out like a sore thumb are slim. Despite all this time in early access, the glaring issues I saw since 'release' are still there. But it's not like this game is horribly bad or anything. As mentioned, the art and music are wonderful, and the environments feel immersive and beautiful! But the combat system, the lack of freedom due to quests, the repetitive and boring exploration, and the overall blandness of the mechanics weigh it down.In my eyes, the content of this game, that seems to be praised, is measured by lines of dialogue and fetch quests.If you're going to play it with a friend, go ahead, you'll have heaps of fun with the beautiful worlds that will be generated for your space shenanigan adventures. Just don't expect much when playing alone.In my personal opinion, I would give it a 6.5/10. But I know there are lots of people that love this game a helluva lot, it's just that I, as a long-time fan, felt really disappointed in the end.If anybody is going to criticise me for the lack of hours I have put in, do take note that I used to play this on another account and have clocked in more hours than just 15.

								Incomplete game that coasted to the top on hype and is now taking a long downward slide towards oblivion.  After years of promotion, promises, and stringing along, you still basically get a shell or an engine with little to do.  99% of worlds are empty and boring, villages and interaction with NPCs is weak and boring, combat is still glitchy.    The game is basically a short grind for resources followed by a boring end game of exploring mostly empty worlds.   Stick with Terraria or Minecraft if you're looking for a game like this. Never buying early access again.			"

								While this game looked incredibly promising early on, the developer has not released much in the way of content or updates. Many of the initially promised features of the game have failed to materialize over the year that it has been in beta, and the game world feels very dry and uninteresting.  If you are under the impression that this game is ""Terraria in space"" as I was, it is a very long way from being anything like that. I still hold hope that in the future this game will live up to it's initial vision though I would suggest waiting until it is fully released before investing any more money in this developer.			"

								Fun at first, then it get's quite boring... ...and confusing. I mean, I know how to go to other planets but really, what's the point? I love the idea, but it feels pointless. It doesn't make it more appealing to play knowing the fact that it'll take ages to start. It barely gets any updates too.  I regret buying this, sadly. Hopefully it gets better when it's no longer a realy access game, but I can't recommend this one right now. I'll update this review later on when the game is no longer early access, probably some time after it happens though. 3/10, has potetial to get a lot better...honestly, I think we might have Half-Life 3 before this is out of early access.I wonder if Steam support would be nice and allow me to refund it, even after, uh, 2 years?

												Played this game all the way from its inception and I have to say I am dissapointed with the final product in relation to the time they spent on it.The problems are not with what the game is, it is a good game. It is what it could have been and to me the final execution feels rushed. So many reworks, I think they tried to achieve perfection and got tired with it and in the end released a ill thought out rushed game. Ok here are my main problems.The questline and story they added is terribleThe main questline features a few basic starter tutorial like missions to get you into the game and then basically has you repeat the exact same quest 6 times before facing a final boss. It is always worrying when the tutorial missions are more interesting and fun to play then any other part of the game. It is also so crazy short. I completed the game in 2 days with little effort which links in to my second issue.It is very easyThis is basically down to progression not being linked to the questline. Once your out of the starter missions and  you have repaired your ship, you can basically get a a top tier weapon and armor before actually doing any of the main questline. Progression in starbound is not bound to the questline or story. I think this was a design flaw. Sure you can just pace it yourself, but the even bigger issue is this my next point.You can basically mine everything you need to progress to the next tech tier in one mining runSo for example, when I unlocked tech to let me visit the fiery or frozen stars, basically the stars that had everything but the final ore, I was able to mine enough of every single resource needed to completely max my tech out in one trip. I was able to get enough materials to get all three of the end game armor sets and crafting stations. From one run. Then when you unlock the final planet ore, again one run gives you all the solarium you need to finally max out your armor and anything else you need. Thats it game is pretty much done. You should have a god like weapon by now as they can literally spawn in the most basic of chests anywhere in the game. So if you havent already beaten all the bosses, go and jump about spamming fire and complete them. Thats pretty much it which leads me to my next issue.I dont see any reason to play on once completedYou may differ with me in opinion here, but I really couldnt see any point in going back to play any more. I mean the fun is in looting and exploring right? So once you have unlocked the hardest difficulty planet there is no point in going to any others as the reward is worthless to you at this point. The side missions and 'town/villages' they implemented with npc missions are utterly pointless. Very low reward for doing repitive tedious missions. So basically 90% of the games worlds are no longer worth visiting at this point. You already have godlike everything which you found in the first chest you encountered on one of these planets. What is the point? I really hope I am missing something here but this was my experience of it. Sure you can max your ship out, sure you can try to build a colony, it all just feels shallow and completely pointless. Like features people wanted which they just added without any thought in relating it to the rest of the gameplay.I played terraria for weeks and actually found bits of it tough, I dont think I ever saw everything and the final boss was difficult for me and took me quite a few attempts.I honestly finished starbounds final release in two days and never really had any problems dying.What could they have done?Make looting make sense. So rubbish loot on the surface, better loot for quest rewards, more rare items the deeper you go etc. Make an end game where early game planets are still relevant.Make other game features like ship and colony building relevant and necessary for the main game questline.Actually have a decent questline with variation in missions and a lot, lot, lot more of them.Increase overall difficulty of pretty much everything.The final 4 tiers of ore are basically split on 2 tiers, 3 of them having equal weighting on a lower tier and then one final ore which lets you upgrade each of these 3 tiers to a final tier (we are talking armor and weaponry here). This was a clear of sign of rushing to me. These should have been four seperate upgrades instead of two. And so much more I could write all night but I am not going to.I have to ask myself, what did they spend well over a year on? I played ti with my friend before and we actually spent a good week on it and I remember having a lot of fun. There were not any quests and maybe one or two bosses I cannot remember, but the progression made more sense and the game was tougher. I remember actually struggling against mobs at points, we actually had to do the old build a wall around us with a peep hole to shoot out of trick to actually get through some of the tougher areas. Loot made sense as well, like it was actually worth exploring and looting stuff. What happened guys? I thought this was gonna be the game that kept me amused for months when it was completed.I could have beat ruin with my eyes closed.TL:DR In summary this is a fun game and an enjoyable experience, its just too easy, too short with a lot of worthless features adding nothing to gameplay and most damaging for it it has no replay value at all once you have beaten all the bosses as the game design makes 90% of the game worthless after this point.

Early Access Review
								(UPDATED 1/22/2016)If you want to see my old review, feel free to scroll down until you see the word ""Wow.""So it seems that the folks at CF have [finally] did a bit of necessary tweaking to the game and -- since my curiosity was peaked -- I decided to revise my review.Like last time, let's go over the key features:•6 playable racesWe were promised 7 at the beginning of the fundraiser, they have finally touched up on that. Racial traits like they discussed still seem to be absent.•A procedurally generated universe with unlimited procedurally generated planets After a while, it feels as if it's a copy/paste of the last planet you were on. This also makes building bases/houses totally useless. Good thing there are upgradeable ships and a few missions here and there to make it somewhat easier.•All content available in online drop in/drop out co-opTo an extent, yes this is true. But if you build a base in single player and want your internet friends to see it on a public server, not gonna happen. Which means you gotta fire up Hamachi (or the Starbound Server feature that's available via the launcher) and start up your own server. •Generated dungeons full of unique enemies They worked on a bit more variety on this end, which is good.•Randomly generated monsters With terrible AI and are repetitive to no end. This part still is true•Thousands of itemsFinally reached up to that point. I suppose building materials still count as ""items"" •A deep crafting system...Which runs on a mostly currency system, which you lose 50% of when you die. Oh, did I mention there's no means of a bank system? Still haven't fixed this bit since my last review. •PVP gameplayPvP in this game is a joke. 90% of the multiplayer community have more or less modded their equipment via Starcheat to one-hit kill everything. <-- You guessed it. Still a problem in multiplayer. •Own and decorate your own StarshipWhich they gave more space via upgrades, a huge problem that should have been solved on day one.•Develop your own home planetStill has yet to be implemented in the game. •Menacing boss battlesWhich now take place on maps you cannot edit, so there is a bit of a challenge with this bit now. •Procedurally generated guns and melee weaponsWhich, again, can easily be cuztomized to be stupid OP thanks to Starcheat. I have yet to understand why the devs added playerkill.projectile into their code.•Farming, hunting and survival mechanics Now it's time for hunting 101!1. Keep walking left.2. Click on the monsters3. Obtain meat!•Built from the ground up to support modding Probably the only selling point. Because does this game sure need it. Still does, however the vanilla version is far less reliant on that end.•Ongoing free updates Which are actually frequent! Yaaaaaaaay!•Multi-platform multiplayerBasically PC/Mac/Linux multi-platform.Final note: This game has still been in Early Access since the last time I wrote this review (So basically...I wanna say since 2013-2014?) and the multiplayer community is still as toxic as I remember, which is unfortunate to say. And I really hate to say this, since the game has lots of potential, but it's going to be -VERY- repetitive after a while. My recommendation? Grab a few friends, fire up Hamachi or the starbound server, get a Skype call going, and just enjoy the vanilla version of the game. By no means am I saying this is a bad game, but it could be SO much better. Save your money, folks.--Wow.Two years and four million dollars well invested, CF.For the low, low price of $14.99, you can buy a barely finished game (and has been that way for about a year now) that has little to no updates!Let's look at the key features, shall we?•6 playable racesWe were promised 7, they still have yet to follow up on that, along with the racial traits still untouched•A procedurally generated universe with unlimited procedurally generated planets After a while, it feels as if it's a copy/paste of the last planet you were on. This also makes building bases/houses totally useless•All content available in online drop in/drop out co-opTo an extent, yes this is true. But if you build a base in single player and want your internet friends to see it on a public server, not gonna happen. Which means you gotta fire up Hamachi and start up your own server. •Generated dungeons full of unique enemies Absolute lie. So far there are only a handful of ""generated dungeons"" that feel exactly the same most of the time. I can guarantee the enemies never change, unless you're in a harder sector.•Randomly generated monsters With terrible AI and are repetitive to no end.•Thousands of itemsBuilding materials don't count, pal. •A deep crafting system...Which runs on a mostly currency system, which you lose 50% of when you die. Oh, did I mention there's no means of a bank system? •PVP gameplayPvP in this game is a joke. 90% of the multiplayer community have more or less modded their equipment via Starcheat to one-hit kill everything. •Own and decorate your own StarshipWhich will eventually turn into nothing but lockers. If you want more space on your tiny ship, be thankful there's a mod for that. •Develop your own home planetStill has yet to be implemented in the game. •Menacing boss battlesWhich consist of you shooting behind a bunker or wall. Menacing my ♥♥♥. •Procedurally generated guns and melee weaponsWhich, again, can easily be cuztomized to be stupid OP thanks to Starcheat. •Farming, hunting and survival mechanics Now it's time for hunting 101!1. Keep walking left.2. Click on the monsters3. Obtain meat!•Built from the ground up to support modding Probably the only selling point. Because does this game sure need it.•Ongoing free updates If you don't mind waiting about...What, 6-7 months?•Multi-platform multiplayerThis is not a key feature. Unless were talking PC/console/handheld multi-platform, then is that a key feature.On a final note: I get that this game is in development. It has been for a year, which really holds no excuse as to why this game is terrible. I remember pre-ordering this game and being REALLY excited. You can imagine how disappointed I was after sinking $60 for my pre-order. For $5 less, you can buy Terraria (Which is actually a complete game! Imagine that!). Kind of shocking what you can do when you're not taking the whole dev team vacation after you release a sad excuse for a beta, eh?But, as promised, I will revise this review once the game is out of beta. If and when.			"

								So this was kinda a waste, also killed my willingness to ""pledge early"" or anything of the like. Loads of potential, barely touched upon. Planets are tiny and repetitive, only way to progress is to move to a new planet every few levels(which kills any reason to build a base) and really it just kind of feels empty, or souless compared with Terraria. Maybe time will fix it though, who knows.			"

								While it's not the worst game in the world, I have a hard time recommending it when the developers have been extremely unprofessional and have reneged on many features they promised during the initial funding drive. The game has also made little progress since the initial release last year.I'll change this if any progress does happen, but since the developers accept no criticism and the community has purged itself of all non-believers I have a hard time thinking anything significant will come of the ""1.0"" release set to happen on the next update.

Although I know they are still working on the game (At a snails pace) there is no excuse for this lack of support. The forums will shun you if you speak your mind and theres no way to really make suggestions without people ♥♥♥♥ing up your face. It was a great game at first, it started off how I thought it would, now greatly dissapointed I warn you about this game. It's not a shity game by any means, I loved this game at first. However, as it is, you will get bored very fast and you will regret your purchase. Perphaps in the future, when this game has many more updates, I will pick it up again and eat my words.			"

Early Access Review
								I have been enthusiastically following this game ever since they announced it with cool screenshots of Space Marines in a Space station boarding a dropship and pictures of planetside mechs and so on. The focus of the game has substantially changed ever since which is not necessarily bad - but a lot of design decisions since then disappointed me. When the game started as early access in December 2013, I was really looking forward to play it. However, I already had to stop trying it when it turned out that I couldn't reconfigure the keys. I opened a thread on the forum and it turned out that a lot of people asked for key rebinding as well. Some of the fanboys told us it would come with the next patch. Guess what, it didn't. Just like many other features promised, it was never realised. Almost ten months later they have not been able to implement a key rebinding interface even though they know a lot of their customers need it to play because they are not used to WASD. All you get is the usually pi**ed off hint that you can tweak some config file and practically reprogram the game yourself. So is this a negative recommendation just because of a missing keybinding interface? No. It still is an early access game and keybinding will probably even come in the final version (if there will be one ever). But the real problem here is an obviously incompetent team of programmers, who dont give a damn about their community. Instead they come up with lame excuses why they it takes them incredibly long to achieve minimal progress being employed by tons of money, the community paid them. One of my favourites was that they moved to a new office to another country to enlarge the chucklefish company. Yeah, wouldnt be surprised if the new office is on some nice beach and the staff extension was hiring a waiter for the cocktails. This is a deterring example for the risks of investing into early access software - you might like the idea, but you dont know if the team can accomplish it. In this case, it really looks like they cant and my money was wasted.			"

								In the beginning this game had huge potential and upside and I played this game extensively when the beta was released. Not much has changed since then (gameplay wise) and the game lost its initial appeal. DO NOT waste your time and money on this. Planets and biomes are pretty much the same with nothing unique to them, the fight mechanics are stale, tier system is garbage and boring because of the constant grind to get materials, this game pretty much lacks alot of content. There is no point in building a home or base or anything for that matter since you just end up moving on to different planets. The developers promised to add many unique and special things to make this game stand out but those were pretty much empty promises. After a VERY long wait this game has gone nowhere with nothing new to make it better. Every now and then I check multiple forums to see how far this game has progressed and always end up disappointed as no progress has been made. There has been no substantial update since December. The developers moved to Europe to be near each other in order to work on the game efficiently and push updates faster. What a huge lie. They pretty much took all the money they got from supporters and ran with it. This game has no future and no hope of ever being finished. Like most people said, this game is forever stuck in beta (if you can even call it that it feels like an alpha) and will never finish. Initially the full game was expected to be released in 2013 but after a multitude of excuses and empty promises I gave up on this game and so should you. Starbound and its developers are a huge joke and scam and as I said before save your time and your hard earned money for something better.			"

								As someone who followed the game before it was even officially named and just a mystery side project Tiy was reported working on. I can say that this game was a massive letdown on many levels. Back when we first got access to the ""beta"" I was beyond hyped to begin actually playing, but I couldn't shake that slow sinking feeling as I went through bland dungeon after dungeon exploring in the vain hope I'd find something genuinely interesting, exploring worlds didn't help matters either, funny for a game claiming to have a near infinite amount of worlds, that 90% of the ones I explored felt so samey. Even though the game is still in early access, I feel little optimism for the future of Starbound with the dev's focus being so weak. I advise anyone interested in this game to just watch from the sidelines and to not consider a purchase until Chucklefish pulls themselves together and finishes this game, or rather reach a concluding point where they consider it ""finished"".

By the time I decided to give it a go, everyone was so far ahead that I never got to experience that exploration, dicovering things for myself aspect of the game. Now, I am totally getting that from this game. I get to not only explore my own starting world (where I have built a pretty cool colony) but I also get to travel to other worlds and meet other civilizations and colonies. I am having a blast.Now a terreria vetran may still tell you that this game isn't as good or whatever but it certainly is special to me. I am really enjoying sinking time into it.			"

								Starbound has a great concept: copy ""Terraria"" but do it in space, with multiple character races plus more of a story. Unfortunately, we're now at around 4 1/2 months without a stable update. I expect there eventually will be a fairly complete version of the game, and it'll probably be good, but stay away until that happens. I mistakenly convinced three of my friends to chip in for a 4-pack of the game because of the devs' promise of a ""Beta"" in ""2013"". That promise turned out to mean ""a very incomplete alpha in 2013 December, followed by getting so wrapped up in moving offices to England that we go from stable updates, to rare unstable updates, to nightly builds that we literally said might blow up your computer and kill your dog"". What's really annoying is that the company has devoted repeated effort to advertising other games instead of putting full effort into this one. (Admittedly some of those don't involve the same dev team members, but it's still bad form.)In short, what you're getting if you buy now is a very incomplete ""Terraria"" prototype and a vague promise that you'll have a complete game whenever the devs can be bothered to finish it.2014.12.4: We're now at nearly a year past the first ""beta"" with no noteworthy stable updates since February. Basic features like quests remain very incomplete even in the nightly builds that are the devs' excuse for not producing a professional quality release (they had millions of dollars of initial funding) in nearly a year.

												The game, frankly, was a hell of a lot better when I thought it was ""bare bones"" but now I see it had more to offer before. It felt like an exploration sandbox where you set your own goals and did whatever you wanted on your own time with no one to nag you.Now?Well, theres this insanely half-baked and arbitrary ""story"" you have to put up with and its basically demanded of you to go out and scan enough things to fight a stupid boss repeated 6 times over untill you get to one of the most lazily named bosses I have EVER seen in a video game.Some more problems i have with the game include but are not limited to:Crafting has had roughly half of the racial items completely culled from the tables, making it boring.Un-needed crafting times of 0.5 to 10 seconds have been added since early access, which begs the question. Why even have them?No longer feels like an exploration sandbox.Race spesific ship AI was removed. (why?)It also got a lot more annoying.Guns STILL suck colossal dong.Game feels like it has less than when I considered it ""bare bones"".Start feels like it was there just to add roughly 2 minutes of play time for whatever reason.If they decide they want to actually improve their game, I'll change my reveiw as I have done with other things in the past but for now.

								I've had this game for years now, and it's always been one of my favorites. I find that it's much more fun to play with friends, but it's also a really fun/calming game to play by yourself. I love the exploration most of all, and I like the fact that there's been missions and a bit of a storyline added into the game. I think this game is a good one to have to play every now and again, but it's not one that I sit and play at every opportunity.

								BUY AT YOUR OWN RISK. After a string of missed promises, mismanagement and spending of the long invested money of both Steam customers and Kickstarter backers, Starbound development is effecitvely dead in the water. There is little to no hope of significant updates in the near future due to the total fracas of bad business decisions made by the developing firm Chucklefish. The details of such events can be found with a few rudimentary searches.In its current state the game has a very low level of progression or content, you have a small variety of biomes with pre-generated dungeons scattered and recycled through them, arbitrary grinding walls that simulate game progression but are really just time sinks to give you the illusion of gameplay. There is little to do with the items you collect and few items or avenues to explore in game. Combat is somehow more simplistic and blase then Minecraft or Terraria given SNES style AI of walk towards the player and attack and mininmal sprite based hit detection. As far as matching to the promised scope of the game the current iteration is no where close and has little hope of ever reaching there. It is doubtful it will ever lose its ""Early Access"" moniker.You are better off purchasing Terraria or some other sandbox game as this project has unfortunately fell victim to a classic case of business failiure, I can only stress my empathy for those who unlike a traditional investment model, must watch their money be wasted. I hope any dissatisfied customers find proper avenues to retain their 15$ or more after such a mess caused by incompetence and marketing hype.			"

												I loved this game, and I can't recommend it now. Now, before this gets written off as just another ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off reviewer because ""they broke my game,"" I just wanna point out some things that were better before and for some reason are gone:-Planets: Oh. My. God. Why did they make planets boring now? There used to be a randomizer for planets so you had a reason to explore and try to find the planet type you wanted with the weather you wanted in order to settle down for fun. Now you just run through the same few planet archetypes and be done with it. There's no fun in discovering a new planet now. Each one is the same as the last with minor variations.-Monsters: Monster variety is gone. They did away with the randomizer and instead added biome specific mobs and kept in a couple of random monster parts, but not many.-Crafting: Not a lot changed with crafting, except that they reduced what you could craft. Every crafting tier has only 2 weapons now. To make matters worse, everyone crafts the same weapons with endgame materials.-The story: It's not so much epic as just a thing you do. It's not even needed to progress through planets of different difficulty. You could play the game and do anything you want without ever needing to touch the quests past the beginning ones (which are necessary to fix your ship). There's just no point to it.-Random quests: Not. Random. Have fun running back and forth random locations looking for an NPC that the questgiver lost. Or you have to go deliver a thing. There's no actual randomness it's just those 2. At least as far as I saw and I've gone through like 100 planets.And apparently there was a thing with pets but I have no experience so I can't comment on whether good or bad.TL; DR: The game has a bunch of things that were gutted and are no longer fun. Because of this I can't recommend it as is. There are fun elements, but you'll soon be bored of planet exploration, which was the point of the game to begin with.  I recommend people on the fence just wait for more updates to add more stuff, and maybe even revamp some (looking at you planets. So disappointed). Otherwise it's just a normal sandbox. Dig, craft, build, fight. There used to be a great game and I believe there's one still.			"

The dev team is run by artists alone and appears to not actually have someone managing development, and with the series of unprofessional and childish responses to community threads made by many of the devs, I consider the game a lost cause. A real shame, but once they got their money the dev team stopped working on the product. Terraria is a much better and complete version of this game with many free content-filled updates being adding even now, well after release, give that game your money instead.			"

								I've clocked in something like 30 hours at the time of this review. This is because I was really stoked about all the cool features I heard were going to be implemented in the future and I wanted to have a good character to experience them with. I was hoping this game would be more space-oriented, but space is just used as a transition between planets and, by extent, the caves you'll be spending 70% of your time in, tediously grinding for resources to achieve the next armour/weapon tier. But hey, maybe this will become a good game. In the meantime, though, steer clear.			"

												Its Come a long way from early access. the process was a little drawn out in length, but the end product is by no means a bad game. If you are sold on the concept go for it, but... Its got its problems, and they need to be addressed because they take away ALOT of what the game could be. Meanwhile, theres a rather large Mod Workshop for what you probably deem annoying or bad. Just be sure you friends have them too. tl;dr: A review with high concentrations of salt and shattered hopes from the ages of early access. Mainly a giant checklist of problems or things that would have made the game alot more entertaining than it currently is now.Anyway, prepare for a VERY long list that im probably going to be updating pretty frequently. Poor Optimization aside... SHALLOW GAMEPLAY. Wiring is the most complex mechanic in the game. Gameplay outside of questing Is generally chalked up to 'mine X Ore to make X Gear'. When your gear gets outdated, you do it again with a different ore. The End-game consists almost entirely on building things since exploration doesn't mean much; and after awhile you're going to get tired of building. Easy End-game. With the exception of people, Nothing end-game poses a considerable threat to you. They are just a minor annoyance. you can heal at any time, almost instantly. Exploration isn't especially exciting.Same dungeon layouts, same swamps, same villages, and mostly the same terrain/biomes. part of what makes an open world game exciting is diversity. This game needs more. alot more. Or to atleast expand on the biomes that are already there. Mech's never saw refinement/rebalancing;they were REMOVED when they could have been implemented for higher level planets that required greater life support beyond an EPP. They are revamping mechs in a future update for more hostile planets. A planets danger level is linked Directly to its global biome. End-game adventuring is aimed at 'scorched' or 'volcanic' planet. Other planets will not be worth exploring. At all.This does cripple end-game quality, in addition to what already plagues it. EPP's require no power. EPP's do not require Oxygen. --- maybe its just a peeve of mine, but i don't necessarily think you should be able to go planet-side for an extended period of time without any need to manage your life suport. Would give an actual need for airlocks on airless planets, in addition to making standard gameplay more interesting. Minimal point in building a crew. They don't do much but stand in doorways, follow you and block your crafting stations.When Planetside, They hardly follow you a couple of yards without dying or getting snagged and needing to teleport to you. For the most part, they cant even keep pace.The only thing you will ever want are engineers, who raise your fuel efficiency to 100% and nullify the need for fuel... Which in in itself is a questionable mechanic to have. NO POINT AT ALL in building colonies or doing quests.  Colonists will give you a boring and mundane series of chores to complete and then reward you with somthing you probably just scraped off your boot and put in the trash 5 minutes ago- with the rare exception that you get somthing you actually could use. whole lotta dishes...But...They have a lot of food items, and i think thats cool, But there isn't hardly a point in making them. The buffs you get are pretty minor and last for a pretty short time. Because of the effort needed, you just end up sticking to canned food or rice. You can either buy fuel or obtain it from moons.  For some reason, fuel and *only* fuel can be found in massive abundance on these moons. They  added a mechanic to fuel gathering to make it more interesting, But it still feels a bit like a chore. 'Casual' players do not need to reach the surface in order to beam back to their ship. Maybe its just me, but I really hate that. You honestly might as well not even have the other character settings. At any time, another player in your party can warp to your ship and break or Steal anything they please.This one is kind of a big one. There are NO private containers except for your own pockets or whatever hidden planet stash you jealously guard. Nothing in your ship is safe.  No Race Diversity. One of my biggest problems with the game.The freaking FISH people can't breathe underwater.The Florans can't supplement their food/energy with a little photosynthesis.The Glitches- who are ROBOTS- Don't need electricity. They can suffocate and have to EAT.Novakids don't glow in the dark despite being made of glowing gas.they totally do.Races do not have different Diets or foods that they have to avoid eating.Honestly, everyone might as well just be  human. Novakid. Needs more creature diversity. in all the universe, why am I still encountering the same pre-made creatures? why can't I fight any giant creatures? Storyline is... meh.  im not spoiling much by saying that it's your standard 'only you can save the universe' story. Nothing in space to explore.No debris fields, no fuel stations, No ships, No research vessels, no space colonies, nothing.No, Outposts/asteroids don't really count. The only thing (that was added recently) that helps this were the vaults... Which really don't hold that much treasure and are filled to the brim with recycled mobs.As it turns out, they are adding more on the concept of space travel in a future update. No meaningful reason to Mine ore beyond crafting armor......Unless you are very desperate for money. Mostly Useless tech upgrades.  They actually REMOVED alot of useful Techs. Remember Bubble Boost? Energy Shields? Health Regen? Gravity Sphere? Not there anymore. and no matter how many times you skim over what remains of the tech upgrades, your standard techs are almost always going to be the spikey sphere, Blink Dash and the Multi-jump. Most other Dashes are nearly USELESS since the dashes don't move very far and grants no invulnerability frames.everything else has limited usability, both in concept and practice. Nearly all staffs except for staffs with 'Energy Restore' or 'Health Restore' are  USELESS . Staffs are hardly a vaild weapon choice seeing as you need to charge them for an uncomfortably lengthy period of time, during which you are slowed. The projectiles they shoot are rather unwieldly, being just as likely to crash into the terrain AROUND your target.Going back over staffs, ive actually found them to be my prefered weapon of choice. some spells are hard to aim reliably, but they just need a little more technique than the rest of the weapons. Somewhat uninteresting loot. Any loot you pick up just isn't too interesting. Theres Variety, sure, but its mostly cosmetic.Astoundingly more often than not, the alternate skill on a weapon is either impractical or has rather limited situational use. There are only three skills i found useful or fun to have: Rising Slash, Giant Sword (which can be used as a light source) and Flurry. HoverBikes Need work. Unless you took the time to flatten a good bit of the planet's surface (which is pointless unless you plan on building there), prepare for an uncomfortably bumpy ride where you have to step out of the vehicle every 24-yards or so and either carve out a path for yourself, or just pick it up and drop it on the other side of a mountain. Earth was the *only* protectorate planet? This is more of a nitpick with the story but...That was Seriously the only protectorate planet? There are no other outposts or colonies that protectorates were stationed? I thought that the protectorates were a big deal, why do they have no presence whatsoever in the universe?			"

								I've been playing this game on and off since it launched. Before that I was patiently waiting for it, keeping myself busy with Minecraft and Terraria. Games like these aren't for everyone, and I know there's been a war with the fans of these games claiming that they're knockoffs of eachother. Honestly, I don't really think that's fair. That's pretty much declaring all games of a certain genre to be knockoffs of one another. Starbound's got a lot of things that other sandbox's don't have, but it's also got a lot of things that they do have. Basically, Starbound plays like Terraria; a side-scrolling/do whatever you want type of game. It has RPG elements, crafting, etc. It has a pretty solid OST, but in my opinion it doesn't really feel Sci-fi. The sprites are gorgeous. The environments are gorgeous. And the creatures.... The creatures range anywhere from downright disgusting in appearance to cute as a button. The kicker is that the cute ones are often the nastiest, and will attack you relentlessly. I've not found two planets that were exactly the same. I'm the type of gamer that rotates from game to game out of boredom, but there are some games that are very special to me that I consistently play. Starbound is among them. I only recommend this game to gamers who have played Terraria or Minecraft and have an open mind. The updates can be a bit sluggish at times, but the changes I've seen have been glorious. And please for the love of Talos, opt into the nightly builds before you claim no changes have been made. Right click on the game, go to properties and from there it's pretty much self-explanatory. Happy travels, Starbounders. ヽ( ★ω★)ノ			"

""Hay yeah can I get a cheeseburger"" ""Yeah sure here it is by the way your mentally challanged"" ""Ok cool ♥♥♥♥ you from now on I'm going to macas""... He and a few others from CF have got some seriously bad press and quite frankly I think alot of people will not be buying from chuckle fish in the future because of the way they and others in the community have been treated if he handled complaints better I wouldn't give 2 ♥♥♥♥♥ when the game comes out but they abuse people cop when they whine is ridiculous there the people buying ♥♥♥♥ from you... If they want to be rude so be it... Suck it up be polite to them and there attitude will change and they will join your side and stop ♥♥♥♥♥ing... Treat them like ♥♥♥♥ and call them brain dead and of course they will continue to carry on like a frigin 3 year old... Anyways If you want to support people who seriously call there fan base brain dead and blame the lack of development on them then go ahead the game is fun I just cant stand the people behind it.UPDATE : Games worth it get it if you like terraria or other games simiar in design.

								With the 1.0 update aproaching(or its already here when you are reading this) i decided to give this game some love.First: Is it worth the money? Yes, the content you get is not only excellent but huge.What is this content?: A whole galaxy(no seriously a. whole. galaxy.) whith different planets like: Jungle, Forest, Ocean and more. You got your own spaceship to explore this galaxy(you can even upgrade it) also you can build your own settlements(Preston Garvy approved) with tons of materials, furniture and decorations wich will have impact on the settlers(example: build a castle and a knight will live there).You like weapons? no problem they got weapons, loads of them and they all have unique abilities like a laser beam or a flashlight. But you dont want to have weapons? You want someone to fight for you? Dont see a problem catch a creature with a ball and throw it(this seems familiar) .The creatures on every planet are unique in combat and looks, some arent cute and kill you others are cute and kill you.You get quests, you can explore, fight, build, eat, sleep and even the stars arent the limit(ignore the name, it lies).

												I wish I could be kinder to this game, but Starbound (a.k.a. Feature Creep: The Official Game Of The Movie) just isn't that great.Setting aside the farcically protracted development time, the long chain of broken promises from the developers, and the frustrating apologist community that refuses to entertain ANY criticism, the game never rises above being ""pretty neat, but impossible to recommend"". Planet-hopping in concept is really cool, and as block building-style games go, you have a lot of latitude to create some nice stuff, but much of the rest of the content is fairly vapid, and often only serves as an obstacle or chore that restricts you from exploration unless you participate in it to the game's satisfaction. Once you burn through all of the possible biomes and settlements the game can generate, and maybe build a thing or two, there's very little motivation to continue playing.The changes from beta feel very much like one step forward and two steps back in terms of tooling the game for fun and player convenience. For example, instead of making mining more enjoyable, ore has just been made more easily available through other avenues for players who want to bypass it, essentially mooting one of the primary gameplay modes. No such luck, though, if you hate the game's combat, because Space Farmin' ain't gonna kill the story bosses for you. In that sense, Starbound is more like a mediocre platformer with a huge amount of padding between levels and an excessive amount of optional sandbox side content. Most of my 200+ hours of playtime are ""unearned"", in the sense that the majority of them were spent planet-crawling or grinding for resources. In other words, sifting through randomly generated content just trying to find the one thing I needed. So maybe it's more like a sandbox that arms you with a plastic sieve and tells you someone dropped a quarter in it a week ago.The story itself might charitably be described as ""serviceable"", but the story missions are garbage. You can't build or dig anywhere to stop you from ""cheating"", but Starbound's combat and platforming are too shallow and unrefined to stand on their own, not to mention the fact that the mission maps are SO poorly optimized that I consistently crash out unless I run the game in a tiny window, despite exceeding the minimum requirements. In fact, I have to regularly save & quit every hour or so because there seems to be a memory leak issue where my graphics get corrupted. Did I mention you can sometimes irretrievably lose all of your teleporter bookmarks for no reason, a bug that has persisted for over a year? Seems like something you'd probably want to prioritize for release.A game like this lives and dies on novelty, which is fine, but the path to that novelty is gated by tedious, uninventive resource grinding and weak action platforming that runs contrary to the developers' insistent sandbox rhetoric. Copy on the official website claims that Starbound allows you to ""create your own story"" (unless you're playing a Novakid, who are completely excluded from the main storyline and still have no settlements, OOPS) and that there is ""no wrong way to play!"", both of which are patently untrue with the way the player is constantly shackled to tutorials and story quests that only have one ""right answer"" and staunchly refuse to let you think outside the box. There is no story or win state outside of playing the game exactly the way the developers intended, and for a game like this that promised so much and delivered on so little of it, that is quite unfortunate. Not only is the decision to make platforming and combat the ""core"" gameplay experience misguided, it seems totally arbitrary, considering planet generation is clearly what had the most work put into it.At this point, the game cannot be ""fixed"" with more content, balance tweaks or fan mods. What it needed was a more focused and unified development cycle, and a team that actually listened to player feedback instead of insisting that being able to play a flute in space was more important than releasing on time, and that ship has sailed.

								Not worth the $15This game has a lot of potential, but at this time the game hasn't had an update in months. Possibly one of the most generic games you could play. There is no real unique planets, once you visit one, you've literally seen them all. NPC interaction is minimal. Enemies are essentially cheap recolours of each other with a few swapped body parts, fight one and you've fought them all. Boss battles are uninteresting and unchallenging. Weapons are mostly dull and uninspired, dungeons can be fun once or twice before you realize hardly any of them have any real loot aside from the useless aesthetics you can plunder. Each of the playable races are statistically the same, esentially reskins of each other. They do have some unique stats on their racial armour, but that's just stupid and not an actual racial ability.Minibosses (ones you don't summon, they appear on most planets) are the same copy/paste generated monsters, except enlarged and given some more health. They don't even try to make the minibosses look good or fit in, they don't use the same resolution on them as other enemies. Instead it simply looks as though someone used the magnify tool on MS Paint and called it a day.I realize it's early access, but it's unacceptable for a game in beta that promised ""thick and fast"" updates to go months and months without any sort of update to the game. They do have nightlies, but they specifically say those aren't meant to be played.Don't give Chuckle♥♥♥♥ your money. Unless they deliver no less than what was promised, this game isn't worth your money.			"

												I purchased this game for my brother and I, an almost 30$ investent. I had played the game in the unstable betas a while back, and it had loads of potential. When I bought it, I fantasized about what amazing boss battles would be added, what new quests would be added to the outpost, how would they revamp the weapons, crafting, planets, ships. How amazing a central story arc would be. The game trailer had my hype levels through the interstellar roof. My main thought was: Could it even be better than before? The answer, my friends, appears to be no. In fact, the overall quality of the game has fallen drastically from what was there previously.-The weapons have become less amazing, random, and awesome than before. It has a lack of rare weapons (the cool ones being nearly impossible to obtain,) daggers and hammers are practically useless, and class armor is generic at best. I, along with some other gaing friends, were expecting some awesome end-game set boosts like gliding for avians or endless energy during the day for florans. However these never came true, and armor found in chests is next to useless before even leaving your starter world. Not only that, but all low-teir (copper, iron, gold) weapons were completely removed from the game. Character tech has also recieved a downgrade, with a very small amount of upgrades, and only one in each of the now 3 categories that is worthwhile (spike ball, sprint, and triple jump.) The bubble tech no longer exists.-The planet system no longer has difficulty sectors, but different teired stars, leading only to a mad dash to the glosest fiery planet for endgame loot. The temperature system has been replaced by the EPP, a barely-augmentable pack that is far too easy and relatively boring to make. Many of the RNG creatures have also become thngs of the past. The mechs, and amzing and fun planetary exploration machine, has been replaced by speeders so expensive that they become obsolete by the time you save enough pixels for them. The crew system, although beneficial, is a real hassle when it comes to upgrading your ship. Also the Erchius Ghost is a pain. Enough said.The story had amazing potential. I loved every second of the tutorial (grabbing both the flower and the cape,) and I couldnt wait to see what the outpost had. After finally reaching it, I was met with three quests. Three. One for the techs, one for the ore mart, and one for dreadwing. Remember all of those fun personal quests? Gone. Remember spending a hour on mazebound to cash in both a quest and an enormous sense of achievemnt? Pointless. Then we get to the ark. The scan quests? Tedious and annoying. That eigth race everyone was speculating about? Never happened. I remembered being so hyped for the new story quests after beating the Hunting Caverns. But it turned out that every single on of these was a glorified trapped puzzle labyrinth, each with its own theme, and each boss chamber was just a rectangular room. No variation, no truly unique battles. Just hit until you die or it dies, staying in the same room. In fact, the planetary exploration system makes it so you can have end-game gear before you even do the Floran mission, leading to really a broken system. Even after beating it, the ending left a bitter taste in my mouth.What Starbound desperately needs:-More inventive Boss Missions-A better exploration and teir system-More weapons and unique armors.-Better Techs and Mechs-A larger variation of creatures-The Outpost quests to returnA novel idea would be to have space pirates (a very realistic thing in a univese like Starbound's) that scales up in occurance and difficulty as you travel to better planets. When ""attacked,"" you could either pay a fine or choose to board their Randomly generated ship of hostile enemies (of any race, even the non-playable ones.) Once you beat the underlings and possibly a mini-boss ""captain,"" you could have a loot chest that also scales with the solar teir. Much like challenge dimensions, there would also be a hidden loot chest somehere in the ship. Once defeated, you would just go on your merry way.As much as I love Starbound, until it gets some serious updates, I wont be playing it again. "

								I've played this game entirely as a multiplayer experience.This is the most linear sandbox I've played.  After the first couple of upgrades and planet moves, I found myself on cycle of new sector> new planet> mine the one important ore> make the next tier of gear> make the tech upgrade> repeat.  The endless planets concept is interesting, but I felt like I was constantly on the move.  That almost entirely eliminates the building part of the game.Battling monsters is a joke at this point.  The AI needs to refined, and the monsters need variety, and hitboxes shaped like the sprite would be nice.Exploring is cool.  Planet surfaces usually have at least one unique structure or town but there is 0 satisfaction for visting towns or for exploring the more dangerous areas.If the game is truely still in Alpha, I would say the creators are on the right path.  If there is any consideration towards releasing this as a full game in the near future - my suggestion is to look elsewhere. "

								This was a great game, it was one of my favorites before the character wipe update that took out the hunger/cold system.  It's still a good game in my opinion, but it has fallen aways from where it came.  It's still fun to an extent and I hope that Chucklefish stops driving the game in the direction it's going.  Taking out hunger/cold completely, damage on contact, common monsters, and some other things are what really put the game down for me.  I still recommend it to anybody looking for an interesting sidescroller/building game, but it's not nearly as good as it used to be.  In my opinion I'd give it a 7/10.			"

								Terraria is an all-time favorite and I really wanted to like Starbound but.. I can't.There's a bit of bugginess and missing gameplay which is understandable at its current beta state so I'm not even going to touch on those. What really gets me is that absolutely nothing in the starbound universe is truly memorable. You can explore a planet (which takes entirely too long for how much there is to do on them) then leave and you rarely find anything worth looking at. The randomized monsters are boring. There's a lot of cool vanity objects but since there's really no point in creating a permanent base you never get to really mess with them. Digging is brutally slow, especially in the beginning.On the plus side, some of the names that can be generated for characters are pretty entertaining..			"

												The early access was brilliant, better than this stable version.Currently the game (1.0 release) has scaling issues and is quite imbalanced, underpowered towards the beginning and overpowered towards the end, with a middle game that barely exists as you try to power through planets to get to the next set of upgrades. It used to be a fun type of grind, but with the general need for more items (volume, as well as different type) to upgrade things it becomes gradually more frustrating. Although the pace for upgrading your MM and Tech feels a bit better.The change to equipping items feels terrible, initially I thought I'd get used to it like a person normally would, but it feels too unnatural. You need to equip many items in general: melee weapon, ranged weapon, torches, rope, trash blocks, flashlight, health kits. That's mainly for exploring, even then more items can be added. And for some reason many items that you think would be single-handed are actually two-handed. Great! Even more switching to do!The need for food to restore your hunger significantly adds to the monotony. Go out into that vast universe - and become a farmer! It does get better, but takes away from the experience nonetheless.The array of items and scenery is great; planets are much more interesting. Playing with friends has never been easier also!It's got a lot of potential, it always had. They're holding it back with trivial design and incessant chores.EDIT: I've deleted the comments that commented on my hours, I have at least 60 hours in total and that's a very conservative estimate.

Early Access Review
								Update 10/01/15 -I tried the new unstable 'upbeat giraffe' beta mode and there are a lot of improvements:- Questing and instances have been added, giving direction and proper goals to gameplay- Fueling your ship is more fun now as you know exactly which planets(moons) to go to in order to gain the fuel itself, making you explore a bit while silmountaneously getting rid of the old 'chuck a load of coal in your ship' method of fueling. The new system is generally less tedious and faster, while still making you work for it.- New biomes- More dangers on planets (heat, cold, radiation, lack of oxygen etc) and tech to survive such planets- Greater variety of random dungeons/building/loot to make exploring more worthwhile- Boss encounters kind of fixed, making it harder to abuse the game and use the old cheap methods of effortlessly killing bosses.The game is heading towards a point where I will reccommend it, but because all of the benefits I listed above (and some others i've forgot) are currently in an unstable beta of a beta, I cannot bring myself to change the nature of my review just yet.OLD REVIEW:<I looked forward to this game and bought it close to release, and had a bit of fun running about in a fairly beautiful (but kind of laggy/glitchy) world.With little to work towards I found myself getting quickly bored of Starbound, and I eagerly awaited some form of meaningful patch to add some content / fix bugs. However, said meaningful patch never really came and I was left disappointed because despite this review being negative, I really wanted Starbound to succeed.In it's current state I simply don't think Starbound is worth your cash. Theres a lot of stigma and negativity flying around lately where devs are claming they 100% ARE working to finish starbound and members of the community are strongly disagreeing with that claim.tl;dr : wait it out. If you insist on buying, do your research first to make sure you won't be disappointed.>			"

								Planets have barely any differences between them, almost every one is a forest, desert, or snow.Races are all human reskins, enemies are all the same, the only different enemies are the bosses, of which there are 3.1.0 was supposed to come out in 2013 ""No matter what"" <--- Those words were used more than the reused and rehashed dialouge in the game. It's been pushed back to 2015. Combat is ♥♥♥♥ with no differences except damage. Guns are ♥♥♥♥, and any weapons you find on planets are drastically inferior to anything you can craft at the time.There is barely any tech to be found.Tiy says that people like the game because 'people have a lot of ours in it' not including the fact that running a starbound server via the launcher counts as playing too. Giving you 2 hours of 1 hour playtime if you're on your server while hosting it. Don't bother hosting a server overnight or else you'll get 12 hours of extra playtime added to your profile.♥♥♥♥ this game, Tiy left terraria to make terraria in space, something 'Edge of Space' does 4 times better. This game is overhyped and it ended up as a steaming pile of ♥♥♥♥.Developers call everyone who complains about the lack of actual content self centered and accused people of having mental disorder (Narcissistic personality disorder) i swear to god they linked the wikipedia article and told people to check themselves for it.It doesn't help that they run the starbound reddit and forums, banning every single hair of opposition. The reason Redigit doesn't do this is because he actually takes the time to talk it out with people who dislike the game and ask what they'd like to see in it. Something Tiy doesn't do, nope, he sits back and watch as his 'community' (fanboys) yell at you, then he gets his moderators to ban you with no reason attached.Tiy and co do not work properly, taking time out of their day to play street fighter and to get in a trash can and pretend to be a robot.3/10, developers won't refund when you preorder it even though you preordered the full game, and early access wasn't even mentioned.

								If you're considering getting this game.  Wait.  Wait, till it is finished and released.The current gear scaling is pretty steep.  It's very easy to make your own gear that quicly removes any challenge what-so-ever.Each new planet you can travel to, is basicly the same and offers very little different from the planet you just left.PVE is either encredibly easy or very hard with little reward.Broken promises, horrible PR, and some outright lies, leave me with a bad taste in my mouth from this developer.It even seems that the publisher is trying to wash their hands of this.There's potential there, but will it ever come to fruition?

												I had high hopes for this since I bought it in beta, but the deveopers overextended and cut their losses into one boring, homogenous, ""you have to stop an ancient evil!"" storyline, instead of the ""you break down in the middle of nowhere and have to make the best of it, explore the galaxy"" thing it had previously. All races are the same except for looks, and things like the race unique ship AI have all been removed.

								Starbound is a game about traveling galaxies and has terraria influenced gameplay. Whats not to love? You start by choosing 1 of 7 races and customize it. You start on your ship and than the game will tell you how to progress for the first half. The boss battles are challenging to complete. You have thousands of planets to explore. This game has flaws like slow progression which impacts my opinion as I like games more fast paced. In the end though I rate this game as 9/10. It is a must-play for enthusiast of the genre.			"

								I really don't know what to think.It started as a good game but maybe they're trying to make it a little too user friendly.I mean, this game is fun (still not very much to do but still) but it's extremely easy if played with a little prudence. Like REALLY easy. Mostly because: -you can ""encage"" enemies during fights by building blocks around them (even bosses);-the fights are too simple AI-wise, enemies just run towards you fearlessly;-you can make water, poison, acid and lava disappear just by throwing dirt on it;Furthermore...there's ABSOLUTELY no reason to build houses since you can store your stuff on your ship and just warp from there to the planet and back (there's no way yet to spawn in different points of a planet so it's not like you would use your house more than once in a playthrough)Moreover, i know we're in beta but i think that challenge should be the first thing to think about when you're developing a game. I really appreciate your work but at the end, what i'm doing is taking walksReally, good job, the good ideas are there but at the end you just walk, dig and dodge sweet blood-thirsty bunnies.			"

								I know it's an early-access game, but a bit more content would have been great before it was out for purchase.  The last time I played it, there were a lot of placeholders for the item descriptions.  Combat and mining are a bit wonky and they don't really compare to that of Terraria.  Graphics are okay, but don't really do much for me.  Never made it off the first planet and couldn't be bothered to collect all the materials to make the first boss.  Also, the fact that you have to  make  a boss is a bit ridiculous.  I can understand finding an item or completing some action to summon a boss, but finding all the materials to craft it is tedious.  And if you don't beat it, you're stuck finding all the materials again.  I'd avoid this game for now, until there are more updates and improvements.			"

								This is more of a neutral review than anything. Starbound aka Sci-Fi Terraria is supposed to be a 'action and adventure' game, well all that lasts about 4 hours until you have finished basically the first half of the game. After defeating the first boss there isn't really much to do. You gather materials to build a house, then it either ends up destroyed or you kill the boss and that's it, Game Over. This is still an Early Access Game but you will get more enjoyment from playing Terraria than this. Starbound is not worth the money you pay for it and is only playable for a few hours before it becomes rather boring. If for whatever reason you are interested in this game just wait until they do further work on it or it goes on sale because there isn't much to the game as it stands right now.			"

								Perhaps I just hyped about this game too much. Ultimately it disappointed me a lot. I am a MASSIVE Terraria fan and although this was not meant to be the next Terraria by any means, it's just missing a lot of what makes a game like Terraria fun. Exploring wasn't necessarily the fun thing about these kind of games (in my opinion), however it's become the core of Starbound. Exploring and finding chests that contain rare **** that you can use to become more powerful than your mates isn't the same as exploring and finding a building filled with intelligent walking monkeys filled with items that do nothing but look pretty or perhaps heal a little health/prevent hunger. It's nice at first but then I just feel like it looses it's joy.To be fair, I preordered the beta so perhaps when the game is fleshed out a bit (a lot) more it will be more fun. I'll stick to Terraria for now.			"

												It's nice that you added a decent story, but all the quests now just feel like filler, including the sidequests.I want to love this game, but I really can't anymore.I remember when campfires were used as heat, and there was actually a point in moving to other planets other than just making a b-line to the nearest fiery star or frozen star, just to click on some objects to complete the quest, and then defeat a dungeon and then move onto the next star.This game used to be great. There was actually a reason to go to some random ♥♥♥ planet in the middle of no where, but now there's literally no point other than to make a colony, which I don't even see how it's useful in anyway.If you like a very short main story, this is a great game for you. If you like a game with a good long story that actual feels like an achievement doing stuff, don't get this game, or maybe you should have back a few updates ago.I have to say, it's a fun game, and it's a change from Minecraft or Terraria, or any other sandbox games, but until the devs fix the problems many others have stated, it's not worth buying.In the current state that this game is in, I do not recommend it, but if Chucklefish were to ever fix these problems, definitely get this game.Please Chucklefish, fix this game.

												Starbound at first looked like a regular 2D Survival game like Terraria. It didn't show me much information for me to be interrested. ""But hey, it does look like a pretty good game to play online with some friends"", and oh boy! I was sure right!This game combines everything that Terraria missed and combined with Minecraft's ""hugeness"" and multiplayer. It may be a bit harsh at first, but as you progress it gets only funnier and funnier. Small details that bring people together, just like instruments! You can play certain instruments in this game, and it even has a function to play as a band! It may seem small but its a huge thing to bring friends closer. The usual laugh mid-game of someone's desgrace and the excitement when someone gets an ""OP Weapon"". The mining adventures and get you lost deep inside a planet. The adventures on the surface battling through monsters and discovering villages of a friendly race. Not to mention the breaks to play a music as a band.This is a true game to play with friends. I recommend 100% this game. Yes, it does has its flaws like wipes and character's deletion. But it's in beta. What did you expected? A Bug-free beta game?Starbound is a great game and it's worth all the money I gave for it.Best of luck to the developers!			"

												A game too ambitious for its own good.That's the tragic story of Starbound in a nutshell. I've played it numerous times since the early access, hoping that each iteration would bring forth new content - but in the end, none of those times felt like it was something worth revisiting. Even the fabled 1.0 update, where the game is now fully-fledged and no longer in early game access after three years doesn't feel anything like it should.Starbound has a lot of great things going for it. The artstyle and presentation of the graphics, while slightly shoddy at times, is well animated and distinct. None of it feels muddied and it has a lot of charm with some of the non-random enemies. The music, while repetitive at times, is relaxing and comfy to listen to. Building your own ship, gathering up crew, making little colonies on planets stocked with people you've hired for the task, Starbound is keen on letting you explore the universe at your own pace.But therein lies the biggest problem. Starbound is not just a sandbox game, but a sandbox game that is generated across an entire universe. There is only so much you can do before you start running into the same biomes, the same structures, the same villages, the same enemies and their attack patterns. This same problem feels eerily reminiscient of another game, No Man's Sky.I will say this. Starbound, compared to when I last binged on it two to three years ago, has changed both for better and worse. There is a more streamlined story, more items to grab, more villages and towns you can visit, but with it, the unique quests you get from the Outpost has been virtually made obsolete, barring a handful of them. The crew you take on might as well be robots - they don't say much of anything and rather, their only flavor text is their name and mood. Even the main side characters get maybe a whole page of dialogue altogether outside of their recruitment missions. They don't say anything memorable. In fact, Starbound as a whole doesn't feel memorable. Why is it that its precursor and competition, Terraria, is that much better?Because Terraria doesn't rely on random generation beyond its overworld. The enemies, items, and whatnot are all mostly going to stay the same in every world generated. Some might appear, some might vanish, but it is a far more static game than Starbound. In fact, Terraria doesn't even have that much of a plot. And yet, it's by far, the superior game due to the amount of unique items, enemies, armors, strategies, and so on and so forth. On the other hand, Starbound enemies, items, armors, and even the main playing strategy are pretty much the same. There are some neat abilities, but due to their random nature, your Beastmode Billywhacker will eventually be replaced by a Junky Moleseeker. In fact, a lot of it got downgraded from the last time I played. I remember when even the most random of enemies had some sort of special move that would force you to adapt. That's all been given to the unique monsters, which are just as dumb. Starbound's progression is extremely weak and the only thing that changes is that the numbers get higher as you go up the ranks. Terraria's difficult combines that with smarter and more varied enemies. Even the NPCs in Terraria are far more talkative than the ones in Starbound. In fact, if Terraria's graphics were better, there would almost be no reason to play Starbound.All in all, Starbound is only fun if you wish to build and explore with friends. The game, much like our own universe, feels too sparse and dead to warrant anything other than a curious playthrough. It's very much just mining from world to world, running into the same structures and biomes, with little variation in between.I can only recommend it if it's heavily discounted on sale and you got friends who can tag along. It's nowhere near being the total package that was promised all those years ago. Buy Terraria instead, since not only will you be saving five bucks or so, but you'll have way more fun than going through a developer's tired, broken dreams.4/10. "

												This is a pretty honest review that I can give after playing through the story and going up until end-game.To note, it took me 3 days of playing to do this.In all honesty...I get the impression that work was put into areas that were not that important compared to others.Progression is linear and simple, like so:- Get Thing- Use Thing to get to New Planets- Get New Thing on New Planets to make New New Thing- Use New New Thing to get to New New Planets to get New New New ThingThis rinses and repeats for up to 4 times.Pros:- Pretty, lots of variety in some worlds, interesting concepts, nice dialogue- Plenty of vanity items to collect and display- Ship can be upgraded, which wasn't a thing back in Beta, which is great- There's actually a story now- Plenty of cool weaponsCons:- There are only 4 rarities (White, Green, Blue, Purple) with no legendary weapons- Years in development yet feels incredibly basic still- Bugs and loading issues that cause you to stick in the air like a Minecraft Sever (Gross)- The Story is ♥♥♥♥ and short- The only 'truly legendary' weapon is ♥♥♥♥- There are only 6 tiers of armor- There are only 5 mounts- Crew are useless- Very little 'rare' or 'exciting' content that requires you to grind to be satisfied- Up until end-game it's difficult to farm up resources for specific armor, and it ends up being easier to loot weapons, sell them to vendors, and buy the armor- Various 'gates' throughout the galaxy around various stars yet they all lead back to The Ark (even though you have a permanent teleport to there)- Very little missions outside of the Main Story- No reason to build houses other than for purely cosmetic reasons simply because you ship can hold everything- All workshops have roughly 3 tiers of upgrading and don't unlock anything interesting- You have to farm around planets for days to find theme-based equipment- Pets are useless, but admittedly cute, so that's not all bad- No 'large' or legendary monsters. There used to be some in beta that dropped epic gear.- Challenge areas are no challenge and the loot is terrible- Mystery bags are just horrible. Literally horrible. There's no point doing quests for the measly pixels and all of 1 matter manipulator core- No epic rewards for finish the main story, admittedly the most you get is, literally, a thank you card.All in all, it's not worth it at the moment, even with it's official release. It just feels very lackluster and bare-bones for what was meant to be a long time coming. Terraria made it's way in less time and had WAY more content than this.			"

												Starbound holds  a special place in my heart. I've had the game since 0.1, and on multiple steam accounts. The game has always had the best oppurtunities to become one of the greatest games around, but it never QUITE made it.All of that changed with the recent 1.0 update, marking the full release of the game.You know have a fully pledged story, with interesting and deep characters, insane ammounts of lore and backstory and over 8+ bosses.Talking about bosses, they range from everything between a spider made of flesh, to a penguin in a futuristic war machine. Every boss is very unique, and their attacks never cease to suprise me.There are 6 classes to choose from; A robot, A fish, A plant, A collection of gas, An ape and of course human. This sounds very bazare, but as soon as you create your character, you can already read a simple recap of the races backstory.Starbound is a sandbox gme, and it is a prime example of what a sandbox game should be. You can choose to never mine a single peice of ore, never craft a single peice of armor and wether you want to live on your ship, or on one of the unique procedurally generated worlds. There is thousands and thousands of different blocks and furniture, which comes in great use with the colony system.The colony system consists of you creating a house, and putting a colony deed inside. The colony deeds cost 750 pixels (the ingame currency). You can choose who will live in the house by either decorating it with old chandeliers and bookshelves, or weapons and armor. You can get everything from a merchant to a guard, and they all come together with the procedural quest system.Quests (That arent outpost or story related) are always procedually generated, yet they're still all very unique and fun to do. The people who will give them to you are either random NPC's or inhabitants of your colony.If you so happen to complete a lot of quests for a specific NPC, will he request to join you on your adventure, as a companion. It is only possible to have to companions with you at all times, but it can range verything from a penguin to one of the many races of starbound. The sandbox aspect comes in very real here aswell, as you can either get companions by making colonies, ore buying your way to illegal penguin mecenaries.If you get enough companions on your ship (You can have as many as you want, just only two with you) your ship will get bigger, leaving you with more room.There is an infinite universe to explore with many weird and funny biomes, and deep and interesting dungeons.The weapons of Starbound; The weapons come in many shapes and forms, some silly and some deadly. They, like so much else in this game, have prodcedurally generated stats and looks, which means you will find something cool about almost every weapon you find.Verdict:If you want a game with litterally endless things to do and create, and many unique enemies and weapons, you're at the right place. Starbound is huge, and for the gamer that likes to read, there is huge amounts of lore to dive in to. There are plenty of easter eggs and references scattered around the massive diverse planets, just waiting for you to find them.9/10			"

												Ok, so Starbound, it's fun! I mean, you can build, craft, fight, etc. Like Terraria, but in SPAAAAAAAAAACE! Or that's what people say, that Starbound is just Terraria in space. Which is false, to me anyway. Starbound is so much more open-ended, expansive, etc. than Terraria (In my opinion anyway). Anyway, now for my reasons as to why you should get the game. Just Came out of Early Access.A lot of people before were whining about how little there was to do, but now that it updated to 1.0, you can expect a buttload of stuff! I have reached the endgame, and I still haven't discovered everything myself. So there will be no shortage of content. Easy ModdingAnd if you hypothetically do discover everything in the game, there is a very active community just pumping out mods which are as simple to download as a click of a button! Hell, you can even modify and make your own weapons/items with a program like StarCheat which is so easy to do, even I managed to do it! In-depth ExplorationMany people complain that all the planets are very similar, and I think that's because they just skim the surface of the planet and then claim it's not original enough. I'm sure if they took the time to look the planet over, you'll discover so many cool places and strangely unique NPCS. Just give it a chance before you hop onto the next Radioactive Star.Story/CharactersOk, so serious talk here, shame on anyone who says the story is too simple, like seriously screw you. You should not be expecting Oscar worthy writing from a game based on exploration, and adventure. It's a wise decision by the Devs to allow the game's story to be simple, and allow it promote exploration. I won't spoil the story here, but honestly get the game and experience it yourself. The story and characters, simple as they may be, are extremely colourful and fun, trust me. Better than TerrariaIt's better than Terraria.Oh and another point, stop comparing Starbound to Terraria. ""But waah they're both games with pixel graphics and crafting and-"" No shut up. You should never compare games together unless if they are extremely similar, and Starbound and Terraria are two totally different experiences. Yes, so what if they both have pixel graphics and crafting? Just because they share just those two aspects is so ground to start comparing the two. Next, you'll be telling me Terraria is just 2D Minecraft, seriously, stop it.Well, that was my first review. A few final words. Honestly, just get Starbound now, even if you like it just a little. It's a wonderful, and colourful experience unlike any other which really deserves more attention, And c'mon, it's only 10 bucks.(PS, that last point about Starbound being better than Terraria was meant to be a joke, not an actual point as to why you should get the game.)EDIT: BTW Thanks to the guy who pointed out some grammatical mistakes I made.

												Starbound is a game in which you can lose hours upon hours having so much fun that you can barely sleep without thinking about it.edit: Now that the game has fully released, I feel I need to add some more things to my review. This game has evolved in many ways, and still is. For a game that is so simple, it really has a certain depth that you can't help but get hooked onto. Singleplayer and multiplayer are both really fun to do and I hope that all that start playing this game enjoy everything that is has to offer along with the mods that community members have worked hard to share with us. Enjoy the ride.			"

Early Access Review
								If Starbound was a Simulation game, it would be called ""False Promises: The Experience""At first the game was very promising. It had quite a bit of content to start with, and there was more coming.Then the promised content got delayed. Then it got delayed again. Any updates we got were just filler to make it look like the game was actually going somewhere. On top of that, those updates constantly killed mods, servers, and save files. I revisited the game recently, and I can safely say that it is not any better than it was when it originally launched, in some ways it's even worse than it was originally.The game falls under the same problem that a lot of Early Access games have, where the devs say ""Hey we aren't going to be like all the other Early Access people, we care about who buys the game and will make a lot of updates!""In short, they are exactly like those people. Games like Starbound are the exact reason that the Steam refund feature exist. If I could refund the game now, I would do so without any regrets.			"

Early Access Review
								I have 300 hrs on Terraria playing w/friends and family. We enjoyed it so much I bought 2 4-packs to play w/my family. Once we finished expert mode on Terraria, we were excited about Starbound because one of the devs on Terraria created Starbound. I bought 2 4-packs of Starbound to play w/my family. We haven't installed them all. The game is just boring, the combat is repetitive and pointless, the bosses are not worth fighting once, much less more than once. Worst of all are the mobs. They could all be the same. It doesn't matter if you procedurally generate many more things if they are all essentially the same boring thing underneath. Oh look a rat pig bird. Hey an eyeball dinosaur. You fight every single mob the same way and they fight essentially the same way. It just doesn't much matter.Infinite is not better. A well planned out, designed, crafted finite world with finite monster types with well designed and balanced mechanics is MUCH better than inifnite, procedurally generated junk. I don't want to play Starbound anymore, it's no fun. It doesn't matter that the universe is infinite. If it's boring, it doesn't matter. Can't wait for Terraria: Otherworld and Terraria 2. Hope someday Starbound gets better, it has potential, but right now it is just boring. I regret my purchase.			"

												Starbound is essentially Terraria... if Terraria were a mediocre amalgamation of 15 genres at once. The best word to describe Starbound is tedious. Everything you do in this game is tedious:Mining takes forever, and one misstep can get you killed. This wouldn't be a problem if the controls worked well, but they are extremely awkward. Also, in survival mode you lose money and drop all your important items on death, so if you die somewhere where you can't get them you're basically screwed.Farming is absolutely pointless. The plants take way too long to grow, planting the seeds and watering them take forever, and it makes almost no money. Not to mention the fact that inventory management is incredibly awkward and frustrating. Exploration is boring as hell.  Planets are all just generic biomes like desert and forest and plains. Also, there's really no point to building a base on a planet because it's just a waste of resources and you can just put all your things on your ship. Speaking of the ship, it is very minimalistic. There's no deep customization, just (exteremely expensive) size upgrades. Also, it is incredibly slow. The way you travel between planets is just clicking on it and then waiting. There's no interesting gameplay of any description. The space travel is nothing but a gimmick.The story really has no place in this game. There is absolutely zero orignality to it. Just the standard find all the things to kill the giant monster. I'd say the character interactions are pointless, but you can barely even call them interactions. You have no choices, and the text always goes by too fast or too slow. Also, the dialogue is dull as dishwater.Gear is horribly implemented. It works similarly to something like Borderlands or Diablo, so you'll be getting tons of useless items that clutter your inventory. And the combat is basic as hell. Every enemy functions more or less the same.In conclusion, this game is just a lesser Terraria which is more expensive for no reason. Please don't waste your time and money, and play Terraria instead.			"

Early Access Review
								Short update 9/10/2015:Seems Chucklefish has no idea where they are taking this game... They just keep adding filler content, ignoring the core, whilst making game easier and easier (hunger and environment hazard removed, ship expansion added) which makes doing certain things pointless (hunting monsters, building bases)... I honestly see no reason to go full-on back to this game, and if this headless direction continues, I see no reason to recommend this game neither... pre 9/10/2015:I bought this game when it was new, and it starts to be over 6 months ago. First month or so this game saw two to three updates that included character wipes and somewhat new content. Ever since that third and ""last"" wipe according to devs, there have been no real patches.About 3 months after release of this game, devs said slow updates were due to their studio being relocated. Okay, seems they got some dosh from starbound, maybe they´ll be now productive in their new studio, I tought.Now, last month after 5 months of no patches, this game saw ""nightly"" mode update, which is supposed to be sandbox mode that players can mess with and get latest content updates while devs actively update it. I have to concur with many critics, this is HIGHLY lazy way to patch and update your game, instead of feature patches they give us sandbox where you get your weapons with console codes if you dont want to grind. Well, this ""update"" truly is ""Nightly"", as it now every time I log into steam downloads and updates itself, but for some reason, they just don´t get it to stable. It crashes for me on launch, and as far as I have read community hub, I have not read a single comment that says it works and launches the game properly.I don´t really have any faith in this game anymore. It was quite fun-ish grind-a-thon 20 hours I played with few friends who I had been waiting with drool on our mouths for starbound all hyped up. But at it´s current state, this game really is nothing but grind-a-thon. It´s like terraria in space, except worlds feel empty and bosses dull.With starbound, I think this is slowly turning out to be second Early Access game that I actually had faith in, but just wont be really finished and promises fullfilled. I´m not surprised if this game gets in all silence 1.0 update next 6 months or so, and then starbound devs will pull what stardrive dev did and announce that they are working on bigger and better starbound 2.

								Still clunky as hell, progression is terrible, 1.0 update out of the blue from an Alpha (Schafer is probably a great role model for Tiy), no stable update for several months.For now, don't spend your money on this.UPDATE:Wow, Tiy pushed an update! I wanted to celebrate a patchless 1 year anniversary, but oh well.Now, this update actually added a LOT of balance stuff to the game. The game is no longer unplayably clunky, for one! There's now a storyline which, so far, adds absolutely NOTHING to the game, other than boring fetch quests. FUN! It goes something like this: Get MM, craft table, bow, cook meat, dig to the ♥♥♥♥ing center of the planet for core fragments, go to outpost, get more boring fetch quests, and after completing 4 of these, I stopped playing. Although Liy and Co. are getting closer to nailing the formula with upgradable matter manipulator and such. it's still very, very, very, very far from a game I'd recommend to people. Hey, you like boring digging? Dig in.			"

												Starbound is now out and I have completed the story so I can give a proper review of it. I will be covering what I consider to be the main aspects of the game.Story-8/10The story of the game is that a big monster blew up Earth and you escaped so you now have to find 6 artifacts that open the gate to the monster. (You find this out in the first hour.) The story has that Bethesda feel, where the game is like ""oh no, this thing happened and you have to do something!,"" but you can just ignore it and do your own thing. The story is an interesting aspect, and actually takes you to the different planet types so you have time to upgrade your armor and weapons. I think that story isn't completely necessary, but it works well with the concepts already established.Combat-9/10The sword-and-gunplay is fun and focuses on dodging enemies. Your ""Matter Manipulator,"" which is a building tool, can be useful for creating cover and such, but some enemies can go through walls. Each 2-handed weapon has a special ability, like grenade launchers and flashlights on guns or spin slashes and warp slashes on swords. There is a variety of weapons, allowing a ton of different playstyles. The bosses in the game are also very well designed and offer up a challenge when you first fight them. These bosses are located in developer-designed dungeons that have many secrets located in them. The combat never gets stale and fights are always interesting in one way or another.Exploration-5/10This aspect isn't the best part of the game. You usually see the same biomes and monsters over and over and while some monsters are randomly generated, by the end of the story you've seen all of the environments in the game already. It is fun at the start of the game, but it quickly gets stale and boring. Randomly generated dungeons are cool, but you often find the same style of dungeon as well.Building-9/10Building in the game is surprisingly deep and interesting. The colony system offers up an interesting thing to do after the story. The foreground and background building is similar to Terraria, but the game actually offers a good reason to build decorated houses so different tenants move in. This is one of my favorite parts of the game and I have spent hours searching for the right materials for my houses, which leads me to find new things in the game as well.Soundtrack-10/10The soundtrack in this game is beautiful and the main theme is one of the most memorable tracks that I have ever heard in games. I cannot stress enough that the soundtrack is worth buying and it adds a layer of charm to the game that I rarely see.Overall-8/10Starbound is not the best game ever made, but it definitely has a large amount of content that makes the game interesting for hours. It seems that this game was a board that ideas were thrown at, and some of those ideas stuck and mixed really well. The game also has a kind of charm to it that you don't see in AAA games. Starbound has been a great project to watch as it grew from alpha to beta, and finally to 1.0. Starbound has, in fact, left orbit and hopefully will go interstellar in further updates.			"

Early Access Review
EDIT: It is now October 2014, and the developers have FINALLY started to add more content, like (unstable) night builds that you can try, steam trading cards, and other very small things. Still recommend you wait a while before investing your time into this game, when there are much better, fleshed-out alternatives, like Terraria.This is a pretty tricky review to make, as there is a lot to weigh here.I had a early-access/alpha/beta phase, and the two games I enjoyed the most were Project Zomboid and Starbound. If you like voxel-crafting/building and/or adventure games like Minecraft and Terraria, then you should definitely check out Starbound. You will most likely enjoy it. I had really enjoyed Project Zomboid, and tried Space Engineers because I love sci-fi space themes, but settled on Starbound instead because of the playability. Also, the idea of travelling to numerous planets and exploring was the icing for me - I love exploration, open-world games.The aesthetics of Starbound are very, very nice. There is quite a bit of detail in the objects and environment. The armor and weapon aesthetics are fantastic and plentiful. Whenever you destroy any thing in the environment, it will turn into an inventory-icon-sized version of itself, and can be picked up and replaced (if you so choose). The music is very well done and makes you feel like an actual space adventurer.The controls are not difficult to familiarize yourself with, and the learning curve is average - you just have to get used to mining a lot for your materials and planning your crafting recipes. There are a variety of planet types to explore, each with different types of monster creeps and randomly-generated areas. You can travel from one side of the planet all the way to the other in a full 360 degree scale, and it is recommended that you do this in order to ensure that you aren't missing anything (like a settlement or ruin) and so you can maximize your ship's fuel consumption.Currently, you can select a planet you have visited as your ""home planet,"" allowing you to teleport down to it regardless of where you are in the universe. Initially, fuel comsumption restricts your space travel significantly, however, it does not take too long for you to be able to travel to the farther areas of the universe. There are also tabs for different regions on the space map (once you meet the prerequisites and unlock them), and each provide more challenging planets to explore - which also provide much rarer materials and loot. The number of planets available to visit is spectacular, as you have to visit space clusters, then pick solar systems, then pick visitable planets (like a super expansive map version of Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic, and Mass Effect). I was very impressed by the selection, and knew that it would be extremely difficult (and time-heavy) to visit every single planet in the universe (and once you consider the multiple tabs you unlock, it can get ridiculous).If you are playing the game vanilla (with no mods), the game can be very frustrating and difficult, especially considering you cannot ""sell"" most items in the world, which makes looting and dismantling that cool robotics laboratory you just took over less rewarding. One of the biggest problems with this game that you will read in reviews is the lack of developer involvement, evidenced by how it is now July 2014, and the game was supposed to be finished in 2013. It was then changed to the beta being ready in 2013, however, we still have a very incomplete game. The quest variety is minimal, consisting primarily of just each character's main mission (which is basically the same thing for everyone because it results in the same items required to craft and bosses).The developers are currently releasing night builds, which provide a window to see how the most recent game build looks, however, it is not completely stable and may result in the loss of your save if you are not careful in backing it up.Starbound's best feature, and biggest saving grace, is the powerful mod support and community. There are mods for almost everything, from changing your ship, to custom races, to stores that give every object in the game, to custom objects (weapons/equipment/etc), to custom missions (some of which are extremely fleshed out and well done), to looking after your own colony. There are even mech battlesuits that you can pilot, the possibilites are (not so) endless. There have been a lot of complaints, however, that the mod capabilities are severely restricted by the game's design. If you look at the current list of available mods, the community has still done an amazing job of providing filler content to the otherwise lacking shell of this game (once you've beaten the main missions and explored the universe for a while).If you are very interested in voxel-crafting/building games, like space exploration and adventuring, and fully understand/accept that this is a (significantly) unfinished game progressing at a very, very slow pace, then give it a try. If you are only interested in building/crafting, then you may want to also consider Space Engineers.Recommend, but with caution - perhaps wait until it has become more developed (into what it promised so long ago to be). For this reason, I have kept the final decision as: ""Do not Recommend.""Cheers,DJSF @DJSF's Rogue Reviews "

								Don't buy this game untill it is fully released, and even then with caution. Devs released to beta and claimed the updating schedule would be ""hot and heavy"". What we instead got was SIX MONTHS+ without updates, all they have done with the 20mil the raked up was buy office space and start publishing other peoples games. Any negative criticism of their game results in a ban on any forums they administer. Extremely shady business practices beware!As for the positives, this game can be very fun, upon release I was satisfied as I played with the assumption there would be regular updates to the game. The modding community is amazing, and they are hard at work salvaging gameplay from what sometimes feels like an abandoned game. If we do finally get updates again I will probably reccomend this game wholeheartedly. This is an early access review and as such I can only say I wouldn't ever trust buying a chucklefish early access game again.TLDR: Don't buy early access, wait for the full release (Late 2015 if we are lucky) "

								I bought this game back when it was released on early access in December 2013, it's now 9 months later and the game has only been updated 3 or 4 times, and none of those updates have made much difference to the game as it was at release.They have nightly updates apparently, but since the lead dev has stated that nightlies aren't intended to be played or tested, and indeed that they don't want any feedback on them at all, they are just there to show progress being made on the game.  I don't think these count as actual updates.All in all, I'd recommend waiting for the game to be released (whenever that may be) before buying it.			"

								I remember when this game was first announced. I was super hyped for it. And then the pre order dropped. Dropped fifteen bucks on it a week later. And then the wait. Finally the beta came out. And for awhile it was pretty alright. Played this game with a number of friends online and then we just stopped because there was nothing to do. Planets get repetitive really quick. Once you find a bone hammer or a legendary gun you are pretty much unstoppable. Ive gone from copper to impervium three times over in coop and twice solo. I was really hoping the developers would have stuck to the schedule they laid out a year ago but it doesnt seem like they give much of a care anymore. The game was supposed to have gone full release six months ago and its  still in beta with a majority of content still missing. Developer has also since rescinded on their refund option for dissatisfied customers so I am stuck with what amounts to a not even half finished game with no full release in sight. More disappointed than angry that the developers couldn't or wouldn't deliver on their promises. I got a good amount of time out of this game but I would get a refund if I could.			"

								God damn it. This game had so much potential. I don't have a lot of positives to give on my pros/cons list, but I'll try.+Interesting  theme+Tons of items/weapons to find and create+Lots of NPCs-Almost NEVER updates. (Since I bought the game in January, the game has updated about 3 times. That's it.)-Gets old and repetitive very quickly-Horribly optimized-One of the worst Dev teams ever (I swear they never work on anything. Don't give me that ""small indie team"" Unturned has been on steam for no more than a month and has 2x as much content as this. Also, it has ONE DEV. AND HE'S 16 YEARS OLD. WTF)-			"

 My Experiences With Starbound  Starbound has changed so much since the 1.0 Update and has changed the game into a great way! Starbound offers a lot to explore, find, craft, and kill to gain better equipment for your next mission! However Before You Go Buying... Please do note that Starbound is growing and morphing, there are cons to it.  There will not be much after you have ""completed"" the game. However the game does not prevent you from building to your hearts content on what ever planet you want to build on Collecting ores may be a task for some  Durasteel  .  Proformance may be an issue on low end computers, however you can look up some good guides on how to improve FPS, such as disabling Vsync, Resolution, Brightness, etc My Experience With Mutliplayer Multiplayer will go 2 ways, it will be the best, and most entertaining time with your friends as you ride your hoverbikes into the sunset, however as how my friends and myself have noticed is that there are occasional lag spikes with and without a dedicated server which may cause issues for some. Overall 8.5/10	 "

								Lets see where to start. Ah yeah, i have bought this game from external site after totally forgeting that it even exist, now what i expected was finished/close to finished game because i have heard about it like year ago. Obviously its far from that and i do understand that its still early access and that its my own fault for not informing my self better before spending money but yeah...So the best way to describe starbound would be unfinished. It really does have everything that is promised, wast space to explore but there isn't enough variety so things get boring fast. There are different sprites for monsters but most of them share same AI while some lack any so they will just jump around till you hack them down.Crafting works fine its menu are not complicated and its easy to understand + you can drop 4 or 1 block at once so over all its far supperior to lets say terraria, however there is one thing that i didn't like and that is progression lock tied to certain events. Simply to say usually you have to kill some boss to unlock more advanced stuff and this works fine in aspect that it prevents you from skiping parts and just going for end game stuff without much pentalty. But it translates into rather boring grind till you hit gear milestone only to unlock more grind add to that rather boring exploration and yeah...Ofc this all can change in final version and i will update this according to that.Still with all that best aspect of game is that it supports modding and with mods you can tweak the game how you like it. So even in this unfinished state i had fun with it.As many said the game have potential how ever i cant recommend the game in state as it is now. I'd say come back and check it again in year or two as development was rather slow up till now.Unless you are not bothered by stuff said above or just have extra money to waste.			"

												Starbound started off promising and somehow got worse instead of better over the course of its dev cycle. The game has fully released now but still feels virtually identical to the earliest builds. The interface is clunky and terrible, the progression system and balancing are all over the place, the combat feels imprecise and every planet is basically a palette swap of the last. At the end of the day, it hasn't lived up to any of the promises Chucklefish made during development and the final version is just boring. Save your money and get Terraria instead.			"

								This game isn't all that great and it has left a permanent scar with my relationship with Chucklefish due to their childish upset against the people who didn't enjoy it. Even though the game was in development for many years and people were desperately waiting for a terraria in space to finally come out. Only to be disappointed with it's lack of polish and content. Even through this games many updates it still has a very big flaw. You can do all of its content in about 2 hours. Sure if you spend a majority of your time going through the different planets and exploring you can rack up more hours. That gets boring extremely quickly when you learn that the planets have little variety and just look a little different. I cannot suggest this game to anyone willing to find a replacement for the amount of hours you spent in Terraria. If you don't like how Terraria worked you might enjoy this game.			"

												Do not buy this, the developers are very rude and bans anyone who gives negative feedback on their forums.EDIT 07/08/2016;Update to this; The game is still incredibly bug-riddled despite being ""Released from beta"", and there are massive FPS drops at seemingly random times. I'm running a pretty high-mid end gaming PC, and most of the time it averages 20 FPS in this game, despite being able to run pretty much any other game on very high settings at >72 FPS.If you want to buy it, wait a little. Don't put your money down for it if you haven't already done so.This is not at all a full 1.0 version. Don't be fooled.To add to it; You make 15 trading cards, but there's not a single Novakid card, despite there only being 7 races, yet you can still manage to add a human game developer card? That's even dafter than I am.Don't make a promise if you never want to do anything with it. Considering how many promises they've made and failed to deliver on, I'm starting to not be very surprised at all by them failing to deliver anything competent.Chucklefish was a mistake.			"

								Still in beta, and somehow the game almost has less content than 2 years ago.The only thing they really added is the outpost, but it's just a gigantic tutorial. They also added one more boss, but removed one in the process.The weapons are still the same, the gear is still the same, the tech is still the same.They rebalanced the game like 15 times, and changed how everything works, including progressing and just basic stuff like getting fuel, but there's not actually anything new. It's just slightly different than before, and this is two years later.			"

								Like a lot of people, I jumped into Starbound hoping for the next Terraria.  Sadly, I get the feeling we'll never really see all the promise of Starbound.  The game as it stands is in an okay state but far from what is promised on the Steam page.  And sadly, it's been that way for the past 6 months now.  No quests, repetetive planets, weak progression, villages full of aliens that don't do anything besides a few little jokes, simple combat, and a team of seemingly incompetent devs who don't seem able to deliver content or interact with the community in any meaningful way have ruined a lot of my excitement for this game.  Starbound is a game that makes me rethink supporting Early Access indie games.  Save your money.			"

								There's really not much to do in this game. I was given it as a gift so I could play it with a friend, but his computer is now unable to run it due to recent updates. After the newest updates I am unable to launch the game as it gives me a run time error and closes itself. This game is boring, there's only so many things you can do. The monsters are vastly overpowered and weapons are ineffective during the beginning. Not worth 15 dollars.			"

								Starbound, hailed as Terraria 2.0 or Terraria in Space. Edit: To the people downvoting this review; read my review before you judge it. I share the same issues most ""negative reviewers"" do, but I have had more than 200+ hours of gameplay from this game, and so have most of the ""negative reviewers"" as well, and for an Early Access game, that is pretty good, is it not? Despite it's flaws. So before you blindly judge it based off slow development, read the following:I have waited with reviewing this game until they posted more updates, but have owned it since it was released to the public - and had 200+ hours within the first 2-3 months of the game being released, a lot of those due to mods, but the game is coming around now on its own as well, adding a lot of the features mods used to.If you loved Terraria, you will love this, no questions asked, just get Starbound and play it. If you never played Terraria, well ask yourself this:Does exploring space in your own spaceship, in a 2D pixelated universe sound amazing? Does building cool space-bases throughout various random planets sound fun? Does exploring the universe and digging to the planets cores sound daring enough for ya'? If that is the case, then Starbound might just  be for you.While I will recommend this game, I do have some minor (and I STRESS ""minor"", because I do love Starbound) issues that I am not fond of. The developer of the game promised large updates frequently, however, since it released 1 year and 2 months ago, there has been approximately 4 ""decent"" updates to the game - which have added a proper amount of content to the game. Starbound still has quite a ways to go before it should be considered a full game. And while I understand the quarrels of coding and programming, the actual design part of adding new blocks, biomes, monsters (although monsters are plenty as it is), items, weapons, etc. is not that hard in a 2D pixel game, and some of the updates focused heavily on adding only these (a lot of cosmetic stuff like hats), with minor additions to other parts of the game.And just to make a note, if that previous paragraph bummed anyone out too much - I will repeat, I do recommend this game, and in the first 2-3 months of the game being out I played 200+ hours with plenty of fun and shenanigans. And I am eagerly awaiting the day Starbound is released as a full game. Starbound has a great future, and definitely has a lot of hours worth of content now (which is more than most Early Access games), and additionally there is a plethora of mods that will give you even more play-time.So yes, I would recommend Starbound in a heartbeat.Plus, the Winter Update just added Llamas in Space!

Early Access Review
								This game is awful in every sense of the word.Best way to describe it? A contentless Terraria. I really cannot think of many positive things to say about this game. It has terrible bosses (both looks and difficulty wise). Who thought it would be oh so funny to make the first boss be a penguin in a flying saucer? Whos humour is so bad that they actually found that funny? Why wasn't the boss simply an alien in the flying saucer, that spawns more aliens on the surface instead of penguins?Then we have the second boss, which is a robot that you build yourself. You build it, just to kill it. This boss also looks idiotic too. How hard can it be to make a threatening looking robot? That's one of the main problems with the few bosses in this game. They don't look threatening at all. They're also way too easy.At least the dragon is somewhat decent.Anyway, the game has been casualized to hell and back too. At first we had threat levels for each sector. For example, in the alpha sector, the threat level went from 1-10, beta sector 10-20, and so on upto threat level 100. You could immediately see the difference in difficulty between a threat level 1 planet, to a threat level 4+.Now we have 10 threat levels maximum. Alpha sector has nothing but threat level 1 planets, beta nothing but threat level 2. Chucklefish claim that the difficulty is still just the same, but that is a flat out lie. The monsters apparently get stronger the further you dig down into the planet, but I never noticed any difference, even when I reached the planets core. Speaking of which, you have next to no reason to dig past the surface in this game. Terraria was filled with sprawling caves which had many neat things to find. Starbound caves are devoid of anything besides a few enemies. You might as well stay on the surface.Oh and once you reach a certain depth, the music cuts off. Some may argue that this creates atmosphere, but since the caves are so dull I don't see how it adds to anything. Instead it comes across as lazy. There could have easily been some cave themes that actually added to the ""creepy"" atmosphere that they were trying to go for.Now onto the monsters. They look awful. They sound awful. Seriously, half of them make horse sounds, the other half make sheep sounds. It's so irritating to listen too. What's the matter? Couldn't even take some time out to give the enemies some decent, unique sound effects? Again, lazy.I think it was advertised at some point ""never see the same enemy twice!"". Well I have seen the same exact enemy multiple times over. I've also seen that same enemy, except coloured green, instead of purple.Do chucklefish not know how to make things look threatening? Well, they sort of do since I have seen a few enemies that actually look good, but most of the time the enemies look goofy as ♥♥♥♥. Why must chucklefish insist on taking the goofy route? Is that their plan? To make the games comedy be aimed at morons that find an enemy with a mohawk funny?I could go on and on about this games shortcomings, but I'm going to cut it short here.The bottom line is, Terraria, which took a few months to create (granted it was still a little rough around the edges when it first came out too) is a far and away better game than Starbound which has taken years and is still in alpha, which the devs are calling beta. The updates are few and far between. It's been like what? 4 months now without an update?Talk about taking the money and running. I had the game bought for me thankfully, or I'd actually be ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off if I payed money for this crap.So remember kids, don't buy incomplete games, because this happens. The devs have no incentive to work on it now that you gave them 3 million for a barebone skeleton of a game.			"

You gather materials, fight a boss. Gather new materials, fight a new boss. Repeat. Its fun for a little bit but quickly gets boring. As for the development, I have seen none. Its almost as if they stopped working on this game completly. I would HIGHLY recommend not buying it at this time. In its current state the game is terrible, and this is not going to change quickly.

								What can I complain about that already hasn't been stated? It's been gone over that the developers are lazy, blame the community, and have decided that one screenshot and half a paragraph of nothing in particular counts as an ;update'. It's made over 2 million in it's kickstarter, and over 15 in the first MONTH, so it's not like they should have ANY excuse not to get cracking, besides the fact they're just lazy.Oh, and apparently none of that massive budget got put towards a QA department. The last content update was in March. For a VALENTINES update. And it was almost all vanity items. And during that time, they released a patch with one of the WORST POSSIBLE bugs in this time of game; about half your chests, or ANY storage unit would crash the game if you simply CLICKED on it.For a game that needs you to hoard a lot of stuff for crafting and building, this was INSANE. The ""hotfix"" (aka a patch that  is supposed to come out ASAP) didn't come out until a couple DAYS later. And guess what? ALL those bugged chests were deleted. Gone, vanished, no way to get your stuff back.What did the devs say to this? Basically ""Tough ♥♥♥♥, you should have made a backup of your world before our patches? You didn't? Well, you're a retard, aren't you?""Don't buy this. It's an empty shell of a game, and I'd bet hard money that Terraria 2 will probably be out and finished before this game is.			"

												Starbound is a very enjoyable and quite expansive Sandbox/Adventure game with both single-player and multiplayer modes. In Starbound, you start out on a planet where you need to gather resources to fix your spaceship in order to explore further. Eventually, you'll be free to fly anywhere you'd like, and there are a ton of different planet biomes and places to see. There so much to explore! Each planet and star system will have a vast array of planet types, terrain colors, ore, creatures, and structures, and the planets in Starbound are procedurally generated, so as you're playing as different characters, likely no galaxy will be the same as another.There are seven races in Starbound: The Humans, the Avians, the Floran, the Glitch, the Hylotl, and the Novakids. Each race has different armor sets, decor, furniture, and spaceship differences. As you explore planets, you will likely find structures of a certain race's theme, finding NPCs of that race and seeing their unique styles and appearances. You will also come across lore for each of these races, and their backstories, throughout the game. Each of the races seems to be inspired real-life cultures around the world, for example, the Glitch and their Medieval-themed motif, and the Florans with their primitive, prehistoric-type furniture and clothing. The variation in these items is quite pleasing, and fun to explore.Starbound's crafting, resource collection, and building can be quite satisfying, as well, and there are all kinds of blocks, furniture items, decorations, costumes, and objects that you can use to flesh out your structures, homes, bases, and any kinds of buildings that you make.Starbound is also a mod-friendly game, and it has all kinds of awesome mods on the Workshop, and on the Chucklefish forums alike. Everything from more technology, more items, more furniture, more player colors, and all kinds of things!Starbound's visuals and soundtrack are very nice, as well, and its lighting and the different effects on different types of planets make the variation of each area all the more charming. The sound ambiance in Starbound is also quite immersive as well, and there are plenty of nice details in the environments and in the game.I would recommend Starbound to anyone and everyone who loves RPG adventure games, and sandbox games! It can be such a joy to play and so much fun, and it also has multiplayer, so that you can share your adventure with your friends. I have no complaints about the game, and I think it's a pleasure to play! ^.^			"

												Time to rewrite this old thing now since it's out of EA.  Let's start with an admittedly bad metaphor.Imagine you see a food stand that makes sandwiches.  They have only one kind of sandwich, the 'Mystery Sub,' but it's promised to have the ingredients you like on it.  Specifically, pickles, butter, and white american cheese, with just a little bit of mayo.  It's also pretty cheap, so you order a sandwich.  You're told it'll be ready in five minutes.Those five minutes go by, but still no sandwich.  So you go up and ask about it and the guy at the stand says he just started in the food service industry yesterday, and he misjudged how long it would take.  Since he's just starting out and he says it'll be the best sandwich ever, you decide to give him the benefit of the doubt and wait for a little while.After half an hour of waiting, he finally gives you your sandwich.  You decide to open it to see what's in the 'best sandwich ever,' and you take a look at it.Mayo.  Lots of mayo.  With one pickle, a big glob of butter, and half a piece of that awesome cheese you like all placed in different corners on the bread, covered in that white goop.  In other words, it's technically what you ordered, but it's not half as good as you expected it to be, and was given to you in much more time than you were told it was going to take originally.Starbound is that sandwich.  It has everything they said it would have; exploration, building, even a few dark themes.  So technically everything they said it would be.  But there isn't nearly enough of that stuff, and mostly samey fetch quests and grinding.  The all-important story is shallow and derivative, with every quest pretty much being 'scan random crap, go though dungeon, kill boss.'  Rinse and repeat.Over all, it's not a bad game.  It has plenty of stuff to keep you busy for a while, with tons of cosmetics and building items.  I would even say the building system is better and more fun than Terraria.  But there just isn't enough of everything else that would make it fun and unique; as the old saying goes, it's as wide as an ocean and as deep as a puddle.There's plenty of bad stuff that happened in development; with the devs, with the missed release dates, and plenty of other problems.  I'm not going to go into it here; if you haven't heard of all the problems with the development and the devs themselves and are interested, you can look it up yourself.  God knows you'd get a better explanation from anyone other than me.So I'll judge it on what it has in it now, not what happened in development in the past.  And for me, in it's current state it's a resounding 'meh.'  Good for one or two playthoughs, but you'll probably get bored of it before you even get to experience most of the main features.  I still haven't even tried the colony stuff, and I did very little farming after 1.0.  It's only fifteen bucks though, so if you think thirty or so hours is enough for that price, then go for it I guess.  Will you get as much play out of it as, say, Terraria though?  No, probably not.I'm sure I've 'gotten my money's worth' out of it while it was in EA, but I still don't like the game much, so I'm giving it a negative review.  Maybe a 4 or 5 out of 10 for me.

								I thank god I didn't buy this miscarriage of a game every day and I mourn for the poor soul that decided to spend his hard-earned money to gift it to me. It was fun at first (mostly because of the hype surrounding it at the release and not because of the quality of the actual game) but there have been no noticeable updates in months. And I do mean months. The developers of the game censor every single bit of criticism wherever they can, and the rabid fanboys dismiss that criticism as some kind of conspiracy. The community is toxic and the developers seem to be either a bunch of children or simply conmen abusing the stupidity of the aforementioned fanboys. Don't buy it, don't give it attention, just forget all about it. I hope that, one day, this game will be forgotten by every single human being on this planet so it could be like it never existed. Starbound: a true blunder of the human race.			"

												I really wanted to enjoy this game, I really did. But the problem was it gets really boring after about 15-18 hours. Once you get to the top teir armours and weapons (not a long time) there really isn't much to do. The story is very repetitive and finding the villages is just boring. I played this with a friend so I may have gotten a few more hours if I played by myself, but the only reason we bought the game was to play together, so that's wouldn't have happened. If you're looking for a short game to play then sure, go ahead and buy it, but personally, unless it's a story only game, I wouldn't recommend a game with less than 50 hours play time + still enjoying it after. I was dissapointed with the play time I got out of it. I liked the time I did play but it just gets so boring.			"

								Terraria in space? Not even close! This is a good example of what happens when a game gets too much hype, ( like DayZ ) gets overrated and exaggerated,( like DayZ) and the company  takes too much advantage of the so called ""Early Access Game"" feature (like DayZ again!) it's like game companies use it as something to fall back on nowdays!  It's been a couple of years and I feel as if Stabound hasn't progressed that much at all, it's still somewha bland, boring, and most of it still has no replay value at all. It just ends up feeling very generic and repetitive after you play for a while.  (Progression still feels unsatisfying) I wouldn't be expecting this game to be better in the near future since Chucklefish would rather use the time to make another game like Waywardtide or publish other games instead of finishing this one at all. Who knows? Maybe at the time Starbound gets finished they would already be releasing 10 more games.Sure, we can all be optimistic and say Starbound has potential, but after seeing how much has  progressed since 2013, I still can't recommend it to others.At least it was only 15$			"

												In regards to the 1.0 update:If you don't already have the game and were hoping that the big 1.0 update would add a new world of content that would change things forever, you're probably going to be let down. To summarize what the update does; the early-access version of the game essentially involved Chucklefish cramming a bunch of content in the game to make it bigger. They added single-player missions, bosses, and a certain level of progression, but it was all kind of shallow and these elements were purely added just to have more things to do.So finally what this big update does is gives these missions and the game proper plot and progression. There are now lengthier, more plot-involved quests that make more sense than just ""I'm doing this quest because an NPC told me to for the hell of it,"" (which is pretty much how quests were in early-access). The story is actually something that develops as you play rather than being explained in a dialogue box at the start like previous versions.For the most part, that's all this update does. Yes, they DID add some new stuff, but the main purpose of this update was to refine and complete the game so that it no longer has that early-access appearance and feel. If you enjoyed/think you'd enjoy the content that was in previous versions of the game, then you might consider Starbound worth a playthrough/replaythrough. On the other hand, if you weren't previously impressed, then there's probably not a whole lot added in this latest update that will change your mind.Regardless, Starbound as a whole is a really good game. It may seem a bit lacking compared to Terraria, but it's very easy to enjoy its unique elements such as exploration, looting, and colonization.			"

								Update  (March 2016)So, I wrote this review over a year ago now and...yep...game is still in ""early access"". Loaded it up briefly today (but it crashed on load, good start) while i had a read of some of my fellow players reviews,  and well....it seems like it's just gone even further downhill from where it was when I posted the earlier review below.Still doesn't seem like we have ship customisation/upgrading? That was one of the early promises they made for content.I actually enjoyed going through the different regions (Alpha/Beta/Delta) back in the day, but they've removed these which makes the universe feel a bit more generic and limited.Once again, the fact it's still in EA a year after my last review, and was initially ""released"" a further year before that...that's not a good sign for a game.My recommendation is still as it was before: Don't get this game until they finish it, if they ever do.Original Review (Dec 2014)So much has been promised with this game, but so much hasn't been delivered- various dates for release stages have been pushed back (often repeatedly), much hyped content (ship upgrades, etc) has never been implemented.It's easy to get pretty much high-end gear and have a huge fortress of your own built *full* of scavenged/crafted furniture/chests/etc without much game time- the number of hours I've spent on this game is including several times where patches broke save files, so I had to start again, and a lot of time leaving the game running while I go and do other things.As of currently, there hasn't been a proper content update in quite a while (not counting the ""night"" updates, which are sort of unstable unofficial patches/updates. So it's beginning to seem like this game will never be truely completed, and therefore never follow up on all it's promise, which makes me sad as it started off seeming awesome.			"

								-Devs lied about the release date of the beta twice-The beta it self wasnt more of a pre alpha with lots of assets missing, bugs, optimization issues, and horrible networking (beta = most assets and mechanics in, alpha = most assets gone and its just a half stable build)-There is no story what so ever (eeeeeeeeeeeeeeven though they promised one), so you will have no clue why you are doing certain things.-The NPCs are lifeless, spouting the same line over and over again-Combat is ♥♥♥♥, I whack you with a stick, you whack me with a stick, lets see who wins-You can technically beat the game in an hour or so due to the lack of quests-Planets all feel the same after a couple of hours, everything just a reeskin of another planet. No unique features past the level gravity-Monster design just rips off pokemon, im suprised they dont say their name over and over like a broken record-Lack of secondary items beyond temporary potions, so no +2 def or +1 attack like in terraria-Insultingly easy, you need to go to a planet thats not recommened for your character just to have a slight amount of challnege-No mods worth talking about-Guns are basiclly airsoft-No depth in the combat (whack whack whack)-Unlike what the devs said prerelease, robots can eat human food, monkies can eat bird food, etc etc. Your character is essentially just a reskin. Do you want to be the bird one, the chimp, the human, or the robot (glitch master race)-Decent music but a real ear sore after several hours of play-Ships are clostrophobic, and you cannot edit their size without a buggy mod-NPC ai is so ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ that it will kill itself trying to reach you (jump off cliffs, fall into lava/poison)The only good things i see in this game are-Character animations (only for movement, everything else is generic swatting)-World design (although like i said earlier, it looses its charm after you find out its just a reskin)-Space travel (as dull and lifeless as it may be, its fun for a bit to explore in your space ship while playing Space oddity-Soundtrack, but as stated, it gets on your nerves after a bit due to the lack of variety for each world type. Lots of tracks in general, but not enough for each areaDecent concept, executed poorly. Very poorlyThis game goes on sale fairly often, buy if its onsale if you reeeeeeally wanna spend 10 dollars on a terraria rip off with some half decent (half ♥♥♥♥♥) space travelJust keep in mind, for that 10 dollars, you could buy a couple gallons of gas and drive somewhere and see new things.

Early Access Review
								It's been a while since I wrote a review on Starbound and I'm going to do another because my attitude has changed and I feel that my previous recommendation isn't correct anymore and might lead some people unexpectantly into buying it.So I will start with my recommendation. Do not buy the game right now. I'll say it again do not buy this game while it is in development. Now you may be asking yourself well why would I say that with having played 80 hours of it and I'm going to explain why my stance is what it is now. I'll try to keep it in bullet format and simple to read so you can pick out the pros and cons and decide more easily for yourself. Also I apologize for my grammar, punctuation, and spelling errors. Firstly I want to say that Starbound as it is right now is playable and enjoyable to a point, but the reason that I believe you shouldn't purchase it at this time isn't because of the game itself rather the developers and PR behind it which I will get into later.ProsExtremely playable, simplistic and fun for short bursts of playing time.Not necessarily a unique take on the genre, but if you played Terraria I'd argue that you would like this game.Interesting race concepts and art styleDecent crafting though a bit lacking has it's momentsA variety of biomes to run in and Dungeons to play through keeping some of the worlds you visit fresh and interesting driving you to continue exploring at least for a while.ConsFor the cons section I'll follow each bullet with my belief on the validity of the con and whether it should influence your purchase. I am no means a video game expert and all of this is my opinion I'm simply trying to help you understand why my recommendation is what it is.Though it's marketed as a Beta in this writers opinion it is an Alpha with Beta stability. I'll go in depth with this a bit more to make my reasoning clear, I believe a Beta should be feature complete and be testing for bugs. Some may not agree, but as I stated this is my opinion not a fact. One avenue where I believe this shows itself best is that most if not all of the content dealing with progression, npc interaction, and questing is garbage and it's been this way for coming up a few months shy of a year now. This isn't permenant just current state now.  ""In my opinion this is a decent sized con, but I don't believe it should be what you determine your purchase on. Though it does suck a bit now it will get better, but it takes time and work to get through this.""As I mentioned above the game is playable and enjoyable in short play sessions, but it ends at about 2 hours if that. Now you can play and build entire cities if you'd like which isn't bad, but when it comes to enjoyability I like progression and steady game play through to the ""end"" of the game. ""This shouldn't effect your purchase unless you are kind of like me and enjoy progression, questing and npc interaction."" Though there are different biomes after about an hour or so they all blend together, I love their heating system for colder planets don't get me wrong, but the driving force of the game is to gather x ore from x lvl planet and make x lvl armor and ship upgrade to go to the next level. There is no drive to build a base, no drive to colonize anything, and no drive to try to discover anything at all other than dig straight down get your ore then go back to your ship/base to build the next upgrade. ""To sum it up these last three cons can all be placed within the Alpha vs Beta con. Just understand that getting into this there are parts missing entire sections that seem boring and will be that way for several more months if not a year more. which brings me to my last con.""The biggest con and the reason that I'm recommending you to not buy this game until it is finished is Developer/company interaction, PR, and feedback to customers. I want to go into detail about this one because it is the damning factor in a lot of the arguments about whether the game is a worth while investment. When I first purchased Starbound the promises from Chucklefish were actually quite different than they are now which brings me to my first complaint. Chucklefish has the worst time with release dates and due to this they change what they say. For instance when I purchased the game there was a quote stating that all funds would go directly to the game and that the more money they got towards it the faster the game would be released. This was followed by a company move and publishing multiple titles for other companies on top of starting another game without having finished their first game. This wouldn't have been so bad had they explained that with the money from Starbound they were in fact not going to hire more programmers and increase the release speed, but rather promote and further their company. Not so bad, but a form of false advertisement on top of a pile of them. Quick releases went to slow releases then releases on a nightly possibly broken status exc. I'll sum this up by when I read what the developers have to say now as they ask for your purchase on steam only a few shards of it are the same as they were when I bought into this and when you argue this point it will get thrown back in your face stating that it is an early release, but I would argue an early release is still promising certain things in the effort to get you to invest in a product so most if not all promises made by a company need to be held accountable no matter the status of the promise. This isn't a kickstarter this is a product being sold on future content or development practices you are promising your customer.When confronted with the lack of communication back when updates were slow and given between three to four websites developers responded angrily with customers. Through passive aggressive hints or even out right blaming customers for lack of production in certain areas because they were ""complaining too much."" Let me rephrase I say developers, but TiY is actually the only developer I remember with this. There might have been more, but TiY stands out as having done it the most. ""These two points though terrible when talking about a company and a consumer are not so bad, but lead into my final con which is the one that truly drives my recommendation.""Over the past few months when I've visited the forums I've watched as some of the most overzealous moderators delete, censor and close any forum dealing with negative feedback with no other reasoning than ""everyone should know better"" quote from Izzabelle (The one who locks) < guessing self made title. When questioned about it the moderators continue to delete, censor and act irresponsibly to customers due to the anonymity of their interaction. This behavior though rude and obnoxious can't all be placed on the developer except that it's been happening for months and anyone watching the forums for a length of time know that speaking ill of the game comes with the chance of being banned anywhere from 2 weeks to permanently because ""they said so"". This would bring one to assume that this type of interaction is not only acceptable to Chucklefish, but applauded by the frequency of these types of responses. Customer censorship is shameful.  Though the game and what it's shaping up to one day be look amazing, Terrible customer interaction, Terrible forum moderation, Lies, Misscommunication and Blaming have ultimately turned me off of this company and any/all of it's future games. My recommendation is to buy the game when it's finished or don't buy it at all, because the moment you have something negative to say you no longer really matter. They got what they needed from you after all.  When the game is out I will switch the recommendation and rewrite the review to explain why in it's finished version it's worth buying, but that any looking to buy need be wary of early access from Chuckle.https://imgur.com/a/DPVRP "

Early Access Review
								The developers constantly silence people on their steam forums, and forums.And if it isn't their developers, it is the fourm mods, which have banned people for even critique.Usually ends up like this: 'I think X is bad, because Y' ( BANNED. Reason: 'bad'. )Before a wild fanboy appears, you can literally google this. I will not hold your hand, do it yourself.Game is not going anywhere, they're already working on another game too.( Apparently it's another team in the same company, as if there even was anyone working on it in Starbound in the first place. )EDIT2.0: It's been a LONG time and yet still none of the promises were expanded upon, and the game's current population are fanboys or people who are angry, still waiting for a product.-REVIEW-Starbound is very linear, with no real goals on what to do other than: 'Collect stuff, make better stuff.'There is no real incentive to play beyond that, as building is mostly pointless as you will leave worlds behind, as you should be travelling across the whole galaxy of space and whatever.The quest system is very under-utilized ( as of which, they have stated that they will add more for 1.0 )and even if they do add more quests, the question changes to: 'Will it ever be worked on far enough to be interesting and add value to the game?'Outside of it's initial charm, which comes from the 'immersive' part of the game, the game can get old rather quickly, as there currently isn't enough material to keep you interested in the lore of the game, and there isn't enough quests/dialogue to keep you wanting to stay around the towns/villages/airships, which again, comes down to lack of content. There are plenty of descriptions, which are a nice touch to the 'immersion' factor, and the player will actually move as if they were talking. There's also a ton of references, which will entertain some. Some references are VERY obvious, while others are a bit more subtle, however, still obvious.But that isn't enough to keep players interested for long.There's survival elements into this game that require you to eat, be warm, and of course, remain in good health ( so nothing completely ruins your day ).However, this adds to the linear part of the game.You make armor, it protects you, you make better armor, it protects you better, and now you are a bit more warm. As for food, you can get food almost anywhere, making it more of a annoyance than an actual survival element. And I do mean anywhere, you can kill animals on the moon if you needed to.The combat works in a good concept, it's actually better than Skyrim. You'll need to actually attempt to stay alive, as enemies are dangerous enough to overwhelm you, until you are geared.There are various types of weapons in Starbound.Spears - Good for pokingSwords - Good for stabbingGuns - Good for shootingBows - Good for Huntingand various other tools of violence, all at your disposal.Currently, the enemy isn't programmed far enough to actually require tactical use of the weapons.The best use is simply to get a ranged weapon and kite the opponent.If an opponent could require certain use of weapons, ( perhaps teamwork )then this would be very interesting.Shooting a monster, while it turns to deflect you, while an ally stabs it in the back with a spear, avoiding it's protruding spikes and toxic clouds.There is the standard mining. Not much to explain there.Cutting down trees actually falls over. Rather than combusting. +1 Immersion.Items; they are everywhere.There are plenty of items and upgrades within Starbound that really change the game.However, your luck is based on whether you go to the right planet or not.Whether you got lucky with the RNG, or maybe you looked for a good planet on the internet, there will still be many pointless planets in which you do nothing but look for a giant monster that has red particles near it. Then you kill it and get a weapon with special properties, which are pretty fun to use. My personal favorite was the bonehammer, which let you slam with a melee attack, while at the same time, launching bones at the enemy.Speaking of items and upgrades( called techs ); there are some pretty cool finds that let you do certain things.Using a quick dash, or maybe creating a bubble to help you levitate, those help with the game's combat, adding a bit of excitement. But, again, there simply isn't enough to use, losing out on any potential diversity.The game's modding scene is extremely good, but, as this is a review of the base game, we will not discuss mods as part of the game. The modders of Starbound have done some excellent work and have added many things that players have wanted. If you did pick up Starbound and regret it, you may have a chance using the player created mods, which would help you gather some value out of the game.Now, you have all of those cool stuff in a sci-fi world. 'What more do I need?' - No one, ever.There's the giant problem of the game not being finished, and not currently having enough meta-game. The lack of content really strains the game, a moment where dynamic missions would be very influential. Right now, the only real content there is, is based on the sole existance of player creativity, and mechanics. Once a player has exhausted either, ( which they will, unless you have a never-ending supply of drugs. ) they will then have nothing to do. Yes, there are quests, but how long will those really last the player? Will they be lengthy enough to continue playing, and will they successfully hook the player? The lack of a true meta-game really shows after just beating the first boss, and is very evident after you get to the last sector.'Oh, you can uh-uh-uh build a b-b-base!'But what purpose does it serve me, other than for more storage?Other than searching for dungeons ( then raiding them after hopefully finding one )and beating all of the bosses in the game and crafting the linear-upgrades of items, what more can you REALLY do?

								Terraria rip-off. Not only that but there's no more updates being planned anymore, so basically you end up with an eternally-unfinished clone of another game that's CHEAPER on the market. Early Access is still a new thing but games such as these really show it in a negative light, so if you ever wanted to play some 2D Minecraft (don't know why you would), just get Terraria.			"

								Do NOT buy this game, unless you're perfectly fine with burning $15. While it is playable in its current state, it has been effectively abandoned by the devs. It has been EIGHT MONTHS since the last official update. The only thing they do now is their 'Nightly' updates, which both do not come every night and are riddled with bugs and crashes to the point of unplayability. They also tend to corrupt your worlds and characters. They promised a finished product by the end of 2013. It's currently 8 months into 2014, and we're still in the first stage of Beta. Not to mention all the trigger-happy mods who lock and delete any thread that doesn't suggest the game is perfect.			"

								I am still optimistic that Starbound will be a great game, but I am starting to feel that I will not see that day for AT LEAST a year.  The current state of the game is not broken, but very far from feeling complete.  There are bits and pieces of brilliance and fun to be found while playing the game, but the game becomes a repetitive bore after exploring past the first couple of sectors.  ""Bland randomness"" is the phrase I would use to describe most aspects of this game that rely on the procedural generation.  The planets are randomly bland, the weapons are randomly bland, the monsters and NPCs are randomly bland, the unique structures and dungeons are randomly bland, etc.       The game seems to have spiraled into some kind of development hell for almost six months, with few updates, suspiciously vague promises of future content, and a fair deal of excuses to why development is going slowly.  Furthermore, I am appalled to see the overkill level of censorship that this company is now pushing against their fanbase: a justifiably angry fanbase that gave THEIR money to Chucklefish in order to help them expedite the development of this game.  At this point, I just I feel like I've been flim-flammed by a dubious indie game developer and payed far too much for far too little of actual substance.    Update (7/31/14): Tried the nightly build after a bit of messing with the files to stop the game from crashing... It's nice to actually see some of the features put into effect that they have been showcasing on their website, even if the gameplay is a buggy, discheveled mess.			"

												It had seemed to have potential... and maybe one day might realise it.  Trouble is it already started looking 'dated', by the time it's out...As stands, dislike extreme lag on complex screens, screentearing at high rate of travel, a general lack of anything past the first few planets, and going by the nightly, extreme feature creep causing identity dissassociation of story.Would not recommend in current incarnation or near incarnation.Curious though of all the positive reviews' age.  While 90% positive is impressive, how many are since the near-year-long hiatus in development?  Maybe at one point I'll revisit this and change the review, but for now.. no.UPDATE: Years LaterThe CM is a toxic snowflake, the game is tailchasing drek, and any potential was beaten black and blue then live-streamed being made to drink from the toilet.  No --> Hell NoGo play Terraria instead if you want your 2d minecraft nostalgia.			"

								When I first bought the game, I thought it was amazing, infact I spent all of the game time I have now for this game in the first week or so. However, updates started to rapidly come slower and slower and slower and I lost interest. I hope they start updating again because I actually enjoyed the game a lot. However, for right now, I would not recommend the game in the state that it's in. The combat is the same most of the time, the weapon tiers are kind of bad, and there's a lot of grinding to be done. I really do hope that they continue to update the game because I feel like if they keep going they'll have something definately playable.			"

Early Access Review
								If you plan on buying this game, or have any interest in playing at all, PLEASE HOLD OFF.(Note that this is a review for the current state the game is in)When I originally heard news of Starbound, my hype boner extended into the stars above and could not be held down. It was basically Terraria. In Space. With promises of being much more. Hell, the game was developed by ex-Terraria developers. That lead me to thinking: How could developers of Terraria mess up their game by simply putting the damn game in space? At that point it didn't matter to me. Numerous friends already bought the game and bombarded me with ""WHY DONT YOU HAVE THIS GAME YET????"", and, ""PLAY WITH ME!!!!!"" They never seemed to run out of things to rave about the game. So I bit the bullet. I bought the game, immediately installed, and dove into the universe of Space Terraria. What could possibly go wrong?Now, onto the gameplay.Diving head-first into singleplayer, the game introduces you to the quest system by having you retrieve your first item in the game from a storage compartment on your spaceship. Simple enough. The controls seemed nothing out-of-the-ordinary. WASD to move around, spacebar to jump (even if jumping momentum seemed clunky), clicking to interact with various ""blocks"" and items, yadda yadda. Already the game seemed like SpaceTerraria. After beeming down to my starting planet's surface and completing the remaining ""tutorial"" quests, I had a cozy little camp with a fire and a crafting bench. I made myself a pickaxe and mined some of the obviously low-quality starting ores (copper, iron, and some coal). Using coal to power my spaceship, I had already travelled to a few planets, and scavenged enough resources to create a distress beacon: the item required to summon the game's first boss. A penguin piloting a giant UFO dropped from the sky, and my first boss battle had begun. It ended just as quick. As it turns out, the boss was extremely easy to ""cheese,"" as a trapped myself in a small dirt box with a one-block opening to swing a weapon out from. The battle was done and over with as quickly as it started. I climbed through the various tiers of armor and weaponry with extreme ease, and had ""beaten"" the game faster than I imagined.The controls, as I stated were nothing bizzare: WASD movement, click on things to interact. No complaints in the controls department aside from extremely wonky jumping mechanics. The gravity on a planet's surface varied with different planets, but none of that seemed to matter. Jumping sends you in the same, awkward arc that is extremely hard to control. Getting the right trajectory and angle of a jump is tedious and waaaay harder than it needs to be.Combat is simple. VERY simple. Like, boringly unsatisfying. Swords, spears, axes, it doesn't matter. You click when a monster is within the weapons reach, and repeat. No RNG (besides criticals) to spice things up, you click. Click, click, click. Guns are no better. All the guns seem identical. Oh, and did i mention you click? Click to win!Being a Terraria-esque game, being able to build a house or base is to be expected. This is where the game shines, in my eyes. Having thousands of different planets to explore means having a diverse selection of landscapes and atmospheres to contruct an ideal spaceport or cozy cottage. Along with diverse landscapes comes diverse building blocks. Want to build a tropical-themed, thatched-roof hut on a frozen, desolate moon? Knock yourself out! A intimidating and looming stone castle on a world of cotton candy trees and talking birdmen? I dont see why not! Even after I ""beat the game"" and reached the highest tiers of tools and armor, building a giant fishbowl for my geisha fish girl and defending it from sphincter-headed dinosaurs was a gaming experience like no other. Make sure to bring your creativity and roleplaying mindsets with you if you venture into Starbound.Multiplayer was a different story entirely. The game was oodles more entertaining and replayable with a crew of friends to join up and plunder the universe together with. I could write an entire book of the crazy-fun times I had with my buds in Starbound, but that almost feels like another game entirely, and I'm here to focus on Starbound.Unfortunately, I'm starting to run out of good things to say about poor Starbound.Being an early-access game, paying for and playing an unfinished game is to be expected. However, even for an early access game, the whole thing seemed rather...underwhelming. While it might just be the dying-down of my hype, the game was not what I expected it to be at all. It seemed very unfinished and empty. Even a group of good friends couldn't fix the empty gameplay. But the advantage of an early-access game is seeing the addition of new, exciting content before your very eyes, right?Starbound didn't get that memo.Call me cynical, or whatever you will, but I feel lied to. Cheated. Scammed. The developers over at Chucklefish were on an incredible streak of fixing and patching the game tailored to the findings of the community and playerbase. This streak continued for months. Then ♥♥♥♥ hit the fan.Developers started leaving, including one of the big-men-on-top. The developers took their patches and fixes with them. Progress on the game seemed to come to a standstill. However, the development website promised and displayed what content was being worked on and would ""soon"" (my definition of soon =/= Chucklefish's definition) be added to the game. Every day, the website showcased new features being worked on. Features that never seem to see the light of day. The website is a catalog of broken promises and wasted potential. The last ""update"" posted to the site is a collection of GIFs of monsters with promises of ""...updates soon!"" These no longer mean anything to me, and are just the developers' way of waving my money in my face.In summary...Starbound is a sandbox, Terraria-esque game that takes place in outer space. Immersive exploration is plagued with lackluster gameplay backed with broken promises of updates and constant new content. Playing with friends makes things a bit more bearable, but feels like you're bringing an umbrella to protect yourself against a rain of flaming dookie.As much of a ♥♥♥♥ I've taken on this game, I sure had a hell of a time eploring and building. Who knows? Maybe the developers will but away their hashpipes for a bit and work on the game. It might have a brighter future ahead of it, but for now, spend your money elsewhere. I truly await better times for this game :(			"

												So close, yet so far.Short: Terraria > StarboundLong:The quests are really boring (MMO style). Scan this fight the boss get the artifact come back repeat. Or, find this dude kill the hostage takers bring him back. Or, bring me 4 Silver ore, make Silver bars, make the equipment and bring it to my friend. I'd be fine with that but the rewards are totally not worth it, most of the time you get a ""suprise bag"" wich contains either a M.M. Upgrade Module or a Tech Card, that would be cool and all but you get a metric ♥♥♥♥ ton of these if you just explore the surface of a planet. I wouldn't mind that too much but you need to complete the main Story to unlock all Shops in the Outpost (Hub like area)The boss fights are really, really, really boring. They're not hard, they just take a long long time to complete. Especially the last boss fight took me about 10 minutes but I didn't take much damage at all.  Compared to Terraria the boss fights are unsatisfying and boring. Building a colony on a planet has no real use. You can upgrade your ship upto five (?) times and at that point you have way too much spare space already. Yes building a colony is cool and all but there is no real point to it since all you really get from it is pixels (the currency) and in the endgame you'll already have enough of them.  If you enjoyed Terraria you'll mostlikley enjoy Starbound too because the gample is pretty much the same. If you haven't bought Terraria yet, buy it over Starbound.			"

								This game is supposed to be Terraria in Space. It looks like Terraria in Space. It is not Terraria in Space.Starbound is clearly an early access game, yet it's been on sale for over half a year. There has been little progress made in the development, even though the developers have received $4 million on Kickstarter and countless sales on Steam.Whatever. The game itself is what matters. It's very boring. There are fundamental issues with the movement, combat, and progression. Movement is clunky, and getting around on planets never gets particularly fast. Combat is incredibly bland. There are only 2 boring enemy types, and some ridiculously overpowered bosses. Progression is bizarrely linear for what is supposed to be a sandbox game. It essentially boils down to : grind for way too many resources, cheese a boss to death, craft a new workbench, fly to next area, repeat. Every tier is not much different than the last, and there's very little reason to revisit previous areas. You'll spend most of your time gathering some resources, then quickly checking lots of random planets for their dungeon loot. Sometimes the dungeons are interesting, at least. Too bad finding them is a huge chore.Yes, these concerns could be resolved in due time. However, these are fundamental gameplay issues. Starbound looks great, and it has lots of toys. The problem is that the devs keep focusing on superficial elements, instead of fixing the game itself.Don't waste your money or time. I doubt this game will get any better. The developers have clammed up, and now they refuse to listen to any criticism. That's a sure sign this game won't see any real changes.			"

								DO NOT BUY THIS GAME! DO NOT SUPPORT THESE DEVELOPERS! This game is stuck in early access Limbo. It will never be released. *edited*Ok, first of all, i played this game for about ~30-50 hours. The lead developer has his head up in the sky and cannot admit that his ambitions are WAY over the top of what he (and his dev team) is capeable of. The game was promised to be released in 2013, then it was postponed to early 2014 and now it is ""sure to come out on 2015"" Yeah, fool me once... No refunds And then they post about ""releasing game from 0.98 to 1.0 - it's just a number"" and yet somehow they are trying to hide away from all the critique by saying ""hey, but it's just an early access""This game is not finished, and it probably never will. And even IF it will be released, it won't live up to what they promised from the beginning. Not to mention all the 13 y/o fanbase that is always trying to protect the game by saying ""you had your hours of fun"" <- yeah this is the generation that has grown up on minecraft. No, i paid for what they promised me, not what has been delivered.The most important thing is -> THERE IS NO UPDATES FOR THIS GAME.Please re-read it out loud several times.BUT before you are trying to protect this game by ""but heeeeeey, there is the nightly builds, play them they are fun and daily"" <- No! No no no! As a software tester myself i can assure you, releasing games with nightly builds is NOT a solution. Sure first they have to go trough nightly, then to unstable branch then to stable... but wait... has there been any updates on a stable brunch? NO there has been none (for about a year)  so choke on that solution chucklefish. (and yeah, adding hats in nightly build... sure... ""progress and development"") Also before the so called ""beta"" release. Tyi promised (as he often do, and then NOT delivering) that there will be 3 beta stages. There is none. Forget about pets, pokedex-ish items, fossils, etc etc (insert here all the billion things they promised) Don't waste your time. Buy something that has already been released. Learn from my mistake. Please.From now on Chucklefish is the new Phil Fish of the gaming industry. Are they thinking about getting more money? YesDo they care about the community? F*CK no!			"

								Starbound does for me what Minecraft couldn't.  Instead of taking forever to explore one island I can take forever to explore a few solar systems.  But then I can travel to any of the thousand other systems and explore them as well.  The different material types are as varied as Minecraft and then some.  You can grow food, build buildings, create better materials, hunt creatures, get into shootouts with the locals, etc.in the latest version you can expand your ship.  You don't even have to develope planet-side buildings anymore if you don't want to.  You can literally live off your ship and expand it as you go.  There are now also more fuel types (fuel is needed to move between star systems), some more ceocentrated than others.With the outpost you now have access to more quests, which means more adventures.  They can be as random as ""Find me a stone USMC sign"".  Do you remember what planet on what system you found that USMC prison colony?  You don't?  Time to go exploring and find another to get that sign!There are ""dungeons"" on pretty much every planet.  You can dig down into the planet and find gnomish villages.  You can dig through several different layers of the planet and find everything from mushrooms to buried laboratories to underground lakes full of acid, all of which you can break down with your tool and use for yourself, either in a crafting recipe or as a decoration for your home(s).If you like open-world construction games of a blocky nature, then this one is definitely worth trying out.  There are many to choose from these days and eveyone likes one more than the others.  If you're still searching for ""the one"" then play this one.  You search will be over.			"

								All in all this would be a great game, if they got around to finishing it. As is I have had this game a long while excited to see the story and what the finished product looks like. Just for it to seem to be in a contious state of beta. I am not saying don't buy this once it's out of early acess once they get a story going and all the items fully made it will be a wonderful game. But for the moment I sugest waiting and not grabbing this till it is actully done.			"

												The game is like space Terraria but much less to do.You know the saying? The journey is more important than the destination. Well the journey sucks in this game and there is no destinationPros:•	Space.•	So many interesting worlds and sets.•	Missions and story have great aesthetic.•	Ships are cool•	Decent variety of planets.•	Building is easy and the variety of building materials allows for a lot of creativity.•	Building your ship can be super cool•	There are some very neat random dungeons•	The races are very creative•	The game is fun with friendsCons:•	Very VERY limited things you can craft compared to a game like terraria.•	Hunger is stupid•	Crew system is super underwhelming•	A lot of things in the game that feel worthless such as pets, crafting weapons, buying basically anything from merchants.•	Way, way, WAY too easy to find everything in the game. Every tear of ores can be found in around 30 minutes of being on your first planet with the ore, and then you never need to mine for it again.•	The game has a very short cap. You finish everything you can do in the game after hardly any work. •	Quests that aren't in the main story are abysmal. There are like 3 different quests and they all suck. Go get this, kill this, or bring this to this person. They terrible payout so there is no incentive to do them at all.•	Money is super easy to come by and not used for like anything, making it virtually worthless•	The character customization options are actually very disappointing both at the character creation and throughout the game•	The game is extremely linear for a sandbox, you have very specific paths to take until the end where is seems like they thought, “Oh ♥♥♥♥, we need to give players multiple options for armor in a sandbox game”Summary:In the end, a lot of the gameplay mechanics seem not thought through and kind of worthless. The game is very incoherent at times, and worst of all, when you get to final tier of armor it is the most disappointing and unsatisfying thing in the game. The only way I'd recommend this game is if you really REALLY liked building and making a town, even then there are better games for that. Because that is the only thing in this game that requires any effort, but that has no payout besides being able to see a ton of people in your town. It’s very disappointing, because the beginning of the game is so fun and new, but as that feeling goes away, you get a very big disappointment. I hope for the game to improve as I’m sure the developers will continue to add to it. But until then, it is a no from me.			"

Early Access Review
								At first, this game was great. I funded this game during it's Kickstarter days with enthuisasm and such blind faith in the development team without learning their history of making games. Let me tell you this, the Developers are very shady. Not the shady kind of scheming but the kind that seem to hardly do anything in terms of game content. This game has been in Early Access for a very long time now, and there hasn't been a single patch in four months to improve content. They aren't great with decision making either; considering they made mining gratutitous and repetitive, you used to be able to farm ore from sand blocks and get them quicker than spending a few more seconds on a mineral chunk, but now it disappears for some reason because screw logic.There's no real difference between planets, every planet pretty much as the same sub-biomes and there's not much difference in monsters per planet either. They're all the same pretty much.Oh and you have to progressively mine now; stone picks to mine copper then use that copper to make copper picks and then mine iron with it, etc. Honestly I really liked this game before the developers decided to start working on a whole new game. Tiy, who is one of the developers began working on some Voxel game instead of helping finishing this. They used a large sum of money to buy a studio than invest in the game. Should you buy the game? Not yet. Wait until they actually finish it, when's that? I have no idea.			"

								would not recommend and heres why.  first the game play is slow moving, the upgrades are fast and leave you wondering what else there is to do and there is exactly that nothing to do. there is no greater goal in mind.  build a city alright now what?the bosses from what i remember were dissapointing  all of them are weak against blocks, block yourself in and shoot them rebuild blocks when nessicary.weapons dont make you feel special at all guns have a few shots before your enegry is depleted and cant shoot,  melee is fun but weapon selection is minscule.techs are the best thing about this game they make for interesting possibilties but run on energy,  so having fun and shooting things is a bad idea.if your looking for a fast paced game like terraria that makes you feel awesome with variety and hard bosses, special events, and things to do look elsewhere.id look for a refund on this game but i know it wont happen.3/10 stars			"

I guess it will take 2 more years for this game to be playable. At least the developers admits the combat system is not done. But on the blog there is entry 'Some thoughts on early access, release dates, the big 1.0' where they say its worth the money and playing already, which is false.			"

Early Access Review
TL;DR: This game is the spiritual successor to the steam hit Terraria, promising a lot but fulfilling very little of its promises.When I started playing this game, I loved it. It was like a 2D minecraft with a lot of possibilities, and an actual progressing ""plot"", that gave you boss monsters and better armor that gave you cool little bonuses. You could modify your characters and while some parts were more boring than others, it was a fun game.But this isn't a review for Terraria, so I'll stop there.Starbound takes a lot of inspiration from Terraria, almost as directly as Terraria takes from Starbound.However, it doesn't follow through on a lot of its concepts. It attempts to make a Skinner box of leveling progression, except there's no real ""fulfillment"". In Terraria, finding a chest early on was a cool thing, generally significant, and especially significant if you got an item worth using for a good amount of time.Starbound relegates that strategy to one or two chests, and a ""maybe"". You're better off scouring the topside of the world and moving on to the next one directly after. You become less of a Starbound Traveler, and more of a Tourist, flicking through snapshots.The worlds are lively enough, but there's no soul or character growth behind them. The plot is piecemeal and unsatisfying, giant chunks of it are missing, and the chunks that are there are disconnected and uncooperative. In Terraria, the mystery served them well. You didn't know what the corruption was, and it was spreading. You could destroy parts of it, and parts of it would come after you. The eventual path to power gave you more and more interesting paths. It was a magical little experience that sent you from the ends of the world to hell and back. Starbound splits up the worlds into randomly generated pieces, which end up feeling generic and lacking a lot of the charm as a result of the lack of a common 'goal'. I would not recommend this game based upon its virtues, because it doesn't overcome its severe weaknesses as a game. As a sandbox simulator, it's fun enough. As a story, it's bad. The promised features for the game are not in the game, and that's what honestly brings it down. It's a damn shame, and I think it's a symptom of the ""Kickstarter Game"". 5/10, was fun for a bit, then lost interest when the unfinished nature of the game revealed itself like the pretty tablecloth ripped off to reveal that the table only had one and a half legs, and no actual centerpiece. And used to be a chair.			"

								  The game was on it's way to being something really impressive, and it got really popular and they made alot of money really fast and then....no update... 5 months... no update. Now telling us to check out the user mods??? are you ******* kidding me? talk about milking time...  Before that it was thanks for all the money  we are relocating.. that great and all, so in the meantime your entire staff is on paid leave??  I think **Chucklefish** got lucky with there idea, took the money and chances are they are probably working on there next bigger project ""more worth there time"".   The only problem is you are dragging your companies name through the dirt in the process.I will not purchase any **Chucklefish** games in the future.

								Two years into development and you still cannot remap the key bindings within the user interface.Reportedly, this game has made over $20 million dollars and its still in 'early release.'This is an example of why Steam shouldn't host pay-to-develop games like this: because once the developers have made enough money, they no longer have any motivation whatsoever to actually continue to work on the game. The ""quests"" are exactly 5, and you finish them in about 30 minutes - and then you're all on your own.This will be my final purchase of an 'early access' title because I dont want to be left with an abandoned, half finished game that languishes for over two years with very little updates.

								The game could have had promise once upon a time, but the company ran it into the ground along with the community. Its deplorable how they have gone about this really, but I do not see them actually getting themselves collected and actually delivering the promises they have went with, which were retracted restated and rehashed along the course of its existance. Even now the game is but a framework being toted as an almost complete product with hundreds of unique and exicting features, but its really not. You would be much better off spending any money you thought to purchase this with in another direction.			"

								[EDIT JAN 24, 2014]I keep looking back to this game in my library, desperately hoping that it's received some love from the devs and am constantly disappointed. Since my last review, which was already months after no updates, there has still been no real updates to the game. Not only that, but they've apparently removed things from the game, such as temperature function, that really detract from the survival aspect. The devs apparently feel the game has been good enough to be considered done for a while already and there's talk that the next update will be the 1.0 release.In that case, I'm going to remove the caveat from my original review and say don't buy this game at all because the game that was promised is now non-existant rather than a long time away.[END EDIT]I had a lot of fun playing this game when I bought it. I stopped playing after my character was wiped. I'm not upset about the wipe, I knew that was coming, I just stopped playing because the devs promised streamlined, weekly updates (their words, not mine) and I wanted to make sure characters would no longer be wiped. 4 months later, there hasn't been a single update of any significance and the devs put out a steady stream of excuses and blame (if they spent half as much time coding as they do making excuses and blaming fans, the game would be done by now).Any attempt to address the game's shortcomings is met by obnoxious fanboys spouting months old excuses and mods banning you for posting a negative opinion or asking a question.I liked the game when I bought it, honestly I still kinda do. Problem is, I bought it for what it promised to be not what it was and now I am disappointed in the state of things (especially with the endgame the devs have proposed which is seriously balls-out ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥).I would recommend this game with the caveat that you only buy it for exactly what you see because anything more is potentially years away, otherwise just save your money.

												With over 60 hours played, I can guarantee you ten of those hours sloughing through the decievingly short main campaign and grinding for resources, while the rest of the time I was playing an okay vertical Stardew Valley. Aside from accompanying a friend's mission with a Banjo loadout or trying out the newer mods that weren't fortunate enough to be merged with the final game, the base game leaves much to be desired.One of the biggest complaints is how badly the framerates could get fudged in a 2D platformer. You typically see a good 20-30 frame loss every time there are particle effects on screen, a large sprite is rendered, or, god forbid, witness a large sprite with alpha channels while hovering over it with the research tool. To put it into perspective, the credit sequence which is crawling text with a slideshow beside it amounts to a whopping 14 fps. That's impressive. It was also a fitting finale that summed up how this game shipped: through massive incompotence, yet kept afloat by a passionate community that has just the right amount of obnoxiousness to be unappealing yet get work done.If you are a fan of platformers with an expansive sandbox building system, this is very likely a purchase. As it is now, I could not personally recommend this to anyone else until they revisit the main campaign, post-game content, and what is most likely the most shameful resource hog I have seen in a while. Kudos to the first patch that landed, however, as it effectively kept our server from crashing every two hours from a memory leak. These kinds of changes along with what the modding community has been able to accomplish within the last week could mean good things later this year.Special thanks to Nutmeg, shoutout to simpleflips, love you mom			"

Early Access Review
								TL;DR Not gonna lie, Starbound has a lot of potential, but the state that it's been in for the past >6 months is disgusting. I know that the company has had a lot of issues and they recently decided to actually have  HQ and they're still settling in or whatever. I also know that Early Access is kind of expected to be an unpolished game, but there have been so few updates it's really upsetting. I can't recommend this game due to the fact that it's just not getting enough done. I am totally willing to change this review whenever they decide to update it (last big update was in February and it's July now)Keep in mind that this game is in Early Access (for better or for worse) and this review is based on playing time up until July 2, 2014. Starbound is an open world exploration/adventure/sandbox type game, basically Terraria in space. The appeal to these games, of course, is gathering materials and just basically playing with legos that you never have to clean up. I personally enjoy this. It's a nice break from being super competitive in every other game I play. I mean, there's a pvp type thing in this game in that you can totally kill other players, but it's pretty broken. This game surprised me. In Minecraft I was really into redstone and just playing with circuitry and just seeing how much I can automate. While you can't automate as much in Starbound, there's defintely potential to automate more. I rigged up something to automate lighting in my planet so that whenever you enter my base, lights follow you on and turn off when you leave the room. Unfortunately, due to a bug, I have to rewire it every time I boot the game up because wires disappear for no reason. Now, this is to be expected, I mean, this is an Early Access game after all, but it's been an issue since day one and they still haven't fixed it. That alone is certainly a reason why I haven't booted up the game in forever.Combat is kind of wonky. There's no real way to know what type of enemy you're going to fight. I personally thought that was kind of for the lore because you're traveling to unknown planets so you wouldn't know how threatening anything is on that planet, but I've heard other people say that they really don't like that approach. I personally just tried to avoid fighting because the goal of the game isn't to fight things and they're really easy to avoid. A friend of mind was telling me about how she really doesn't like the fact that armor doesn't really make you super overpowered against mobs even at the highest tier, and sure, I can understand that being an issue. I personally am of the belief that this is the survival aspect of the game and you can't be expected to actually fight everything in the game; that's just impractical for actually surviving. Instead, I picked my battles and only fought when I was out of blocks to bridge over enemies. Resource gathering is pretty normal, just mine out blocks and hope for ores. The more advanced you get in the tier, the easier of a time you'll have finding ores from lower tiers. At the highest tier, you can mine asteroids which are super rich in ores and kind of break the game since you don't have to actually scavenge for resources, but, instead, just head to the nearest asteroid for a half hour and have all the resources you'll need for a while. Something that was kind of off-putting early on was that the basic tools performed better than the fancy matter manipulator item you have. I mean, I totally get specialization of items and how that contributes for better gameplay, but it didn't make sense to me that an item clearly more advanced than a pickaxe or a regular axe is outperformed by both. I mean, you can totally get drills later, and those do way better, but it's still weird that this space traveler is reduced to using what I would think is archaic, uncharacteristic items.The drops in this game are kind of weird too. You can totally have a friend take you to a high level planet and just loot surface chests for gear you can use and it'll carry you forever. There's also a chance that you find actual literal trash in the surface chests and then you're kind of upset. Even at high level planets, you have a good chance at finding super bad weapons. It's kind of irritating. At least building is pretty easy. I didn't really play Terraria, so it had to be explained to me that you have to actually fill in the background for stuff to not spawn (I thought it was a lighting thing like minecraft). After a bit it all makes sense and it's pretty intuitive - Select a block, press the mouse to put the block, repeat until done. There's also a pretty large variety of blocks and colors of blocks. That's pretty cool, but, in my opinion, the best blocks that can be used for building are generally hard to find and also uncraftable in vanilla. That's pretty upsetting. There are mods that allows you to purchase them with the otherwise pretty worthless pixel currency and that's totally cool.Progression in the game relies on you to find a certain amount of an ore and or it's additive to make it into a new refined ore to make a new tool thing or armor so that you can progress to the next area. That's totally cool, but it does feel kind of unrewarding. Sure you unlock a bunch of new things to build, but I really don't see a reason to limit a player on what they're able to build based on how far they've progressed like that. I do, however, see the need that some materials need special resources to create. I mean, you have to basically jump through 10 hoops to finally be able to craft everything. Some issues I personally have with the game are the fact that the pixel currency is virtually worthless; the cosmetics sold by some vendors aren't really appealing and the machine that lets you scan/reprint decorative blocks is cool, but I really wish the mod that allows you to print blocks made it to vanilla. The idea is that it's a super advanced 3d printer anyway, who is to say that it shouldn't allow you to recreate ANYTHING you've previously seen rather than just a handful of things you'll just place around for looks.Chests are also kind of a big deal. They don't really upgrade in capacity. I mean, and I bet you're maybe getting tired of hearing me say this, there is a mod that lets you have higher upgrade capacity in specialized chests, but these types of things, especially considering there's a forced progression, makes me think that there isn't enough thought being put into the game.I've already mentioned wiring. I don't know the cause of it, but it's always the same combination of 5 wires that I have to reconnect each time. That effectively makes building with wiring in mind irrelevant because it's going to break. It WILL break. Maybe not all of it, but just enough to make you irritated. Fortunately, despite all the bugs, the modding community is excellent. A lot of really cool mods have been added that give existing game mechanics a boost. Starfoundry comes to mind as something exceptional that really increases the game's playability. Overall, I cannot recommend this game in its current state. As I've mentioned, I'm totally willing to adjust whenever they're comfortable saying that they're actually gonna release the game in full as they see fit. It's tragic, though, because I really want to like this game. It's got a lot of potential, but just isn't there yet.			"

Didn't think I'd ever get around to reviewing Starbound, but I suppose now's the time. The beginning is a bit ranty, and I apologize for it.While I haven't played Starbound in ages, I can certainly say that this game had a lot of potenial when it first went into early access. Those intial days of those first updates were fun and brought us new features. I thought this game was going to be a rival of Terraria and I was honeslty surprised in the differences that I saw in the early stages, but then...Chucklefish went MIA for a long time. The game got stale, bugs weren't getting fixed, and now almost three years later it's getting released. While I can't say that I didn't enjoy the game and what I've played, and I loved it every bit of it, I can't recommend this game only for the the devs. I've been with the community almost since the beginning and I had a lot of hopes for this game like a lot of the community. While I can't speak for everyone I'm displeased at how Chucklefish worked on this game and how they treated the community, I'm not going to throw and shade but I need to be careful of what I say because of acts they've done in the past to people talking about Starbound. I am however going to make a pro and con list of the games feautes and what's made it the experience that is it.Pros:-Large variety of blocks to build with -Fun and inviting landscapes-Wide variety of weapons to kill, maim, and destroy with-Seven playable races-Soothing OST-Easy to pick up combat system-Game's Purpose: Building is fun if you're creative.Cons:-Beginning is boring, mid-game is boring, everything just tends to be ""boring."" The game tends to just be a huge collect-a-thon-Boss fights. Let me expand on this first: The boss fights just aren't interesting. The first boss you fight is just bland and not enjoyable, the rest of the bosses are slighltly different, but not as fun.-Optimization (I still don't understand HOW this game isn't optimized. It still gets lag spikes even though my computer runs hardware that's a lot faster than the recommended specs. I know not every game is perfect, but I shouldn't lag everytime I enter my ship or go into a menu. This game honeslty is just poorly optimized and Chucklefish should have fixed that a long time ago.)-Quests and NPCs aren't fun to do or interact with; most quests are fetch quests or a ""Do this to complete a query so I can give you an item that's already out classed by experience."" While there are a lot of quests in Starbound, most of them are needed to progress in the ""story,"" and just take too much time to do. NPCs are still basic and uninteresting. Nothing has changed since the first update, they still just say a few lines and walk around.-The ""Story:"" There's a forced story in this game and while some say it's a good way to teach players, it's just so slow paced that it hinders the experience. When I started playing Starbound it was just ""Build and survive,"" but now that there's a story that is REQUIRED TO ADVANCE IN ANY TECHNOLOGICAL WAY it honestly just makes the game more of a chore.-Game's Purpose: If you aren't a creative person, this game just lacks much of anything for you.-Planets: They're all just color swaps with different environments. The generation is lacking, and in some cases is down right unfair, I.E. Huge death pit that you won't find until your mining durasteel or slime biomes that just make you bounce into enemiesIN CLOSING:I can't hate this game. I liked it for what it was when it was a lot more basic, but with all these additions Chucklefish keeps bringing in, it's honestly making the game more of a chore. I can't recommend this game only because of how slow development was and how the devs treated the community, especially during the hiatus. While it is getting released, FINALLY, in a few days (Or is released if you're reading this review on release day,) it's not worth the money. While I don't hate this game, I just wish that the whole development cycle would have gone differently and I hope that the release changes how the devs produce for the community and interact with the community.Until these changes, please don't get this game.

								With all those devs screwing over the customers, incessant shilling by the delusional userbase and the lack of content, I can not with a good conscience recommend this game to anyone. Now, people might complain about how I can give a negative review after having ""played"" so many hours (Don't forget that Steam considers having an opened launcher as being in game) while I've  bought this product for just 15 dollars.It's simple: This isn't about money spent/time played. It's about what was promised to me as a customer and what they provided. If I wanted the most bang for my buck I'd go play outside or enjoy some torrented movies, both of which come for free and are way more fulfilling than playing a game just to get spit in the face by the devs, while they ""apologize"" for my inconvenience by calling the development ""Weird"" and losing a third of their coding department.Tiy, if you read this: Hiring more artists won't fix *♥♥♥♥*. Don't forget to get a few more people that know how to code properly or Sony will have you by the balls.			"

												So after a 5 year wait, it's finally released. After all that time, with content updates and changing basically everything in the game, Chucklefish has managed to deliver something truly dull and uninspiring. Starbound is a fabulous premise, a universe full of potential. After spending some time with the final release, I am left with one question:That's it?The quests and story that I've been waiting for the biggest let down. The main quest consists of 2 types of mission: 1. Find a settlement of the specified race and scan their furniture.2. Travel to a pre-made level and fight a boss at the end.The side quests consist of 3 types of missions:1. Deliver an object or escort a person to another person on the planet. Often times this second person is right next to the first person.2. Kill an enemy for someone.3. Collect ore or some other item for someone.The rest of the game, as best as I can tell, is collecting stuff and building other stuff. You can set up a colony, but why would you? So you can get more tedious and boring quests? So you can have a farm? A universe of endless possibilities and farming is the most creative thing you could come up with?One other thing I noticed is that the monsters seem to have gotten less unique. There are some that still seem to be randomly generated per planet, but there are a few that are on every planet. I don't know if that's a bug or not, but it wasn't like this before.So after a 5+ year wait, I'm left with a game that has redefined blandness and squandered potential. No, I still can't recommend this game. I don't even want to bother finishing it just to finish it.At least the soundtrack is still good. But that's it.			"

												edit: fixed some grammar here and thereDuring the Early Alpha I was like ""This is good. There's lot of potential!"". Had fun for a few days, especially in multi with a friend. But still it seemed too much unfinished, and so we decided to wait for the final version.A year or so later, when the final launched, we tried it again. It seemed fun at the beginning, they fixed something here and there, balanced it out. It was engaging again for a few more days.I now have played I think a dozen hours on the final version, between single and multiplayer, and finally decided to write this review. (steam reports more hours because I forgot it open a couple of times)The dev team sadly fell in the old procedural development rabbit hole, and understandably couldn't get out of it. The content seems a lot, but it's really not. The whole mass of the content is in the graphic assets, but for the rest there's almost nothing. Let me get in detail:1) There are like 3 quests repeated over and over the whole galaxy, including the main questline. The superficiality of the sidequests is evident when you find different villages and you always get the same quest, literally the same one on every planet, from 10 cramped up npcs. This is also apparent with the main questline, that consists of those 4-5 ad hoc maps (unreachable otherwise) where at the end you get to kill a boss (and boy they are all easy to beat).2) Another major turn-off is the main story. I really think that making the main questline obbligatory for the player goes against everything that a sandbox game is.3) The sub-biomes are another big problem, they are very superficial too. You basically find always the same 2-3 ones (gnomes, slime, small houses underground, etc). These sub-biomes never give you anything special, nor they have any background story or anything. The crates you find, and you always find them by the dozens, have always the same loot, because each of the few different star types has the same exact loot for all its planets.4) And then we have the colonies system. You find a planet, build a house, and a random guy teleports in. He does nothing. He will rarely give you one of the same 2-3 quests (they are exactly the same as the sidequests in the game) and then, when he wants, he'll give you finally the chance to hire him (but you don't actually need a crew in the game, and it has no utility whatsoever).I don't recommend this game.Maybe only discounted and if you plan to play in multiplayer with a friend.Otherwise don't waste money.

								I used to want to recommend this game to everyone, as the game is fun, challenging, and ultra fun in multiplayer. HOWEVER, i quote what the developers say, ""Updates will come thick and fast, though, as we listen to your feedback, push fixes and add new content.”   What updates?... the game is pretty much the same since Dec 4, 13  with a few minor fixes... i cant recall the last huge juicy update.      With that being said, once you get to the wierd part of the game which you can call ""the end""  you can farm overpowerd weapons easily making everything die in the blink of an eye, then there really isnt much to do in the game after that. To me it feels like taking a nice peacful journey that feels like it couldnt end, then BOOM right as it was getting good, dead end....  the game is fun up to that point... but that point is really easy to reach once you get the hang of things, there are also a ton of useless things in the game, useless mechanics, useless weapons and armor, useless ores, they can take that crap out and add more content please.  This game has soooo much potential, yet, they arent doing anything with it, makes me wonder what they are actually doing.			"

								If you're on the fence about this; hold off until full release and even then maybe you shouldn't.How to win at starbound:create pickmine some oresmake better pickfly to better planetgoto 1.That is if the game doesn't bug out and halt progresson entirely.Combat is hilariously easy(but hey, we got omni-directional sword swings now; counts for something right?) and even 'bosses' can be killed without taking damage easily.Content updates are minimal, if any at all, with most 'updates' being attempts at fixing world gen/render lag which apparently don't work for a lot of people.No, bugfixes arn't updates. Those are patches.The nightlies exist but arn't nightly and are really broken(they did warn us I guess)Crafting is decent but is hindered by tiered progression (refer to 'how to win at starbound', above)In short: Hold off on buying until they decide to slap 1.0 on it (Be warned that starbound does not follow the standard program version numeration)			"

Early Access Review
								Loaded with awkward 'features' that make gameplay unbearable such as the stale, randomly generated enemies that all manage to feel and act about the same way have ruined this experience. Speaking from playing this game and watching its development from its early days up until now, I can tell you that the more finished this game gets, the more vile it becomes. Possibly because the charm has all worn off, or maybe because the development team keeps making the -dumbest- decisions. Now, I don't really know the dev team so I don't know what their vision is, but trying to patch up this game by having forced mission sequences when the core of the game is about exploration, building, and player-driven advancement is more than a little wrong. Instead of finding new, awesome, and cool things on planets, you find that every single place you go to is exactly the same with a different coat of paint. It's the same -everywhere-. The hazards feel like background noise, the enemies all look and feel the same, the combat is dull, and no matter what you do or what you run into, it's always -disappointing- in the end. That's what this game is summed up in one word: Disappointment.How a game that started out with such crass graphics and such a small development team as Terraria could far surpass this particular endeavour in every way, that started with a -modest- goal, and as more or less a 2D minecraft clone is beyond baffling. Terraria doesn't boast multiple worlds, and the only thing that's randomly generated is the terrain, but I'd still rather waste my time in the world of Terraria than this game. Why? Because when you explore you find things that -matter-. It feels like you're in control. Everything -- even building -- has a point to it. So basically, Starbound managed to completely ruin itself by being the exact opposite of Terraria. You're not in control of anything, everything is pointed out to you, exploration renders nothing satisfying, and there's so much randomly generated content that it all blends together into one static mess.Understandably, this game is early access which means that the developers are constantly working on fixing it, and at some point in the future, say, maybe 2020, they might have all of the bugs and quirks in this game fixed, but until then, it's not going to be fun for anyone.If you like disappointment, this is the game for you. Otherwise, just leave it alone, buy and/or play Terraria, and save yourself the grief.Post August '15 Update Edit: This review might've been written with more venom than what was intended, but I stick to my guns on this: You're better off playing Terraria or Minecraft. The update I've noticed has added a lot of features that seemed interesting, but ended up, again, not adding much to the actual meat of the game. You can dress a mess up however you want and even throw some neon lights on there to attract the rave kids, but at the end of the day, it's still a mess.			"

								At first i think this game was alsome, well...here's are few reasons why i won't recommend this game any more:*The game radomly gernrates almost every thing... but after you play the game for a little while, everything feels same, for eg a planet will almost always have same number of monsters and a durgon, etc...*The guns in the game are more of a blowpipe with a high ""blow"" rate, and they are super weak.*Every thing, almost everything uses energy(guns, bows, etc...), like they don't even have ammo and the energy goes down too fast...*Even they say, oh everything is radom so you can play it over and over, but no if you think about it every game is same! Start in a planet, make stuff, kill a boss, goes to another sector, and repeat..*The boss in the game are so easy to kill, basically block + rage weapons(Just cage the boss with blocks!), some boss like UFO does crash block but if you put blocks all around it it would just stay there and can't do a thing.*Not enough crafting objects, well right now you can only craft a few blocks, witch means that your buliding materials are super limted, yes you can take from durgons but that's just board.*Lame animations, ok starbounds animation is just well ugly i guess, the bullets won't create lights, lame death animation, fake looking explodsion, etc...Right now i won't recommend this game.

								TLDR: Don't buy this game, or at least wait for it to be finished first.  Now that the hype has died down, people are starting to see that this is just a suckier version of Terraria.I wanted Terraria in space.  I needed Terraria in space.  I thought I was paying for Terraria in space...but no...I like a lot of things about this game.  The art style, the music, the concept, the sense of adventure, but in its entirety, this game falls flat on its face.  When you start out, you'll have a few tutorial quests teaching you how to do things, and you'll cut down trees and make a fire, and then you'll be sent out into the world.  In my first few hours, I found military bases, ancient pyramids, sewer monsters, and all sorts of fun stuff like that.  The frustrating thing was that when I got to these places I usually got killed instantly by the enemies there.Now, here's the devastating part.  To get armor and weapons, you need to get a bunch of metal bars and pixels.  Pixels are what everything is made of in Starbound, so you'll need them to make everything.  So even though you have a bunch of iron bars, and you want to make an iron chestpiece, you'll still need pixels to do it.  You get pixels by killing monsters, but when you die, you lose two thirds of your pixels.  So you'll need to be very careful, killing monsters one at a time and sleeping or bandaging if you get hurt between fights, which is just waiting and waiting.  And you will get hurt, because monsters in this game move at lightning speed, and they jump thirty feet into the air, so you can't hit them with your bow (Which wouldn't kill a monster at your level in just one full charge anyway), and then they kill you instantly when they get close.  And after a couple of hours of frustration, you finally have that iron chestpiece.  After that, to get the bow, sword, helmet, and pants, rinse and repeat.And here's the best part:  Once you get fully geared up and the monsters aren't a challenge, you move out of the Alpha sector and move onto the Beta sector!  And you get insta-killed by the monsters again!  So start grinding to get that gear!  (If I wanted to grind in a video game, I'd play World of Warcraft, which is mind-numbing in a pleasant way instead of an agonizing one.)Compared to Terraria, where it was really fun to to progress through the tiers of gear, and fight bosses, and make cool houses (In Starbound, time doesn't pass on a planet when you're not on it, so be prepared to have a farm and all of your chests on your ship), Starbound is too repititive and grindy.  I haven't gone through all of the game's tiers yet, but I've put over fourty hours into it, and I feel like that's enough to give it a fair judgement.  Of these fourty hours, perhaps half of them were spent in either frustration or the mind-numbing sensation of doing the same thing over and over to reach a goal.I believe that Chuckfish have said they'll change the progression system in the future, but this game is in Beta.  I'm not giving this game a negative review because an ice planet I went to had a warm temperature, or a lava planet was freezing.  I'm not giving this game a negative review because it's a bit laggy for a 2D game with pixel graphics.  I'm not giving this game a negative review because they haven't added in a wide enough variety of food, or guns.  I'm giving this game a negative review because its mechanics seem to be utterly broken, and if it's that way in Beta, I doubt they'll ever be able to fix it.Edit:  This review is out of date, and I really don't feel like updating it.  Sorry.			"

								NOTE: This is a review of the game as of 7/21/2014 Early AccessIf you've played the heck out of Terraria then there's nothing to see here.They say there is a main questline (from my last time playing) the only questline was to do what you where SUPPOSED to do (I.e. obtain your first mining/digging/treecutting tool, slay the 1st - 4th bosses) after this there is the ""comparing"" between Terraria vs. Starbound, Terraria has so many ♥♥♥♥in' weapons for each class, while in starbound alright, there's a wide selection, but good ♥♥♥♥ing luck gettting them. World exploration, Terraria has a fault since Starbound has, welp, a crapton of planets, but to me, it was all boring, felt like it was a randomly generated world with nothing under the ground, other than monsters/aliens that you'll find on the surface. Armor? hah, 15 versus Terraria's 45 (excluding console only armors)Fairly enough I wouldn't touch this game, instead try doing a run on terraria with using a different set of weapons then before			"

								Honestly, I saw this game being released a year ago, but wasn't really following it. I thought the whole idea of Starbound was quite interesting, but I wasn't really playing games that much so it wasn't until recently that I decided to check it out again.When I bought the game, I thought I was going to be getting a close to finished/complete game since it has been ""Early Access"" for god knows how long now, but that simply wasn't the case.While the gameplay is actually fun, and I was able to sink in a few hours of enjoyment, the game rapidly stagnated for me, which while disappointing, was something I should have known.I neglected to read the reviews on this game, and now I see that the studio behind this game is incredibly disorganized and inept, especially the lead devs. When I asked on the forums about the lack of updates in nearly 5 months, I was swiftly banned, but I'm not alone it seems, hundreds of others have been banned on the forums regarding inqueries to the games stall in development.I would not recommend buying this game at this time, the staff doesn't really seem to know what they are doing, the game is unfinished, and while you may have some fun for a bit, the game is not worth the $15 as it stands.Overall, disappointing with how this whole thing has turned out.

								As it stands right now, I cannot reccomend this game.Starbound is a game that originally caught my eye with what seemed to be limitless potential and a dedicated design team that had already worked on some products I enjoy. Unfortunately you can't buy groceries with potential, and even a broken clock is right twice a day.That said, there are some good things about the game.- Potential. I can't stress enough that this game looks like it COULD be super good once it's finished and it IS still in beta, so you never know.- Sci-Fi...sort of. You can argue this for sure, but it's nice to see an exploration game that uses at least some space and sci-fi elements instead of the standard gantasy game tropes.- Addictive gameplay. If you're a fan of Minecraft or Terraria, you know what I'm talking about. In the beginning you could easily lose hours and hours to this game as you explore and build.- Neat Bosses: All of the bosses I've encountered have been fun and interesting. I won't spoil them for you here, but check out some gameplay footage if you want to see them.Of course, with there being good stuff, there's always bad stuff to go along with it:- Update frequency, there isn't any. For a game that was promised to be full of ""thick and fast"" updates and a constantly growing list of features, there has been extremely little delivered on. At the time of writing I think the last update was six months ago, and the most recent dev blog update is pathetic: A screenshot of a single mob, no context and ""I don't feel like writing much right now.""- Stale Progression: One of the things that initially attracted me to this game was the idea that you'd progress through research, learning to build new things through maybe trial and error or exposure...and the game has utterly failed to deliver on that idea. So far all you do is craft a new set of armour, fight the new boss, and then move onto the next section to repeat. There's no quests beyond the starter ones, no story and overall nothing to do except the same thing ad nauseum.- Uninteresting Worldscapes: When I first loaded into Starbound my loading screen showed a black planet surrounded by tentacles. I COULD NOT WAIT to go find a planet like that and explore the heck out of it. Sure the planets I was on right now were boring, but I could deal...until I found one. I found one of those tentacles...only to discover it was just a reskinned tree. It was chopped down like a tree, fell like a tree, and produced wood like a tree. And unfortunately that's all there is. Each planet is just a reskin of the ones before, with the same landscapes, dungeons and cities. Even the cool enviromental stuff you see at the beginning of the game becomes stale and samey after it's repeated dozens of times.There's some pretty ugly stuff that goes on in the forums for this game as well that paint some pretty unflattering pictures of the Dev team and the Mod Team for their forums. I'm not going to get into it here becayse you can easily find accounts of it all over, but this is a Company i have come to mistrust, and that can sink a lot of enthusiasm.At this point I doubt Starbound will be released, and if it is, I suspect it will be a shadow of it's own potential. I hope I'm wrong, but wait for release if you MUST give it a try, otherwise I recommend giving Starbound a pass.			"

For a long time most ""updates"" were simply the developers taking mods the community made and making them ""official"" and adding one or two cosmetic items that did nothing but look nice.I understand it is in ""early access"", but the good people at Chucklefish have yet to actually implement basic features such as the ability to change keybinding or even a button to delete your characters. The devs have also failed to implement any promised features to the game in many months. At first they kept saying that it was due to their ""staff"" moving and settling in at their new office in London, but since then updates have remains scarce and development appears stalled despite constant assurances that they are ""working on it"".Don't buy this. I urge you not to give these people money. They truly do not deserve it.			"

Early Access Review
								A warning against buying early access games, Chucklefish dropped the ball by releasing Starbound in it's current state. Do not be fooled by the early game, the upgrading of your space ship, the collection of gear and treasure or the seemingly sensible progression of upgrades. All these positives are fleeting. It won't be long until you've completed all the actual content; obtaining the endgame armors, beating all the bosses and sampling each type of planet, which gets old very fast, given that each planet has copy pasted dungeons you'll be sick of seeing. Afterwards all that's left is to sit and wait for Chucklefish to release more.I've tried time and time again to like this game and whilst it has features that I do enjoy (dual wielding and dynamic lighting) it just doesn't get updated frequently enough. Months can pass without an update to their stable client. When updates are released they are underwhelming. Quite frankly I cannot recommend this game in it's current state. Perhaps it'll be a late bloomer like Terraria was. Chucklefish did not deserve my money nor do they deserve yours.			"

												I've given this game three years and finally came back and finished the final release with a buddy of mine, and at the end of this glorious storyline he summed it up perfectly. ""This game feels like it was completed by a couple of high schoolers, NONE of which have ANY creativity."" Literally, nothing but fetch quests. Like a single player MMO. It gets repetitive really fast.If you've already played Terraria and beat it, this game scratches that itch. That sandbox 2D itch. If you haven't, don't waste your time and money on this one. Go play Terraria.			"

								this game in its current state is not worth buying in my opinion, it took me only a day or two to get to the last sector of the game and get all the armor types, i find myself getting board from nothing to do except explore the same old planets and build ever bigger houses.the bosses were all easy to beat you just use the same tactic over and over again and the monster all act roughly the same no variations between them.and for updates the last real update was in april, and no i dont count reworking old block as an updateand the fact that the develiper atacking and banning people that ask why none of the things they promised were in the game a year on ( now 2 years on)  what every one says to play are a buggy as hell and broken nightlys. you know  you have a bad development team when modder have done more work since the april update then the develpores in 2 yearsupdaterecently cf mods have been deleating post and banning anyone that bring up fail promises of anything negitive abou the game. i believe this is to remove all negative post from the forums so new people that have not bought the game do not see thembe aware this is not the only shade / illegal thing they have done in the past so if anyone that has not bought the game reads this do not buy!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!edit so as of the new stable update (aka unstable relabled ) most of the buggs that have been in the game since launch have not been fixed. the new patchs have broke the game so bad that lenux and window xp player weren't able to play the game at all for almost 2 weeksupdateso ya he terrible quest system is still there and is still the only way to progessstill no point to biulding a base, food is still mostly useless, the f up farming in the nightlysthey fu metalurgy coppe + iron =  steal????  i like the longer this game goe on the crappr it gets it does not even resemble what it was origioly sold as so ............ still not a buy recomedation			"

								The devs have repeated lied about the devolpment of this game. The store page features false advertisements in both the pictures and description, claiming updates come thick and fast. An update hasnt been released in over 4 months. The lead dev is a known liar, he used to work on terraria before starbound but was let go after stealing sprites from final fantasy and lying to the community about updates, and doing other things that both hurt the community and devs, The lead dev also promised that this game would be fully released by 2013 as well as MANY other promises that he has not fulfilled. Any criticism towards the game on any official starbound forum is instantly deleted for being ""A jerk"" or ""Mean"" (Yes, these are actual reasons stated by the mods and their PR manager.) Honestly, there are so many more things I can say about this game but I dont have the time or patience to do so. Please do not purchase this game or any game that Chuckle Fish endorses. If you dont believe me just google this stuff, im sure you can find more than enough reasons on your own on why you should not purchase this game.			"

								This is one of those games I felt had potential, perhaps it still does but at the moment the game feels the same. There hasn't been anything exciting to pull me back in. After I lost my first charecter to an update, I started anew hoping that there would be more to the game than: mine ore then move to next planet. But I found myself doing just that and it grew stale. Once the quest update came around while I wasn't excited I had hoped it might make the game more interesting. Unfortunatly the quests feel boring and fairly pointless. After a long while of waiting the exciting update I have waited for still hasn't shown up, and it makes me sad because I feel like this game is missing out on being great.The only other game I can compare this to is Terraria which was recently updated to 1.3. I thought I had played enough terraria but then the update was big, exciting, had tons of new of cool things to do, more interesting things to learn/discover and an epic end boss. This game just doesn't come close to Terraria and until a worthwhile update comes out it never will. I have 197 hours on terraria and want to play even more. I don't think I want to play Starbound at all now.			"

												Okie, After playing this game for a solid of 100hrs and more.I've decided that I should give my thoughts about it.It's... Amazingly fun!When I first saw the game clip, my first impression was.. okay, maybe this game is the grindy and more of a farm-base kind of game? But trust me, it's not.If you are looking for a game that is grindy or heavily dependant on questing and leveling, then StarBound is not the game for you. StarBound is a exploration game.The game focus a lot in immersing the player into the StarBound universe.Not to mention the developers did a brilliant job with the multiplayer option that make the game ten times more enjoyable to play with. StarBound has everything.If your feeling adventurous, tag one of your friends to go universe hunting with you, fend off monsters, save the villagers, earn friendship or even recuit a crew. If you are a builder, Starbound offer over a hundred different types / race of furnitures. From high tech to medival and more. Build your own coloney, expand it, rent it and make new friends!If you don't like to play with human or AIs. No problem, StarBound also offer a pet system for pet lovers.Traveling to all the different universe and capture awesome monsters, make them your companion and trusty mission partners.There's so many varity of things to do in there, you can choose to do them or don't have to. It's entirely optional. It's your own StarBound story to tell.Overall experience, highly recommended. StarBound definitely earned its 10/10 at ease.			"

												tl;dr: I wouldn't buy it unless you have a friend that has it but even then I duno. Pretty much mod the crap out of the game to make it worth while cause I duno what the developers were doing over the last few years :(Oh after editing a bit I figured out what i'm exactly feeling about this game. It feels like this should have been the beta and now we are waiting on the real game. So this review is my first and probably terrible but it is mine and if anything I hope the 5 people on my friends list that have this in their wishlist are a bit more informed and hopefull avoid this shallow game.Cool Stuff--First couple of story missions-Space ship upgrading (granted its only room sizes w.e still cool)-Multpile races-Different planet typesTrying to think of more-Procedural weapons maybe-Cool special moves on weapons-Underwater and Outerspace bases-Crew recruting-Colony/Tenants-Building in this game is a breeze and beautiful so it has that going for it I guess ill give it that-Hand created enemies-Boring but rewarding random fetch quests ( you kill some cool units sometimes and i've mostly gotten cool things as rewards)-Rainbow knightNot Cool Stuff--Story missions after first couple-Space magic is really dumb ( i wanted to like it but they should have left that to terraria )God theres a lot-No novakid npcs or tenants ( i feel like they don't even exist, i guess i could play one )-Crafting is like straight up trash as far as weapons are concerned-Magma, Ocean, and Poison worlds ( no reason to explore except for ore and only place to really use the useless boat )-I felt like the techs were cooler in the betas back a couple years ago-Hoverbike ( to many giant hills to really take advantage of it and it takes tons of damage )-The crew recruiting is cool the crew members themselves are useless-Omega super god aweful boring enemies-Stupid enemy ai that just runs into you over and over, really boring-Not so random random enemy generation ( cool concept but ive seen the same face on the same body type 100 time but this time he has spikes on his back )-Pets are about as dumb and usless as the crew sadly ( once again cool concept )-Unique weapons or legendaries are boring and usually really weak ( i did like the magna orb though )This is going to be to long maybe?-Moons are dumb ( go to moon with nothing on it except for fuel, that is just plain old fluff content )-Asteroids are meh ( less boring then moons but no real reason to go there )-Everything about the UI sucks especially for chests ( you need mods )-Basically a lot of stuff is just bland except for all the things that were once previously mods of some sort that got inject into the official game like railing was really cool and the novakid stuff which I found out was really a original idea but evolved from a much cool race call the umm Anyemods or something AnodynesYa I don't know. I'm going to keep playing it because i'm seeing some interesting mods that change things to better fit how I want to play but I don't think I can recommend this game to anyone. Mods seem to be the only way i'm going to make it through my first playthrough because it is just so boring. I played this thing a bit around the time of the initial release and then kept tabs on the dev blog ( like had it as my home page ) for a while and I felt like what they were showing was really cool and then it just took them forever to make. I am not a developer so I don't know what it takes to develope a game like this but when like right out of the gate they were like it's going to be out ""blah blah"" or wait no ""later blah"" I grew a bit skeptical of the game really coming out so after a few years this game was a complete distant memory.So where are we? I'm what a week or more after the release of 1.0 after not playing this game since pretty much 3 -4 years ago and it still feels like it has no idea what it wants to be.The long of it for as long as this has become is that I guess I was expecting more from a game that seemed to have so much going for it. This games just regular? Bland maybe I duno. Maybe I was expectin personalized quests for each race or something. I mean so far the quest system that I was looking forward to is just really really bad. I liked the space station mission and was like this is cool, then there was the floran one and was like woah I really like this and by the hylotl and avian or w.e the birds were called again I was pretty much like ""ya this is just boring now"". Oh and jesus that looking for artifact things with the manipulator that was just bad...ya just bad... really bad.I really wanted to love this game. A game shouldn't make you feel sorry for it ya know, like woah this and this is kinda cool but I don't know what happened with the rest of you sorta feeling?			"

Early Access Review
								Ugh, why can't Steam have a 'mixed' review option? It's a good game, it just has a lot of growing pains and i wish I could say ""wait til it develops more"" instead of just ""Yes or no"". Anyway... there's a lot to like and dislike about Starbound. I won't drone on and on about it though, and try to sum it up.It's got a good style, good polish, tons and tons of items, content, enemies, the map and word system generates procedurally and with a surprising amount of interest. There's quests and ship progression, item and skill upgrades... there's no shortage of content in the beginning. However, once you're through with the quests, have a big ship, and are free to explore the universe, it kind of... falls flat at the moment. I feel there should be, at some point, either more interesting quests, bosses, things to find and explore at the end game. Before the questing, this was more free-form and fun, experimenting and discovering. Now with quests it's a bit too restricted, but.. if they want to go that way, fine, just develop them more. The other part is the ship, making no reason to build on planets. While I like the ship upgrades and progression, I think it goes a bit too far and too much, as one other review said; you can put everything in your ship, so what's the point of building on planets?The progression is alright, except I personally found the bosses to be INSANELY difficult solo. When you die, too, you re-navigate the entire level. Extremely frustrating and annoying... but customization is extremely high, music and visuals, polish and controls, all very high. I think the biggest problem is just later game content and some balancing, but it's a good game overall, I'd just still say wait on it.			"

The gameplay is decent but repetitive and strangely balanced, such as eng-game materials costing a measly 600 pixels.I like this game. I like it a lot. But it was given a full release that's not worth the money. I bought this game in beta thinking it would be good, something special. I am sorry to announce I was disappointed.But hey, other people might like the story and find the programming issues tolerable. I'm not content with the mediocrity presented to me as a game, however. A full release of a game shouldn't have so many technical issues, and if those weren't present I might pass it off as acceptable. They are here, however, and given the game in it's current state I can't recommend it.			"

								Early Access should have some kind of user feedback feature, where you can vote if Steam should block these guys from using this system again. This is one of the cases where a block would be good to teach them not to mess with their customers.I can't express how disappointed I am at this game. They just kept the unfinished game there for what should be around 2 years now, releasing an upgrade once every 8 months or so just to claim that they're not abandoning the game (wich, believe me, they ARE) and that's it. This game had such potential, but all wasted. At this rhythm, the game gets 5-10% better every 8 months... and it still has A LOT to do before it can be labeled as a complete game. They keep changing the already existant stuff instead of implementing the stuff missing in the game to finish and release it already, and change existant stuff with further patches if needed. It's almost like they're stalling, winning some time just to keep sucking from our wallets with the ""work in progress, we need your money to continue"" excuse. Do NOT buy this. Teach them a lesson.			"

								Really wanted this game to be good. Heard they were going selling a Beta, decided to jump onboard. The Beta claim was a lie, this game in 2013 was a barely started alpha. Where I expected a nearly finished game (As is warrented when playing a BETA) I got a game that was not even close to a finished state. This was clearly an Alpha that I was playing, and ChuckleFish clearly lied about it. But, I liked the concept and I had fun with my friends for a short while, so I was willing to overlook that detail. I would give them the benefit of the doubt. They promissed consistant updates and quick development.That was about seven months ago.I have what is essentially the same alpha that I had when I first purchased this game. No changes worth speaking about. I'm not overstating that either, nothing as far as updates go. I'm not one to get mad at developers for being slow, either. I also did the DayZ early access programs. DayZ may be slow, but at least they done SOMETHING. They've fixed combat logging, they've fixed zombies, they added physics, they added a bunch of guns. Actual progress. Starbound, NOTHING.Top this all off with creepy amount of censorship that ChuckleFish has on its forums and Reddit and its easy to see why there are so many negative reviews of this game. Honestly STAY AWAY, this game is not worth your money and ChuckleFish is not worth your time.			"

												While I really enjoy this game, There are a few issues that need to be adressed.Pros--A fun sandbox game, sort of like Terraria, in space.-There are something around 4 millions or so planets to explore (that was the number I read when I got it, there are probably more now.)-There are many different things to do, like farming, building colonies, and so forth.-The planets add many different challenges.-There is a pet-like system, sort of like pokemon in a sense.-You can get crewmembers, that do various things for the ship. Like the engineer can increase how much fuel the ship can take on.Cons--There is almost no point to do any of the extra features. Farming isn't all that necessary, even with the hunger system.-To upgrade your ship, you have to actually build a colony, and get crewmembers to upgrade it. However, due to the new ""upgrade station"" system, there is almost no point to do that since you can live fine without upgrading your ship once.-A very, VERY, bad storyline. You start off in this group, called the ""protectorate"", and basically you have to go through the entire game to  beat the thing that destroyed earth, but there is almost no incentive to do so. You are in the protectorate for around two minutes before Earth gets shrekt, so there is almost no incentive to go through the game, and beat the final boss, since it never really did anything to you in the first place.-The storyline is the same almost everytime, you basically get a debrief from a protectorate lady, that basically says you have to go to any random planet of your choosing, find this ""specific"" race, and scan certain items. Whether the items the race has in their home are useful to scan or not, though, is a completely different matter entirely. This happens six times, everytime ending in a boss battle. Basically, becoming very reptitive.-Some of the crew members, like the janitor, seem to be completely useless, basically bringing no upgrades at all to the table, or even giving your character any sort of buff.-Crew members were, when 1.0 came out, almost completely useless in a fight on account of them doing two damage. -They are still completely useless, it seems, unless you use mods.-You won't even get to use the pet system effectivly, until much later.-I probably should also mention the fact that several features they introduced, whether it was a year or two ago, were removed. As a result, they spent valuable time in early access and removed half the good crap that was actually in it. As a result, many older players aren't all that happy with some of the new features that kind of replaced the old. It sucked out some of the fun of the game.Basically, once you beat the endgame, there isn't much left to do, besides build. I still enjoy this game, however, due to the great hours of enjoyment it did give me. And, I would recommend it, as you will probably get your money's worth for around 150-300 hours of fun.			"

								The game is in late Alpha stages currently but it's already showing real potential.Some call it the spiritual Successor to the famed indy game ""Terraria"".Starbound has some good points, some bad, and most of the bad should be fixed over the next few months.Keep an eye on this one, it'll be worth it. ""when it's done"".I don't recommend playing it in the current state, as you'll ruin the game experience when the final version is released.For now, you'd have to deal with:- Currently gear scaling is awful - you can skip whole tiers, and each tier doubles your damage if not more.- Bosses can be boxed in and beaten with a pole or gun alone. They are stupid like a rock.- Some mobs are way too powerful- No save points except your ship.- Multiplayer on public servers is not recommended.- There are many mods that add features the game devs should have added to begin with.- Pixels are a horrible system - you need to farm kills to be able to craft anything useful. Not just metal/ore. Plus, when you die, you lose an X% of what you saved up. (quite unlike coins in terraria)- Guns are poorly available, and poorly available for crafting.- Gear progression is stale, just copies of the same thing with higher dps.- No point in making a permanent settlement anywhere, since your ship does everything and more. Except it lacks storage space.- Shields lack information / descriptions still. It's unclear whether one shield is an upgrade to the next one you may find.- Hunger is a kind of redundant system later on.- Healing yourself is slowwwww and frustrating. You can set up a tent and dig yourself in, but again slowww, bandages barely heal you at all, and farming plant parts gets frustrating due to lack of inventory space.Someone remind me to update this review later.

Early Access Review
								There is really no use in buying it in this state, or at all really. Dev's are utterly horrible people who cannot take criticism, even if it's logical. And I really wish I could get my money back but lucky for me they are money grubbing fiends as well. But on the bright sid- Who am I kidding there is no bright side. Them making promises they cannot fufill, the devs treating the people who gave them their hard earned money for a half ♥♥♥♥♥ game like trash, and A PENGUIN IN A SPACESHIP, WHO CLEARLY CANNOT PILOT IT WELL, GETTING STUCK IN EVERY CREVAS THERE IS, and many, MANY other technical issues. Actually who am I kidding I can still go on.-There is diversity in the LOOKS of the aliens you fight, but they all move and do the same things.-Many Items and little things that should lead to something, but don't-The story was written by a bunch of 7 year old children, they have all these races and nothing to show for it.-The dungeons and randomized areas are fairly worthless due to the fact that they have one useful thing that might not even be needed for the longest time. and nothing else. No mini bosses, not alot of diversity in the traps and the way they are used.-and as I stated before, NO UPDATES, only some stupid night builds that don't change very much.-And last but not least, They promised us the moon and back, and we should of got it considering it was in development in 2012, They had time, they had people. They just wanted to give us a horrible game for a price that is higher than actual good games. If you really want a good game go buy Binding of Isaac, or better yet wait for rebirth. Unlike this utter crap the devs care about the people and communicate properly with the people, and the updates actually matter.-The only real saving grace of this game is the modders who make it worth about 30 more minutes in the game.So all in all if you want to waste your money on a watered down, broken, horrible, repulsive, disgusting, you get my point, version of terraria. All the power to you. But it won't be my head if you read this and do it anyways.I rate this game a -10/10. They should be paying me to play this trash, and I hope enough people make a ruckus so we can get refunds.			"

Early Access Review
								I think the biggest issue with Starbound is the existence of Terraria. Starbound was Tiyuri's vision of ""what could have been"" with Terraria, but it wasn't necessarily ""what SHOULD have been"".It explores a lot of mechanics and ideas that Terraria doesn't, but almost every place where they overlap Terraria is the better game. The only things they both have that Starbound does better are building and character creation.If Terraria didn't exist and somehow Starbound did, it would actually stand on its own pretty solidly. At least in terms of exploration and building.  Even without Terraria to compare the combat and collecting aspects would still be hollow and boring.The game is certainly worth a try, especially with friends.  But if you've already played Terraria, it's hardly worth getting excited over.Overall, I'd say the game is maybe a 7/10.  Like I said, it stands on its own but Terraria just obliterates it in every department.Edit:  Yes, the game is early access.  However, early access doesn't excuse fundamental flaws in the gameplay.  If the developer cannot even get the basics correctly, then how can you expect the game to magically be better when it's ""completed""?Also before you criticize me before comparing this game to Terraria, please do some research.  Tiyuri--the lead developer of this game--played a significant role in the development of that game.  The two games are connected in more ways than just similar gameplay.			"

								Logistically, a lot of this game is like Terraria, in space. If you really liked Terraria, but found the biggest barriers to your enjoyment were limited build space, and not being a large green plant person. I've got the game for you. The building system was nicer, but the storage systems were unsightly. In our early games, we had an entire planet devoted to storing materials, and harvesting plants. I've had a lot of fun in this game, it's significantly better with a friend or two. At the point of writing this, I believe they're still in the early access, and making large balancing adjustments. I look forward to exploring it again, when it's fully finished- and seeing how drastically the gameplay has shifted. It was good back in the earliest builds, I imagine as time passes, it will only get better.			"

Early Access Review
								I pre-ordered this game (As in I did NOT buy it through steam, and long before it was early access).Coming from that position, it has been a big disappointment thus far. I bought a game that was slated to be finished in 2013 and remains in Alpha state to this day...No, it isn't a Beta yet, people who say otherwise seem to not care that words have meanings.Currently it's a buggy, broken, and thoroughly less fun Terraria which is still going through major game mechanics overhauls after 2+ years of development. If you love love loved Terraria you will probably like this...when it's finished...I hope.Personally I'm not going to touch it again until it comes out of EA, at which point I will update this review. The developer has a LOT to live up to with the next patch and I am not optimistic. It's a shame.Lesson learned kids, be careful what you pre-order 'cause it might suddenly end up in the depressing graveyard that (currently) is Steam EA. Fingers crossed that the Dev's most recent open (and ambiguous) letter about ""what makes a game a finished product"" doesn't speak to how feature-complete this will be as a full release. Really, it's not the money spent that is upsetting, it's the breach of trust and shoddy game that has got me down. I HOPE my intuition is wrong.Until then, buyer beware.			"

								I recommended this originally. I don't recommend it anymore.No visible updates. Updates are hidden behind a ""its crashing"" disclaimer in the beta section. A beta for a beta? Really? That is not Early Access. That is stupid. Space Engineers does weekly updates and every update is fixed immediately if there are any bigger bugs that prevent you from playing. That is Early Access done right.But this game does it wrong and I doubt it will get ever finished.			"

												October 13, 2016 - I prefer Terraria more than Starbound in almost every way at this point in time. The price for Starbound, 14.99 USD is probably the correct max price.As I understand it, the game has been available in early access since December 2013, and spent time being developed before that. It got a full release on July 22, 2016.I'm gonna explain what I liked about vanilla Terraria so I can compare that to Starbound.You started off in a procedurally generated world with basic tools, a weapon, and the Guide npc. You then explore, collect basic resources like wood and stone, and fend off various monsters at night. Eventually you'll end up fighting the first boss, the Eye of Cthulu. You'll start mining resources underground to further build infrastructure and to craft more weapons and items. You'll fight different bosses and various world events like falling meteorites will happen, offering rare and more useful materials.Eventually, you will be prepared to traverse the bottom on the world, the hell biome, in order to craft the (vanilla) end-game armor made from hellstone. Around that time, you could challenge the Skeletor boss by talking to the npc outside of the dungeon.This vanilla journey was fantastic to experience the first time. The game only became better each time the game got updated, adding tougher bosses, better weapons, combinable accessories, extra biomes (Hallowed, more content for the Corruption, the Crimson biome, etc.), more things to craft, fishing, the Pyramid, Alien Invasions, etc.Now, for vanilla Starbound. I have to say, I hate everything about the movement. Everything.- The movemnt is extremely floaty. It's impossible to calmy step down a 1x1 block incline. Jumping onto a 1x1 block is also far too difficult without double or triple jump.-It's not possible to chain movement abilities fluidly: I can't use the sprint tech and double jump. Using the dash removes the ability to jump for a moment. Air dash removes the ground dash. Blink dash cancels the charge of heavy 2 handed weapons.The Freedom of Movement mod on the steam workshop fixes and sidesteps some of the problems with ability movement, but the weird floatyness is still present.The combat and monster variety is awful.- What's the difference between one flying bird monster and another flying monster? There isn't. What's the difference between a plant monster and a murderous robot? There really isn't. Occasionally a monster is capable of a ranged attack and some of those ranged attackers move slowly. Unfortunately, most monsters sort of just aggro on to you and charge at you. Your options are to dodge, block, or attack it for every enemy.You might argue, ""Terraria was the same."" Not really. Flying eye monsters would sort of fly in an eliptical path to you. This meant you could save yourself effort by not changing what you're doing if they were not going to hit you on their immeadiate flight path. Corrupters would sort of position themselves in a set radius around you and spit projectiles that turn regular blocks into corrupted blocks, which if left unchecked could spread corruption much farther. Zombies would mindlessly aggro to you, but that makes sense for them. Imps in hell would teleport somewhere on your screen and attack you with a projectile that could travel throgh blocks, so you could dodge or destroy the projectile until you could kill them.The bosses in Starbound are boring, take too long to beat, and aren't fun to play against. If you think the bosses in general are acceptable or fun, I'm glad you enjoy this part of the game more than me.- Dreadwing shoots at you while it strafes left and right: You can dodge most of those shots by strafing in the same direction and you only need to react when it changes direction. Dreadwing smashes its body to ground when you're under it: Use a jump or sprint or dash before it gets to hit you.- The Erchius Horror boss requires that you hit four buttons that charge up a laser. You need use the laser three times. You avoid its own damaging laser beams by staying in safe zones by jumping on platforms, waiting for a safe chance to hit those buttons.- It's my opinion that the rest of the bosses aren't fun either.The weapons are mostly boring. Slightly more interesting weapons are usually inconvenient or bad.- Most random loot weapons are awful.- Most snipers don't have a real purpose since they don't typically one-shot enemies who will just start charging at you.- Most two handed weapons are worse in various ways than the Violium Broadsword which you make from a fully upgraded anvil.- The Magnet Orbs are interesting as you can shoot multiple projectiles and can be used as a shield, but does low damage on the harder planets.The npcs in Starbound are empty and without purpose for the most part.- Quest npcs give quests. What else? They give you more quests until they run out of quests. Do they have any meaningful dialogue if you interact with them outiside of quests? No, not really.- Most npc merchants sell bad random weapons and random pieces of armor sets.- The only villan npc you interact with has nothing interesting to say and adds nothing of interest. If you read the extra codex entries, you find some backstory which doesn't change how unneccesary her inclusion in the game is. A generic hooded cultist would have been more appropriate.- Colonists don't really matter outside of Steam achievements- Colonists give fetch quests which are go from point a to point b, do x, come back to a, do y, go to c, etc.The story might as well not exist.- The story is that you need to collect five macguffins which are guarded by boss fights in indestructable, predetermined areas which are only accessable after you look at alien furniture so that you can fight the hentai monster that was sealed away by the space god emperor who sacrificed himself for your sins. Jokes asides, that description is actually far too accurate.I remember seeing this game and thinking, ""I'll wait until it's out of early access, I've already wasted money on Planet Explorers when it went on sale, so I don't wanna make that mistake again."" Well, It's still a fun 2d sandbox game and I've put a lot of time into it but I can't recommend this game. It's not a good product when you consider that this was for sale almost 3 years ago.I'm gonna build some more buildings for fun and I like collectathons, but I'm probably gonna stop playing when I feel that the rng deems me unworthy of seeing the last bugs to catch and the last fossils to unearth.

								In the current state of this game I would have to say don't bother. Not every update they do wipes your characters clean, but the one right after that will. This game can be fun, but not ideal for LAN parties. Servers are almost always needed to keep everyone running smoothly and happily. If you put something on the planet it will disappear after the next update, same goes for your ship. Then at that point you might as well start a new character. The Community behind this game is vicious, but sometimes friendly. The mods for this game can be frustrating to install, but can be worth it for cosmetic looks, or even cheating to get the best items.			"

								A great example of why Early Access is a rabid cesspit of lies sold for money with no way of getting a refund when they don't deliver. Aparrently this game was 70% done in 2013. It's now 2016 and all they've really done in add random crap, such that it still looks about 70% done. They actually REMOVED the Roadmap from the website. Completely removed it. This game will trot allong in Early Access for another two or three years and then randomly ""release"" in an incomplete state when noone cares anymore, just like Starforge, because they know they can get away with it, because Steam refunds will have long since expired (Valve, ♥♥♥♥ your policies that are illegal in the EU)This coming from a guy with a Star Citizen avatar.

												This game... Oh boy. This game. It's a beautiful thing.You have the ability to do whatever you want in true sandbox style. Build your own colonies, go mining, explore, do missions, explore the virtually infinite universe and virtually anything else you could think of.Starbound has come a long long way since early access, and even from the last update. The jump to the full release is very significant. I still notice odd framerate drops and inconsistencies in performance though. I don't feel it makes the game unplayable, though I strongly urge the devs to work even more on that. ESPECIALLY on the server software. PLEASE. It's my major gripe with this game.Bottom line: The game is exactly what I wanted from the start: A sandbox in space with endless possibilities and some guidance in form of a main quest line to tie it together.  It's the most fun I've had since Terraria.It's been a rocky early access, but it's finally here. Definitely now one of my favourite games of all time. <3 ^_^			"

Early Access Review
								As an ‘early access game’ you might expect to be provided regular content updates and progress through milestones towards a future full game release. This is not the case; the developers’ website is full of deceit, falsified updates and broken promises of updates and ideas. You have been warned, this game is no longer in development - and don’t go believing the lies about unstable 'nightly' updates. This game has lost focus and the developer has moved on to their new Kick Starter campaigns and new game ideas. Putting all this aside, the game is average; it lacks much of the character and charm of Terraria - the game it attempts to copy. Rather than a focus on developing and exploring a random world, the game focuses on a repetitive grind consisting of warp to planet, see if anything good, warp to next planet, repeat. There is no sense of achievement, and the tirelessly repeated 'dungeons' can be overcome with simple block placements around enemies. There is no feeling of adventure and there is no reason to 'dig' deep into any planets, the easiest way to get rare ores is to just run over the surface and then move onto the next planet. If the developer actually puts some effort into this game they might be able to salvage it, but I implore you to take some time to look over the comments, reviews and forums; you'll notice that the developer has taken the money and run. Please don't support this money grabbing developer, wait for games to be fully developed before handing over your hard earned cash – no matter how small the amount - if the industry keeps going down this route it's going to be bad for all of us.

Early Access Review
								Starbound can be a very deceptive game.First of all, it looks great. The sprites are very detailed and their animations quite fluid. The environments are all unique and visually distinct from each other, the monsters all look different and weird (as far as I understand it, they're created by mixing various different sprites and messing with their colors, so you'll always find new weird creatures to kill) and you can build some really good looking structures because there are tons and tons of furniture that all look really good. The music is not bad either.But here's the thing: it all looks different, but it plays the same. You'll meet a thousand different looking monsters, but they don't change much. They can fly, walk, be passive, aggresive and that's it. The environments looks distinct, but apart from some instances where the game messes with the gravity or the temperature, they're all the same.My first hour playing Starbound and my fortieth were basically exactly the same. Starbound changes its visuals, but the mechanics never reflect that; you'll always be doing the same thing: mining, maybe chopping up trees, maybe building another house if you're bored. You'll be grinding (mining different minerals) so you can defeat the lackluster bosses so you can mine some more. The name of the minerals will change after that. It's not enough.It isn't that Starbound isn't worth your money, it just isn't worth your time. It's way too time consuming for the limited experience it offers.			"

												[Note: At the time of this writing, Starbound is at v1.0.]I have been told once or twice in my life not to let perfect be the enemy of good. If you allow yourself to get too bogged down with what could be better, you blind yourself to the things you should appreciate. With Starbound, Chucklefish have taken this a step further and not allowed good to be the enemy of passable.While managing to do competently everything a game in the sandbox builder genre needs to do, Starbound still lacks the organic progression from goal to goal that makes such a game stand out. The game does little to draw a player into the crafting system or compel exploration. There are plenty of hints of an entertaining fiction, though they are inconsistently delivered. Starbound frequently feels like a game where development of various aspects ceased when they reached a certain baseline of quality so as to avoid having any one thing stand out enough to contrast the weaker elements. The game has modding support through Steam Workshop, though at this point it would be pure speculation to say whether mods can complete the game experience.To their credit, Chucklefish walked back more than a few questionable design choices that were met with player antipathy, but at the end of the day the bottom line is that there is little to capture and engross an audience. If you are a fan of the genre and want to play a new game that does more of the same, Starbound is certainly that. If you are new to the genre and want to play the best it has to offer, other options exist, most notably Terraria.			"

With Starbound, Chucklefish have taken this a step further and not allowed good to be the enemy of passable.While managing to do competently everything a game in the sandbox builder genre needs to do, Starbound still lacks the organic progression from goal to goal that makes such a game stand out. The game does little to draw a player into the crafting system or compel exploration. There are plenty of hints of an entertaining fiction, though they are inconsistently delivered. Starbound frequently feels like a game where development of various aspects ceased when they reached a certain baseline of quality so as to avoid having any one thing stand out enough to contrast the weaker elements. The game has modding support through Steam Workshop, though at this point it would be pure speculation to say whether mods can complete the game experience.To their credit, Chucklefish walked back more than a few questionable design choices that were met with player antipathy, but at the end of the day the bottom line is that there is little to capture and engross an audience. If you are a fan of the genre and want to play a new game that does more of the same, Starbound is certainly that. If you are new to the genre and want to play the best it has to offer, other options exist, most notably Terraria.			"

												It literally felt like the ""story"" missions were put together in a single week if not a few days.Comes across as they ""finished"" and did their 1.0 so they wouldn't get harassed by their community anymore.5 years for 5 missions of ""scan this race's furniture"" ...extremely uninspired...other content is decent, weapons give you a nice mix of stuff to try out and upgrade, unfortunately later there isn't much use for them.Bosses are kind of fun when your fighting them, but they go quick and there isn't much to rave about until they add some more enemies.There is no point mining apparently, to get all my ores I just planet jumped a couple times each tier, in the cities you can loot every box and chest and get the ores from that, the people don't mind, only if you break their pots...? lolthe NPC cities make it a pointless risk to mine if you are playing the mode where you drop stuff on death.They should be less frequent in my opinion, and the world and digging should be more interesting somehow.The block set is very nice, there is many blocks, furniture, and colors to use if you treat it as a casual building game or are interested in it in that regard.Overall a decent builder, other aspect leave a bit to be desired. I can't help but be dissapointed since I've been waiting since the game was announced and wanted so much more from it. "

												I initially gave Starbound a positive review when it was first launched on early access almost three years ago. While it was a poorly optimized mess in some regards it offered a fun and atmospheric exploration survival with a space travel twist, a nice soundtrack and a nice amount of cool bosses.On launch it's just as poorly optimized, exploration has been shifted clearly out of focus and almost all the bosses have been axed. Starbound is a poster boy example of a cool premise for a game turning into something different and lesser over the course of development.			"

Early Access Review
								I've had never been a huge Minecraft fan and I've never played Terraria....like ever.  So I bought this game based entirely on the fact that, ""everyone else is doing it so it must be good.""  I know, dad always said just because everyone else is jumping off a cliff doesn't mean I have to do it too....... But sometimes it's fun to jump off the cliff with everyone else.  With that known, this review will be from a non-Minecraft/Terraria fan and what my impressions are.My first game play into Starbound was solo.  After all, I didn't want to look like a complete n00b when I start playing with friends.  I think I was expecting some sort of 2D Minecraft, to which I wasn't let down in that aspect.  There was mining, crafting, building your home/base all those things that make Minecraft interesting.  Then I see one of those cute little aliens and I'm like, ""oh cool, hopefully it won't attack me at a snail’s pace like the monsters in Minecraft.........ohh, oohh.. WTF it's spraying some sort of fire barf all over me and jumping at me.  Good gods get it off... I'm dead.""  It would take me another few fights similar to that to get the hang of the combat system which thankfully is much more active than Minecrafts.  Being one who likes challenging game play, (my favorite game series is Monster Hunter after all,) this was the first thing in Starbound that made me want to play more.  Hanging out more in the game, discovering that different mobs do have different attacks and there are boss monsters, I've not been let down in this area.  After reading a bit online about how to get a good start, (if you’re a game player that likes to be lead by the nose to everything you need to do in a game then you may not enjoy this game as much...) I felt I was ready for multi-player.  A friend of mine asked if I'd like to join him and off we went.  After playing a bit I've seen that multiplayer is certainly where it’s at in this game.  Don’t' get me wrong, solo was fun but there's just something about teaming up and traveling to other planets, building fancy bases, exploring random dungeons, it's all much more fun when you've got a friend to hang out with.  Throw in some Skype so you can hear each other panic as some monster from hell rips though your group and your set for some very fun times.Overall I enjoy the game a lot.  Even in early access there's a ton of content and things to do and well worth the money spent to buy it.  I eagerly look forward to what the future holds for this game.Pros:  Minecraft style gathering, building, and craftingHundreds of sandbox worlds in one gameChallenging monster and boss fightsTons of content in terms of places to explore, an entire universe full of planetsEach planet has a different feel to itSurvival feels like survival since you actually have to eat and watch that you don't get too coldMultiplayer is tons of funReplay value is super highGreat musicShould only get better with ageCons:Very little guidance.  You will need out of game resources to figure out the game entirelySome monster fights can feel repetitive as they have similar combat modesPlanets can start to feel similar in terms of graphicsDifferent races seem to be only cosmetically different at the moment2D pixel graphics may turn some offStill in beta/early access so there are some crashes, glitches (tee hee) and maximization things that happenPlease note that many of the cons are things that will/may go away or be changed as the game leaves beta and gets more fleshed out.  Overall though the game is already well worth the listed price of $14.99us and if it's a game style you think you'd enjoy it will be money well spent. "

								While the concepts and foundation are there, unfortunately the development team is not. Many promised features are either lacking or totally absent. I do not feel like the game is worth anything near it's current value, nor has increased towards it since I was first able to purchase it; regardless of people trying to use the ""Early Access"" and ""Beta"" excuses. The game's blog has continued trying to drum up support with new features and pictures, but a big release has yet to be seen. This game has almost exclusively turned me off Early Access purchases unless the current product is worth the price. This is not. This is also ignoring a lot of the drama due to the behavior of the development team and their attitude towards the community.Save your money until they actually own up to more promises.- August 5th, 2014			"

								Did you like Terraria? You might like this game too! I would hold off for now though, its got some content to keep you busy for a while but it seems like such a hollow experience because at the end of the day you havent made any actual progress in the game. Grind, beat the bosses, get the armor sets, then look at your screen because youve just seen the whole game.In most cases I'm the first person to defend developers who take their time and really perfect their game. CF has really dropped the ball on this one. They do release frequent unstable builds, nearly every few days, but in all honesty that feels cheesy. Havent seen a legitimate update for months. I follow their blog, its clear they arent abandoning the game, as so many trolls are so quick to say, but they certainly dont seem to be anywhere near being able to actually add any of this new content to the game in a stable way.Final verdict, pass on this game for now, check in every few months on their blog and see what theyve accomplished.

												I'll start off by saying that Starbound isn't a terrible game. It certainly has some positive qualities. It looks fairly nice; it's a very colorful game with some very well-designed sprites. The mechanics are pretty solid, it feels good to play the game for the most part. It also has the potential to provide hours upon hours of entertainment.But, despite some of these positive aspects to the game, there are huge problems with the game, and with the developer. I'll list some of these below.1. The first of these issues is that Starbound has been released as 1.0. This is a problem because Starbound is not a complete game, there are still changes to the game's features that the developers plan to make in the future, and in fact, some features have been removed from the game so that the 1.0 release wouldn't be delayed, with uncertain statements by the devs that they may consider re-adding them in the future, post-1.0.This is unacceptable in my opinion, because they're marketing this game as complete, and yet they may still end up making huge modifications that some players will be unhappy with, players who spent money on what they assumed was a final product.2. As I mentioned above, Chucklefish have removed content from their game, and this has happened on multiple occasions. I would not normally condemn a developer for something like this, but much of the stuff they've removed have been things they've shown off in multiple dev blogs, content they've spent many hours working on, content that had no realistic reason to be removed. Dozens of racial weapons, racial SAIL AI, local chat, a number of vanity item sets, and much more. No reason has been given for this removal of content, content that was interesting and, in many people's opinions, contributed to a game that was originally very complex in design.This further leads me to believe that this game is an unfinished product, and one that I fear may be subject to additional content removal in the future.3. The third issue I have with Starbound is not so much directed at the game as it is directed at the developers, but it's an issue that affects all consumers of their product; Chucklefish's unreliability. Throughout the development of Starbound, its five year development of which half was early access, Chucklefish have made promises that they've failed to deliver on and yet have made no attempts to apologize for or acknowledge. Several release dates have been given in the past over the course of these five years, and Chucklefish failed to meet all of them. On several occasions, Chucklefish promised there would be no more universe or player wipes, and yet time and time again they forcibly wiped universe and player files thanks to seemingly arbitrary changes to file structure which have never been explained.These would not be such concerning issues if Chucklefish had actually taken the time to explain to their players why these things were happening. Not once did we receive a blog post explaining why a release date had been missed, or why another universe/player wipe was forced.4. And then the storyline. Admittedly, this is more of a personal feeling of disappointment than a glaring, objective issue, but the storyline is so incredibly generic. It follows the most basic formula possible; I'll do my best not to spoil anything, but you, the main character and thus the center of the universe, are one of the few survivors of a catastophe. You escape on your own and have to find your way to the hub world, where you meet the plot device meant to drive the story further. You're buried in exposition and sent off on your quest to defeat the ultimate evil, which had been sealed away ages ago and is finally breaking free. Eventually you face off against it after working with a crew of unique individuals and destroy the evil once and for all.There was once a pretty interesting concept behind Starbound; you were a nobody trying to survive on your own after escaping certain doom, making do with what you could forage and build from the wild. They ended up trashing that idea and focusing time and effort on a boring story mission when their efforts should have been focused on the sandbox elements for their sandbox game.I could likely rant on about this, but I've rambled long enough. Starbound isn't a terrible game, but because of the issues it's had in development, I cannot in my right mind rate it positively. It wouldn't be fair to the people who are expecting to buy a complete title. As far as I'm concerned, until Chucklefish is satisfied with Starbound's features and has no intentions to change them further, it's still an early access game.TL;DR: Chucklefish spent five years on a game that they constantly removed assets from, dumbed down the story, broke promises for, and still can't decide whether their game should have new features added or not. Buyer beware, what you purchase now might very well be entirely different from what you own a year from now. "

Early Access Review
								I severely advise against buying this game. Don't be fooled by my listed hours of disinterestedly trying to get my money's worth, I regret the purchase still. Starbound is, by developer admission, molded in the likes of Minecraft and Terraria. However, Minecraft is all about the vast world where you can create whatever you want. Terraria more focuses on allowing the player to create a home worth defending and then sending challenging and enjoyable enemies after it to be fought with a smooth and complex combat system... Starbound seems to be about the developers showing off.Starbound promises so much and delivers so little. The enemies are supposed to be endlessly varied, but they're all mishmashes of a few parts with ridiculous colors and functionally identical programming. There are different races, each with their own background and collectible bonus text; but nothing can ever come from any of it, and the limits of what it means for you the player is the occasional bit of racism from NPCs. The supposed vast galaxy of more complexly generated planets feels very small nonetheless: every planet of the same biome is basically the same but with everything palette swapped. Planets have hidden sub biomes which are supposed to be treats to find, but you can't make anything useful from the supplies of just one and looking for more is incredibly tedious. There is a massive variety of items, but a sparse handful of purposes between them... and an absolutely HORRIBLE inventory system to manage them. NPCs have really nice villages and dungeons... TOO nice, it feels rather futile to try and build your own stuff when the NPCs are handed vast structures of perfectly coordinated furniture with 20 different kinds of blending blocks and a massive variety of decorations. There are powerful bosses and minibosses, but generally 'powerful' just means with all the stats jacked up rather than cleverness, since basically all of them can be foiled by making a tiny shelter of dirt blocks. There are vast dungeons to explore, but they seem to have an alarming tendency to contain absolutely nothing worthwhile. The game pretty much fails at EVERYTHING it does. Aside from merely not having actual content of merit, the engine where all the effort seems to have gone has problems too. The ability to explore different planets is mostly just a nuisance... since you HAVE to go to different planets and flying is slow and tedious. Gathering fuel is a pain and does very little to enrich the experience as well. Though able to run much more complex games well, I found there are severe lag issues as well. My absolute least favorite aspect of the experience is the fact that when trying to explore planets I repeatedly run into enormous squares of nothing that I have to wait several flow breaking seconds to see load. But more than anything I take issue with that idea of blurring the line between developer and player. Because you can't, for one very important reason. The developer is the one getting paid, and the player is the one who lost money. If Starbound was free, I'd be much kinder to it. It's bright and entrancing for the first few minutes, and there ARE some good mods. However, virtually nothing about this game is something I want to encourage or support. Were I to describe Starbound in one word, it would be this: Unfulfilling. It is a miserably unfulfilling, unimmersive mess of a game that feels like it does not need nor want players.			"

Not take away some of the other content, although maybe they kept some content in, but I just got so bored looking for villages to scan some items in that would lead to some sort of door key somehow. I haven't beaten it since.My point is, the game isn't the same as it once was, and I just haven't gotten used to it, and i don't think I will.Sorry Chucklefish, but you sort of dropped the ball just as you got it spinning of your finger.

												Ah, Starbound.I feel like a disappointed parent. A parent that's watched over a child (or maybe a niece or something) for a good few years, watching it grow, watching it learn - all for it to come crashing down in a car accident that paralyzes the kid for the rest of it's life.Okay, admittedly, that's a bit dark. Allow me to explain.I ♥♥♥♥ing loved Starbound. (Read: Loved. Past tense. Very important.) The wonder of exploring a beautifully created universe and finding out neat little snippets of lore from random books you find in kitchen cabinets and secret USCM bases sounded got me to fall in love. The pixel art’s utterly eye candy  (trust me, that’s not a good thing, I’ll get to that later) and the combat system was - read, /was/ - pretty fun. I had a few complaints with it (lack of content, difficulty comparing weapons, lack of content, occasional bugs, lack of content, lack of content--)For a while, I had a review up that essentially just said that the game wasn’t done, and thus I couldn’t judge it properly. Now, uh...To put it simply, the game still feels unfinished. You agonisingly slowly inch around the maybe 12 different planet types, praying to god it’s just a really long lag spike or something. Could just very well be my computer, but Starbound used to run perfectly fine, and now it’s like trying to race snails through honey. But I digress- that’s likely just personal nitpicking. However. The severe lack of content for what can be called a “finished” game really does genuinely bug me. There’s so many useless little trinkets and pieces of furniture, but at the same time, there’s so little to do- as many will tell you, the story feels like it was thrown together in a few weeks, or, hell, a few days. Some other points to note:-The game’s still uncomfortably buggy.So, there’s this thing where you use a teleporter on your ship to poof around everywhere. Alright, alright, nothing wrong with that- until your game nearly ♥♥♥♥ing crashes trying to process that you’re teleporting somewhere. What.There’s also a lot of grievance I have with the matter manipulator. It feels like I hope that the item I want to place gets placed most of the time, whiiich shouldn’t be happening.-The food system ‘revamp’ or whatever.Food now rots, Don’t Starve style, except it doesn’t fit the game at all and just causes an inconvenience. As far as I can tell, food doesn’t give any more bonuses like boosted speed (I could very well be wrong on this) and instead you’re given a system where all food counts as an individual entity and rots on it’s own. No stacking. This basically just renders food completely ♥♥♥♥ing pointless. For one, you can’t check how rotted something is - which is what Don’t Starve does, by giving it a little bar of rotted-ness. Instead, you just kind of have to hope that the vague ‘will stay fresh for a while’ description means /something/, rather than just a generic term slapped on to 70% of the food items in the game. For another: food does not stack. I’ve said this only a few sentences ago, but I don’t think I’ve stressed this enough. Because of how much random ♥♥♥♥ you’ll be carrying around, even having an entire grid of inventory slots for carrying food is not nearly enough.Speaking of the inventory:-It’s incredibly inconvenient.It expects you to carry around an even amount of every type of item (that being: generic things, blocks, furniture, and food). Except it doesn’t work. You can’t transfer one kind of item to another inventory tab, so you just have to suffer carrying 50 weapons even though your inventory is ¾ empty. -Lack of… things.For whatever reason, the item drop rate has decreased dramatically. Now, when you spend 20 minutes wrecking hell on a temple, you’re rewarded but nothing but a few hundred pixels. Which, also, for some reason, are now much more uncommon than before. Everything either drops pixels or some other thing very very very very /very/ rarely, and it’s frustrating. I remember, when I would leave an Avian temple, I’d have a dozen or so new weapons to toy around with. Now, I’m lucky to find a chest with a single tech card in it.As I’ve said before, there’s a ton of useless objects, but at the same time not nearly enough content to find. There’s about 30 different dungeon and village layouts at /best/, and though that may not sound too bad, you’ll get sick of it very, very, veeeeeeeeery quickly. Plus, there’s so little reward for exploring. Finding loot is incredibly difficult, rather than a satisfying, base game mechanic. Really, is it that hard to drop a few more chests here and there? Or maybe give boss monsters actual rare weapon drops rather than pointless achievements? Apparently.You want a good weapon? TOO BAD. Here, have 20 pixels. ♥♥♥♥ you. -The plot.Allow me to summarize:Earth gets rekt. ♥♥♥♥ around on a planet for a while. Find a gate. Walk through a building.Talk to old lady (WHO, by the way, has the most ♥♥♥♥ugly gremlin of a talksprite I’ve ever seen) that constantly bothers you over some non existent messaging system that’s never explained. Get a crappy unskippable exposition dumpabout some massive forces beating the ♥♥♥♥ out of eachother and a Cthulhu ripoff that apparently destroyed Earth. Go to some planet. Click on furniture. Listen to her vague generic comments. Walk for 5 minutes past a bunch of ruins, get ♥♥♥♥♥♥ reward bag. Sometimes do side quests or kill things or do disgustingly difficult boss battles with weapons that are way too weak for that point in the game. Repeat. Not fun.It used to be simple and easy to take in: you’re a fugitive of some kind. Your ship broke down. You’re orbiting an uninhabited planet. Good luck.There was a plot, but rather than dumping it on you with crappy exposition dumps, it was subtle. Instead of it being explicitly obvious what happened with Earth, all you know is that Earth was destroyed an undetermined amount of time ago. It feels like a far off, historical event that has little bearing on today. Instead of having to listen to some ugly sprite condescendingly teach you about some otherwordly ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. you read codexes to find out about the world and lore, or just talk to NPCs you find on your journey. Everything felt like it had more personality, but now it’s all soulless and empty and depressing like a suburban neighborhood.They ruined the wonder of exploring an unfamiliar universe. It felt enormous, fantastic, even.Now, you get to click on things.Gameplay!I have a good few other complaints, but most of them are nitpicks that don’t really matter all that much on their own. Combined, though, all these little things - for example, the removal of SAIL’s racial AIs - just add to make the game less than what it could’ve.Oh yeah. And they got rid of racial armor boosts. Fish people can no longer breathe underwater. Bird people can’t glide. And they cut a bunch of other perfectly good bits of content, like apple pie. Come on.That’s dumb.As a good friend of mine put it, it’s a game by pixel artists, not game designers. It’s boring, it’s dull, and most of all, /empty/. It looks pretty, but that's about it. There was potential, here, but they just threw it all out so people would quit whining about them taking a while to build a game.I wanted it to succeed.But now, all I can say is that it’s become a disappointment. I can’t expect there to be many more updates, now, since it’s “complete”, and it sort of feels like the game was shoved out the door so Chucklefish could say they finished a game.I’m genuinely kinda sad about this.

												I will preface this review by stating that I have played this game on and off for about three years now.I purchased the game December 2013, merely days after it was released in beta.I have experienced this game from its public infancy to its now-grown-adult life.Nutritionist Robert Atkins is quoted as having contributed to the popularization of the very well-known and very commonly applied quote ""don't fix what's not broken."" Atkins' quote can most undeniably be used to explain 'went wrong' in the developmental cycle of Starbound--that is, the rise and fall of an incredibly promising pixel-sidescroller-adventure-multiplayer-procedurally generated RPG that once held the hearts of thousands of dedicated and passionate tester-players and yet has at once severed from itself those elements which had made it so special in the first place.To not beat around the bush, the biggest problem with this game is that it turned from leaving the whole experience of the gameplay and setting up to the players' own interpretation to a game throughout which the player is handheld in a linear progression of gear and gameplay environments, following a story which is forced down the player's throat and so contextually inappropriate that it literally shows itself detrimental to the game. Indeed, I am asserting now that Starbound 1.0+ would actually be a better game if it didn't have a story. I hearken now back to the days following my purchase of Starbound--as I said, December, 2013: the earliest of the beta releases. The player was greeted with a small, minimalistic message making it known to said player that their home planet was destroyed and that they were now in their spaceship, looking for a new home (or something to that effect). This opening is quick, easy, and shoots the player straight into the 'actual game'--that is, based on a spaceship and beaming up and down from planets. The player is given the creative freedom to imagine exactly what might have happened to their home planet and why specifically they had a spaceship in the first place. Not to mention that there is no lengthy, limiting tutorial section. You are immediately granted the same basic freedom you will exercise throughout the game all from the first moment after you begin a new save. Oppositely, upon starting a game in Starbound 1.0+, the player is forced to play through a confining, linear tutorial level providing a backstory for the destruction of Earth which takes anywhere from ten to forty-five minutes depending on how thorough the given player is in their exploration of the environment. The real issue with the tutorial and game introduction is not at all in the quality per se of level, but rather the existence of a lengthy, linear, limiting tutorial level itself...one which paints a picture of who the player's character is instead of following in precedence of the greatest role-playing games of the past by handing the player the canvas and brush to choose who their character is themselves.In Fallout: New Vegas, the player is informed that their character is a courier whose delivery was violently intercepted and then is let to make whatever else they want of their character as they are nearly immediately let loose in the Mojave wasteland.In World of Warcraft, no matter what race or faction one chooses, the player is let known that their character is destined to be a participant in the worldwide struggle for power over the opposite faction and races and then is let to make whatever else they want of their character as they are immediately let loose in the wide world of Azeroth.In Dark Souls, the player discovers that their character is the chosen undead who is destined to discover the fate of the undead and rekindle the First Flame and is then let to make whatever else they want of their character as they are nearly immediately let loose in the kingdom of Lordran.In Starbound's early beta, the player was let known that their character is on the search for a new home and then was let to make whatever else they wanted to of their character as they were immediately let loose in the universe. However, the case with 1.0+ is that the character's past is very clearly defined within the tutorial. One is not playing a role one creates, but rather one that the developers have created for them. It may seem ridiculous that I have spent so much time criticizing the tutorial level, but the truth is that the problems in the tutorial which I have described are actually the same problems which plague the entire rest of the game.There was a time in Starbound's development during which the only objective of the player was truly to do what they want. Maybe there were incentives to upgrade one's gear and spaceship, but, at heart, the point of the game was to do what one pleases. It was driven by freedom. But with the faultily linear story now present in Starbound, a player is not let to develop their character and write their story as they please. Instead, they are made to follow the path as painted by the developers, only let to progress by undergoing the same line of quests for any character one ever makes. In any of the games I mentioned earlier, one can develop one's character and exercise one's freedom in any way one pleases. In Starbound 1.0+, if one wants to even leave the lowest-tier solar system in which they start upon making a new character, one must complete several quests, the final of which contains the game's first boss fight out of seven. Yes, to even start exploring space in this space-exploration adventure RPG, you have to progress through almost 15% of the main questline.The player is not encouraged to find their own way like they were in the hugely open-ended beta version, but to follow the path created for them.This circles back to my original point. Somehow, Chucklefish Studios, in attempting to move even farther forward with their already excellent prototype, ended up releasing a game that smothers the role-playing element of freedom that was once present in it. The game regressed from a sphere to a line; a role-playing universe sandbox to a series of quests.They really did, in Atkins' words, attempt to fix what was, indeed, not broken.I obviously have spent quite a bit of time playing this game--maybe not as much as some other more devoted gamers--but still a considerable amount of time. This is because, simply, I loved the beta release. I really was immersed in the universe Starbound procedurally generated. However, no matter how hard I tried--and I tried hard--I could not become immersed in this totally unprecedented story that had taken the place of the game I loved. It is not at all the game I spent hours upon hours enjoying years ago.Ultimately, this brings me to my most exigent point to make: I do not recommend this game at this time simply because I am not being allowed to play the Starbound I know and love. The incredible saving grace of Minecraft's controversial 1.0 release five years ago at the time of writing this was the version-selector feature that was eventually implemented, allowing a player to run any version of Minecraft they wanted from the latest version all the way back to the earliest alpha builds. With this in mind, it is also sensible that all the legacy builds of Starbound be made available by Chucklefish to people who have purchased Starbound, as they would only be providing the consumer with exactly what they wanted by doing so.At this point in time, my purchase of Starbound does not directly allow me to experience the promising game I once played and, as a result, I cannot recommend the purchase to anyone else. If legacy versions are ever made accessible by the launcher in the future, I will change this review, for it is only then that the purchase would actually be providing me with the game I was under the impression I paid for three years ago.

												I kinda get what people now mean with having nothing to do post game, I kinda wish there was no story to begin with since it kinda ruined the game for me I feel or forced the team to make certain deciscions so it would fit the story better.-Biggest issue is probably that only a certain kind of planet can appear at certain tiers which kills the ""forever exploring"" thing a lot. I don't really see everyone-Every dungeon feels the same since every dungeon has to include enough furniture for the main quest which also kills the exploring part or wanting to explore more.-Story seemed to have killed a lot of the lore it's all bundled in one galaxy federation thing.-And just a lot of features seem to have gotten removed and not sure why...I played some hours and technically got my money's worth (the many hourse I have are from beta which I enjoyed more than the 1.0 release, in the 1.0 release I spend 15-20 hours but I don't know I just expected more, it feels like they went around a lot in circles during development and couldn't decide on some aspects of the game. I don't know thats just me felt a bit stale in the end, is all.			"

								Honestly, I followed this game way befor the release actually happened. And it looked like everything I had ever wanted in a game. I got so caught up with they hype of the games pre-release, even pre-purchased a 4 pack day 1. Then the game came around and I was so dissapointed. Granted, the game is in alpha stage, but I have played many of other early order alpha games and have had much more enjoyable experiences. Now, as far as the game goes.The game starts out interesting, but gives no clear instructions. You have to find out how to progress using a wiki, friends, or a board, but lets face the fact, that spoils some of the game. All the terrains are interesting, but nothing really to unique. Just color pallete swaps of the same materials. The mobs are unique to a point, however they are rather repetetive in behaviors. I could go on but I dont want to bash this game figuring its still new.I hope to see better progress and updates in the future.			"

								One huge grind. Get tier armor, fight bland boss that can be exploited with ease, go to next teir planets, GET YOUR A-- KICKED, Finaly get ore from THE SURFACE, Fight another bland boss, rinse and repeat (Bosses end after teir 4). The only good weapons are the swords, which are all bland. The guns are useless. You cant prepare yourself for the next teir, because your armor becomes useless, and so do your weapons. The building sucks, not many blocks.  Their is no need to set a home base, just build everything on your ship. All planets just feel like reskins. Do not Buy! Wait untill its finished, which might be never seeing how many empty promises the Devs made. Just buy terraria. Terraria has replay value, unlike this game.			"

												Before I continue writing this review, I'm going to clarify something. I actually like Starbound. It's an interesting game and, despite what people may claim, it isn't just a Terraria clone. Similar, yes. Clone, far from it. To be honest, if someone's just looking to kill a bit of time, I WOULD recommend this game. However, in terms of a game you can really put hours into, I wouldn't, hence the 'no' recommendation. They really need to add an option for half-way, but that's going off topic.Starbound has, at it's core, a brilliant concept, and a lot of that concept shows itself in an impressive way. Terraria might be an amazing game - I've sunk over 300 hours into it - but the idea behind Starbound is, in my opinion, even better. When it comes to realising that concept, it's been done to an impressive standard. Being able to set up whole towns (not just a bundle of houses for a few specific NPCs), travelling to different worlds, an unusual mix of sci-fi and medieval content, various races to play, penguin engineers (okay, not a major point, but I just love how they look like the Prinnies from the Disgaea series :D) and more.The thing is, I don't feel - and this is just my opinion, clearly - that it feels... polished, for lack of a better word... enough to really rival Terraria in terms of a game you can truly sit and play, as opposed to playing now and again. I'm not saying that Terraria is any better than Starbound as a whole - just that it's a game you can get better absorbed in. And as a point before I go on, I'm not writing this review to compare Terraria and Starbound. But that being said, since Terraria is arguably one of the best of it's type, I will end up comparing them at times.It's hard to really define what it is that puts me off, but I'll give a few general ideas. Starting on the least important point - the graphics style. I'm not saying it's bad graphically, but it just doesn't appeal to me. It's too... rough, I suppose. I'd personally prefer a slightly simpler art style that's more refined. Personal taste though. *Shrugs* Think of it like carving a statue - I'd prefer one with less detail but smoother lines, than a detailed one that looks like someone's just gone nuts with a saw :)Secondly, the 'matter manipulator', the means for mining and the like. It's an interesting idea, but it's just awkward. You shoot it at an area of blocks, some of which take longer than others to mine, and sometimes targeting far more than you want to. Same with placing - you end up placing more than you intend to. It's a real pain in the backside. Though this can, thankfully, be changed through modding (there is a mod on workshop at the moment that lets you change the size of affected area. Bless the modder who did that) it really should be something the game itself allows.EDIT : Turns out there is a way, it just wasn't anywhere in tutorial either pre-patch or post-patch. Really should have been. Thanks to The Lost Sentinel for tip :) Still think matter manipulator is just awkward to use compared to the tools you find in Terraria though... Possibly the largest put-off for me, though, is the way in which the game runs. Okay, I'll admit, my laptop is fairly... rubbish, to put it mildly. But it doesn't have any problem running most games - ones with much higher processing requirements run fine. It isn't a hardware issue, in short. But it just feels more clunky than other games. For those of you who can make sense of what I'm about to say, it's like it's slower without actually being slower. Go figure.Staying on the topic of issues, but taking a slight detour, I first played Starbound a long whilst before it was 'released'. Probably a year or so ago. What I've mentioned so far were issues that bothered me even then. Since I last played though, the game's been through two patches : the combat update (I think it was called, but whatever) and the full release update. I'm not wholly sure which changes I'm about to mention come from which patch, but it doesn't really matter. For the purposes of this review, I'm just going to combine the changes and refer to them as the patch, singular. Less confusing that way :)So... for one thing, this new storyline. Under most circumstances, I believe games need a strong story to them to be really great. I'm a writer, so stories are important to me. This though... honestly, I think Starbound was better off without it. For one thing, it's the sort of game where you don't really want a story that much - you just want to play the game. Before the patch, yes, you had to advance a storyline to get certain things, but it wasn't half as strict as the new one. Your actions are very much forced now, as opposed to having a bit more freedom with the old one. Sandbox games really shouldn't be so restrictive. And as a slightly minor point, this new storyline is... I'd say bizarre, but that'd be stretching the truth. Let's just say I really, really don't like it. It offends my inner writer at how bad it is. The occasional humour (I will admit I like the slightly sarcastic and/or weird nature of SAILs new dialogue) doesn't make it up for me. At all.Second, the new system where you can equip an item in each hand (two-handed items notwithstanding). It's an interesting idea - but I don't feel it suits the genre at all. This isn't Skyrim. The old system where you had singular items was honestly much better in my opinion. I admit that the system has potential, but it doesn't seem to fit into the game too well. And I'll make the next point as a continuation of this one, since they mine similar territory - the ability to scroll through the quickbars with the mouse wheel. Helpful, of course - but they really shouldn't have included the matter manipulator as part of that bar. It kind of gets in the way, especially since it sits right in the middle of the two halves of the toolbar.My third point - and I'm going to make this the final point, because this review's long enough as it is - is somewhat more... unsure. It's possible I'm imagining it, but I swear there used to be more crafting options available (e.g. copper-based armour). I like the way the crafting menus are spread out now - less packed and headache-inducing - but there seems to have been a reduction in options. As I've said, I could be wrong. Been many months since I last played. But there just seems to be stuff missing.I could go on, but I won't. I think I've made my point, really. So I'll finish with a simply summary. Starbound has an absolutely huge amount of potential, far more than Terraria ever did. But there are too many things that just don't feel polished enough, or don't really seem to work with the game type. I don't deny that this game is fun, as game's go, and it's a definite recommendation for anyone looking for the occasional fun. But it's also not something I'd advise if you're looking for a game you can really sink your teeth in to.As a final point of clarification, this is just my opinion. I'm sure there are plenty of people who disagree with most, or all, of the above points. Since I wrote the review, this should be common sense to realise, but hey, who said the whole world had common sense?I'd hope no-one, or he'd need to spend time in an asylum for being hopelessly optimistic.

												I have about 48 hours into version 1.0 so far. I played the stable Beta before this for over 200 hours. I'm keeping my recommendation as ""no"" due to the VERY bad storyline mechanics and missing techs. tl;dr: Get this game if you want to play Terraria in space. Don't get this game if you want a storyline or hate fetch quests.Full Review:You get a space ship and fly around the universe exploring random planets, towns, and areas. Think Terraria in space but with infinite worlds. I spent a lot of my time building colonies with the insanely responsive and customizable building system. It blows Terraria and vanilla Minecraft out of the water with block customization and the smoothness of the building process.That said, it's not without A LOT of flaws. The thing that sticks out right away is the loss of over 20 unique ""techs"" that really gave this game immense flavour in the beta. Instead we're forced to use *yawn* basic techs that are the same vanilla flavour that all games of this type have. Seriously. There is 4 flavours of a morphball from Metroid. there is 4 favours of double jumping. There are 4 flavors of dash. All of the work exactly the same, but with a slight twist. Look up the ones that were lost on the wiki and see what you're missing. You'll cry: http://starbounder.org/TechWe also lost unique storytelling for the individual races during the translation from beta to release. You have races that WOULD NOT become a space cop for earth now suddenly space cops for earth. So say ""bye bye"" to any sort of fun background story you had in the beta.Finally, the main quest is just simply bad. Not redeemable bad. AVGN: ""What were they THINKING?"" bad.You need to get these dragonball like keys to defeat evil. How do you do it? You scan the furniture of the 5 different races then battle a boss. NO JOKE. You scan a race's FURNATURE in order to find keys to an ancient evil. WHAT. THE. HELL? ANY other trope-filled storyline would have been better. Mario Brothers 1 had a more interesting storyline. The Matrix 2 had a better storyline. X-Men 3 had a better storyline. This is an unforgivable fail on the part of Chucklefish.The kicker? The specific furniture pieces are randomly placed in a LARGE infinite universe and you're given VERY vague instructions on where to look. You could look at 30 LARGE planets and find maybe one chair out of 35+ items to scan. It took me 6 hours of boring searching per race. I hated myself for wasting that time. I could have been productive or learned a foreign language. Nope... gotta scan a candle holder on Jupiter.Pros: - Procedurally generated worlds makes exploration feel fresh.- The controls are spot on. All damage you receive is on you.- Building things is incredibly fun an easy.- Infinite worlds in infinite combinations- The weapons and guns are fun to discover and play withCons:- Storyline. Its mechanics is the worst I've EVER seen in a sandbox game.- Having to scan everything and then scan it again.- Reward bags do not scale with level so quest rewards rewards are just bad- Questing, in general, is unimaginative.- Flavourless ""special"" locomotion and move sets- The fans on reddit who think Chucklefish can do no wrong.Once again: Get this game if you want to play Terraria in space. Don't get this game if you want a storyline or hate fetch quests.Was this game worth the three year wait for it to get into a stable ""finished form?"" NO. Terraria made itself 10x more stable and more fun to play in 1/3 the time with less people.I'll NEVER buy another Chucklefish game while its in beta again because I don't hate myself.			"

								The last update to the stable game was released in APRIL (read the edit). This is really frustrating as new content is not being added to the main stable game that is already lacking a lot of content. For some reason Chuckle fish is unable to sit down and spend time to get an update for stable. Who knows how long things will go un-updated, but I do know that this game will not reach a level where it will be worth $15 for a long long time if things continue this way. EDIT: Finally an update and it only took 10 months for it to come out. My opinion still stands until they show that they can keep an acceptable update schedule, that does not leave massive amounts of time inbetween updates.			"

Early Access Review
								Preface:The more I think about this game, the more utterly angry I get. The developers of this game, Chucklefish, got 4 million dollars in half pre orders, half kickstarter PLUS an early access which did 1 million sales initially at $14.99 a pop and 3 years 5 months from start of development to now and this game is STILL in alpha. This is scandalous. This is litigious. Because they weren't short on time or money and let's face it, it's a ♥♥♥♥ing procedurally generated 2-D sidescroller. They haven't worked on anything but minor bug fixes and superfluous mechanics and artwork for a long, long time. The topping is this game is far from complete.This unfinished game which currently has incredibly dull gameplay, shows no sign of completion any time soon. And at the end of the day, even if it is finished it's probably going to feel as the game it is now. Dull, dry, monotonous. The height of tedium, from building to combat to mining to questing. Every facet of this game is incredibly droll and boring, and I will go into further detail in the actual review segment.Bottom line:$4,000,000 in pre orders. According to SteamSpy, there are roughly 1,891,483 owners of Starbound. Assuming Steam takes a 30% cut, then approximately $19,000,000 in profit.So in 3 years, 6 months and profits of 23 MILLION DOLLARS can not get this game complete.Houses in the Bahamas, off shore bank accounts. Which would be perfectly fine if the developers were competent game makers and made a polished, complete product in a reasonable timeframe. They are not and they did not.This company is either incompetent or conmen. I'd seriously advise against buying this product and view every game this company develops in the future with avid skeptism.Review:Starbound is an open ended galactic themed 2D sandbox game heavily based off the very successful Terraria. But this is also a sad tale of disappointment that profits off the good intentions of the consumer supporting the underdog indie developer.You start the game with a tool that allows you to mine at a very slow pace. This device can be upgraded, but only by use of rare loot based drops. And with each upgrade you need more of this rare item. The game excruciating hands out mining progression, which is a running theme.This is one of those games where building absolutely does not matter... That's it. Building any structures is pointless. I would argue this would be a game of creativity, but you have to unlock schematics in order to get access of cosmetic objects, and these are unlocked at an excruciatingly slow rate.The combat is dry. Quite simply because this is not a survival game. At a time you will have three mobs on the screen, half of which will not be hostile and winning is based more on the tier of your equipment than any meaningful combat decision making.Quest Progression In It's Entirety:Mine tier 1 ore -> Make tier 1 equipment -> Complete tier 1 quest -> Mine tier 2 ore -> Make tier 2 equipment -> Complete tier 2 quest -> Mine tier 3 ore -> Make tier 3 equipment -> Complete tier 3 quest -> Mine tier 4 ore -> Make tier 4 equipment -> Complete tier 4 quest -> Mine tier 5 ore -> Make tier 5 equipment -> Complete tier 5 quest....(This is literally what the quest system is. Developer has nothing but contempt for audience.)I can't wait for them to finish this game so I can ♥♥♥♥ing do the same ♥♥♥♥ing thing again and again and again with absolutely no excitement. Then I can just ♥♥♥♥ing kill myself.And what are the main quests? Mostly a dull gauntlet run to a boss which. Don't be fooled, that makes it sound better than it is. It's wandering through a multiple path procedurally generated environment filled with enemies which more often than not becomes a battle of attrition due to the fact you're just wandering the same rooms which no sense of direction coupled with how you start to inadvertently soak damage because of how dry and monotonous it is. To be fair, the bosses themselves can be moderately challenging as they have patterns that must be adapted to but they are still ♥♥♥♥ easy. If you die the first time you'll win the second.What about side missions? Someone needs a cake for no reason, your reward is a weapon that is worse than anything you can craft. Oh boy that was fun. One wanted me to give them a vanity item in exchange for another vanity item and that was my reward. Now this is the most glaring and obvious criticism most players bring up without actively targeting. The established universe is subject to development whims and not subject to any form of grounding, especially when this doesn't factor into any form of gameplay. This is a problem. Having a space terraria style sandbox, but still digging through the mud with a pickaxe and using rusty swords is the biggest bait and switch I've ever heard.Everything in the Starbound universe is a joke or reference or whacky in nature with absolutely no grounding, so you are incapable of being invested. Why should you care? The game doesn't. The races are a joke, settlements are a joke, quests are a joke. And they're all bad jokes in the Douglas Adams vein. The game goes to such length to show how it doesn't take itself seriously at all, but there is no payoff.This is the video game equivalent of someone handing you a bad finger painting and saying ""Here's my bad finger painting! Look at how bad it is!"" expecting you to laugh. How are we meant to respond? ""Hahahahahaha! You don't care at all and I paid you for this! I guess the jokes on me! Haha... ha... ha....""You can have a joke game but you need actual jokes. When Chucklefish's idea of a joke is making fun of their own flat universe... Jesus christ, really? Could you have more contempt for your audience and more self awareness?Long story short, it's Terraria but worse. Much worse. Technically it has more ""content"" but the whole game is dry and dull, dry and dull.Essentially a sprite artist from Re-Logic (creators of Terraria) remade a subpar, stagnating Terraria and made millions and consumers are torn between lynch mob and white knights.The only thing I can say to this games defence is it has a lot of pixel graphic assets (oh very taxing) and it's music is good.This company is fascinatingly cynical, because no aspect is fleshed out and it's not even a focus.""I'd really love to see some more games made on the Starbound engine, its so flexible and easy"" - Tiy Jun 27 - 2015Do you know what this says to me?""We ♥♥♥♥ed up. We don't know what we're doing. Someone please make a good game for us. All we can do is make innocuous content.""I resent this company, for being the most obviously cynical cash grab bare bones example of a game completely supported by hype, false promises and implications.We have enough problems with EA, Ubisoft, Warner Brothers without ambitious little ♥♥♥♥♥ doing it as well.PS. Hey Tiy, I don't think you were meant to use the millions of dollars you got to start a publishing business... Pretty sure it was to just make a game.Note: I edit this review frequently to better express my supreme disappointment of this title and to convey that Chucklefish are as trustworthy as EA.2013 Indie of the Year: You know how Starbound got this award? For just being a popular release to Early Access. It looks like Chucklefish isn't the only one without integrity. You'd think you'd have some ♥♥♥♥ing shame giving an award to a unstable, broken alpha game, www.indieDB.com.2013 PC Gamer Top 100 award: Came in at number 95. Apparently this is better than Monkey Island. Protip: It ♥♥♥♥ing isn't.			"

												For a long time, I've been one of the most vocal critics of both Starbound and ChuckleFish.  As it turned out, many of my speculations and predictions came to be true, of both, sadly.If you wish to learn of all the mishaps of the development, the forums of the group I am admin of, Dissinters Annonymous, hold a whole section devoted to archiving it all.  It tends to get handwoven anyway, so we'll focus on the game itself this time.  Furthermore, the game as of this writing, (Sep 16, 2016) and not any prior version.To put it bluntly, Starbound does not know what kind of game it wants to be, and does a terrible job at trying to be too many kinds of thing.  The controls are too loose and floaty to be a decent platformer, and the bad basic enemy AI really kill it being any kind of ""metroidvania"" experience.  The random generation just does not have enough actual variation to it, so all output gets very ""samey"" very quickly.  This applies to terrain, equipment, quests, and creatures.The building is fairly nice, that's one thing i can say about it.  But there's not much real purpose to it besides playing with virtual legos.  The storyline is bland, plodding, uninteresting, and utterly predictable.  The music is pretty nice.  Most things you can do in the game end up feeling very pointless.  Unless of course 2D legos is your thing.Preformance is atrocious.  There is a noted lack of options, especially of the video category.  It's a roll of the dice to get decent FPS, even with good hardware.Overall, starbound comes out as tepid, bland, and boring.  It's your $15, but there are games that do the same things better, and they are cheaper.			"

								I really did not enjoy this game. one of the reasons why is that the gameplay is too slow. I actually regret that I ever bought this trash. It just takes too long to progress. I already wasted about 3 hours of my life. Hours I can't get back. I would not recommend this game to anyone.Please for goodness sake don't buy this load of trash, it's just a waste of money.			"

												So, with the 1.0 patch released I finally decided to get back into the game and an hour in I'm already encountering issues.*Overlapping interface elements. ( http://prntscr.com/bw8p21 )*Interface doesn't fit on screen. ( http://imgur.com/a/oosXP )*Lag spikes despite barely anything happening on screen.*Enemies that can go into an immobile invulnerable state for a short while, but still do contact damage.*Clunky movement. Pits in particular are risky business, and I find myself walking straight off despite barely having tapped the movement key with a full tile between my character and the edge. My spawn point doesn't help. ( http://imgur.com/a/n4Znu )Considering how long this game has been in development, these issues make it impossible for me to recommend it. I'm aware that my 1024x768 screen resolution is on the tiny side these days, but the fullscreen resolution option ingame has it available so it should be fully supported.Similarly, while an Intel HD 4000 integrated graphics card can't be expected to run most modern games at 60 fps (or 20 for that matter), neither is that any excuse for a non-graphics intensive 2d game to lag. Terraria runs smoothly even with a lot of things happening on screen, and I expect the same from similar games.			"

Early Access Review
								I'm sorry this game, it's developers? They have problems. Look at this list here:http://pastebin.com/jAWKJnHyThe developers are unable to take any criticism and the fans of the game are rude and sadly hateful preventing any constructive feedback from getting to them. At this point I can only strongly urge people to stay away from this game as it has the potential to be another Towns. I maybe mistaken, it could in a few years turn out to be a great game. As is? Not worth your time or money, and that is the bottom line.As a note: It remains such a heavily played game on Steams watch list because the developers haven't fixed a ""bug"" where the launcher stays open or sometimes the exe even when you close the game. Shady when this has been reported to them numerous times since this alpha released in December.Edit: It has been a a bit now since I wrote this review and thought I might expand on it a little now that they have released a nightly build feel I should expand on the gameplay itself some. I didn't touch on it in my first part but focused on the larger problems, and plan to correct that now.At the core, the game itself is at present a stripped down Terraria. It may generate planets, but all these are is procedurally generated worlds just like Terraria. Only, rather then most of all biomes in one world they have maybe two biomes per world. Other then that worlds are bland and fairly uninteresting. There maybe generated villages but all these are good for is grabbing decorative items.Next on the list is combat. The combat is, even in the new nightly, clunky. A borrowed shield mechanic from Secrets of Grindia doesn't really help matters much. The monsters are all spazy with little variations despite the procedural generation nature of them. Also healing becomes an issue the higher in tier you go.Exploration, or.. why Terraria blows this out of the water. Every item in Terraria has a use that you find early on. Every biome has reasons to visit it. Every npc has a reason for being besides background fluff. The major difference between them is you feel rewarded for exploring in Terraria. Starbound throws out tons of things at you but none of it feels as exciting as when you get a hook item or magic mirror in Terraria, because these things have a use. They have meaning that makes exploration worthwhile.Now when it comes to fluff the game itself has some serious issues with bloat, lack of direction, and speed of development. The pokemon like mechanic is somewhat of an interesting idea but is half implemented and not done well. The expanding ships are not customizable, the various biomes are pallet swaps. The list goes on of fluff, while core things like selling items and various other necessary mechanics have at the time of this writing been left to gather dust. The whole ""story in a sandbox"" is a big selling point, and there is no story almost to be found!Given how slowly the team works as the game has not changed hardly at all in seven months.. we are left with many things unfinished while they work on silly side items rather then the main progression path.The game has spent three years now in development, and does not show it at all. It still remains not worth your 15. Also as of this spring chucklefish stopped allowing refunds, despite the assurance they always would. Further shady dealings with a team that has made millions and is hardly making any progress at all.Edit2: The 2014 very end of the year winter update of restriction.I'm only going to touch on this shortly for now. The developers have finally put in the framework for quests/missions. Ones however, that bring you out of the sandbox. Only as a way to restrict your progression for the most part as well. You are now metaphorically bound to a hubworld as they are along with most things of importance now set outside the sandbox, where you will find tech that allows you to explore planets after doing a bunch of run around more or less. Also they have removed several features such as temperature and hunger at the time of this writing. Main progression path still doesn't have as much done as should be after a years worth of effort without any sort of effective communication from them on steam.The game is becoming a non-sandbox restricted game with block building tacked on and features being moved to post release, later, or culled all together. I believe this will be my final update to the review until the full release. I still cannot in good faith recommend this game. Not because it is incomplete but how it is being handled and where it seems to be going along with the scant little still in it. The developers spent almost a year not listening to feedback while also not even managing to put in content that modders did in weeks after the beta dropped. The final result of it all is a less open exploration, chore to play ""game"", then what was there months ago.If this is the future of Starbound, it looks bleak.			"

								You can only play a game for so long before you've seen things twice. With Starbound I have most likely seen everything around 7 to 8 times as when a minor update came out, my character data would be wiped. Now although my character is no longer being wiped, there is nothing new being added to the game, which is honestly heart-breaking because the beta stage at first was fantastic. now... Not so much. I would also like to add that the screenshots above are LIES. I saw there first and was excited to build interesting looking builings with the blocks shown yet all I seemed to find were materials such a wood, stone, sand, mud and a different coloured sand. If you are going to show me what I can do, LET ME DO IT.			"

								Spore 2.0.The developers promised to make a Terraria with times and times more content, but as it is right now, it can't even reach what Terraria was on release date. The game has dozens of reskins for one thing, terrible combat mechanics, weapons that feel so bad that calling them peashooters would be a compliment, pokemon rejects for enemies with AI as bad as their designs. There is no fun in exploration after first 5 hours of gameplay, everything feels the same and lacks challenge.The game does have great visuals, exploration soundtrack and ambient sounds, creating a very cozy atmosphere on pretty much every planet you set your foot on, and building is much better than in Minecraft/Terraria, but it's not enough to keep you playing for long, even with friends.Keep in mind that updates pretty much stopped after the developers got on Steam, and one of them up and left without saying a word, while others keep crying on their twitters how no one likes the game they're making and how everyone with a little bit of critique is a jerk and troll. Don't repeat my mistake, DO NOT buy this steamy pile of broken promises. If you're interested in a game with same gameplay, get cheap Terraria with hundreds more of actual content in. It maybe not as pretty as Starbound, but it's a much better game.			"

								""Updates will come thick and fast, though, as we listen to your feedback, push fixes and add new content"", the game's developers claim in Starbound's Early Access blurb. Allow me to be blunt here - that's an utter, absolute lie.I'll elaborate. As an Early Access product, Starbound was released in a very basic, unfinished state and while that was to be expected, Chucklefish seemingly lost any and all motivation they had to actually work on this game as their first couple of paychecks came in. Thanks to a Kickstarter-esque early backing scheme plus getting their game on Steam, they made a very decent amount of money quite early on and then grew lazy on their laurels. Once they'd released a handful of post-launch hotfixes, Chucklefish redirected all their attention to idling about on their official forum, subreddit and Twitter accounts, to taking a long vacation and moving their office across the world and even getting a puppy for it so it doesn't look quite as empty, but the actual work they did on their game was lackluster in anything except for controversy. Updates never came thick and fast; they were largely cosmetic and took ages to be released. The last update was rolled out approximately three months ago and the Starbound team does a great job at consistently ignoring community feedback (unless passing off modders' content as their own counts).As far as I'm concerned, Starbound is a trainwreck of a game and Chucklefish is a bunch of borderline fraudulent people. Don't spend any money on this game until - if - they get their act straightened out and actually start doing their jobs instead of spending their money.Update: This image nicely displays how Starbound's ""development"" process has been coming along. Do note that while it has yet to be updated to reflect blog posts and what-not made during the months of July and August as of this review's update, there's been no game updates whatsoever in that period of time.http://img2.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20140704032751/nochuckles/images/1/15/Calendar.png "

								Starbound will never be finished.Chucklefish is the most disappointing game dev I've seen yet.Hopefully the problems that they have with Starbound never manifest in their other games, because despite how little faith I have in them, Stardew Valley and the pirate game do look interesting.But it's a pipe dream. Expect more endless alpha. Expect no leeway to critique the games without being hounded by fans desperate to suck off the devs or desperate to justify their purchases, or simply ♥♥♥♥♥♥, ♥♥♥♥♥♥ moderators permabanning you. (https://i.imgur.com/YY0UmkZ.png).I want to like the game. I really, really want to like the game. But this is probably one of the worst purchases I have ever made.e: jesus christthey're censoring their forums and everythingif you really, really want to buy this game I urge you to first look at some of the stuff out there about the censorship, the lawsuits being brought against them, etc.bottom line: don't buy starbound. don't buy starbound. the game isn't worth it, and neither are the devs. don't buy starbound.e: for over half a year now i've been emailing their support periodically trying to get a response. nothing. chucklefish and starbound are travesties; just bad mockeries of what devs and video games are expected to be.
