												Just beat the first playthrough, and I have to say this game was totally up to my expectations. -Combat was different and tactical, yet enjoyable-Art Style was beautiful, especially on the cut-scenes-Story kept me glued to the screen -I took about 6 hours going through the first playthrough, that is with some time spend on the challenges-Totally looking forward to the Recursive Mode 2nd playthough Update After Recursive mode playthrough and 100% Achievements-Combat still hasn't gotten old, I love how you can drastically change up how you play by just swaping some skills around-Art is still spot on-Enjoyed the story the second time even more, helped me notice little things I didn't pick up the first time-Limters were a cool concept-The later challenges were perfectly hard without being unfair-This game was totally worth $20-Definate buy if this game is on sale!!Couldn't have asked for more.I totally recommend Transistor!Thanks Supergiant for making a fantastic game.

												I'm older than the rest of you yahoos.  Real life gets ... real.  Games don't catch you like they did as a kid.  Other worries vie for control of your mind even as you try to get away from them;  after they're dealt with the mental fatigue often prevents you from getting immersed in a game (or anything) like you did in yesteryear.For a year or so I've been eye-ing Transistor, trying to discern its worth.  It looked so flashy and neat, but experience has taught me that most such games nowadays have invested far too much in glitz and not enough in depth.  They're shallow and vapid, something you regret wasting your time on after an hour.  False promises and empty husks.   A time waster at best.Transistor  cut through all the old-age baggage and cobwebs-- all the accumulated life-experience that a younger me would just call cynicism-- and hit me in my gut.  Maybe my heart.    It sucked me in, keeping me up until 3 AM on workdays.  There is genuine ART in this game.  I'm thoroughly impressed, and wish I had bought it before.  Thank you, Supergiant Games.			"

												I feel like I need to set the record straight on Transistor. The biggest complaint I've heard about it is that the story is inscrutable and there isn't much of it. First of all, that is not true, but more importantly it just doesn't matter. Transistor is a masterpiece because you don't have to be a detective to enjoy the game. It is, at its very root, a simple love story. If you can appreciate that much and enjoy the beautiful art and incredible music, than you have a game well worth buying.Beyond that there is the mystery of Cloudbank to uncover, and the many philosophical questions to answer. We are taught to value the voices of each person and try to create a consensus that serves to make everyone happy. Transistor toys with the idea of a ""vote"" vs. a ""choice."" Transistor is not preaching any answers, and that's why I think the narrative may come off as weak. We have villains who could be heroes and a main character who reasonably and selfishly just wants to pursue her own life without getting embroiled in any political machinations.This is a supremely beautiful work of art and in so many ways that I will easily recommend it to everyone. Explore the world of Cloudbank for awhile and decide how much you want to discover. I promise that even a short trip will be a memorable one.			"

												Transistor is the second game from Supergiant Games, the developers of the critically acclaimed Bastion. Those who have doubts about whether this game lives up to Bastion's expectation can be at ease: Transistor delivers and more.Story:You play as Red, a famous singer in the city of Cloudbank. One night after a performance, a group of people, the Camerata, attempted to kill Red with a strange, green sword, but she was saved by someone. Waking up, she found herself next to the corpse of a man, stabbed by that same sword: the Transistor. The sword starts speaking, and not only that, but seems to know her. Urging her to pull it out of the corpse, the two start tracking the Camerata down, seeking answers, while fighting what seems to be robotic creatures sent to hunt them down.But things may not be as they seem.The story of Transistor seem simple and straight-forward on the surface, but most of it isn't handed down to the player, instead inferred and concluded from various hints noticed in the environment, character interaction and character profiles. It encourages the player to seek answers along the main character, and leaves a lot up for interpretation. That's something I like in a game.One downside to the story however, is how short it is. It's far too short, the game is far too short. You'll be left wanting more, even with ""recursion"", playing a second play through with your stats intact.Gameplay:The gameplay is a mix of Action RPG and traditional turn-based RPG, using the Turn() system that I will touch upon soon. Red is able to equip up to 4 slots of ""Functions"", essentially abilities, upgrade those functions with up to two functions a slot, and assign functions as passive abilities, for up to 4 passives.In battle, Red wields the Transistor. In Diablo style, she can use the numbers 1, 2, 3 and 4 on the keyboard to select an ability, then the right-mouse button to use that ability. Abilities can be offensive, such as shooting a long-range beam or a destructive shockwave, or supportive, such as turning invisible for a period of time or turning enemies friendly. The Turn() system adds a new depth to the action RPG. It allows Red to stop time momentarily in order to plan and input a certain number of commands: attacking, setting up traps, maneuvering around the map to escape enemy clusters or get behind obstacles, you can do all that. But once all commands are preformed and the Turn() bar is depleted, Red is left (almost) unable to attack until it recharges again; use Turn() at your own discretion, balancing attack and defense.The game offers the choice of ""limiters"", handicaps that increase the difficulty of the game in return for better EXP awards. There are achievements you can only get by using limiters, the hardest achieved with all 10 limiters. In addition, there is a ""sandbox"" unlocked in-game that allows you to tackle specific-themed challenges, like a speed challenge, or a Turn-planning challenge.Graphics:Transistor uses an isometric point of view, being able to go in all 2D directions. The sprites are smooth and look good, but the highpoint of the graphics is the artwork. The character portraits, whether in-game or in profiles, are drawn beautifully. The artist, Jen Zee, did a brilliant, detailed job, and it shows even on the OST cover.Sound:Here is where Transistor really shines. The game's OST is amazing. From Ashley Lynn Barrett's beautiful voice in The Spine, In Circles, and other songs, to Darren Korb setting up poignant, melancholic instrumentals that fit the mood perfectly. Tracks play hand-in-hand with gameplay, showing up at specific times for maximum impact, further heightening the experience. I highly recommend getting the OST along with the game, if you can. Well worth the extra bucks.Summary:Transistor is a beautiful, enjoyable game. It has a bittersweet, albeit short, story that forces the player to think. Brilliant soundtrack, and beautiful artwork. The gameplay won't last you long, but there is decent replayability in it. Try picking it up immediately whenever it's on sale.			"

AT A GLANCE(Full review follows below)Game Name: Transistor Original Release: 2014 Genre Tags: RPG; Isometric; Atmospheric; Excellent Soundscape; Sci-Fi My Overall Grade: A Estimated Playtime (Campaign): 7-14 hours Multiplayer Aspect: None Recommended To: Established fans of the genre; Those intrigued by the genre; Aesthetes; Game atmosphere connoisseursREVIEWTransistor is a story-driven, linear experience that boasts a soulful blend of action-RPG and isometric hack-and-slash.  Beautiful graphics and the alluring, lullaby soundscape create a marvelously intriguing atmosphere that is sure to appeal to nearly any gamer.  The narrative is interesting, but doesn’t explain everything and leaves a lot of room for interpretation.  Together, these aspects create a very entertaining, albeit somewhat short, experience.Probably the first thing you will notice is how aesthetically pleasing this game is.  If you are someone who enjoys games with graphics that feel like interactive paintings, you will definitely enjoy the art-style in Transistor.  Complementing the beautiful art is the serenading, sing-song soundscape.  These elements are perfectly crafted and blended to create a truly inspired atmosphere.  The game drops you right into the thick of the narrative, and things are slowly explained as you progress through the story.  However, the explanations of things are far from “spoon-fed,” and much of the story is open to interpretation.  The tale unfolds during gameplay for the most part, so things stay lively rather than there being many plot-development inspired lulls in the action.  Be aware that because of this style of narrative gameplay, the game is very linear and it will continue to usher you from one spot to the next with little room for exploration.The combat and actual gameplay mechanics are an interesting blend of RPG elements, isometric hack-and-slash, and turn-based tactical planning.  You will gain experience as you play and can unlock new abilities which can then be combined in various ways to keep things fresh as you progress through the game.  A dynamic difficulty system, Limiters, is another appealing aspect of the game.  Using these, you can increase the difficulty of the game in various ways (more enemies, stronger enemies, less access to abilities, etc.) which allows you to customize the gameplay to your skill level.One downside is that the game is rather short.  However, you also can’t even unlock everything in a single playthrough no matter how thorough you are— so the game is clearly designed to be played through at least twice.  That said, I personally would have much preferred if the game was twice as long with the ability to unlock everything in one playthrough.In short, Transistor is a very well designed game that certainly has a very unique identity.  This underlying novelty combined with the charming atmosphere provides a truly enthralling gameplay experience.  I would say any all-around gamer will enjoy this game, and obviously fans of the genre(s) even more so.  Expect 8 to 15 hours depending on if you want to do everything and play through a second time.Follow my curation page to see more of my recommendations! "

												""Hey, Red... we're not gonna get away with this, are we?"" -Mr. Nobody[Spoiler Free]It's time I've finally reviewed Transistor, you know... the game with the talking sword and the mute lady? Yeah that one. Let's begin:Aesthetics: 10/10Well as you can CLEARLY see from the screenshots and the given link above, Transistor is absolutely breathtaking. The game takes the cake for visual and musical extravagance, as both mix so perfectly well with one another, that it become evidently difficult to express in objective terms the splendor that it creates in the brain, how so very atmospheric this game is, it's more of an emotional virtue than one being explainable through words alone. People have been coining the term 'art', which by no means is an understatement, the aesthetics of the game, voice acting (haha three actors, funny), music and graphics are as I rarely say, perfect.Story/Characters: 9.50/10Rarely does the medium of gaming (especially in this day & age) employ such precocious writing and superb storytelling, Transistor applies to this small margin of games. A game that truly respects the intellect and free thinking of it's players, requires an intelligent producer, no? Supergiant deserves an excellent applause for their creative usage of the mechanic of replayability. To truly cherise the game's universe, one must complete the game several times to unlock all of the information that is present. A truly cherishable quality Transistor has, is it's two characters which create a sense of dread and unknowingness with each other. Their relations throughout the game serve to state implicit subjectations on the world around them, Red through her interactions on the OVC and the Transistor's commentary. A huge contrast to each other which creates a sense of accepting lack, one without a body and one without a voice.Mechanics/Gameplay: 8.75/10As an RPG game, Transistor holds a creative candle in the rat saturated tunnel that is the RPG industry. Of recent years, the well known RPG's of it's time have begun to show how dated their mechanics hold up in our era (yes you, Final Fantasy). This is why the liberty to experiment and employ new ideas is so vital in our industry today. Transistor is unique in which that profiles become the tools of the trade. Transistor can be played as a turnbased game or as a free action one, which by the way, both work very well in concurse with another. You have 13 functions (abilities) to use in your kit, yeah I know that's a small amount, but guess what? for every function you have, you get the ability to fuse with another, and for every fusion you have with another function, you get to fuse with another! So this means there are roughly 22,283,705,698,113 combinations of Transistor functions. (Transistor Wiki, Cited) That's a lot of unique ways to fight your enemies. Final Verdict: 9.50/10It's hard to see why in this day and age producers don't want to experiment with their products given that the industry would absolutely kill for it, but then again, since when do producers even listen to the demands of the consumers? Transistor is a beacon of hope in the dark hallway that is the gaming industry, and hopefully you can agree with me, that this game is something special.			"

												(WARNING: LONG COMPREHENSIVE REVIEW, READ EDIT 4 FOR OVERALL SUMMARY)This game is created by the same makers as Bastion, which is one of my favorite games ever. Upon loading, Transistor is visually appealing, and Logan Cunningham (Rucks in Bastion) makes a reappearance which is exciting. Controls are fluid, music is amazing--I'm very excited to play through this game!EDIT 1: After playing for about an hour, I must say that I think all the expectations I have had for this game are met. Unlike Bastion, which was more of a go-get-em game, Transistor really makes you think and analyze your tactics in battle, especially with the new ""time stop"" system where you can plan out your actions (each move you make will cost part of your ""energy bar""). There are plentiful save points, and a nice level-up system to improve your skillset. The game is mysterious so far, and I think it really fits into the mood. However, some people might dislike how the story isn't really clear, and you're just following the path without much reason until (supposedly) later on in the game when things will be made more clear. My only qualms with the gameplay itself are the somewhat repetitive nature of the fights (although each fight calls for new tactics), and the somewhat tricky level-up system which seems a bit arbitrary. The upgrades arn't clearly defined as to what exactly they do. Overall, some parts of the game feel like I'm not sure what's going on or what I'm supposed to do to upgrade the Transistor with, but that just adds to the mysterious nature of the game at the beginning. EDIT 2: Having come across the first ""boss"" now, I really think that I can speak for all people when I say--wow. The way in which the ""characters"" speak is amazing. The fight had me on my toes, really making me consider the best way to defeat it without losing too much health. I was blown away at how the screen colors changed and blurred as I started to lose more and more health.  EDIT 3: After tinkering for a while at an Access Point (checkpoints basically), I think I figured out exactly how the upgrades work. The Transistor has four slots which hold a primary ability. Each primary ability has two secondary ""upgrade"" slots. In addition, you have four passive slots. You will collect ""cores"" which you can slot and re-slot at any Access point. For instance, I could socket Crash() into Ability 1, with Break() as its ""upgrade"" to have a medium-damaging medium-range attack that mini-stuns (opposed to the regular melee-ranged attack without the Break() upgrade). Or, (normally), you could leave Crash() as Primary Ability 1 (melee-range attack) and Break() as Primary Ability 2 (Long-Ranged attack). Or, you could put one into your passive once you get more cores. There are also ""Limiters"" which increase the power of the enemies you face (similar to Idols in Bastion), but reward you with more EXP. Indeed, the customization is insane in this game--I can foresee myself spending quite a bit of time customizing once I obtain more cores. Play how you want to play--fighter, stealth, assassin, long-range--just customize your cores to fit your playstyle! Extremely well done, albeit a little confusing at first to figure out the customizations. Only qualm might be (if any)...there are TOO MANY choices!EDIT 4: Finished the game, Steam says it took me ~5 hours overall, but this doesn't include the second playthrough (Recursion Mode) which I think I will be playing soon. Overall, I think this game is a worthy successor to Bastion. However, I still prefer Bastion. Why? Bastion was a bit more clear-cut and easier to process. The Calamity happened, fix it. In this game, it took until halfway through the game for me to actually realize most of the protagonist/antagonist/story arc. There were also quite a few ""did not expect that"" moments, which can be both seen as positive and negative overall. I personally was confused at the ending--in a way, for me, not much closure, but I accepted it. I could see it going over poorly with lots of people however. This game feels a lot darker than Bastion for sure, and I really thought that the narration in some parts was quite hefty and really tugged at my conscience. It definitely leaves you with a lot to think about and has more going on beneath the surface--you will want to play this game with a very open and sharp mind. Great to discuss as well. Also, remember to check out all the OVC Terminals--you definitely don't want to skip those as a fair portion of the story and development relies on you reading and filling in the blanks from the information given at them (Thanks to Dragonfire973 for reminding me!). Also, when you have time, make sure you socket all the functions into every slot (Primary/Secondary/Passive) and read up on all the information unlocked. Pros: Amazing Artwork, Beautiful Soundtrack, Superb Narration. I expected nothing less.Lots of customization for how you want to play the game. Story-arc similar to Bastion, so this story will feel somewhat similar.  Cons:Somewhat repetitive battles, but interesting nonetheless.Often confused as to what really was going on story-wise (not much explanation of what was going on), but this could be intended. Not much closure for the ending, but definitely lots to think about. Really made me think about the whole story after the credits had rolled. Score: 9/10A very nice game overall. The aesthetics of the game are unmatched. However, some people might feel like the game is a bit confusing to wrap your head around. I preferred Bastion's ending to Transistor's, because Bastion was more clear and provided some closure. Transistor left me wondering what really happened and left me with too many unanswered questions. However, it did leave me with a lot to think about, and I want to go through the game again to see if I pick up anything I missed the first time through. If you have any doubts on buying this game, your doubts should be dispelled--this game is worthy of your $20; a beautiful second game released by Supergiant Games.			"

												Transistor is a sci-fi themed RPG action game, developed and published by SuperGiant games (the same guys who brought us Bastion), releasing on PC in mid 2014, and then later in that year on PS4, and then got a further port to IOS in June of 2015. Game play in Transistor takes a lot of elements from Bastion. The camera angle is in an isometric point of view as you control the main character, Red. You traverse a series of locations fighting enemies, known as the ""Process"". A nice feature which has been added which is where Transistor differs from Bastion, is that you can either fight in real time, or in a planning phase. The real time plays very similar to how any isometric action game would play out, however the planning phase really adds an element of strategy to this title; you have a limited number of commands you can carry out before needing to recharge, these commands include moving around the scene and casting your various spells and abilities.As you progress through the story, you will come across other characters who have fallen victim to the Process, and you will take over their souls and learn new abilities and powers. You can either use these new abilities as straight up spells/attacks to use, or you can also enhance your current spells/attacks with the new abilities, granting unique effects, such as adding an area of effect technique on an ability. You can also have up to 2 of these abilities being used as a passive effect on Red, so are in effect all the time. Transistor is a stunningly gorgeous game. The art style on show here are some of the most perfect graphics I have seen. This game should be one of the front runners for people trying to get the media to understand that video games should be classed as a form of art. The story in this game almost had me tearing up at the end, it is one of the most heart wrenching endings to a game I have ever played. Along the way you come across a series of plot twists, and at one point you even think the  story is ending only for it to take a dramatic turn and continue. Words cannot fathom how gut wrenching I felt at the end, I encourage anyone who has already got Transistor, to play it and finish it just to experience the final scenes. Much like Bastion, the audio is one of, if not the best feature of this game. The narration whilst not as good as Bastion's (because that was pretty much perfect), it still sets the mood of the game, and carries the plot through to conclusion extremely well. There isn't much voice acting in the game, actually Red doesn't speak at all, until the end of the game. The sound track to Transistor has been released individually, has sold phenomenally well. Some of the songs actually remind me a lot of a sort of James Bond movie soundtrack. I have to admit, the lack of a tutorial in Transistor does knock it back a little bit, but once you actually are able to work out what all of the interface means, and how to properly carry out the fight scenes, the gameplay becomes second nature and you are able to blast through hoards of enemies without batting an eye lid. The end boss is something of a sufficient challenge as well, resulting in me having to replay it at least four times before I was able to succeed in beating it.  Another nice feature to be seen is, that you can actually implement your own difficulty barriers in game, such as allowing enemies to do more damage to you, BUT you get some sort of reward in return, such as more experience.  You are able to chop and change these ""barriers"" as and when you please in the same way you can with your spells abilities. Transistors levels are all extremely well fleshed out, allowing you every opportunity to venture off the main track and down alleyways and into buildings with no real specific plot line to it, letting you explore the gorgeous world this game is set in. You are also able to use terminal computers scattered around the world, allowing you to dig deeper into the lore, and some times interacting with them to complete surveys and sign petitions should you desire to. A full playthrough of Transistor will take you just under eight hours. This is one of the few games that I can say I have finished more than once, just because of how good it is. There isn't any side missions in the game, but they aren't needed, just because you will be so immersed in the main story that you wouldn't want to do them anyway. Even though the ending of the game is the same regardless of the route you take to get there, the gameplay is such a high quality, that the replay ability is still there, because you will just want to experience the sheer fun you have whilst playing. Sadly I did have a couple of issues getting Transistor to run properly; firstly the game does not support anything higher than 1080 resolutions, whilst this isn't a massive issue given that 1080 is still the standard, it would of still been nice to see it in there. Secondly, I had to delve into the registry of my PC to fix and issue with the game also not loading into full screen mode correctly - if you run into this issue, the fix can be found in this thread on the Steam forums. http://steamcommunity.com/app/237930/discussions/1/540743128801543513/Transistor is another absolutely stellar game by SuperGiant Games that everyone needs to play; some of the game's original ideas, the graphics and soundtrack are some of the best I have ever played in my fifteen years of gaming. Lord knows what else these guys have in the pipeline, it can only be amazing given their track record. For the low price of £14,99, you need to pick this game up. It has been known to go as low as £3 on Steam, which is I would almost class as day light robbery if you can get it for that price. Do not hesitate to pick this game up for the full price.

												First impression: fantastic sound and art direction, just as expected. Seriously, if you decide to buy this (and you probably should), make sure to crank up your volume, put on your best headset and maybe slap some glue on its speakers so you can never take 'em off again. Trust me, you're not gonna want to.So what do we have here? Let me just sum things up:- Logan Cunningham: check. The voice behind Rucks from Bastion is back, do I need to say more?- Story-telling through narration: check. This is done in almost the same manner as before, with one minor difference I won't mention for those who'd rather find out on their own.- Gorgeous, vibrant artwork by Jen Zee[jenzee.deviantart.com]: check, check and check. Jen is one of my favorite artists and she no doubt has outdone herself yet again.- Breathtaking musical score: no comment. If you're still not sold by words alone, check out the soundtrack on YouTube and draw your own conclusions.What's different from Bastion?- Combat mechanics: confusing at first as you'd probably be expecting action-packed hack n' slash, but in the end it boils down to being a curious hybrid of Frozen Synapse's tactical gameplay and some of Bastion's core mechanics, all mashed together into something I find difficult to describe. Personally, it also reminds me of The Bureau's ""Battle Focus"", just minus all the slo-mo. Powers and combos are there: as before in Bastion, you'll probably spend some time looking for a perfect skill combination to cater your own playstyle, which is a fun experience in its own right as there are quite a few options to pick from.-Game length: I finished it in under 7 hours with most of the challenges completed. While it IS a lot shorter than Bastion, you still get access to New Game+ upon completion so you can blast your way through it again. I still find game's length disappointing however, so if you're really concerned about that, I'd strongly advise you to wait for sale.In general, Transistor is still as charming, well-paced and beautiful as its predecessor: you can absolutely tell they're both cut from the same cloth. But, while Bastion was somewhat more experimental in terms of narration, Transistor takes a bold step forward and puts even more information at your disposal than before. Which is probably a good thing. That is, if you like reading. Well, you've come this far, so I'll just assume you do.Issues I ran into so far:- My only and the main gripe with this game: abnormal, seemingly random freezing. I'm not talking ""locking up at checkpoint saves"" kind of freezes, either. I had to ctrl+alt+del at least 6 times due to it completely freezing up on me, ""hl2.exe has stopped working""-style, with looping sound and everything. AFAIK this is a common problem at the moment of writing, so you've been warned.P.S. Hold TAB while you're in game. Don't ask, just do it. :)			"

												Transistor made me cry.Not okay.At all.The game may start slow, but as soon as you hit the first boss... boom- I couldn't stop. This game was so beautiful and entrancing that I played through twice, with 9 limiters my second run: it's the first steam game I've gotten every achievement for. The story is tragic and twists to dark areas I didn't know that the game could even consider twisting. The bosses are all interesting and fun to fight, though the first two become rather simple once you get their strategy down.Buy the game, play it, listen to the soundtrack, find all the news broadcast stations, and experience some major feels.9.5/10			"

												Played it. Cried. Played it again. Cried again. Story: You're Red, a woman who lost her voice. She gets a powerfull weapon after nearly being killed by it. You'll fight to found out who were these people trying to kill you and what this weapon is for. I'd like to tell more but I'm afraid to spoil so I won't :<Music: The ost is just beautiful. Like I can't even describe it. It adds so much..  to the game. There's about 4 songs with Red's voice and I literally love all of them. Graphics: You can judge them by the trailer I suppose, It's very colourful, detailled, pretty, awesome etc. Hnnnghhhhnnh.Gameplay: You basically enter a fight, have the time to think about what skills you're going to use and how, you need some strategy. You have 16 different skills, you can use them on an active/passive or upgrade slot  which means you can do a lot of fun and interesting combos, and have your own playstyle! Overall: I just got a crush on this game AND DAMN THAT END HOLY **** I really didn't expect it, so much feels fiuezgfugzfuiezuifgzugfzigfiz. Just. Play it. <3 "

												45 Minutes in, looks and feels like Bastion. Visuals are stunning, narration is one of a kind.  Great hack and slash, mouse controls are similar to Diablo 3, fighting style is like Fallout series, you can go Vats style or free hand it.  Game so far well worth the price.6 Hours in and it is beaten. All and all well worth the money. I did a full play through. As bastion there is a re play option at the end of the game were you can start over and keep your level and items etc.. I give it 7 / 10 i cant wait for DLC			"

												I am a huge fan of Supergiant Games' previous game, Bastion. Topping that game was a tall order, but I think they've managed to equal, if not better it, with Transistor... though I guess that depends on your personal tastes. First of all, if you have not yet played Bastion, I implore you to do so. If you have played it, and liked it, then I can definitely recommend checking out Transistor. Both games share some common fundamental elements: isometric action gameplay, a set of diverse weapons, amazing music and visuals, and stories moved forward by in-game voiceover. In the case of Bastion, the voiceover was provided by a narrator. In Transistor, the voice is that of the soul of a ""dead"" man within the main character's weapon (the Transistor). The other main difference is in the way combat is handled. While combat in Bastion plays out in real time, in Transistor you can pause the action at will (on a cooldown) and plan out a set of actions (or ""functions"" as they are called in game) that will play out in rapid sequence. So essentially, Transistor is more of a strategy game. The game takes place in a city called Cloudbank. You play as Red, a singer that's lost her voice after an attack by an organization called the Camerata. Red wields the Transistor, an object that can absorb the essence of people, who in turn, become ""functions"" that can be assigned to your combat loadout. The gameplay loop consists of clearing out groups of enemies, collecting new functions for the transistor, and then combining those functions in all sorts of different ways. There are 16 functions, each of which can be used in one of 3 ways: as a primary action, as an upgrade effect for a primary action, or as a passive effect for your overall loadout. With 4 passive slots, 4 action slots, and 8 upgrade slots available to assign your functions, you can imagine how many different possible combinations there are to experiment with. And man, is it ever fun. There's plenty of room for experimentation to find what works best for your play-style. It's a brilliant combat system. The only negative I would say about it is that it's a bit confusing to figure out at first, as the game offers little in the way of explanation. It doesn't take all that long to get your head wrapped around how things work, but the early going might be a bit confusing.Visually, the game is just absolutely stunning. The environments are so gorgeous that I would eat them up if I could. The story is somewhat inscrutable (which I've heard brought up by people as a negative on the game), but there is plenty of information available within the game to flesh things out if you put in the attention and effort required. But ultimately, I never felt any of that really mattered too much. At its heart, the main plot is simply a love story, and that's all that really matters in the end. The other highlight of the game for me was the music. As with Bastion, music has a huge impact on the game experience. The music is consistently outstanding throughout, perfectly setting the mood for each area you traverse. There are also a few vocal tracks spread throughout, which are particularly good, especially the ending song, which was the high point of the game for me. I guess my only disappointment with the game is that there just isn't more of it. The story can be completed in around 6-8 hours I would estimate. After that, the game allows you to ""recurse"" through the story again indefinitely, while keeping all of the upgrades you've acquired, and making the enemy encounters harder each time. This is nice, and worth playing through at least once, but really, there's only so much you can go through the same few areas and watch the same cutscenes, etc, no matter how much you enjoy the gameplay and visuals. But what is there is excellent and worth the asking price. So in summary, if you liked Bastion and the turn-planning combat of Transistor sounds interesting to you, definitely give this a look. Or just give it a look anyways. Games like this just don't come around every day, and need to be experienced. I can't wait to see what Supergiant does next...			"

												Uniting both action RPG mechanics and an engrossing world, Transistor isn’t just a spiritual successor to Bastion, it’s a full blown messianic triumph of beautiful art and sublime game design. Supergiant Games have exceeded their previous work with a game that marries fluent action RPG combat with sublime tactical planning & customisation. Yet that would be just half of Transistor's charm as the world, characters and narrative unfolds like an origami swan, leaving you to marvel at its gorgeous art design, intricate architecture and unique atmosphere.The story begins with you, Red, claiming the Transistor from the body of a dead man. From there you begin to uncover the city of Cloudbank, why everyone has gone and what The Process is - sentient machine aggressors within this fallen Rapture. That reference is deliberate as there’s a little touch of Bioshock within Transistor - a fallen city, the mystery of its unravelling and tragedy yours to discover if you’re willing to put in the work to unlock its true secrets. This is made all the more acute by how Transistor welcomes you into its world with no fanfare, no menu screen. Just a fade from black opening up on your journey with the Transistor, voiced by the rich tones of Logan Cunningham, against The Process and their mysterious overlords - The Camarata.To say any more would spoil the joy of discovering the details for yourself. Supergiant Games had deliberately kept details of Transistor to a minimum until release and it’s thanks to this blackout that’s made discovering the games systems, people and places a genuine joy.It’s difficult to review Transistor without referencing Supergiant Games previous work - Bastion. That’s because its influences are plain to see with the same isometric-style viewpoint, similar art-style and even the same narrator. While those similarities may appear as merely iterative steps on paper for Transistor, they are in practice the opposite. The art style has evolved to be not just gorgeous, moody and atmospheric, it now conveys the spirit of Cloudbank without ever explicitly showing it in such a way that you feel part of that city, not just an observer with a controller.Combat is real time action-RPG based with four main skills available at one time. You can freeze the action once your Turn() bar has filled at any time and then plan out your attacks methodically. Once done you can unfreeze the game and Red will perform her balletic combat attacks with the Transistor. This appears at first to just be a cool looking feature to break up combat scenarios but very soon it becomes essential to besting The Process.In this frozen state you can see the damage you are likely to cause, the effect different attacks can have in combination with each other and use it to quickly get behind enemies to deliver backstab moves. There’s nothing quite like positioning yourself correctly, freezing time and then delivering a quick series of moves to destroy everything. I’m not especially clever but by Jove, Transistor made me feel like a combat genius.As the story progresses you’ll acquire more skills and this is where the combat evolves from those mechanics set down originally by Bastion. Instead of just swapping out skills when you want a change, every skill can be slotted into a secondary or tertiary upgrade slot to augment an already installed ability.For instance, the basic attack move you start with is Crash(). You can then modify it with a skill like Bounce() which will chain attacks to multiple targets. Or with Cull() that sends enemies into the air. Or you could use either of those modifiers as one of the four main abilities. Cull(), a basic uppercut move and Bounce(), a skill that sends out pulses of energy.This enables you to define the combat system in any way you want it. Like aggressive frontal-assault tactics or stealthy concealment? Perhaps turning a few enemies on to your side floats your boat? Or maybe just a blend of different styles? Transistor allows you to do what you like with this combat system rather than force you down a particular road.The only restriction is if your health is reduced to zero in combat. Instead of death, one of your abilities is overloaded and will require at least two trips to an access point in order to recover. Then there are the Limiters - status effects that reduce your capability in combat but with the rewards of increased experience. As you can tell, what appears as a simple combat system in the beginning soon evolves into a complex and involving way to deal with The Process.The way that combat is combined with the narrative is just as intriguing. As you use these new abilities in different ways or combinations it unlocks more about the person you acquired them from in the first place. Slowly the pieces of this mysterious world start to come together as you become more adept at combat. It encourages creativity and a deeper understanding of the mechanics you're working with on order to unlock the secrets of Cloudbank. But It’s not all dark alleyways and moody lighting as you’ll have access to a ‘backdoor’ - a safe haven separated from the unrelenting assimilation of the Process. This serves as a menu to access the different challenge rooms Transistor offers. Here you can test and refine your combat skills and increase your level. Or you can just kick back and listen to the ridiculously awesome soundtrack while lounging in a hammock.This densely packed experience is made up of small touches like that. From the way Red drags around the weighty Transistor, to how she combs her hair with her fingertips when admiring a view, with the best of all being her ability, at the touch of a button, to hum along to the excellent soundtrack.Before playing I didn’t expect to be fully enraptured by Transistor, thinking the spectre of Bastion would haunt the experience too much. But neither did I expect Transistor to take that formula and evolve it into something so sublime and handcrafted that tears would roll down my cheek as the credits rolled. From its combat mechanics and customisation, to the narrative and the visually appealing art-style, this is an experience to be savoured, to lock yourself away in the confines of your gaming boudoir and revel in its luxurious design and perfection.A Must Play "

												I know, negative reviews on overwhelmingly recommended games won't win me any popularity points, but hear me out.It breaks my heart to not recommend this. I had really high hopes due to how amazing Bastion was, and I went into this knowing that it is nothing like Bastion, so my dissapointment doesn't stem from that. Let me start off by saying that the combat customization is pretty neat, the art is nice, and the music is really nice.- The story just isn't that good. Futuristic world is being destroyed by virus-type-invaders and your sword/companion is the key to beating it. The ending is very predictable and there isn't much character development at all. There is such little story that I can't even expand on that without spoilers because of how little story there actually is.- The atmosphere is pretty but has very little variation. I got really tired of seeing the same grey blocks over and over.- The enemies have very little variation. You have turrets that buff/heal, fast dogs, floating objects that shoot beams at you, a mortar, am aoe tank, and guys that spawn suicide bombers. Not much else, the listed enemies all look exactly the same throughout the game; the only difference being small buffs as you progress. There are three bosses, each more forgettable than the last.- The combat is very tedious, and because (as above mentioned) the enemies lack variation, every fight feels the same. There are some great ways to customize your skills and buffs, but everything just feels the same. Since your last shred of action bar can perform skills that would normally take a huge chunk of action bar, every turn you take is just skill stacking just the right way so you can get the big one in at the end for free. It just feels exploity. - The backdoor area (a special zone where you can access challenges): probably my least favorite thing about this game. The trials are all (save for one) time consuming, tedious and pretty pointless. I did all the trials with very little to show for it other than maybe a level and a half and music tracks unlocked, which as far as I can tell, can only be listened to in the backdoor area.. A place that quickly becomes chore zone. Every time I finished trials, I was more than ready to leave.- No replayability. There just isn't. Restarting with all your skills would be nice if the skills weren't so bland. It's just doing the exact same thing over and over again a second time.-The game is incredibly short. I have 7.7 hours logged and I even took my time. I explored thoroughly and didn't move between areas until I knew that I had explored the whole area. I read all the dialogue and accessed/read/listened to/replied to all the terminals and still only got 7.7 hours out of it with no interest in or reason to begin ng+.- One of the things that irritated me the most is this game has an amazing soundtrack.... but it is hardly utilized in the game. When your in combat, you spend most of your time in a pause-type attack planning phase.. during that phase, the music is replaced by the same humming.. so you spend a lot of time listening to that one track that is her humming the same tune over and over. When you're running around/exploring, the sword is talking the whole time (not a bad thing) and you cannot hear the music at all. The game was probably overhyped to me, which is probably why I feel as dissapointed as I do. If you love SuperGiant and love hearing Logan's voice (like me) I'd recommend getting it on sale. Otherwise, you might be dissapointed.			"

												[TL;DR at the bottom] The same quality shown in Bastion returned with an outstanding game called Transistor  Absolutely breathtaking artistry, soulful narration, phenomenal combat system, a brilliantly creative world and a unique story that unravels itself over time. - Just fantastic. And that's not even to mention the musical score that may be one of the best that's ever happened.You will be confused. You will be confused as to what's happening...where you are...who you are...what you are. You will be confused by the mechanics of the combat abilities, and as far as I'm concerned, that's perfect. The story and mechanics become more apparent as you play further into the game. Your understanding and revelation become an experience. Wanting to understand more drives you to keep the experience going.This game isn't just beautiful. It is curious...it inspires curiosity. Once you understand the weapons system it goes from confusing to interesting to absolutely brilliant.The only flaw in this game is that there isn't more of it.An absolutely tremendous accomplishment for a team of only 10 people. Simply wonderful. Graphics = 10/10Story = 8/10Characters = 10/10Game play = 10/10 loads of different style of playMusic = 10/10 Best Soundtrack ever in any game			"

												There is a legitimate argument to be made that Transistor is too short for its price.  I beat it in about 11 hours, although I'm only about halfway through with Achieves.  I think this is a bit of a silly metric, though.  The more key question to me is ""was it a good experience?""  I would say ""absolutely"".Transistor is a deeply beautiful and atmospheric game, with a bittersweet story told through powerful narration and themes.  It also effectively uses game mechanics to pull you 'into' the story and world.  It has a 'hum' button.  There are several scenes where the controls and gameplay shift to make the player 'feel' the scenes.  It is one of the best examples I've played of a game avoiding ludnarrative dissonance and in fact using gameplay as a narrative aid.Transistor left me with that same feeling of satisfaction I get after finishing a good book.  I like that feeling.  I liked Transistor.  Definitely recommended.			"

												Transistor is a brilliant 2D sci-fi action-indie RPG, brought to us by Supergiant games – as most of us know, are the creators of Bastion. While Transistor doesn’t exactly play like Bastion, I’ve still enjoyed my time with it. The hand-drawn visuals are fantastic and oozes style. Darren Korb composed the soundtrack and it's a delightful treat for the ears. The gameplay is fun & unique. The player takes control of Red (the main female protagonist), who has the ability to freeze time and plan out attacks – which is called a ""Turn()"". A well-played ""Turn()"" can be rewarding and its especially satisfying watching your attacks play out In motion.I know we’re all going to make this comparison, but Transistor plays more like an RPG than Bastion. You level up, gain new skills and can customize them to your liking. Fans of Bastion and newcomers who are unfamiliar with Supergiant games will without a doubt have a blast playing Transistor. I highly recommend this game!			"

												For all their hundred-million dollar budgets and hundreds strong development teams, it feels as if indie games have all but entirely eclipsed those of AAA developers. Transistor stands at the precipice of this phenomenon, an unprecedented achievement in artistic vision and game design that I hesitate to review for fear of not doing it justice. Supergiant Games, creators of the outstanding Bastion, have not been resting on their laurels, returning after three years with an experience that has completely toppled any expectations I previously had for it, leaving me stunned and in awe at the scope of their vision and the skill in which they execute it. Transistor is, simply put, a masterpiece.Transistor isn’t the story of a falling city; of the rebel group, Camerata, letting loose a viscous process to annihilate the city of Cloudbank to be rebuilt to their designs. It’s not the story of the many characters filling its voluminous backstory, fleshing out a fascinating futuristic dreamscape that is so similar yet different to our own world. No, it is the story of two people, or more accurately the relationship between a girl and her sword. The dynamic between Red, a singer who has had her voice stolen, and the Transistor, a talking sword now housing the soul of a deadman, is what drives the narrative. Despite Red’s inability to talk, the Transistor’s dialog creates a tangible connection between the two; an emotional tie that makes the continued suffering of Red, and the guilt expressed by the Transistor (who somehow feels responsible for what happened to Red), incredibly real and heartbreaking.It would be too easy to write Transistor off as using its many narrative tricks to hide the fact that its plot is fairly straightforward, because it’s not about what happens throughout the story, but the relationship between its two leads that makes it so compelling. All too often games will try to force characters to depend on each other, whether through arbitrary mechanics or cliched victim roles, but Transistor sidesteps this issue by having the two characters literally rely on each other to survive. They need each other, and its for this that the narrative manages to create such an effective emotional connection with these characters; similarly causing you to despise those that have put them through so much distress. As simple as it may sound, the nuance of every line and its delivery is no small feat, and a true testament to the writers and voice actors behind them.I could go on at end for how emotionally invested I became in the characters of Transistor, but it’s the finesse of its gameplay that truly astounded me. Aside from some mild exploration, the experience is entirely focused around its incredibly deep and rewarding combat system, which seems outwardly inaccessible but is shockingly intuitive once you get your hands on it.Combat can be broken down most easily into two phases: real time and the planning stage. During the former, you can use any of your abilities at will, but enemies in turn can also move and attack, which becomes an issue with the long build up required for most attacks. This is when you transition to the second phase, which then turns the game into a sort of strategy RPG, freezing time and allowing you to plan out your moves (which will then be executed near instantly when you leave the phase) with the only restraint being the action bar which is used up with each move you make. It's not an entirely unique formula, but Supergiant Games has carved out an incredibly fine tuned and complex niche for itself, with the sheer number of different ways you can approach an encounter.Every action you make is the result of a function you have slotted in, which in turn can then have additional functions slotted on top of themselves, as well as passive functions which give you boosts outside of individual moves. However, none of these are separated into classes or otherwise excluded from being assigned a specific role with the rest of your abilities. This creates an incredible amount of options for you to experiment with, with each function you unlock having three unique abilities onto itself (if not more when combined with other functions), and new functions being added regularly as you progress and level up. Supergiant has also found a brilliant incentive to getting players to try out new combinations they might otherwise never use, by tying every bit of backstory to a specific function, which then needs to be used in all three slots (technique, enhancement, and passive) in order to unlock all of a character's biography. It’s a fantastic way to almost entirely fix a common problem of getting stuck in a routine of the using the same abilities the entire game, and had me constantly swapping different functions in which kept the combat fresh the entire game (even after having beaten it I haven’t used every combination there is, creating a ton of replay value on top of the already included new game plus mode).Bastion was an undeniable artistic treat, but in comparison to Transistor it might as well be a rough prototype of a game. The art design of every single frame is unbelievably gorgeous, from amazing architecture and environmental designs, to characters and even the subtle yet beautiful sparks that spring forth from Red dragging the Transistor around. The dark color palette matches the somber mood of the narrative, but it does so without bringing you down with it, leaving enough brightness and pure beauty despite the events happening around you to make you feel like you’re on a vacation to a fantastical city in the sky. Darren Korb once again returns to deliver a soundtrack that surpasses what I even thought he was capable, with a layered and elaborate score that still feels as raw and personal as he's known for.Transistor left me floored. What Supergiant Games has accomplished is hard to properly put into words, as even with all I’ve said I can’t help but think I’ve barely scratched the surface of the praise I wish to heap upon the game. It’s vision is remarkable, stunningly consistent and inspired in every aspect, achieving a level of excellence that exceeded my already high expectations. It’s undoubtedly one of the best games I’ve played this, or possibly any year, and is an experience that cannot be overstated or should in any way be passed up. Brilliant; utterly and unbelievably brilliant!You can read more of my writing on Kritiqal[kritiqal.com]. "

												Transistor is one of those rare, beautiful indie gem of an ARPG that every gamer should have played, even at least once. The game is developed by the people behind Bastion, but the 2 games have very few similarities, it's hard to compare them. Every aspect of Transistor is flawless, for now, no cons come to my mind. But I will try to review what I can.Pros: Stunning sci-fi cyberpunk art style and setting Amazing voice acting Wonderful, atmospheric soundtrack, one of the best I've heard in an indie game (purchasing the OST is very much worth it) Interesting and creative character designs (I can't go into detail here, might spoil it) All the things I have mentioned above go together so well to create the rich, detailed world of Cloudbank Innovative combat: you can switch from hack-n'-slash mode to a strategic, turn-based one, and you should still plan your moves very well Game has a way of letting you figure out the story and lore on your own: if you skip any OVCs, you'll barely have an idea of what's going on, and you'll lessen the great experience (Trying to avoid spoilers as much as I can here) The story is memorable, and leaves you at some moments in suspense, and other moments just thinking about what just happened - it is unique and far from those 'good vs evil' cliché RPG plots Lots of ways to customize your character build as well: you can combine up to 3 moves or 'Functions' and test how they work, you can add 'Limiters' that increase the challenge lvl but yield more rewards, etc Game is also strategic in a way that you should plan your battles wellCons: Game is linear and does not have too much room for exploration The story can be too short, and even vague for some peopleOverall Rating:9/10 - Transistor is more of an experience to me, than a game.

 Tron meets Kill Bill What do I have to say about  Transistor?  First of all,  wow.  I wasn't sure it was possible for Supergiant to top  Bastion,  but as it turns out, they could. What does Transistor actully have to offer? First of all, one of the most unique and challenging gaming experiences I have ever had. The combat system revolves around what the game calls a Turn() sequence--and yes, the partentheses are part of the word. Turn() allows you to freeze time and plan out your every move, but your enemies, a horde of machine-like entities known collectively as the Process, have ways of confounding you. A great deal of critical thinking goes into making your Turn() as effective as possible, especially considering that you get a fixed number of moves depending on the Functions (think spells, but with a cyberpunk twist) you employ.Next are the sensory experiences. Darren, Ashley, and Logan outdid themselves yet again.  Transistor  has a larger--and just as well-performed--voice cast than  Bastion,  the sound design is flawless, and if you loved the  Bastion  OST, you'll love the music in  Transistor  as well. The voice actors especially have my approval, particularly Logan Cunningham, the voice of the Transistor, who you may or may not know as Rucks (Bastion), Horatio Nullbuilt (Primordia) and the Archjustice (Pyre, the next Supergiant game). What about visuals? I've heard of eye candy, but  Transistor  is eye  crack.  Supergiant continues to appeal to my surreal sensibilities. Every environment is unique and beautiful, make sure to have a look around before moving on from each area.Finally, there is the story. Don't go in expecting a repeat of  Bastion.  Where  Bastion  was about repentance, redemption, and rebuilding,  Transistor  is more about loss, futility, and good intentions gone wrong. You play as Red, a former singer, who loses her voice as well as her lover after an attempt made on her life by the shadowy Camerata society. Lucky for Red, her unnamed lover sacrifced himself to save her life, but as a result his consciousness gets uploaded and trapped inside the Transistor. Wielding her sentient cybernetic greatsword, she sets out to track down the people who tried to kill her, and while she does that, she must find a way to stop the now-mindless Process from reducing the city of Cloudbank to its basest, most desolate form.I really enjoyed playing  Transistor.  While at times it made me exceptionally frustrated  heads up, you can lose your Functions if you run out of health, and the bosses and Process get steadily more difficult ,  the story, visuals, and sheer challenge it offered kept me hooked for hours at a time. I look forward to the many times I will play back through it. Worth every penny I payed for it.The only turn-off I see is that the story is very vague and complicated, even more so than  Bastion . You may have to watch a couple of videos or read a guide before you get it. As soon as you do, though, I believe you will better appreciate it within the context of your knowledge. Personally, I love when a story (be it game, book, or movie) doesn't explain everything to you. When you think about it more, you get drawn into the world, and your intimacy with the story grows.Like my review? Check out my  Curator  page!			"

												First of all: thank you SuperGiant Games, the game is another masterpiece.You play as Red, a popular singer in the Couldbank city, but for some reason one group called Camerata are hunting some influential people, and they try to get you. After that, it is up to you to find out what is going on and why they are doing it.The gameplay is great and it has a interesting and innovator turn-based combat system. In the combat you can try combine different weapons to test the best combination that works for you, but the game has a nice way to present some new combinations and help you to test every weapon available.The art, game design and the music is awesome. It will mesmerize you in every single moment of the game. I don't have word to describe, it is just beautiful.I'm in love with this game and I truly recommend it: great story, beautiful art design, incredible music and nice combat system.			"

Graphics: 9/10 Colors are very important, warm, cold... each level makes you feel. Game: Very cool, once you adapt to it and you can play of very different ways.Recommended? No doubt.----------------Bueno, es imposible decir nada negativo de este juego.

												Transistor is a sci-fi action rpg from Indie studio Supergiant Games (The makers of Bastion).You play as Red, a famous singer from the city of Cloudbank. An incident occurs that leads you down a path of no return. In the process, you receive the mysterious weapon known as the Transistor and the powers that come along with it.Gameplay consists of real time combat mixed with an optional turn-based system. At anytime during normal combat, you can pause the game to plan and queue up attacks. This proves immensely helpful when you face large numbers of enemies at once.As you progress through the game, the Transistor gains new powers. These can be used in either active (attack), support (supplement attack), or passive modes. The level to which you can customise powers to complement your playstyle is one of the highlights of the game.The visuals of the game are another strong point. The artstyle is stunning. Great use of colours and imaginative design bring out the vibrancy and beauty of Cloudbank. This is a city you'd want to save.Voice acting and music is stellar. The soundtrack is atmospheric and easy on the ears, while the voice acting is filled with character.The plot can be ambiguous but if you pay attention it makes sense by the end of the game.The only downside is that a single playthrough lasts 6 hours or so. Some may find the $20 sgd pricepoint too high for that length, although there is a new game plus option that provides some replayability.tldr: A polished, unique Indie action rpg albeit a little short. Highly Recommended			"

												Like its predecessor Bastion, Transistor is a truly marvelous and outstanding title that everyone must play to completion. Transistor boasts a lively, beautiful, hand-painted world filled to the brim with thick atmosphere that harmonizes perfectly with Darren Korb's spectacular soundtrack and Logan Cunningham's once again superb voice acting. All this combines with a deep, sweet, and brilliant story, unique and entertaining gameplay, and overall excellence, rendering Supergiant's newest title a true masterpiece. 10/10			"

												So you've read the reviews praising Transistor for its amazing scenery, the detailed hand-drawn sprites, the phenomenal soundtrack and maybe even read a thing or two about the gameplay which included words such as ""time stop turn-based abilities"" or ""active and passive weapon functions"" and you're left wondering... Is it accessible? Beauty being in the eye of the beholder and all, can the layperson appreciate the final product?Answer: maybe not, but don't let that stop you from trying. New experiences build character and ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ is Transistor a new experience. It's just that Transistor is a game where the protagonist gains experience faster than the player behind the screen. Consider the following: you earn ""functions"" which can be used either in your weapon slot or as a passive buff to a function already in use, adding its properties to the active weapon. That's the active and the passive system! THAT'S HUGE! Do you realize how with four weapon slots (your four face buttons) and five functions, you already have twenty different configurations? Well hold on to your hats because there's a whole lot more than just five functions to play with. Try sixteen. Add to this secondary passive slots for player buffs, extra upgrade slots for weapons and a memory cost per function to manage and that's a lot to take in!There's more. The whole time-skip ability pauses the game and allows you to plan out multiple actions in advance, at the cost of a cooloff period wherein no function can be activated. It's something that can certainly bite you in the ♥♥♥ if abused, so you want to hold on to it like a panic button. Or spam it constantly what with the correct build and enemies. Really, you don't know and the game doesn't provide you with much opportunities for experimentation. Enemy encounters are fixed and unique in nature; and although the game provides you with a Practice Mode, it's more target practice than battle practice.Transistor's greatest flaw resides in its extraordinarily linear story mode. There are no collectables or side quests, so if the story mode has a reputation for being short, that's only because there aren't any branching paths anywhere. There's nothing to look out for, all unlockables are gained by leveling up and earning XP is done exclusively by defeating enemies. Whom do not respawn and appear at fixed intervals. So your whole adventure feels like riding a conveyor belt: move to enemy encounter, defeat enemies, save at conveniently nearby terminal, repeat with the occasional story break.Although we commonly hate repetition, human beings learn by doing the same thing over and over again. Adding THE OPTION to redo a segment would be welcome and giving players a minor incentive to do so would go a long way in getting them acclimated to the active/passive system. There's no lack of technical info as the configuration screen offers you all of the hard numbers for your functions, but you want practice in addition to theory. Bastion provided ""dreams"" which were just waves after waves of monsters to defeat for extra shards. Practice Mode offers no such incentives and the targets don't fight back. For all of their efforts at writing a story, it seems as if the developers have forgotten to build a playground.Thus I'll make my final verdict as simple as possible: buy Bastion first. That's a good game regardless of your sense of aesthetics (review available here). If you've enjoyed Bastion's stylistic direction, consider Transistor. Despite the change in setting, you'll recognize much of the artistic sensitivities that are the hallmark of Supergiant Games. Otherwise, you probably won't have the patience to appreciate Transistor. Regardless, you have to recognize the ambitiousness of what's ultimately a very simple concept at heart: make every weapon also act as a power-up. You can't fault that, and you want other game developers to crib the idea. So buy the game and encourage simple ideas that are complex in execution. We'll get more practice out from the other games.			"

												To describe Transistor in just a few words simply doesn't do it justice.When I first received Transistor as a gift, I was extremely picky with games. At the time, I thought I could never be immersed in a world that was isometric, and I'd never enjoy combat that was turned-based. I could never have been more wrong.The first thing you'll notice is how gorgeous the visuals are and how immersive the voiceover is. Not long after, you should also be able to hear the magnificent soundtrack which blends beautifully into the game. The controls are very easy to learn and the combat system is wonderfully executed. The combat system is very tactical while still managing to be very action-based so you're not left feeling bored. I also find it hard to become bored with the combat system because of how many Function combinations there are and with all the Limiters available. You'll find yourself pensive as you begin to uncover Transistor's memorable story, although it might leave you wanting to know more about the characters and their Functions, more specifically Breach() a.k.a. Subject Not Found.Overall, Transistor is a game I will always remember and cherish as I've found few other games to be comparable. I genuinely recommend this game to anyone looking for a bittersweet masterpiece. Thank you Supergiant Games, and I can't wait to try your next project, Pyre.Pyre @ PAX East 2016 Recap[www.supergiantgames.com]Pyre - Reveal Trailer "

 Short version: I had a lot of fun playing Transistor. It's one of those few games that manages to be respectable from both a technical and artistic perspective. While the presentation is stunning, one of Transistor's greatest gameplay strengths is that it greatly encourages taking your time and setting up fights. Customization of, and interaction between, abilities and attacks is a key feature here. The variety of ways to start and end an encounter is pretty amazing and there's always a new method to try. While not particularly new to the genre on their own, a lot of obvious features combine to make Transistor feel like a unique experince. My only real complaint is a few jarring difficulty spikes and drops.Overall, a great game that I loved start to finish. Not without a couple flaws of course, but I would say it accomplishes everything it sets out to do and sets a very strong example for the genre of strategy ARPGs. Less-short version: Transistor is a story-driven isometric ARPG from the makers of Bastion, which it has a fair share in common with. In my opinion, It's definetly a solid title. First of all, It throws you right into the action when you start it up. There's no real opening cutscene or exposition to speak of, which I loved. Instead, you learn about the weird, artsy world of Transistor as you play. An important thing to note is that this game requires the player's attention to be really good. Everything in Transistor wants you to think. If you try to blow through it or brush it off, you probably won't end up enjoying it.The combat system is the real selling point to me. It's fun and rewarding to fight, which is what an ARPG should be all about. It achieves this by including a freeze-time, turn based mechanic where you can take a breath and queue up attacks in the middle of a fight. Between that and the sheer variety of different moves, there's a lot of creative ways to kill something. The catch is that you can only equip four different functions (combat/movement abilities) at a time outside of a couple passive slots unlocked later. Because 'dying' disables one of the functions equiped, you have to prioritize certain functions over others. On top of all that, functions can be apllied to other functions to alter the way the original attack works. Add a dash move to your projectile to make it pierce enemies, add an explosive to your melee to make it AOE, etc. This rather complex system is not only great fun to mess around with, but works wonderfully in practice and makes Transistor a seemless ARPG/strategy game hybrid.To underline the functions and insentivise you to use them more, much of the game's lore is only acessible by completing levels with certain attacks or passives. You need to use every function in every slot to reveal the full story. This idea didn't always work for me. More often than not, the little flavor text given isn't worth scrambling your carefully crafted setup. Still, it was a nice break from the ""read a couple pages from a computer entry"" style of storytelling that most games use. Transistor doesn't have much voice acting, but what's there is certainly passable, if a little bit annoying toward the end of the game. The big problem I had with Transistor was the difficulty. While most of the levels were challenging but fair, the bosses were all over the place. Some were a cake walk; others were too frustrating. One in particular actually had me checking the Steam guides for optimal loadouts and stats. The out of place spikes in difficulty were jarring and removed me from the experience at some points. With all that said, I still give this issue a pass simply because I may have just not experimented enough or was using bad loadouts.One thing I really loved were the challenges/minigames you can play in the hub...beach? They're all fun and engaging. Sometimes I felt like I played them more than the main game! Although that wouldn't really suprise me, considering Transistor is unfortunately on the short side. The length isn't too bad, but definetly dissapointing. Another thing I didn't like was one of the plot twists near the end of the second act of the story. I won't spoil it, but it was kind of a let down for me. You'll know it when you see it. The ending itself was fine, though just a little cliche.The story may a bit hard to follow, and the difficulty might be a little wonky, but you can't review Transistor without mentioning the art and music. This game is nothing short of gorgeous. So much effort was put into making everything, from the backgrounds to the enemies and even the UI, look good. The music is my favorite part though. Once again, you can feel how much heart and soul was put into the music. Ashley Barrett nailed the atmosphere with her occasional vocals. If you want to see for yourself, the soundtrack is on Spotify. I highly reccomend giving it a listen if you're looking for something good.All in all, I would recommend the game to anyone interested.			"

												A heart-wrenching tragedy wrought with loss and sorrow, a bittersweet love story the likes of which are never seen in video games, an unbelievable experience that's as breathtaking as it is unforgettable——these are just a few of the things that Transistor has been for me. And don't think that I lavish the game with verbose and flattering descriptions idly either, this game swept me from my feet the moment I loaded it up and delved into the imaginative world it offered. Rarely have I been so immersed in a game and never before, not even in Supergiant Games' previous game Bastion, have I felt so emotionally involved in a game's story——it was refreshing to experience a game where I felt a surge of raw emotions... from frustration, to despair, to grief. And to add icing to the cake, this game's audio and visual presentation blows every other indie game out of the water... each time I step away from the game and come back to it, I'm still shocked to realize just how beautiful a game it truly is.Red, the character whose role you assume, finds herself in a strange and unsettling predicament after being attacked by a mysterious organization known as the Camerata. With the help of her companion, the Transistor (a.k.a. Breach()), she must seek answers from this mysterious group and fight the newly arrived threat of the Process. The Process comes in many forms, and Red with the Transistor in hand, must face off against them. The combat in this game is a hybrid between fast paced action and tactics. Red can be equipped with up to four active Functions and four passive Functions (essentially abilities). Each Function can also act as an upgrade for Function already equipped as an active ability. This allows for quite a lot of customization. Furthermore, there are Limiters, which act as a way of increasing the challenge within the game. Enable a handful of limiters and you'll easily find yourself tuning and customizing your Functions to overcome some of the harder encounters and challenges. There is definitely challenge to be had in this game if you seek it, and exploring all the customization options is one of the highlights of the game's combat system——some of the Function combos are ingenious and finding such a badass combo is always a joy.And while the game's combat system is superb, I'd probably rate it as the weakest feature simply because every other aspect of the game is so near perfection. The audio and visuals of the game are no exception. Anyone who has played Bastion should know from experience alone to expect something amazing when it comes to how a Supergiant Games' game should look and sound, and despite such high expectations they wouldn't be disappointed with Transistor. The game is just mesmerizingly stunning, to the point that it's hard to describe in words just how remarkable it is. It has to be played to be appreciated at the level it deserves. From gorgeous hand drawn scenery, to the hauntingly beautiful lighting, to art filled cutscenes... this game is beautiful. Audio is no exception either with solid voice acting (the voice of Rucks from Bastion voices the Transistor), perhaps the best original soundtrack in the entire industry which I could write an entire second review on alone, and don't forget Red's incredible humming prowess.Although the game presents perhaps the most extraordinary sensory experience in the indie scene, to me the true selling point of this game is the story and the way it is presented. There is a lot going on in this game and it's worth getting involved in. Read what's happening at the terminals, read the bios, listen to the audio logs——it pays off. But most importantly, listen to what Transistor says. Stop and listen. Pay attention. And when Red responds to Transistor via typing, just don't quickly read what she says but feel what she says. Following the connection between the two is what sucked me into the story and got me involved with it in a much more personal way. There is a lot of character depth for both Red and Transistor, and an equal depth in regards to the relationship between the two. Putting myself in the shoes (or heels, I suppose) of Red was a surreal experience, and feeling the pain, frustration, longing, and love through her perspective is what made this game something special.The developers put love and care into making this game. The story is strong, no doubt. But I think what makes it stand out is that the developers built this game bottoms up starting with the story. Scene by scene crafting the perfect medium to tell this story, at every point making critical decisions about what music to be playing, what visuals to show, what Transistor's monologue should be; at every cutscene and at every interlude, deciding how best to portray the story through artwork and song. And by my reckoning it worked, they took a story and found the best way——the perfect medium——to tell it, and the product is Transistor. I've seen people refer to video games as a form of art before, but Transistor joins a miniscule list of games that I have played and feel as if I can share such a sentiment having played it.			"

												One more nice game and story from Bastion creators. It provides you a dynamic gameplay, lovely music and a spellbinding plot. The only issue I found is replayability - after all I don't feel like pass it again. The game is short, it took 10 hours only to get the end, but, imho, it's better to play a good short game then a bad long one =) I can clearly recommend it to grab on sale and enjoy!			"

												Another banger by Supergiant Games. Let me start by saying that Transistor's music is absoultely fantastic. It's composed by Darren Korb (also did the soundtrack for Bastion) it has a futuristic feel to it with a little bit of Noir in there. It's also neatly integrated into the game and its story. The protagonist is a singer for crying out loud. Her name's Red, she's a singer, and her friend is now a talking sword. That's all you get at the begining of the game. Transistor's story is open ended, surprisingly heartfelt and imaginative. There are no clear-cut solutions or ideologies, the characters have their (sometimes questionable) motives, and it's hard to say what's what at times. The game is also very subtle about its themes. Very much like Bastion, you can speculate and fill in the gaps with your friends. Fun stuff. Much like the story, the gameplay is brilliantly crafted and also very much open ended. Every bit of it is customisable, and the game makes you feel like you're in control of its systems. To simplify it- it's a real time action RPG. By pressing the right trigger you change it to a turn based structure, but it's more of a special power. The ""turn"" lasts only a short while but you can trample over the enemies without consequences as they are frozen in time, and you have a bunch of tools that can do the trampling. Red has a large selection of abilities to chose from, each ability has three functions- active, powerup and passive. You can attach unused abilities as powerups for the ones that are active, or you can use them as passive powerups for your statistics. Some abilities deal damage, some persuade, some create distance between you and the enemy, which you will need, as the enemies are tricky to handle (when they're not frozen in time that is). You will have to mix and match, see what works best, and then change it again. The game encourages experimentation- change your character's presets as many times as you want, it's easy and free of charge. The game's too forgiving? Obliterating enemies left and right? You can make the enemies harder and gain more experience. It's all customisable. Supergiant Games definitely built upon the already well made systems seen in Bastion and greatly improved them.Heck, the whole thing's really well made. And, well, gosh darnit. Ain't this the prettiest darn game I have ever laid my blue eyes upon. This game's graphics are something special, tell you hwat. Inspired by Art Deco, its futuristic vistas are just... Just beautiful. A little bit confuisng to get through at times perhaps, but with these looks, hey, who's complaining.The only criticism I have is that its story is too short. Now don't get me wrong, the story is really well made and doesn't drag, but you can finish it in 5-6 hours. Now, that's great, I like a well made story, if it has to be around 6 hours to present itself the right way, the way the author intended, great. but you WILL want to play more of it after you've seen the ending, and it is a shame that you will have to start up New Game+ to do so. The good news is that the New Game+ mode is really well made and has some additional stuff in it. Everything transfers and the difficulty ramps up. Heck, they even change up the enemy spawns, so it's definitely worth a second playthrough. Plus- there's no way you're going to reach the level cap during your first run through Thransistor, so there's a bunch of new stuff you'll get to play with.Well, that's a minor gripe, this is A+ material for sure. It's obvious that these guys know what they're doing, and every part of this game has been meticulously crafted with much passion and hard work. Whatcha gonna do next Kasavin? Cause whatever it is, I'm listening.			"

												Transistor - a semiconductor device used to amplify and switch electronic signals and electrical power.Indeed, this game centers around a device called the Transistor which amplifies the signals (intent) and power (emotion) of its user, the main protagonist in the story, Red.This sophomore title by Supergiant Games delivers not only a definitive OST, graphics, and mechanics, but storyline as well.If you played Bastion this is almost a required play, as the Transistor universe brings into question the very essence of existence and the universe, almost hinting at the possible creation of the Bastion universe itself if you read deeply enough between the lines.I recommend this game. 100%What I didn't like:For myself, I found certain Function() combinations almost necessary *especially* when more and more Limiter()s are enabled. I found this brought down the strategic planning involved with battles and increased the spamminess. Though I concede this may be due to my own play style in the first place.And I wish it was longer. This is such a detailed, charming, delightful world that I wish my stay was longer than it was.			"

												Yesterday, I finished Bastion, today, I felt like I need more from them so I played Transistor. It took me 5 hours to complete the story without doing anything else but the story, I also didint use and game-hardening effects that you can add while you play. I just wanted to see how it goes. So far, amazing. PROS:- Game is an eye-candy. Drawings, characters, enemies, everything is so beautiful I actually felt like using my old oil paints to paint something from this game and hang in my room. I'll just buy probably.- OST's. As I mentioned in Bastion, they're not just doing a great job but I'm actually going to put all of these songs in my phone, they're worth it.- Gameplay. I like isometric, but this is something else. I thought I'd be bothered with the turn-based playing but actually, It was on point and fun. Little calculations make it very easy.- Skill design = FOR THE MOTHER OF INDIES, I loved it. The design is so catchy, and the combination system means, you can play the game however you want! You can create 1-hit K.O. AOE's or if you like playing dodgy, you can create more agile stunner gameplay too. Its all yours.- Story. I cried. Seriously.CONS:- Level gaining. Level gaining itself isn't the bad part, the bad part is, I had to wait and watch how the character gained level after every single encounter, and I don't really like waiting for something so repetitive. It literally pauses the game, pops a little window, shows how many percentage of your character gained level, and then pops of. Still, It didin't ruined the game, It's something minor, and doesn't really bother you at some point because you're just so in the game.TL;DR: If you like Bastion, buy it. Being isometric, or different gameplay won't bother you in any way, this game's a little masterpiece.			"

												TL;DR Version: 10/10 srsly this game is freakin' stellarI can't recommend this game enough. It's seriously one of the most stunning games I've ever played. When I rank games in my head, listing them with all their faults in mind, all I can say is that Transistor is the ONLY game that I've played that has no faults.Where do I start? Gameplay. Transistor does a fantastic job at letting you customize your moves. The pacing is fantastic- it does a very good job at easing the mechanics for you early on. For example, you start with a quick jab, and a long charging shot. Eventually you get an attack that is like a weak AoE. Pretty simple stuff, yeah? But then it tells you you can apply similar properties of powers to another, like combining them. Now your long-charge shot can split into multiples. And THEN you can apply powers to yourself, and not your other powers, to change up gameplay. The flexibility in powers allows for such a massively open-ended way to play. It's a simple 3-choice system that really allows the player to pick how they choose to play.The story is pretty interesting. It's nothing fantastic enough to win awards, but the way that they present you the story makes it interesting. Cloudbank is a mysterious place, and their little terminals and hints in dialogue makes you keep guessing what it really is. The characters, though, are rather lackluster save for Red and the Transistor. There are only 3 voices in the game, and one of them is simple grunts and humming. The Transistor character, voiced by the same fantastic narrator from Bastion, is the main spotlight for his character. The other characters, the Camerata, aren't so fleshed out.The art and sound styles are fantastic. This shouldn't really be a point to deter anyone, as these are just aesthetics. But when something is so stellar and outstandish in a game, I need to point it out. This game has STYLE. It's a beautiful, artsy, cyberpunk experience that's complete with everything that you need to keep you immersed.There's really only one problem with this game. I want more. It's so good, but it's a straight-forward story game that won't take you longer than 10 hours. I want more of Cloudbank. I want more of the Transistor combat. I want more, more, more! The ending made me satisfied, but I was sad that it was over.Do yourself a favor. Buy this game. It's very, very good.			"

												The Bad:You have to play it twice.The Good:It gets even better the second time around.Let me say this, about 75% of the way through my first playthrough, I wasn't even sure if I really liked the game yet. There are some game breaking power combinations you can create that make it impossible to lose. The game is beautiful, the combat is interesting and what eventually really won me over, was the story. Towards the end of the game, you finally start understanding the story. It's not even that it is told to you, no, what happens is you get more and more of it via text in your powers, text in the limiters, just from everywhere. I didn't fully understand the impact of those until later.Once you are done with your first run, you kind of question some things, so what do you do, you play again. Suddenly the story becomes clear. You understand what happened. You understand how. You understand everything in a way that simply wasn't possible the first time around.It's like watching Fight Club the second time. You see it in a new light that you couldn't have before.Simply beautiful, well done. I have to applaud them for making another great game after Bastion. I didn't think it possible. I am so glad I picked this up on a whim. Literally because it was cheap at the time.			"

												It made me fall for for a faceless guy (more like a sword duh!) with super hot voice andit made me cry.The battle system is unique, battles aren't that hard, great soundtrack, amazing storyline, love the characters.""Sky looks blue cause we want it to"" - Farrah Yon-DaleBut too bad I can't compare it with Bastion since I haven't play it.Some said, the ending makes no sense, well I dont know which part but to me it is completely statisfying.There is no real bad guy, it just a matter of perspective and I really, really like that. But, what I like the most is the romance.I didn't bought this for the romance, I didn't even know! But it turned out to be simply amazing and beautiful. Without lot of words I can feel the connection/bond between Red and The Transistor,Players don't need a complete conversation to know they love each other, and I know it's not easy to do that.Especially, during the gameplay. Players don't know their history (yet) or what kind of relationship they had and Redonly stays silent, but, you can feel it that there is something between them like longing.When the game ends, I didn't expect it to be like that, I was surprised and it hit me with tears, the beautiful soundtrack makes it even worse.Definitely 10/10			"

												Wow. I just completed Transistor and honestly, it was one of the best games I've played this entire year. I was completely blown away by the soundtrack and the overall art style. - I felt that the gameplay was very unique by mixing two different types of combat styles into one. - Art style and atmosphere was really beautiful and unique. Throughout my 4 hours playthrough, never once did I feel that the map was bland. - Soundtrack. Just speechless. Darren Korb blew me away with the soundtrack in Bastion, and did it once again with Transistor.- The story was decent. It was simple enough and did not drag itself out for too long. - Took me 3.9 hours to complete the game. However, I did not do any challenges which would have extended the game by an hour or more. - The game's combat was not too easy and not too difficult. It never once made me feel like the game's combat was too easy to the point where it was basically cheating nor did it made me feel like the game's combat was too unfair and unforgiving. I felt that 3.9 hours was the sweet spot for me with this game. The soundtrack and atmosphere alone made the amount I paid for ($13.99) worthwhile. Supergiant Games outdid themselves this time again.			"

												Basically, this is Bastion with a ""software"" theme. The art and music are outstanding, though very similar to Bastion, as is the attention to detail.There are loads and loads of programming references, which I found absolutely delightful, being a software engineer.You don't have to be a software engineer to enjoy the game, though. Like Bastion, the game is perfectly accessible to anyone. It's been described as an RPG-lite, but there's plenty of gameplay complexity. The combat is a mix between ARPG and TBS.There are even a few ""puzzles"" (game calls them ""tests"") thrown in, where you are challenged to win a fight by utilizing your abilities in specific ways. These tests are a way of educating you on the combat mechanics.There's plenty of strategy involved, including the ability to make combat more difficult in exchange for a small exp bonus. I played at effectively the highest difficult setting and enjoyed the challenge. I'm probably going to continue through the second playthrough for additional challenge.The first playthrough is fairly short, but never feels tedious, either. The second playthrough can be taken to extend play time by quite a bit. I like the game length. Some might complain about the price point, but I think it's fair for a quality indie title like this.There are stability issues at the moment, but they are rapidly being patched, so I expect those to mostly be resolved soon. I mainly encountered problems with the optional ""tests"" deadlocking (?) and requiring manual process termination. Glancing at the forums, this seems to be related to the online features, which are understandably more difficult to test prior to release, so it's not exactly fair to ask ""don't these people test their game?""Also, there's not much character development and no real character interaction (though there's plenty of good voiceover). Some might miss that, but it didn't bother me. The focus is on atmosphere. I liked the way the game slowly revealed the backstory and made you work for some of it - revealing character biographies if you used your abilities in different ways.I liked the story, though I may be biased given the theme :)In conclusion, I highly recommend this.Disclaimer: I only played 30 minutes into Bastion so far, so I'm not very qualified to compare the two titles. (Yeah, I know, I'll get around to finishing it eventually)			"

												Big fan of Bastion and the same developers made Transistor, so I gave it a try...sadly, a bit disappointed.So, is Transistor a bad game?  No.  However, it's a somewhat flawed game, at least from a gameplay standpoint.  First, the good.  The story is...largely unimportant/boring, but the characters and the world built in are amazing.  You feel very much drawn in with our silent heroine, Red, and her chatty admirer trapped in a cybernetic sword.  It creates a narrative experience where you are there more for how the characters and world interact than the story.Graphically, the game is quite distinctive.  Think Bastion meets Cyberpunk 2020 or Shadowrun.  It's very much a detective noir cyber punk world and feels dark, gothic, but also futuristic and techno.  The effects onscreen can be quite a sight to behold as well and the art style itself is quite beautiful, using 2-d hand drawn in conjunction with the sprites and 3-d action in combat.Sound design is where the game shines.  An amazing voice cast, beautiful music which fits the mood perfectly, and relatively satisfying combat sounds make it a joy to listen to.  The tracks are good, but the vocal pieces in the beginning and end of the game are probably the best part of it.One thing I will say about Transistor that I love and wish more games would do is it feels organic.  You have, for example, several areas that are completely unnecessary, not story related, and which you can skip, but not skipping them builds the world and the characters, feeling like we get to know them through their actions and choices.  Like ordering a pizza after trying to be murdered.  I'm dead serious and it actually ends up being a nice quiet moment between heroine and sword.  Also, Red can hum or flourish the sword, if for no other reason than because that's what the character would do, even if the gamer chooses not to.  Feels very much alive.  The world itself is very distinctive, even if it draws heavily from noir and cyberpunk.Now, the bad.  Like Bastion, it seems to go for an action RPG route where you can choose your moves in real time, with the option of a system freeze time, string together combos, and plan your battle more strategically.  This is where the game starts to suffer.  You cannot play one or the other.  Largely, the game requires you to use this ""turn"" system and when you use it, you are left vulnerable for up 5 seconds while a bar recharges.  You cannot attack and are slower than all the enemies and their projectiles, so the game is VERY frustrating at times in this regard.  Also, your health drains at an insane rate, even on the easy setting, and when it drains to zero, you lose one of the four moves you can map to the face buttons until you die.  At times, this will happen multiple amounts in battle and it takes several battles to recharge, as you can only recharge the lost abilities at specific points.  So, you may not die, but the game is very unbalanced in terms of what you can do and how much damage you take compared to the enemies.  It has an option to increase difficulty in exchange for more experience, like in Bastion, but honestly, the game feels not hard, but frustrating enough without it.There is also an area like the Bastion which is meant to be a training/cooldown place, but...unlike the Bastion it feels kinda shoe horned in.  There seem to be several features, like the added difficulty, thrown in because ""hey, we did it in Bastion and people liked that.""  Standing on its own, without comparisons, it's...unnecessary, but inoffensive.On the whole, I liked Transistor, despite the story not gripping me as much as the characters did and the gameplay being often very frustrating.  I'd say play Bastion first, because Bastion is just a better game, but if you're looking to kill 4-6 hours and the issues I mentioned with gameplay can be overlooked, the experience is well worthwhile.Transistor is flawed, but still a gem.

												Now that I've recently returned to 100% the game, I feel that I can finally review it. (And don't worry, no spoilers.)First off, if you've not played Bastion, you don't need to in order to play this one. They aren't connected in the least besides gameplay and artstyle/music. Of course, I'd recommend playing that game too; it's a good one. If you have played Bastion, then I'd still highly recommend playing Transistor. Though it doesn't have the multiple endings that Bastion does, the story is still quite satisfying.Transistor is a great game, and I enjoyed it even more than I enjoyed Bastion. Its gameplay, though similar to its predecessor, feels a lot more polished and varied, with Red's many attacks having much use as you go along. What's nice is that a little ways in you get a way to attack even during your cooldowns (if you choose to use Turn()), which mixes up the fun even more. The story is just vague enough to keep you interested in its mystery (as Bastion did as well), and as minimal as it is, it works quite well. It's a really nice tale of love and loss (cheesy, I know), and the characters and world that it builds are very imaginative. It's short, it's fairly action-packed, and it's heartrending.The theme at its core - the potential imperfections of paradise - is touched upon tastefully and openly enough for the player to form their own opinions on how such would work (if it could). The game contains a couple of anticlimaxes that are done in an intentional manner to add to the mood and storytelling, and while for a game that's generally not the best idea, I found that it made sense for the most part here. That is still, of course, a flaw, but it's a justifiable one.As for the ending, without spoiling anything, I found it beautiful. The art, the music, the circumstances... they all blend together so well to make an impactful ending. It's amazing in its simplicity, and it is, for the most part, a logical conclusion to the story. I suppose there could maybe have been a choice as there was in Bastion (though only one choice and two options here), but that's just a very small piece of missed potential. The ending that the developers chose works, and it works well.The art in the game is awesome, and I figured I might as well give it a brief mention. The whole game looks great, and every time you get to see full art in its glory, it really does feel like a treat. The artist is http://jenzee.deviantart.com/ in case you want to see more of her work. Anyway...Finally, I get to gush about the music! I highly recommend buying the soundtrack, because it is phenomenal. It has some powerful songs (especially the vocal tracks - if you've not heard Paper Boats before, please don't listen to it until the end of the game. It just adds so much to the ending.) as well as many intense or atmospheric ones. A while back I made a review for the soundtrack itself, so check that out if for some reason you're interested in my favorite tracks. Anyway, all of the songs fit the game, and they add a lot to how artsy and beautiful it is.That's about it for this review - it turned out a little longer than I'd expected! For a rather short game, Transistor is one of the best; like any Steam game, it's in your best interest to buy it on sale, but to me it's worth the full price. Even after fully completing it I can see myself going back to it in the future. I don't really like giving numerical scores to games in general, so I'll just say that while it isn't perfect, it's really great and most certainly worth picking up if you can.			"

												Transistor is a pretty interesting game, though definitely confusing. You begin the game ""in media res,"" with things falling apart and jumping into some uncertain combat with some creatures known as The Process. Your character, Red, seems to have lost her voice, which is odd, and I will get to that later as a criticism related to Supergiant Games. The only thing that speaks to you (as the character and player) for most of the game is actually your weapon, the Transistor itself.The story is not all given to you. In fact, you must piece a lot of it together - what the world is, where the people in it are, who the people you meet along your journey are, and what you are actually doing in the first place, among many other questions. Supergiant was very lightweight on what they give you, as you only learn small pieces here and there, with a few side details as you explore and find items such as terminals, which have news posts or recorded audio.Other story details revolve around your powers in combat. As you go along in the game, you earn new attack skills for the Transistor, and you can map out which skills you have at a time. There are 4 active skill slots you can hold at any one moment. Each skill can be upgraded with a max of 2 other skills at a single time. And further, there are 4 passive skill slots that you can hold, which will cause certain effects during combat. Each new skill will give you 3 pieces of story information revolving around a singular character. To unlock the information, you must use each skill as Active, Upgrade, and Passive. Doing so will give you new blocks of text about each character's background.Note that there is Memory that you have in the game, and equipping each skill uses up the Memory. Its purpose is to limit the amount of active, passive, and upgrade skills you have at any time. Further, you gain experience to level up in combat, common to RPG-style games. Leveling up is how you unlock certain new skills, and also how you unlock the usage of the new slots for active/passive/upgrade.A very heavy piece of combat, which is basically a requirement to survive the game, is something called Turn(). Essentially, it stalls combat (freezes time) and gives you a limited energy bar to plan out what you want to do. Moving around and using skills will eat up the energy, though you can undo moves and keep changing your plan until you finalize it by ending Turn(). Doing so will trigger everything you chose in faster than usual speed, with most enemies barely moving while it all happens. Turn() is a way to increase damage against enemies, escape bad areas of battle, or even just a way to look around the area to figure out what to do.While I do think that the usage of such a system was pretty efficient, and the fact that using skills in those 3 different ways allows for good customization, I do not think that Turn() necessarily blew the game away. A big reason why it is not all that is the fact that it really must be used a ton, or else you simply die. Many enemies cannot be efficiently beaten without it. Some of them are even chasing and attacking you every single second, as if they are in their own Turn() mode the whole battle, such as these dog enemies called ""Fetch."" While you find certain skills to hide or run away, most battle areas end up being relatively small and having large amounts of enemies, meaning that no place is exactly a safe spot.In fact, the later into the game I got (and during my second playthrough in ""Recursion""), I ended up using the exact same set of skills and spamming Turn() in order to get through. The game had certain side battles called Tests, one of which is called Performance Tests. In them, you must fight waves of enemies with randomly generated skills, as a means to get associated with more skills than just a few you like. However, most of those were simply not possible with certain skills and required many retries to get stronger ones, showing that not every skill is enough to beat the game.The graphics of the game are pretty good, though I found way too many areas to be extremely bright/to have high contrast to where things were blending together. I could not find a good reason for this, because my computer and the game settings were nothing abnormal. No such brightness/contrast issues exist for any other games I have played, or for any applications I have used.As for the sound, most of the effects are nothing too special, while some of the music and voice acting were done well, with limitations. In total, you only hear about 4 characters in the entire game, with 3 of them being for very short periods of time. Supergiant Games seems to not get many people acting as characters, and in both of their popular games so far, that minimalism exists. The other game is Bastion, of course, a game which many people compare Transistor to, as Bastion came out a few years before in a similar vein. Both games have very little voice besides one main character talking as a semi-narrator, and one or two songs made for the games.Now, as just mentioned, Supergiant has the other big hit Bastion. As has seemed to be a large topic for players of these games, many people question and answer which of the two hits are better. A majority of people I've seen so far say Bastion - and in my opinion, I would agree with them.While Transistor is definitely strong and I still recommend playing it, I feel like Bastion has more charm and better setup than Transistor does. I enjoy the gameplay setup of Bastion more, with a hub that you return to, a map that you traverse to specific areas with vastly different styles, and a purely active combat style. I also enjoyed the story and characters of Bastion more, with you getting to learn more about them and the world.Supergiant made Bastion with very tight-knit story and gameplay, while Transistor has more breadth. Bastion gives you almost every single background detail possible, which I would not say Transistor needs to do - but I still think that Transistor did not go as deep as it should have. A lot of the story just feels like it is randomly pieced together, while Bastion feels very connected. Further, Transistor is a rather shorter game in comparison to Bastion.Despite the above, I think Transistor is definitely a game worth trying out, as it is a nice experience overall. However, I believe that Bastion has a higher replayability as well, and I do not see myself returning to Transistor much.			"

 I love this game! Now, the story is quite deep for a seemingly simple game (to be honest I didn't get it all until I checked it online) but I'll give you a spoiler-free, rough idea of what this game is about.A city called Cloudbank is attacked by the Camerata which is a group of individuals who intend to change the city using Processes which are basically robotic creatures. You play as Red, a female singer who fights these creatures with the Transistor, a weapon that can also speak to you.Throughout the game, you will receive new abilities called Functions for the Transistor which can be combined differently to produce different effects on your attack and defence. You will be able to change and combine the Functions together at terminals called Access Points to help you fight different foes with different abilities. There are also Sandbox areas for you to test and experiment with the Functions.Armed with the Transistor, you will fight your way through beautiful locations, unlocking new Functions and facing new enemies. Your talking, sword-like weapon will keep you company and help you make sense of what is happening. Gameplay: 9/10  RPG style. Countless combinations for attack and defence. Real-time fighting and planning mode available. Very fun to play. Story: 9/10 Very unique and interesting story. Graphics: 9/10  Beautiful atmospheric locations and cutscenes. Sound Effects & Music: 10/10  Incredible music. Game comes with optional Soundtrack. Voice Acting: 8/10  Good voice acting which adds to the tone of the game Overall Score: 9/10  Recommendation: Very highly recommended. Play with a controller. Play at night in a dimly-lit room because... ambience. Buy the soundtrack. "

												Supergiant came out of nowhere with Bastion, and it was amazing.  Would they be able to recapture the magic with their sophomore release?  In short:  mostly.What made Bastion memorable to me was the music and atmosphere.  Mechanically solid, but aurally and visually delightful.  With Transistor they flip this a bit.  The real hook, the most fully formed part of the game, is the combat mechanics.Make no mistake, the audio is still miles ahead of most competitors.  Darren Korb does superb work with the music, though admittedly my tastes favor the folk blues of Bastion to the synth jazz of Transistor.  Logan Cunningham once again able to run laps around most voice acting in games.  Overall the entire atmosphere and audio portions of the game fall secondary to Bastion, but there is no shame in taking second to a game as strong as that.The mechanics are the area where it stands on it's own.  They use a unique system of abilities, with each function able to take either the form of an ability, modifier for another ability, or passive support role.  The myriad ways these interact can lead to many tactical situation.  The game also strongly encourages mixing and experimentation, as the narrative is largely unlocked by using an ability in each of the 3 roles.  There doesn't seem to be any overpowering combo, though each can feel that way when used correctly.  Many games feature a wide array of abilities you can equip, but few do as good of a job encouraging you to experiment and resist using the same strategy throughout.Overall, a hearty recommendation.  While I rate it slightly lower than Bastion, their idea of a sophomore slump is still to embarrass the competition in writing and audio.			"

												I would give this game an 9/10. The graphics are very good.The gameplay is very good, I\'ve been using a PS3 controller for controls.The sound is pretty good. The content is pretty good.I especially love the fact that it uses programming functions, visually, to create your weapon inputs and everything.The only thing that hinders it a point, and I was going to say 8/10, is I don\'t really get into the storyline. I don\'t feel connected to it. It is kind of just happening. Others might, so I gave it an extra point. Overall this is a great game.I also like that now-adays games seem to be smaller, so when I thought I beat the game, I ended up going hours longer. So far I have about 8 hours played, and I \""think\"" I\'m close to beating it. All in all, great job! I\'d recommend it. Still unsure what the singing button is for, and the jumping for the sword button. I\'d imagine they are just for looks.			"

												From the creators of the beloved Bastion comes Transistor, a game in which you take on the role of Red, a musician living in the city of Cloudbank, whose voice has just been stolen during an attempt on her life. Red finds herself pulling a greatsword, Transistor, from the body of an acquaintance, whose consciousness has been transferred into it and can actively communicate with her through it. Transistor proceeds to serve as the narrator of the game and a contrast to the now-voiceless Red.Transistor is set in a technological era where pretty much everything can be digital, even one’s entire being, and disturbingly easy to take ownership of, manipulate or destroy. This technology has also brought certain comforts, and citizens find themselves voting on the weather and what color they’d prefer for the evening’s sunset. Cloudbank seems on its way to being a utopian society for its citizens until, one day, influential figures begin to disappear, one after another. An army of intelligent robots that serve as the city’s defense has been activated and begins… processing people. Red must fight her way through the Process to stop it, find who's causing the trouble and recover her voice.The real stars of Transistor—sorry Red—are the function system and the hybrid battle system, where you can use abilities in real time and/or pause and plan your actions step by step on a tactical grid, then unpause to watch them unfold. Abilities, or functions as they’re called in the game, are absorbed by Transistor from the bodies of citizens you encounter as well as through leveling up. The function system is modular and synergistic, allowing you to mix and match and change your skills freely at checkpoints, with hundreds of potential combinations and effects. A simple attack function, such as Crash(), can be augmented with other functions so that it chains to additional enemies, charms them, has an added area of effect, fires more quickly, is more powerful, pulls enemies toward you, or becomes available for use in real time while your tactical turn is recovering. Each function may be used as an active skill, support for an active skill, and/or a passive skill. If, at some point, you attempt to research the strongest function combinations, you will find that almost every player has a different opinion; so many viable combinations is a hallmark of great design that doesn’t pigeonhole you into using cookie-cutter ability combinations throughout the entire game. This is where Transistor truly excels and the new game+ rewards you with additional copies of each function to play around with and more challenging encounters to test them out on. Self-imposed penalties called limiters, similar to the idols in Bastion, provide the option to challenge yourself further.Everything else in Transistor plays a supporting role to the combat system: The art is beautiful, but the locations are not very memorable and only serve to funnel you from one combat encounter to another; the soundtrack is solid but lacks a single track remotely as memorable as Bastion's vocal tracks; the narration takes a backseat because, although Transistor talks a lot, he really doesn’t have much of importance to say; characters other than Red and Transistor are never really fleshed out or present in the game other than to have their lives summarized in three-paragraph text dumps on the ability screen, where you’re left to decide their overall relevance and whether they should mean anything to you at all. The developers left a lot of holes for the player to fill and, whether this was intentional or not, for every player who manages to make sense where there seems none, another will be left scratching his head. Unlike in Bastion, additional narration of story elements does not take place during the optional challenges, which I feel is a missed opportunity to rectify this.For me, Transistor was ultimately the story of two individuals amidst chaos and despair; everything else was incidental and incohesive, and I was unable to appreciate the story much at all until I looked at it this way. Confined to these two characters and their story, it was touching, with a powerful conclusion. Regardless of whether you come away from the story with anything meaningful, Transistor is still worth playing for the excellent combat.			"

  Transistor has beautifully done artwork, amazing colour contrasts(most likely picked every single colour to create this game tbh) and an Action-RPG game of sci-fi futuristic metropolis that includes the story of gorgeous influential singer, a female protagonist called Red and the remarkable sword, the Transistor.  Game begins as Red wields the sword(transistor) stabbed in deadman and ventures deep into the metropolis to discover and resolve some mysteries. The story reveals in bits and pieces, its our job to put them all together to find out whats really happening and it was a bit difficult to figure that out.The game is mostly about two characters, the guy trapped in transistor after being stabbed and the girl Red, which is more like romance between these two and to keep each other safe rather than saving the city.Together they go after the group belongs to Camerata organization which, for no good reason, turns against Red to kill her but failed in process. As the game goes on we discover that the man trapped in transistor was the one who gave up his life to save Red from dying and at the same time Red lost her voice and couldn't communite at all. The sword talks all the time and is the actual narrator in this game. He/it never stops talking to Red which at times annoyed me because i couln't concentrate on the story during the fight.The ending is quite emotional and sad nevertheless sort of satisfying.As for me, i liked the combat and gaining the new functions for the sword on every Level-up. I enjoyed destroying the machines and robots by combining various functions which come out as new combos to deal greater damage to finish them off. I always enjoy stories and hate killing but the phenomena was totally oppoiste in this game(idk if someone agrees with me on this but i must say combat and combos were awesome for me). The game also has the Planning mode which makes it alot easier to make combos and attack afterwards. Planning mode has always been my fav!This game is very beautifully designed, capital city, Cloudbank is the major place where the whole story lies. The atmosphere was really pretty! i loved it.I thoroughly enjoyed the soundtracks and music throughout the game. More music and songs could be unlocked by completing the side actvities and various tests. All of the songs were really amazing, i must say Supergiant  put really good effort creating them! Some of the songs were also sung by Red, she had pretty good voice and really nice songs.To the verdicts! Well the game is masterpiece of artwork! amazing soundtracks, well drawn art characters and a nice story.Pretty much worthy of 19.99$ but its nice to have it on sale. I Profoundly recommend it!!! "

												Transistor is like candy, in that it gives you a rush but ultimately leaves you feeling a bit empty.Initial impressions are fantastic - the first few minutes of the game has genuine emotional punch, voice acting is great, graphics are vibrant and evocative, and the game’s soundtrack is arguably one of the best ever released for a computer game (I’ve purchased it). The game is set in a unique and engaging world, and a range of intriguing characters are regularly hinted at.Disappointingly, the story remains surprisingly lightweight given the cracker start, and the game finishes with both the world and the characters remaining enigmatic and unexplored.Gameplay is primarily combat in a modified “real time with pause” style, which suits me great and has a ton of potential. You have the ability to combine a large number of different powers and effects, creating some genuinely interesting combinations. Unfortunately there is little variety in enemies, and consequently, combat lacks depth and replayability.I feel bad being critical about a game this good, but for a game only a few steps away from having been a genuine classic I can’t help but reflect on what might have been. If only the developers had explored the intriguing world and characters they have created in a little more detail.Regardless, Transistor is undeniably a top-shelf game by any measure, and a worthy (though not essential) addition to anyone’s game catalogue.I like candy.

												Transistor is all I ever wanted it to be. And that's inspiring and wonderful. Gameplay is varied and barely annoying, it serves as a vessel to tell a pretty story, in a very remarkable way. I had no problems with the game whatsoever, the varied attacks are all pretty interesting to see, though some are rather less useful than others. Regardless, the soundtrack helps a lot to build a decent atmosphere, and that's the highest bit about this game. I got it on a sale a while ago for 4-5 dollars, it's been a while since i got to play it, but it was worth every dollar spent, and wouldn't mind paying the full price for a game such as this one. Kudos to the team behind this, all the best in the future.			"

Product received for free
												I received Transistor as a part of a between-friends Secret Santa gift swap and it took me around five and a half hours to get to the end once.  I used the Xbox 360 controller the whole time.  A singer without a voice and a talking sword.  This duo has a front-row seat for what looks like the end of the world...  Transistor should feel familiar to those who played Bastion before since it too is an action RPG with an isometric angle.  Instead of landmasses floating in the sky, the setting is a city in the process of uncontrolled change.  And instead of a young man with an ever-growing arsenal of weapons, our heroine instead drags the titular Transistor behind her, and she uses that for a variety of attacks.  ""Red, we're not gonna get away with this, are we?"" is the line that starts the game, spoken by the sword sticking out of a man to the woman standing over the two.  No backstory, no introductory cutscene, just this scene and cutting to gameplay as she takes the sword with her.  The sword knows where to go, so you move on...and then the cubes come and with them, enemies.  You start with two attacks and four slots to put them in to start, and you get more attacks through the story and as you level up.  Combat's interesting because of the ""Turn()"" feature.  You can fight enemies in real time, but Red is no warrior and several attacks have windup times that leave her open.  Using Turn() stops time and allows you to queue movement and attacks that eat up your ""planning"" bar.  When you confirm your setup, Red will zip along and do all of the attacks at lightning speed as the enemies move at a snail's pace.  The tradeoff is that then you can't use any attacks until the planning bar refills, though you can move.  Red only has one movement speed, so using Turn() to approach, strike, and retreat is always a good idea.  Another neat thing about the combat is how your unused attacks can buff your other attacks or even Red herself.  Crash() is one of the starting moves, a basic melee-range attack that can stun enemies.  Applying it as an upgrade to another move makes that move stun.  Applying it as a passive reduces the damage Red takes as well as renders her immune to slowdown.  You eventually unlock two upgrade slots for your attacks and four passives for Red, but you have to mind the MEM limit taken up by your powers, each of which eats 1 to 4 MEM.  There are quite a few combinations to try out, and you can get interesting combos like a ranged AoE that charms and poisons anything it hits, or a summon that spawns two helpers that slowly heal you.  Another interesting thing is that all of the powers are tied to character bios and you unlock information as you use the power in the active, upgrade, and passive slots, though this is completely optional.  You get some background info as well as circumstances leading to their disappearances in the wake of the chaos going on, so the game indirectly pushes you to try new combinations.  The game also takes a different approach to lives.  You have a health bar that naturally depletes as you get hurt, and when it empties, you get fully recovered at the cost of losing access to the move that used the most MEM, and it won't come back until you visit a few save points.  Lose all four of your set powers and game over.  I really liked the game's visual style, art deco mixed with digital aesthetic, giving it a weird retro-futuristic vibe.  The enemies are mostly white robotic constructs that attack you with lasers, there are white cubes that pop up to show an upcoming fight and to be used as cover, and you drag a big green sword behind you that looks a bit like a circuit board (which also leaves behind circuity sparks as you move).  The game feels like it could take place entirely in cyberspace, especially considering some of the prompts (finding the Transistor stuck in the man's chest reads ""User: Logged Out""), but it's left ambiguous.  The music is great too, though I really took notice in a couple of places that play songs that Red wrote and performed in-universe, like ""The Spine"" playing when fighting the first Younglady at the big poster or ""In Circles"" gradually getting corrupted during the first boss fight.  Given Red is currently mute, the Transistor makes comments about the situation or the things you interact with.  I know the narrator in Bastion was pretty love it or hate it, but I didn't mind him and I never would've guessed it was the same guy voicing both characters.  As far as difficulty went, I found the game on the easy side, but that might've been due to the power combinations I used or prior experience with these kinds of games.  YMMV of course, but I only lost my health to the first boss once and the last one twice, though I came close a few other times.  If you know what you're doing and have a good setup of powers, you can probably handle anything.  The game slowly introduces you to new mooks to fight and their upgrades, at least.  The game is pretty short, as in, ""one night of gaming"" short.  It doesn't overstay its welcome, but I honestly wanted more.  There are optional challenges that give you a preset list of powers and tasks you with a mission such as ""survive for 90 seconds"" or ""kill all enemies in one Turn()"".  There's a New Game Plus feature where you go back through the story, fighting mooks in their strongest forms, and you can opt into the Limiters you unlock by leveling up which increase the enemy's powers in exchange for you getting more EXP out of fights, to the maximum level of 30.  You get another set of the same powers you earned the first time through, so you can really mix things up on the second loop.  Short but sweet.  Transistor is a bit more than just Bastion: Cyberpunk, but those familiar with Bastion should find this a great fit.  It's pretty light on the RPG even though you level up, as you don't allocate stats and the biggest choices are which of the options you go for when you level up, not that you permanently lose anything you skipped.  It's pretty appealing for those who like customizing since there are 16 powers and you can combine any unique power together twice, so there are a lot of combinations to try out--and the game tracks which ones you've used at that!  Kinda wish the story was longer, but it wraps itself up nicely even if it's short.  There's some replay value but a lot of it comes from the optional challenges or just trying new combos to decimate your foes.  You'd probably like this one.			"

												Oh holy ham sandwiches, this game is absurd. First of all, the art style is simply amazing. I mean did ya look at it? It's fabulous. Secondly, the soundtrack is WHOASH. You might end up not enjoying the game but still love it because of how good the music is. It's off the chain man.The gameplay. Let's just say that it's a real sauce ball platter when it comes to this aspect. Transistor uses a battle system that is both unique and delicious to the stomach. It allows you to attack enemies in real time or using the neato ""Turn"" ability to plan out your attacks. Both options are viable and they are both quite satisfying.Transistor is not without it's flaws however. The game is pretty short only taking me around 7 hours to beat. The game is also extremely linear offering no sense of exploration. The game will keep you going on the path of destruction without much say. HOWEVER, transistor's replay value is boosted thanks to it's wide selection of weapons which allows you to experiment and find tons of different strategies and slam dunk homeruns to use throughout the game. So you don't get to explore the world much but you do get to explore your vast arsenal of abilities. Making different loadouts was pretty fun, and that's where a lot of the replay value was found for me.For those of you who played Supergiant's last game Bastion, you should be right at home with the new role that voice actor Logan Cunningham plays in this game as the voice inside the transistor.  Similar to Bastion, the main character is silent and the voice in the transistor will speak for her as she journeys through the city of Cloudbank. It is a slightly different role compared to the role of the narrator from Bastion, but it is executed very well and at the end of the day I was just as impressed. The story is also one of the biggest dunks this game has to offer. I found it very interesting and engaging, however once the game had ended, I was left with many unanswered questions that were never resolved.  This may annoy some players, but I actually found it refreshing that the game challenges you to think about these questions and come up with interpretations for yourself.At the end of the day, this game is GODLIKE.  For those of you who are looking for a large amount of content in this game, the 20$ price tag may be too steep. And that is okay, but I believe that this game is such an awesome experience that the price tag is justified even if it doesn't last you as long as most games.So yeah, Transistor gets a rating of ""11/10 reverse gorilla dunk"". Thank you for your time.			"

												It's another great atmospheric game. I love the visual style, and the music is great.The action is a bit slower paced than Bastion, and you have a 'strategy mode' where you can line up actions for an instant attack stream. You also pick up new skills here'n there, which you can combine to upgrade others, or use directly. It's quite interesting how it's put together. So far it's pretty amazing game.			"

												This is the most beautiful game I've played in my twenty six years. Besides the visual appeal and the music being leagues ahead of any game I've ever seen, the game mechanics are amazing as well. You can make so many different abilities because all of the functions are interchangeable between passive, actives and mods. The amount of work that had to go into this game is incredible. The story hooked me right from the start. I literary downloaded this game, played nonstop and finished in a little over five hours. Now I am still awake at 3AM feeling compelled to write a review about how much I loved this game. I really do not have any words that will do any justice to this unique and beautiful world that I completely fell in love with. This will, hands down, be the best buy of the 2014 Steam Summer Sale.

												Overall, there's just too many things about this game that rub me the wrong way.First of all, I definitely like the art, visuals, music, voice acting, and writing. They don't hold your hand when it comes to explaining the story and it forces you to pay attention and also encourages you to try lots of different function combinations so you can learn more about the characters, if you care to.Other than that, though, there's not much I like. The most important aspect of games to me is whether the gameplay is fun, and honestly transistor's gameplay isn't that much fun for me. Like others have said, not being able to do anything after you pause time and plan out a sequence of moves just sucks. They don't even give you enough mobility to dodge shots. All you can really do is try to get to cover and hide out until your meter replenishes. And if you opt to instead play without using turn (or using turn to pause and think and then unpausing and simply executing your actions manually), you'll probably disappointed by that experience when comparing it to the action oriented gameplay of bastion. One of the worst things, in my opinion, is that you lose access to functions when you lose all your health. Honestly I'd rather just die and restart from checkpoint. I can see that they're trying to encourage you to try different combinations of things, but it still just frustrates me losing the build that I was in the process of learning. And when your options are limited the gameplay just gets more and more boring because you might have to resort to gimmicky tactics depending on what functions you are left with. Overall, it's certainly a unique idea to blend the turn-based with real-time combat, but, in practice, it ends up just not being all that fun to me. I'd rather play a turn based game or an action game. My brain doesn't like switching between the two so rapidly.I would say get this heavily discounted and play it for the uniqueness and aesthetics. Don't come here expecting something very heavy or that you're going to really want to sink countless hours into or replay. My first playthrough was done in 6 hours and I was glad to be done with it. I have to complement them for not dragging it out or having some frustratingly long and tedious boss fight at the end. If the story went on even an hour longer I might've just gotten sick of it and given up.If you're into experience games more along the lines of how you experience art or other aesthetic experiences (and not necesarilly for the thrill of challenge and victory), you should definitely consider this game. There's a lot there to process. I personally don't care much about that sort of thing when it comes to games, though.			"

												When I first looked at Transistor I thought it would be somewhat similar to Bastion. It had the same graphic style, an isometric view and a narrator (which is actually a 'character' this time; in the form of a talking sword). But, I'm happy to say that I couldn't be more wrong.Yes, it has all of the features I just mentioned but it's not just a simple copy. There's so much more going on here. Transistor has a deep (and a little bit confusing) story and a combat system that as equally deep. The lore reminded me of Dark Souls where you have to piece things together yourself and not everything is trying to be explained.The graphics are amazing, but are, unfortunately, this time limited to full HD resolutions and not anything higher. Despite that it all still looks like art, and it really is eye candy. Absolutely wonderful.The narrator is doing a great job as far as the voice acting goes, even if it's a bit stiff and sometimes feels unemotional. The music and sounds are all excellent as well.Let's get back to the combat system for a minute. Like pretty much any RPG out there, your character will level up after several battles and once you level up you're allowed to choose a certain skill and passive upgrade. When you first start it's just that, a skill. But level up a few times more and you'll have several skills. This time, however, skills can be combined to make an even more effective/deadly combination. So, for example, let's say that you chose the skill to teleport in an instant. Combine it with Charm (which temporarily transforms an enemy into an ally) and you'll be zipping across the map converting enemies, making your battles much easier. This was just a poor example, by the way (blame my memory !). Of course, this also works the other way around, resulting in entirely different skills every time. It's a blast to play with and it's even more fun to experiment with these new skills on real enemies. You'll see that certain combinations will do ridiculous amounts of damage and that others, while still being useful, need some slight tweaking in order to be effective. It's pure brilliance.Transistor is on the short side, however, and it can easily be finished in 5-6 hours. I think I explored every area carefully in my playthrough, but I didn't do most of the (optional) challenges. So I think you can add another 2 hours to my numbers if you want to do all of those. And after that, you can start New Game+ with all your current skills intact (which will make the battles more fun right from the start).In the end Transistor is nothing but a brilliant, deep little game. If you call yourself a serious gamer you should absolutely play this. I liked it even better than Bastion, and that's definitely saying something.[Rating: 91/100]			"

												A really loveable game filled with music, art, and all around good characterization and story writing. From the intro to the credits, the scenes are immersed in art and colors. To draw a parallel--much like Bastion, the many UI aids are still present (Subtitles, non-intrusive graphics, and despite the seemingly 'light filled' gameplay, it's not garish at all!), which in gameplay terms also includes a difficulty scaler (purely the player's choice) that modifies every aspect of combat alongside full control over what you bring into battle, covering around four major battle skills and their own (maximum of two) modifiers each, coupled with passive bonus modifier slots overall--all of whom you gain from the world...and its people, that writing about it in a review may downplay how much is actually possible. Every power and skill is configured to work with any other setting that given the simple battle system, would occur a mixture of primary and secondary effects (The skill would be thematically the same, but modified by the secondary add-on). All four 'major' skills can be modified dynamically given that setting, which makes the combat system able to be tailored to one's custom playstyle.While not visible in the above screenshots, Transistor has subtitles for everything (sans the song notes and chords for when the protagonist is singing herself) alongside an engaging storyline that somewhat tells itself in media res, with snippets to what was and is happening collected along the way.It also works on rather 'low-end' PCs which, coupled with wonderful graphics and an also wonderful storyline (and gameplay), creates an immersive setting that performs very well through several hours of playtime with importance given to the lore and writing. Personally, when I played this, the utter smoothness and immersion as if I was playing one of those 1080p quality videos I can hardly load on Youtube made me feel a lot better about how inclusive games are being (both to those with disabilities--given my hearing--and to those who are hard-up in affording 'better' PCs for games).Edit: While I may not look it--I've played a playthrough and beyond despite the current time showing it. The achievements record per-save basis (and with a stable online connection, of course), so it may not be that obvious. :P			"

												That was one hell of a ride...I cannot believe that there aren't many people that know about this game, as it is simple amazing. It is a more than worthy successer to Supergiant's first game Bastion and its story is suprisingly hard hitting.Pros:- The game's soundtrack is phenomenal, and teh game's ability to allow the main character, Red, to hum along when out of combat helps the soundtrack shine.- The game is beautiful, but runs very well, even for my 3 year old laptop, which isn't at all built for gaming.- The combat system is simple, yet very fun, somewhat challenging (but not too challenging) and is very creative, making it a breath of fresh air.- Speaking of difficulty of the game, there are limitations, much like Bastion's panthenion system, which allow you to make the game harder if you feel that it is currently too easy for you.- The story respects you by allowing you to figure out and put pieces of the puzzle together, instead of constantly guiding you through the story, adding to the mystery of the game, which Bastion also had.- The world and level design is very good and certain interactions that you can have with the world help to flesh out the world that the game is set in.- There are extra challenged in the game and the game's story is replayable, if you would like to play the game with a different combination of powers.Cons:- The game is a little on the short side, with its main story coming to around 6 hours.- There aren't any section within the game that allow you to make choice which will affect the story, and - despite Bastion only having a few of these - I feel that they are missed. In all honesty the cons are really only nickpicks, and don't really affect the game too much, and I feel that Transistor is a step up from Bastion. I also feel like it could have been acknowledged as one of the best games of 2014, if it had been given its rightful attention as its stylistic gameplay and world, combined with the beautiful soundtrack and mysterious story, make it on of my personnal favourites.

												Transistor pleased me in every way, from a fantastic audio/visual style to the amazingly satisfying, in-depth, and unique combat system.  I enjoyed every minute of Transistor even more than I enjoyed Bastion, which is saying a great deal.  Check out the video if you want to see more.

			We take a look at Transistor from indie darling Supergiant Games. While the game might invoke feelings of Bastion at first glance, in a good way, there's definitely a lot more going on here that sets...

												pros - - gorgeous soundtrack and visuals- narration > bastion's narration, in my opinion- emotionally stirring, thought-provoking story with roots in science fiction - solid length, and the nature of the game's story-telling makes it to where replaying at least once is still enjoyable - turn-based, strategy-based almost MOBA-esque combat is really fresh and fun, and can be infuriatingly difficult- seriously one of the beautiful all around games i've ever playedcons - - the story is not presented in the most cohesive way (deliberately) so i can see why someone may not fully understand the breadth of what is actually happening- that's literally it			"

												Wonderful game, if you played and liked Bastion, you will definitely like this one.Pros :1. Solid story and characters2. Interesting and well-presented idea (futuristic ""techno world"")3. Both design and music are amazing4. Great level of customisation, wide variety of abilities the main protagonist can use and quite a few enhancements to make the gameplay a bit more challengingCons :1. The game itself is a bit short, I wish it was longer ( it took me ~5h to finish it )- to get all the achievements, you need to replay it, but it still feels good, because of the atmospheric style and customisation2. After completing the game, I felt like the story was missing something, it could definitely develop into something more or offer a bit more advanced character development Overall 9/10 "

												Supergiant Games does it again with Transistor. The game has everything I adored about Bastion with a deeper disposition.The game's combat system features both real time and tactical elements which I feel does wonders for varied playstyles. The function combination system also gives you a ton of choices seeing as you can mix and match 16 different functions as actives, passives, and upgrades. The musical quality of the game is also quite excellent. It goes beyond what you would expect as far as ear candy goes. I also noticed that compared to Bastion, the songs in this game have a more direct message. They're not just catchy, they really fit into the story. If you think the soundtrack for this game is stellar, wait until you hear the humming added in!Here's a sample:

			Transistor is a science fiction action RPG video game by Supergiant Games. It is released on May 20, 2014 on Microsoft Windows and PlayStation 4 platforms, with other platforms possible in the future.		

As far as the story goes, Transistor really runs it deep. There are large gaps in the game that I still don't understand even after completing everything (while reading/listening to all interactables). I feel these gaps (some of which are open to interpretation) should at least be partially expanded on. Despite this, the game did not disappoint. I just wish they had alternate endings like they had with Bastion.10/10 - Everything about the game was very good, but the 10 rating comes from the insanely captivating music. I'm the type of gamer who values my audio experience just as much as the gameplay (if not more) so these things are very important to me. All in all this has been a great impulse buy.			"

												Wow, Transistor is one of those beautiful games that gives you great satisfaction while playing it <3. I enjoyed this game A LOT, no wait, I mean I love it. I'm glad I gave it a try. Definitely one of my all time favorites after finishing. The soundtrack is simply AMAZING, combat is fun and diverse with many moves + turn based strategy, story is told well as you progress and the voice acting is excellent. Not to forget the reeeeally cool artwork and characters too like Red and her companion <(^_^)>...I have yet to play Bastion, Supergiant's earlier game, but after this I need to try it some day.If you enjoy stuff like sci-fi, great music, story and cool action/rpg, then give this superb game a try. Highly recommended. Thank you  Supergiant Games for this beauty <(^_^<)!			"

												Summer-Rain looks over your shoulder witha few blinks, expecting an answer, which youdo not give. The screen flashes with shadesof sea green, white and orange, as the titlescreen greets the both you.TRANSISTOR.Bugging you after she heard a group of herfriends fangirl over the sheer *awesome* ofthis particular game, Summer-Rain pesteredyou into spending an evening at her houseshowing her the game and whether it wasreally as good as all her friends said it was.It is.Simply put, and as you soon discover withSummer-Rain gasping with the introductionof each new enemy type, Transistor is aneffective blend of Diablo's isometric 2.5-Dengine and a profound story which givesBioshock Infinite a run for its money.The mysterious narrator of the game givesexposition in dulcet tones that makes Summer-Rain swoon dreamily. Trapped asa disembodied consciousness after savingthe player character, a starlet known as'Red', you embark on a quest to recoverRed's stolen voice and bring to justicethose who murdered her boyfriend.Along the way, the titular sword whereRed's dead number 1 fan and boyfriend,the Transistor; can be outfitted withvarious upgrades, upgrades which areavailable as more characters die aroundyou and more bosses are vanquished.Summer-Rain holds your arm as youhelp Red avoid a gigantic, nanite-basedsuperweapon-gone-wrong known simplyas 'The Spine', a metaphor and referenceto Transistor's world lore of  'The Spineof the World' and one of Red's own solonumbers, 'The Spine'.""Don't die."" Summer-Rain says, lookingat you with a mix of fear and desperation.""The story is so good. I want to- I need tosee the end, Starboy."" You nod once.""Don't worry, Summer. I won't. Andwhatever you do... don't let go."" Summer-Rain catches the Transistor'sdialogue reference and smirks slightly before leaning her head against your shoulders, and you enter one of the different stages to battle The Spineitself. You manage a small smile inreturn, both of you feeling just like howRed and the Transistor feel, togetheralways, back-to-back against the world.When all is said and done and the storyends, both you and Summer-Rain feelthe tears run down both your cheeks.The world is saved, at terrible cost, butall that transpired in Transistor madeabsolute sense and nothing felt forcedor left-field. Extensive enemy stagesand 'Danger Room'-eque scenarios,along with varying difficulty levelsand damage multipliers allow for ahealthy amount of replay value. You look back at Summer-Rain andsee that your mouth is partially agape,before she smiles sheepishly and closesyour own mouth too. Blinking the tearsaway from the touching ending and theemotional roller-coaster that disguiseditself as a game, you turn off the PCand have a quick shower before bed,Summer-Rain joining you.""You know..."" Summer-Rain starts,clad in nothing but a towel with her hairwet and shining as she dries you off. ""That was one of the best games I'veever seen you play."" You turn back toSummer-Rain, putting your hands onher hips. ""But you didn't play..."" Youanswer, tugging away at the towelwrapping Summer-Rain's form.She smiles her signature smile,before gesturing you to dim the lightswhile undoing her towel. ""SometimesStarboy... sometimes you're just content with watching.""TRANSISTOR. "

												This is a Sci-Fi Tactical RPG set in the luxurious neighborhood of a city. The RPG part is the usual leveling and acquiring of various attacks and abilities. The tactical side has you planning your moves and attacks during your 'turn' and during 'their turn' you run away. An interesting aspect in this game is that any ability can be used as an active ability, A passive ability or as an enhancement to an active ability. Gives a lot of different combinations to play with and the game encourages you to try them all out. It's also the main reason I'm considering playing again immediately. Something I rarely do. Story wise, You're Red, A super pop star, and something bad happens. Fortunately your over-sized all-purpose weapon talks to you and fills you in on what's going on. Well, The talking stick doesn't tell you everything. A lot of background is given through text and I found the setting it painted compelling. So much so that I wanted to explore and experience more of the city. I kind of interpreted that as a reflection of Reds' yearning for a part of her life that has been interrupted. I saw the fatalistic vibe as Reds' also.Visually the city is pleasing, clean and precise. While the more personal moments are done in a nice watercolor style. The music, Except for one stand out song, seems mostly ambient. Though there are some excellent subtle things done to the music, I wished it wasn't so subtle. Something to save for the next game perhaps.Overall, While the gameplay is excellent, The narrative seems more like an interesting experiment if not entirely successful. But I'll be there for SuperGiants next game sight unseen.			"

												I've been thinking for some time that cinema is leaving the spot open for new ways of storytelling. Videogames have tried to take that spot over the years, ofering now a great tool for writers and devs to reach their audience in ways movies can't. This level of inmersion is often used to put the player in other character's shoes, offering experiences with more or less background. Transistor favours the storytelling in spite of some of this inmersion, making the player an observer, not giving you absolute control, getting carried by the events, giving  you a broader view of what it has to deliver. And what a way to deliver it.Transistor executes flawlessly everything it attempts. It doesn't offer you the latest in graphics, the best music or the most action-packed gameplay, but it makes sure you enjoy every last bit of it. Don't take me wrong, the hand drawn graphics look gorgeous, the music is great and the gameplay is very, very enjoyable, but it's the way it delivers it to the player, what makes Transistor one of the very best games I've ever played. And I've been around since the 80's.The game takes all the good things from Bastion, all kinds of influences from our day, and builds a vivid, original world, so full of life and personality it makes everything else look so run-of-the-mill, so old and used. It tells the oldest Story ever told, a Tragedy. But it's the characters, the world they inhabit, the references to our world, the little details, the pauses, the many readings anyone can take from this story... It's more than just a game, just a story. It's an interactive piece of art.To sum it all up, don't miss this experience if you're looking for something else than quick, mindless fun in a game, because you'll be missing a classic. This game is gonna be high up in the history of videogames, at least as one of those ""hidden gems"", and will bring you memories (and probably a smile) when you stumble upon it in some years. Indie games are offering new, fresh, great ideas and masterpieces like Transistor only proves that it's a very good time to be a gamer, enjoy it while it lasts.			"

												Play this if you love music and art; if you think that videogames are much more than just easy entertainment; if you want another one of those unforgettable experiences in your life. And finally, play this if you thought those thing I've said about Bastion.I recommend to beat it twice in order to complete all the achievements and unlock all the info of the characters. The story has a clear simbolism and opens a long debate about existentialism. If you are able to see this, then you can give this game a 10/10 because it really deserves it. And about the soundtrack. Wow. Much more than videogame music if you ask me. One of the best indie games of all time, and actually the best of 2014. ""See you in the country, Mr. Bike.""			"

												I...I don't really know where to start with this so I'll try to keep it short. When the discussion of ""games as art"" comes up, this should be at or near the start of the conversation. Transistor is breathtakingly beautiful. It's one of the most realized and striking art directions I have ever seen in a game. The gameplay is rewarding and the story is fantastic if you're want to learn more about it.I loved Bastion, but this may beat it in my eyes. Transistor deserves all the accolades it has recieved and should be experienced by everyone. An all-time great for me.			"

												I've barely started playing this game, and I'm already feeling sorry that I will finish it soon -- game's THAT good.Simply put, it's an upgraded version of the Bastion -- with even better graphics, sounds (and music too!) and script.The core gameplay is decent too, one can describe it as ""platformer meets hack'n'slash meets Final Fantasy"". UI has some issues, though -- you'll encounter them when you'll be trying to customize your loadout. But nevertheless, game is extremely good -- must have, if you ask me.I'd rate the game 9.5 out of 10.0, a must buy.			"

												I was pretty excited for this game.  It's an action RPG.  developed by the same guys who developed Bastion.  Nice art style.  So, when it went on sale, I snatched it up right away.Overall, I was pretty disappointed.  I found the gameplay very repetitive, the action very underwhelming, the story bland and  on the whole very short and unchallenging.  There was a lack of enemy variety, and no real strategy needed to get by them.  Bosses were kind of a pushover too.  Even tho I found this game disappointing, I'll likely give future games from the developer a shot.  Despite my complaints listed above, I enjoyed the actual gameplay mechanics.  The upgrade system was kinda neat and I liked testing out different combinations of attacks you get.  Controls were decently responsive and fluid enough for purpose.  Some other pros are the art style and music.  But, graphics and music don't make a game.  I feel it's more or less wasted here.To wrap it up.   While the gameplay mechanics, art and music were great.  The repetition, weak challenge, and bland story (no real character development either?) dragged it all down to create a forgettable experience.  One little unrelated complaint too.  The guy trapped in the transistor just never shuts up.  I get it's supposed to be a narrative.   But, holy hell..  a line between narrative and constant irritating rambling blurred together here. "

												If you liked Bastion, you should buy Transistor.If you like heartrendingly beautiful games, you should buy Transistor.If you like games that constantly force you to adapt and reevaluate how you're approaching a challenge, you should buy Transistor.If you're a human being, you should buy Transistor.In all seriousness, coming to Transistor from Bastion, I was a little worried. Bastion had extremely tight and hugely enjoyable gameplay, and it seemed like Transistor was discarding that for a slowed down, more strategic approach. I could not have been any more wrong. Transistor provides a system that is pretty easy to learn and grows in complexity and versatility as you progress, allowing you to really tailor your abilities to how you want to play. Unused abilities become modifiers for your equipped abilities or modifiers for your character herself, allowing you to constantly alter your playstyle. You pick the pace at which you fight, choosing whether to focus on fighting in real time, or relying more on using the “time freeze” mechanic to stop time and allow you to plan a whole flurry of attacks in quick succession.Regardless of this flexibility in playstyle, if your health hits zero, instead of dying and starting over, you lose one of your abilities randomly. This serves an elegant two fold purpose. On one hand, it provides punishment for the player who failed to stay alive, removing an ability that that player specifically wanted to use. On the other hand, because that ability is now removed from the game for a while, the player is forced to mix and match and experiment with whatever abilities are left in the ability pool. To stay alive, the player must adapt.And there is some satisfaction to be had from being forced to adapt. By forcing your hand, Transistor challenges your creativity, your willingness to change the way you think or to try something new. It sits on the precipice of balancing hugely gratifying gameplay with a breathtaking world and a resonating story, and does not disappoint.You should probably go buy it.			"

												The first thing I did once I played 10-20 mins wasTab out → click on store → search for: Transistor Soundtrack → tab back to game →   continue playing.for real, the soundtrack is one of the best things I've ever had the pleasure to listen to in my life.(you can unlock most of the soundtrack for free inside the game if you beat some optional tests)The art and textures of the game are just divine, no words.The combat system is pretty unique since you can do a mix of going for ''turn based'' combat or free combat.the skills you unlock are also optional and there's an ''unlimited'' combinations since every skill you unlock you can use it as a passive skill or as a passive skill for skill.and the last thingThe Story, the story is more more deep than it looks like, and I encorage you that once you ''end'' the game, search it up and look it from a different point of view.It's been a long since a game didnt make me feel like this, being more clear since I end Portal 2 (wich was 2 years ago).the chills were racing all over me....while playing Transistor.

												Listen, I loved Bastion to no end and I was extremely hyped for this game. I'll start with the pros for this game:- Incredible ost. It's so damn good I bought it here on steam, because I want to listen it again and again- Great art style. Character design and lighting in particular are fantastic, but even the transition drawings used as cutscenes are a wonder to look at- Really fun to play around with your skills. There are plenty of different skills and all can be active, passive or secondary, which means lots of combinations and lots of possibilities- Great sense of atmosphere and overall interesting charactersNow for the cons:- Even though I've said the characters are interesting, I've completed the game in 3,7 hours (reading the steam stats of what I've played in the past week, when I decided to make a proper run of the game, not knowing I was already halfway through) That's ridicolously short... I mean, not only it ended quite abruptly, but there really wasn't any time for character development or anything else.- It's fun to play around with skills, but I guess balancing them was really tough. I mean, there are some combos that will make this game so easy it will stop being fun. Example: go to the final boss, select purge as active skill and put the two skills you have from the beginning in its passive slots (breach and pulse I think are the names) Then just spam the skill button. Done.- There's virtually nothing to do beside the main story. Yeah, there's a ""beach"" where you can go and have trials (something similar to the trials in Bastion) but you can unlock only songs in here... that you can only listen to if you stay on the beach. I completed three or four trials and then never went back there.Honestly, if it's on sale, buy it and see by yourself. To me, it was very disappointing			"

												I'm not good at reviews, but I felt that I should write something because I loved this game and I love the people behind Supergiant.  <3Supergiant games did it again!  ^_^ After having fallen in love with Bastion and Supergiant Games, I could not wait for their next release.The only similarities between Bastion and Transistor, however, are.. obviously the art-style, the immersive narration and story, and yet again the amazing soundtrack.  Woot woot, the same narrator from Bastion!The difference: the combat system is not quite the same as Bastion's. It's not so much a hack & slash, as much as it is a *tactical* combat-system game.  Ahh how to explain this..? It's quite unique.There is a 'time-stop' system which allows you to literally -pause- to analyze and plan out your combat moves in advance. Each ability and number of steps you take around the ""field"" require a certain amount of 'energy' - so you are limited by an energy bar and its refresh system.  Therefore, you have to be efficient in not only the abilities you choose, but your movements across the ""combat field"", etc.  It's remniscent of other games to me that I had enjoyed very much.. so that was not an issue for me, personally! -- it was quite a delight. :)What I especially enjoyed was the way that you can experiment with and mix up all the different abilities you pick through leveling up. Each combination results in something different, and you can only have 4 active ones in combat. You can literally mix 2-3 learned abilities together for one unique ability / result - so there are multiple possiblities.  You also have passive ability-slots which you can use those ability cards for, as well, and they play a completely different role.  There is quite a flexible customization system. :)  Also, if / everytime your HP goes to '0' in combat, you lose and are disabled from one of your 4 abilities; which you can only recover at a later time. :o Additionally, if you want to challenge yourself further, you are able to raise the difficulty by implementing an in-game system called ""limiters"" -- a very similar system to Bastion.  The more limiters you use, the more rewards (more xp). Funfun!All in all, I loved the game so much that I took my time with it and did not want to rush through it.  I recommend that you don't either to enjoy the narration, soundtrack, and immersiveness for the total experience. Luckily, there is an option for a second playthrough so you can have the opportunity to level up some more and unlock abilities you had missed out on before and try different combinations! :)			"

												tldr I  cant recommend enough both bastion and transistor-they are @ 80% off for the weekend and they re  a steal for that price---I just finished transistor twice, and i loved it-fantastic art awesome soundtrack and unique setting--it feels alot like its bastions dark alter ego.at first mechanics may seem bit strange, but make sense after a while. sidenote- achievements in both games are very fun and challenging and actually add to the experience- so dont rush these games, do your 2 playthroughs (you retain level and gear for the 2nd) ) and  grab them all-- PS i used controller so i have no idea how they play with k/b + mouse			"

												This game was an unbelievably vast piece of coolness at first, and quietly escalated to an emotional blast throughout the process.Narrator sounds like a piece of perfect bacon telling how it was sweetly grilled. Music was good, the kinds that made me jealous, which by the end, becomes something so strong that it has its own voice, watches you play, takes care of the characters.No need to describe the graphics with words. You heard of it. You can see it for yourself. All of the elements are so tremendously glued together that even thinking about there were these talented human beans working in a small team makes me want to bang my head to the wall because apparently I've been living in hell.

												Well... I'm not very good at writing reviews, but here we go...When had my first touch with Transistor i already heard some good reviews about this game. But when i started to play, and i was going deeper and deeper, i knew that this game deserve for those good opinions.But let's start from the begining. Transistor is a typical arkade RPG, where we will try to find a previous users of the sword (Transistor) and try to discover the true Transistor's destiny. To do that we will have to defeat a whole armies of enemies which we will have to stand and fight with them. Yeah, fight system in this game is just great! We have a lot of various skills that we can combine with each other to gain a brand new skill! Isn't it just great? But let's go forward. Through the game i have made a lot of screen shots, more than i'm usualy making during a game, becouse this game have an awesome audiovisual layer, it's more like an art not a game. I love the songs composed by Darren Korb and Ashleu Barrett it just fit great in the game, i literaly can lisen a soundtrack a whole hours. The storyline is also a strong part of Transisotr, i remember that when i was finishing the game it felt like - WHAT? WHAAAT? Wow, this game is awesome! Well... after all, do i recomend the game? Definitly - yes! One of my fav game so far. 10/10			"

												If you played Bastion, I guess you already own Transistor. What? Not yet! Well it is not too late. You will enjoy listening to the narrator voice again and the music is once again wonderful. The gameplay is slightly different this time but very interesting, though a bit repetitive on your second playthrough. Supergiant managed to create just what you need as a gamer. No superficial introduction. You just press a button and the game begins. You slowly level up and become stronger but the limiters keep the game balanced. The configuration of the buttons is up to you and let you adapt your play style according to what you want to do or your enemies.Just come and experience Red's story...			"

			Transistor: Impressions Transistor is Super Giant Game's 2nd game, and their first game being Bastion, it has a lot of live upto.		

The above is my impressions of the game. Transistor is Super Giant's 2nd game. The first one being Bastion, this game has big shoes to fill. Lucky for us, Transistor is every thing we expected from the creators of Bastion, with a few nuggets of surprise thrown in.Transistor, like Bastion, is a top down isometric RPG, that features amazing visuals and audio. Unlike Bastion, Transistor is a pseudo-Turn based RPG, the melds turn based mechanics with real time combat. The combat system overall feels familiar, but fresh, and original at the same time.I think it goes with out saying, that this game is gorgeous in every was possible. Amazing illustrations, backgrounds, composition, color pallet, and the sound design matches the visual in quality. It's just a top shelf experience that you won't find in other games.All this is great, but keep in mind that Transistor is fairly short, and there's not a lot of incentive to come back to the game other than the possibility that you'll like it enough for a 2nd play through. So for those who are feature, or length centric, consider this your warning. But do keep in mind, when approaching games like Transistor, you're not paying for the amount of game you get, but the quality of game you'll get to experience. Pros:- Incredible quality in visual and audio- Unique blend of game mechanics- Piles of attention to detail- An experience all gamer's should haveCons:- A little short- Very light on content			"

												Supergiant Games is back to challenge anybody who thinks this medium isn't ready to be called art.This is a beautiful, engrossing game. The oversaturated, colorful art style combined with the ethereal soundtrack provide an incredible feel for the game. The art is incredibly colorful, ranging from extremely warm to extremely cool, and it's all hand-painted. The ""cutscenes"" (if you can refer to them as that) are incredibly beautiful, and prompted me to take several screenshots in order to preserve them. Red's character design is excellent, and the enemy models and city are both really creative and interesting. A lot of cyberpunk art is cool, hard, metallic; you don't see that here. There's a lot of blur, a lot of soft edges, a ton of bloom. It's a game bursting with color.If you've read any of my other reviews, you already know that music and sound design play a big part in shaping the experience for me. This game has both in spades. The excellent soundtrack ranges from jazzy and uptempo, to soft and bluesy, to straight downtempo ambient. The sound design is utterly phenomenal. When paused, the game continues playing the background music, but at a slower tempo, and muffled, as if  it were being played inside a car next to you with all of the windows and doors sealed tightly. Click out of the game's window, and you get a very quiet, bassy hum in the background. I've got the game paused in another window as I type this review, and I feel the quiet bass rattling on and off in the cans even now. It's a really phenomenal effect. Whoever worked sound on this title definitely earned their wages. There's also an extremely simple, yet very likeable feature that causes Red to hum along to the background music merely by holding down a button. This is just as simple as it sounds, yet I found myself sitting for minutes on end with the left bumper on my controller compressed; mesmerized and staring into my screen as my focus slowly deteriorated.I feel like I'm floating in a hot tub while on drugs when I play Transistor. It's that kind of game.As someone with an overclocked 1440p display the lone criticism I have with the game is the lack of 1440p support, but this qualm is rendered moot by the fact that these are hand-painted designs. It's difficult to justify creating these designs with a 1440p resolution in mind considering how small of a userbase it is, so I can forgive Supergiant for locking the display at 1080p. That's what the art looks best at, and I experienced the game at this resolution in windowed mode.It has a voice acting schtick similar to the narrator in Bastion, though in Transistor it takes the form of a speaking sword rather than a narrator. So if you liked that kind of thing in Bastion, you'll like it here. The voice acting is very well-done, but it rubs me a bit wrongly; about half of the lines feel like they're jammed into the game in a very hamfisted manner. I seem to be the only one who felt that way about Bastion, though, so take this criticism of Transistor for what it's worth.The core gameplay is your basic isometric action RPG stuff with a couple of neat concepts thrown in. The ability to pause the game and plot out your next actions -- which happen extremely quickly and automatically once you unpause -- is a key aspect in what keeps the combat from becoming a bit stale. There were plenty of times when I felt I didn't have enough control over where my attacks were headed. Certain ""functions"", as the game calls your attacking skills, felt like they were a bit too hard to properly line up, and as a result I frequently missed some enemies I should have been hitting. But the nifty pausing function takes care of most of it, and it looks really cool. It makes you feel like the badass that Red is supposed to be.The other thing I really liked, and the thing that kept me playing most, was the ability to junction functions into each other in order to modify their actions. You have a set amount of function attack and actions and only four slots in which to place them. Each function has an active ability that becomes usable when placed, but they also have a specific modifying ability when junctioned into another active function. This all seems complicated when I write it out, but it's really fairly easy to understand in the game; no tutorial is really necessary after a few minutes of tinkering with it. The combinations are almost literally endless, and I found myself constantly resetting them in order to try new ones. It really adds some meat and some depth to a game that I felt would have easily succeeded on its artistic merits without these systems.In conclusion, I'd say this game is worth a few hours of play simply for the art style and the soundtrack. But the neat combat and function features here will keep you coming back for far longer than that. This is a very worthwhile experience and Supergiant Games continues to offer some really unique, polished, artistic gaming experiences.			"

												I feel like I just started this game and it's already over. Not because it was a magical journey full of adventure but because it was so short and I saw so little. Most of the gameplay was in the little sandbox area with the progressively more difficult challenges. Carries a lot of the more subtle aspects from Bastion (one chocolate velvet voice talks to you, similar artstyle and music, similar storytelling mechanics). The narration is a bit more creepy though since it's your sword talking and it's hitting on you, not even in an overtly hilarious machismo way either. Imagine swinging groose around as he yelled ""THE GROOSE IS LOOSE""  and other hilarious one liners while you pummeled your enemies. Also the protagonist needed to be more attractive. You can't depict a futuristic pop idol without making her look F-I-N-E, but the devs were probably ♥♥♥♥♥whipped into making her look normal as to not offend the types of idiots who get pissy at spiderman alt cover comics. Gameplay. Isometric hack and slash with an ever increasing number of attacks and methods for combining aspects of said attacks with others. Difficulty enables you to make the enemies arbitrarily more challenging to dispatch (rewarding you with more exp). This part was wonderful in that you weren't constantly just using the one newly acquired better-than-what-you-had-before weapon like in Bastion (you would pretty much never want to use the early weps end game but here they're still useful in tandem with other weapons). It's pretty good but there's an underlying tone that has me wanting to avoid starting this game up. Once it's going I naturally progress but just starting it is so trying.			"

												This is one of those games that you play with your heart, you feel the characters you feel the dev's hard work that they made in this incredible game, you just feel it.Transistor is the bastion successor as some said, and man i love both games.It is quite similar to bastion in a lot of aspects, but this game is more dark and relies on strategy and planning more than action and slashing ( bastion) A very beautiful heartbreaking teardropping story with an outstanding voice performance, honestly could not expect less from the same team that made Bastion with that amazing narrating style...I like that how in this game the narrator is talking with you, all the game staying by your-side, and the ending was .. lets just say i cried and no spoilers..Amazing graphics and artwork just look at that its like an animated master piece put together with codes to make it into the beautiful game it is now.... its like plugging your Keyboard+mouse or controller into a painting... very beautiful it moves me.This is the ONLY game in my entire steam library that i just HAD to buy the Soundtrack... it is so incredible i love it, i listen to it all the time while doing everything its so relaxing and soothing it made the game much more perfect it hit the roof.Amazing character designs each with its own background story that you keep playing to unlock, outstanding details all over it.Very unique 2-ways battle system, planning turns and using spells real-time.A great set of Abilities ( Functions ) that unlocks as you play and level up, each can be used as a main or inserted in another to upgrade it or used as a passive effect, and in each of those 3 it gets a different ability and status changes, it is really well-done  you can customize the functions to get the most of your abilities and to strategies your movements and make turns to kill the enemies.Like bastion this game can get harder ( in bastion you use Invokes in this game you use Limiters ) Giving more exp and making the game much harder, giving monsters perks and so on.Just circle around the screenshots on this page, and just look at them, the game's price is too low for this kind of art .... you go deep through it and experience it all as you play it is a very beautiful experience to have this game like my friend said "" You're in for a treat"" when i said i got the game, and boy as he so rightTL;DRAn outstanding Action adventure with perfect atmospheres and soundtracks and customize able abilities set that grows bigger as you play and more advanced, with great strategy battle system and a very challenging gameplayPros : 1 - Perfect soundtracks and atmosphere 10/10.2 - A very beautiful story and narrator style 9/10.3 - A set of abilities that can be customized and set as upgrades of passive effects with in-depth planning 10/104 - Beautiful artwork and character designs and backgrounds 10/105 - Unique game-play and unlockables all over the game with good achievements 9/106 - Many called this short game but it took me 7 hours to finish the game with 36% achievements, and it will take another 7 hours to get the NG+ and other unlockables.Cons : 1 - Not a con in the game itself but in the gamers, no i'm not offending them at all no, its just many assumed that the game's story is deluded, But it can be explained a lot by unlocking the characters background stories and reading them, just listen and read and you will understand a lot and it has some plot-twists that left for the gamer to find out.2 - Several friends had some performance issues and complained that the game does not have any graphics settings just resolution, i kinda agree although i had no problems with a low-end laptop but i can see their point.If you liked bastion i highly recommend this game.This game's story is darker than bastion, and you need to unlock stuff to figure out the missing pieces and put them together to get it all as a whole picture.I am really glad i picked this game, had a wonderful time playing it over-all rating 9/10			"

												So, the most asked question first - Is this Bastion 2? Absolutely not!Transistor has a few things in common with Bastion - Great voiceover, compelling world and story that reveals itself through the narrative, the solitude of the main character, interesting art style and unique enemies and the combat is similar (yet at the same time completely different).Transistor is beautiful (if you like this animation style), the music of the game is simply fantastic and the story flows well towards the inevitable conclution. The fighting is innovative and clever and makes you want to try out all the combinations.The game is not without flaws though - it is highly linear and constantly pushes you through the quite short story arc. Exploration is not really present so if you want to rush through the game you can do so quite fast.Is the game worth buying? Yes! Especially for the price point of this game I highly recommend it!

You might like if: You enjoyed, not only the gameplay, but the story and experience of Bastion (Supergiant Games' much acclaimed title before this one). I'd recommend checking that one out first if you haven't.This is an artistic experience more than a game.I know, I know... what the heck does that even mean...Transistor's strength lies in the way the story unfolds. The plot (and its twists) are excellent, the characters brilliantly designed and the visuals are outstanding (pretty much what we've come to expect from Supergiant games after Bastion). The combat is clever and good fun... but not ultimately what you keep coming back for.And therein lies the one downside... the story is a bit short. It's not the fastest game to get into, and by the time you're hooked and going ""hey, y'know what... this is getting pretty good"" - It's actually drawing to a close. Slight shame, but still 10 very worthwhile hours (There is technically newgame+, but that has less appeal for me)On the plus-side, at least the enemies also get stronger in NG+, so it's not like Bastion where you replay and just stomp everything flat with super-powered weapons. If you like the combat and challenge, that at least continues to deliver through the second iteration.The combat itself is refreshingly unique. It's essentially about using Fallout-esque 'planning' time to compile devestating combos - combining strategy to an otherwise innocuous hack-and-slash. Throughout the game you acquire 'functions' which can basically be applied in one of three ways... as a 'move', to provide an added-effect to a move, or to apply a passive bonus. Bear in mind, you can only apply a function once and are limited to how many are in play - so there's a lot of variety to be had. You're encouraged to try out different combos (by unlocking backstory as you do) and the game is thankfully forgiving enough to let you experiment (i.e. there is no single 'correct' combo). It's fun enough but, as mentioned before, only goes so far in keeping the game interesting.The gem is really the narrator again. Combining authorititive guidance with human touches of humour, emotion and vulnerability; it adds warmth to an otherwise (intentionally) structured, robotic setting. The part where he's spaced out is particularly entertaining (I lost it at ""hey... that's not a bike..."" and was too busy chuckling to realise I was dangerously low on HP).If you enjoyed the experience of Bastion (not just the gameplay) - This should be well worth checking out			"

												Transistor is a game developed by Supergiant Games, who are well known for their stylistic action game Bastion.  Transistor definitely borrows from Bastion's strongest suits; notably it is brilliantly compsed and absolutely beautiful.  The story is extremely esoteric (certainly moreso than Bastion), but not unsatisifying.  Where it differs from Bastion is mostly in gameplay; Transistor still is still an action/RPG where you traverse levels, attack bad guys, and level up, but the game plays much slower almost as a strategy game would.  Enemy encounters are isolated and you can use a ""Turn"" to essentially stop time and plan out your attacks, which will then carry out in nearly zero time.  Just like Bastion, you're offered a plethora of ways to deal with enemies.  Instead of weapons, you use ""functions"", which are essentially castable spells and abilities   Each ability can combo with other abilities to alter them, or can be used in a passive slot to provide a permanent buff.  The result is an insane amount of combinations, and you are incentivied to explore them because using abilities in different ways unlocks more information about the story and the characters which are a part of it.  In Bastion I found myself finding a weapon that I really liked and sticking with it for the rest of the game (even though many weapons are equally viable).  The story mechanic in Transistor subtlely pushes you to try different combinations, and in doing so, you often stumble into even better combinations that you probably wouldn't have realized existed otherwise.All in all, I highly recommend Transistor.  Most fans of Bastion should enjoy it -- although the amazing art and music is immediately noticable, it is definitely a slower burn in terms of gameplay and the early parts of the game take a little while to get into.  As more abilities and the true nature of the game unveils itself though, it is very well executed and an absolute joy.			"

												This game surprised me to hell and back. Seriously.Word of Note: At the time of writing, I have not beaten the game. This ""Review"" is more of a ""First Impressions"" than a proper review, so please keep in mind that the game may have a few more surprises down the line that may completely change the gameplay or atleast alter it drastically! Review will be updated accordingly after I beat the game if anything new pops up. *I also won't summarize the Premise of the Game's Story as the game itself starts you out completely in the Blank and shows you what happened. Visual-wise, pretty dang amazing, albeit a few scaling issues with buildings and such. This game is the epitome of low-poly modeling and hand painted textures. The enemy models and landscapes are very simple looking as far as modeling goes, but the assets/textures used on everything gives the world life even if the places are deserted, it invokes a tone of lonelyness and helps you figure out somewhat, what exactly happened that there's not a single soul around. When Red moves around and drags the Transistor (Sword) it leaves a trail on the ground that disappears shortly after, but helps mark direction, additionally, some moves can leave holes in the ground depending, and won't disappear until it's replaced by the same ""break' textures elsewhere. Enemies themselves are presented as robotic creatures and are reminiscent of Kingdom Heart's Nobodies in that same way - as creatures sent to hunt your player character, but are mindless in nature. The Soundtrack is also quite a treat! Boasting pretty impressive Lyrical compositions that gives it a bit of a Noire feeling and are pretty well varied. Additionally, Red can hum alongside any given track, effectively making a sort of ""remix"" to that particular song. Soundwork is also pretty well done, the Transistor does it's charging noises, it clings and clangs when slamed unto the ground, there's a subtle noise for steps, for the trail the sword leaves and enemies make their odd creature like noises when they're going after you. Voices are also excellently done. Red doesn't speak, but you can hear her sing in some flashbacks, the Transistor also serves as a sort of narrator to help divulge neat little extras. Something the game does, that I really dig, is that the way he speaks to Red, sort of feels like he's talking to the player aswell, giving it a 4th wall kinda feeling. It's all amazing.The game also fares pretty well, if a little slow and methodical. This is the part that may make or break the game for a lot of people, for sure. Red moves VERY slow, it's done on purpose though, as areas in general are subdivided via ""zones"" and they aren't very large in scale either. The game's Battle Structuring is simple, but feels a tad linear in execution (atleast at the start) where enemies ambush you in certain parts of a Zone but won't respawn after a battle ends and you walk back into the area.Combat is where the gameplay really shines. The battles play out sort of like Crisis Core, once you enter combat mode, you're trapped inside the zone until enemies are defeated. Enemies will be mercilessly going after you, and you have just the one Health Bar to tide you over the entire battle, if your health bar depletes, you will lose a ""Function"" instead of dying. During combat, your attacks depend solely on the Functions you have picked out and set up. Each function, obtained either through finding people that died or leveling has multiple functions. This gives the game a LOT of depth as far as building your character goes. You have 4 main slots to assign a Function too, and those slots have 2 extra slots that you can assign more functions to to power up that function - * * * example: You can have a function that shoots out grenade like particles in an area, you have another function that, by itself, creates a bomb in place that needs to be self detonated, however, you can add that function to the previously mentioned function to add, let's say explosive attributes which come via the way of damage buffs, range buffs, etc * * * You can continously build more and more powerful functions to use to kill your foes, move faster, avoid attacks while dealing damage, etc, there's I believe, TONS of ways to build the character you want and fight the way you want. When fighting, the Combat Areas have little grey squares, these serve as your main method of avoiding attacks. You can destroy these squares yourself or the enemy can. During Major Boss battles, this is very important to keep track of, as bosses can deal a TON of damage and are very patternized. You also have the ""Turn"" Command, which freezes the entire battle field and let's you plan out attacks ahead of time, this can also be used to avoid attacks. The Turn command works via a queing system - Imagine you have a time slider and you're editing it with the stuff you want Red to do, wether it is move away or closer to an enemy, use specific Functions to continously attack an enemy, avoid an enemy, or both. It is, however, not 100% accurate, as while you're in turn mode you continously set Red to Attack the enemy in a specific area, but the enemy CAN still move when combat resumes and avoid your attacks, thus giving the combat a ton of strategic aspects to it. Turn mode is balanced due to the way you're forced to wait until the turn slider returns to normal, when you deplete the Turn Bar, you CANNOT attack or use any function, so keep that in mind always, and don't use Turn Mode haphazardly as it can leave you VERY vulnerable after usage.Pros:+Amazing Soundtrack+Amazing Hand Painted/Digital looking world+Amazing looking Particle effects to compliment the already awesome looking world+Expansive and Deep ""Functions"" System+Amazing Voice Work and Sound Effects.+Surprisingly deep combat with a large strategic element to it.+Communicates it's Atmosphere amazingly.+Great enemy designs help the atmosphere even further.+Surprisingly well designed and written Main Character. Cons-Minor Scaling issues with Buildings and structures-Red moves a little methodical and slow-Combat Structure feels a little linear (At time of Writing)			"

This review is created for  My Curation Page.  Skip to the bottom for my Final ThoughtsTransistor is an isometric hack and slash RPG from the creators of Bastion. You play as a famous singer who lost her voice, and it's all the Process' fault.GraphicsTransistor is one of the most beautiful games I have ever played to date. Everything in the game feels so... alive... Everything is hand painted and looks spectacular, you can really feel the artist's motivation and power. The cutscenes are amazingly well done and really helps you connect with Red, the main character. Everything from the enemies, levels, and even ambient background objects are incredibly detailed. Kudos to the artist(s) for the job well done.Audio & SoundtrackOne of the featured tags on Transistor's store page is Great Soundtrack, and, well, it does indeed have a great soundtrack. Actually, scratch that. It has an incredible soundtrack unmatched by other indie titles. You are Red, a famous singer that actually sings in the soundtrack. The soundtrack is mesmerizing, and the singer for Red did a fabulous job. Sometimes you just have to take a moment and listen to the breathtaking tracks. The voice acting for the Transistor is marvelous as well. You can really hear the passion in the voice of a sentient sword. My favourite line spoken by the Transistor is ""Don't let me go"". The voice actor has a lot of meaning and soft power behind his lines.My only problem with the soundtrack is they didn't use the amazing vocals of Red enough, which makes since if you tie it in with the story.Favourite Track: In CirclesStorylineTransistor is very story rich and deep. You play as Red, a once famous singer with a vengeance against those who stripped her of her beautiful singing voice, and, as I mentioned previously, one that you can actually hear in the soundtrack. You are accompanied by Transistor, a sword that embodies you with the power of a thousand suns as you rain hellfire upon those who wronged you. The cutscenes and news stories supply the perfect amount of exposition for you to understand just what is going on, what happened to Red, and why you have to take your sweet, sweet revenge. GameplayI love the combat in Transistor. You can choose between turn based combat and real time hack and slash. You can carefully plan out your moves in the turn based combat system but you can also fully enjoy your power in the hack and slash mode. You can change out each ability and you can also modify them. There are endless possibilities you can use to exact your revenge. There is a lot of strategy that goes into Transistor. The turn based combat system has a cooldown that leaves you vulnerable to enemies. You have to plan out what abilities and modifiers you use to exploit your enemies weaknesses. Everything, including the realtime hack and slash, has to be planned out in a way that keeps you entertained.Final ThoughtsTransistor is one of my favourite indie games ever with an amazing soundtrack that is incredibly moving. Seriously. Listen to In Circles, which is the best track in my humble opinion. If you enjoy turn based combat, real time hack and slash, deep storylines, and extreme customization, Transistor is definitely for you.Rating:Graphics: 9.2/10Audio: 9.7/10Gameplay: 8.9/10Overall: 9.3/10Enjoy the review?

												Transistor...The next perfect game by Supergiant Games.This time the developers put some more effort into the gameplay than in the story I personally think, but that's no problem at all! Maybe I shouldn't even compare Bastion and Transistor because Supergiant Games might wanted do something different... Anyways. You start right away in middle of the game and the story. The setting is a Sci-Fi world, more precisely I guess it's something like an online world.In Transistor you experience the story chronologically. In the beginning there are some minor gaps, which get filled soon. The story catches you and you want to know what happens next. Nevertheless, to be honest I have to say that I liked the story of Bastion better but the story of this game is not bad at all!The gameplay is quite cool. Transistor's gameplay contain some nice features that underline the story and the atmosphere. That includes electing something on a terminal or some breaks for the protagonist. These breaks are implemented as beautiful pictures.What I liked the most is the combat system.Time to time you get more attacks and can combine these like you want. This mixing provides a great variety to fighting in Transistor. Also, there is a ""plan mode"" in which you can plan moves and then perform then fast. That looks very cool and is fun too.Lastly, you can, as well as in Bastion, increase the difficulty on your own.Supergiant Games games always catch you with their atmosphere so I didn't write anything about the atmosphere here.Okay, I can not write this review without mentioning Darren Korb and his great job on composing marvellous songs for this game. The music matches perfectly to the game and is an essential part of it, just like in Bastion.I come to the conclusion that Transistor is another awesome game by Supergiant Games. It's a perfect game that doesn't need improvements at all! If you liked Bastion or you want to play something different but brilliant buy Transistor now!			"

												Oh, Transistor. I went into this game assuming it was, like so many have said, a mere 6 hour jaunt. The impression often given is that that's all there is to Transistor; sure, it's visually and musically stunning, and its narrative is engaging, but ultimately many will say that 6 hours (give or take an hour) is all there is to it. I disagree, and not just because subjective, arbitrarily determined gameplay durations are generally a poor gauge of quality game content in the first place.My first playthrough took me about 11 hours, 12 if you count my various AFK'ing and tabbing out pauses. However, I didn't just play through the story from start to finish. I completed the extra challenge ""tests"" that introduced me to abilities I may not have realized were useful otherwise; I explored every area, read news terminals, and unlocked some of the additional ""function"" (ability) file details. All of these served to greatly expand my understanding of the game's setting and characters. It is this that gets me to the point of my review. There is more to Transistor than just the story that's on the surface. Just getting to the ""end"" of the game will not give you an explicit understanding of its story.Meticulously placed throughout the beautiful environments, the well-voiced dialogue, the amazing music -- even some of the function names -- are subtle hints, easter eggs, and pointers to details about the game's setting, story and characters that are often not addressed directly anywhere else. This game is very much about (subtly) showing you, NOT outright telling you. Days after I had first beaten the game, I was still going through my screenshots, still pondering the meaning behind some of the music's lyrics, and still reading others' interpretations. This was all in an attempt to absorb more of what the game has to offer, to gain even more insight into perhaps the best, most enjoyable and satisfying aspect of the game for me -- what was NOT said, what was NOT blatantly pointed out, and was instead left there for me to find on my own or to speculate about later. And my second playthrough... well. I don't think I've ever jumped right back into a game for a new playthrough so soon after finishing it. And then even the fact that the game's ""new game+"" option was instead referred to as a ""recursion"" turned out to have some significance.So yes, the game's art style is gorgeous. Its soundtrack is one of the best game soundtracks I've ever listened to. Its combat system is intricate and greatly rewards planning ahead and experimenting. It is all of these things, and you can go through a straight start-to-finish playthrough and enjoy every bit of that. But if you're the type of player who likes to ask a lot of questions about the specifics of a game's plot or characters, who isn't always merely satisfied with the obvious, and who appreciates a game that lets you connect some of the dots on your own, you'll very likely get even more out of Transistor than you thought you would. P.S.: Yes, the soundtrack is absolutely worth purchasing. Do it!			"

												Wonderful game. Very nicely done.Never played the previous game ""Bastion"", but after playing this I may have to pick it up, too.Well in this game you are controlling Red. Explore the cloudbank and fight against evil process using functions. You can and have to combine your various functions to get the best from your character.Story is not too hard, the first level are challenging, because you don't have many functions. You can even start a NG+ to start over with more functions.During your visit, you can do some ""tests"". Basicly they are challenges to teach you a better way to use your abilities. They are easy, except the performance tests. If you want to 100% the game you will need some time to practice those :DCan recommend it to everybody. Oh and almost forget: The soundtrack is awesome.

This analysis essay criticizes the vagueness of the plot and character details in Supergiant Games' otherwise magnificent game Transistor.[. . .] It would be boring for me to simply say that Supergiant Games' Transistor is a gorgeous-looking, wonderfully designed, mechanically fun, and brilliantly soundtracked title, even though all of that is true. It would be less boring, I feel, to discuss the one area of the game that I am inclined to critique: Transistor's plot. [. . .][Click here to continue reading this article][thegemsbok.com] "

												You're probably aware that this is a beautiful game (nobody reads reviews before watching the trailer, right?), and it is BEAUTIFUL, the art and the songs. I see that most reviewers mention that and that the story is cool, but not so many people emphasize this enough:This is one of the best combat systems you'll find aroundDuring combat you use your skills (therein called ""functions""), run around and etc... but you also have a ""turn bar"" that when fills up, allows you to ""pause"" the fight; it sort of allows you to ""script"" what you're going to do next. You have a certain number of ""turn points"" to spend on using skills and moving around. Once you're done, you ""unpause"" and your character will ""run the script"".That idea in itself is worth the game, really. But there is more.The skills are AWESOME. There are 16 ""only"", but they are VERY DIFFERENT. ""Bounce"" hits the target and ricochets around; ""Breach"" has a long range and pierces the target and walls. ""Crash"" causes little damage, but stuns the target, which increases the next damage; ""Void"" does not cause any damage, but increase the damage for the next few seconds. Now, these are their Active function; skills can be used in Passive mode as well - which give you some bonus or protection - or be Combined (in the game its called ""upgrade"") e.g. Breach + (Bounce + Crash) will pierce through targets in a straight line, but also ricochet and stun. Mind you, Bounce + (Breach + Crash) is not the same thing, nor is Crash + (Breach +  Bounce).The combinations and possibilities for combos are so overhelming that I've finished the game twice and never settled down for one single combo line, always changing. The combat system is just plain amazing.Finally, another reason to buy this game: it is a Supergiant Game. These guys are one of the best small studio I've seen around, professional products released in mature state, also customer support was great when I needed. Back these guys as much as you can, they deserve it.			"

												The Transistor is a story about love, melancholy and genuine grief. It's about a man and a woman who are in love, and who readily sacrifice for their feelings. This is immensely appealing. If you are looking for an escape to a dark and gloomy world, which can suprisingly be also dangerously calm and rumanitive, then you might have just found your thing. Highly recommended. 4/5			"

												Transistor is a great game with a creative battle system where you are given many options to fit your own playstyle. The Story of the game is also very interesting but you have to pay attention since it's non expository. The Atmosphere of the game is calm and a bit gloomy which the Artstyle complements. And the Soundtrack is really good.All in all in great game 9/10			"

												Transistor is a good game, and it is worth playing. I beat it in around ~5 hours.It is truly beautiful, both for the ears, and for the eyes. It really sucks you into a fantastic looking world, that leaves you silently thinking back on it once you've finished it. Artistically, the game is amazing.However, the combat is just average. It's interesting, and kind of unique, mixing real time combat with some turn based element (being able to freeze everything to plan a move), but it gets repetitive, as the enemies don't feel that varied, and you end up mostly running in circles while your action bar is recharging. Also, you often have to wait a few seconds extra after each fight is done just so one of your skills comes off cool down, so that you can grab the monster EXP that's shield protected. If there were more fights like the final boss, it would feel more rewarding to play it.The story is vaguely interesting, and unique - but not thrilling. I feel that if the combat and story were just a bit better, the game would be a masterpiece, instead of simply being a good game.Still, Transistor is a unique experience that is worth living :steamhappy:			"

												This game is sick, I personally enjoyed it.  Graphics, gameplay, controls are very good.  I would rate the game 9/10 because its kinda short, 4-5 hours but if you play the extra challenges and go for a second run then it will be more hours, no duhhh.Like the idea of mixing your power up perks, not really a based turn game in a way.  You got limited mobility (dont get me wrong you can still move, but when planning your attack you have limited time) which you should take advantage and plan your attack, you cant spam your power ups.  Each power up has different abilities, it can serve straight up as a power up or serve as an attachment or as a passive perk.  Mixing your power ups is part of the fun, you can become badass if you used them well.  ""With power, comes great responsibility.""Overall game is very balance, kinda short (hoping future DLC can change that), OST is amazing, graphics are great.  Final rating 9/10, would highly recommend.			"

												Got it on fall sale. This game is very good, it's the same developer who created bastion years ago. But the gameplay is very different. You need to plan your move and then execute them, Bastion is basically hack and slash, so if you are expecting bastion-ish game here, I don't think it has that similarity in core-gameplaypro:- great music- great voice acting- great environtment- great battle systemcon:- i don't get the story.. it's more surreal than bastion, sci-fi fantasy thing that I don't understand the time and place- short.. really short if you see my playtime, I've been idle for like 10 hours, so only ~8 hours of playing. I wished they add place as HQ and we could choose place to add replay factor- too linear. you play FFXIII? the gameplay is similar before you reach grand pulse, just beat those things and move forwardthe dev implement challenge that somehow reminds me with bastion, the game doesn't ask you to play easy, normal hard like other games, but they give you perks to you could choose to boost your exp but make the gameplay harder.spoiler:I like part of the game that the ending scene is similar to beginning scene! reminds me of brother tale of two sons I recommended this game, better to wait when it's 50% off. It's winter sale when I'm writing this			"

												Transistor is a smart action-RPG gameplay that uses your intelligence and tactics of how you play, fight and move on the battlefield when the enemies spawn. If you played Bastion, then you will find that this game visual graphic will be similar of it’s heavily influenced by the expressive character design of classic anime. Its a very beautiful visual art for a science fiction world. Music is absolutely beautiful with its Jazz smooth feeling. If you have bought the Soundtrack, don't listen to it 1st before playing the game as you might ruin your experience when going though the game. The story is also very interesting as you play as ""Red"" who lost her voice and its up to you to get it back. The game has a lot of replay value with New Game+ as when in combat, you get to experiment of how you will take to the field. Lving up will get you to choose different abilities and at one point the ability to fully respec your character at any checkpoint.			"

												The first playthrough for me took about 7.3 hours, despite the fact that I skipped the last challenge room. The whole atmosphere constructed by the art and soundtrack is very immersive. The whole story came together beautifully.Gameplay:	It's an interesting take on giving players a choice between etiher real-time womanliness combat (which I'm not woman enough to do) or ""halting time"" so you can plan out a series of executions (use a skill, move, use a skill, use a skill, move, etc.), and even a mix of both. Have to admit though, the controls on the keyboard aren't too great, and while it isn't a huge issue, I am more inclinded to use the plan-it-out option in fights just to make sure I hit the right things.Art:What can I say? It's beautiful. It's breathtaking. It looks like it was a hell-of-lot of work to do, so kudos to the art team. It's really amazing.Soundtrack:For me, the fantastic song ""We All Become"" featured in the reveal trailer stands out the most. Yet, it and every soundtrack/song mixed into the Transistor experience are all really, really well done.Storyline/Immersion:I have yet to complete the storyline, but the whole game comes together well. The world is given life and the characters given silent voices. While the story isn't told in a straightforward manner, having the player piece it together on her/his own is a nice variation.Transistor is a phenomal work of art that everyone should experience. 10/10.

												A gorgeous and fairly short adventure that is probably more enjoyable on a second playthrough once you fully understand the mechanics and world that the game exhibits. By the time I properly had a grasp on the combat and began to learn its ins-and-outs, I was only a couple hours off from the ending. I also didn't do many of the optional challenge rooms, as I figured I should save them for a second or third playthrough. Through a fantastic use of colour, light and music, Transistor's aesthetics wonderfully inform its narrative for a climactic and bittersweet final chapter that made my opinion of the game increase dramatically. I bought this on sale for $5 and certainly do not regret it. It's great to see games that not only have a good story and good gameplay, but can combine the two effortlessly for an interactive experience.			"

												The age-old argument as to whether games can be justly referred to as art has already been won, and any gamer would defend the industry in that respect. However, it's always nice to see games release that further enforce that ideal, and no other game released in 2014 embraces that ideal more than Transistor. Supergiant hit it out of the park with this title, and once again proved that games can be more than just pure entertainment. They can challenge us intellectually and philosophically. They can inspire spiritual debates, and even make us question our own existence as much as any other medium can, and in some cases, even more so.On its surface, Transistor is a game about survival and revenge. Surviving the coming onslaught of the Process, a mindless virus destroying the virtual world of Cloudbank, and avenging the loss of your voice, not to mention the death of your one true love. Peel back that layer however, and just like any other great work of art, there are many more layers to be discovered. The depth and careful attention to detail in this masterpiece is there for those who pay attention, and if they do, they will experience something truly spectacular that will change the way they approach video games in the future.As the name suggests, Cloudbank is a virtual city, one ruled by its citizens. Just like any other city, there are scientists, musicians, artists, and sports players. All significant decisions that affect the citizens are put to a vote at kiosks. Changes in aesthetics, buildings, weather, even the color of the sky itself, are all decided in this manner. This is an issue for a handful of usurpers scheming in the shadows however, claiming with conviction, that when everything changes, nothing changes.You play as Red, a famous musician in Cloudbank, who unfortunately for her, is also a popular voice in the social hierarchy of the city. It seems that there is a group of people who are unhappy with the current state of Cloudbank, and they want to change it, by resetting it. The Camerata, as they call themselves, seek out the popular voices to assimilate them into a Transistor so that they can give the citizens what they don't even know they want. This will be useful once the Process finishes destroying the current version of the city, and the Camerata take control of version 2.0. Of course, this brings about interesting questions concerning what the collective thinks versus the individual, and the merits of socialism.The Camerata's plans hit a snag when Red's lover sacrifices himself to protect her, which results in the terrorist group losing the Transistor. Thus, the primary weapon of the enemy becomes a tool of self expression for Red, something a mute desperately needs. With it, Red is able to collect the consciousness of citizens who have already fallen victim to the Process, and unlock Functions for her to use to protect herself from the same fate.These Functions are the foundation of the attack system. Each one has a primary attack, secondary attack, and a passive attribute to be strategically utilized in battle. Combining them in different ways provides you with an almost unlimited amount of customized attacks at your disposal. Experimenting with these Functions feels like a practice in programming, with the names mimicking those in existing development frameworks. The attacks can be triggered in real time easily enough, but the real fun is entering a Turn state, which essentially pauses the action long enough for you to plan out your moves in advance, and then ending the Turn state will allow you to watch them play out. One of my absolute favorite functions provides a passive ability that gives you a small chance to evolve into a 'Super User' when entering a Turn state. If this occurs, you can basically nuke the Process into oblivion, de-rezzing them TRON style. The developers encourage you to try out as many combinations as possible by unlocking more background information on the citizens of Cloudbank for using the Functions in different ways.You will have plenty of opportunities to research these Functions by locating a 'Back Door', which grants you access to an administrative area of Cloudbank, which is full of challenges for you to complete. I recommend you take the time to complete these, since they will improve your skills exponentially. Practice makes perfect, and you can never have too much of it. You can also listen to Transistor's soundtrack here, which is absolutely brilliant, and I cannot stress that enough.As great as the primary game mechanics are, the little details are what makes Transistor really shine. The commentary from your lover coming from the Transistor, for example. Character development is hard enough, but when the protagonist is mute, it's even harder. Supergiant did a fantastic job of pulling it off nonetheless. There's a flourish control that makes Red throw the Transistor up into the air and catch it before coming back down, which serves no purpose except for looking cool. You can also stop what you're doing at anytime and hum, which allows Red to dance with her lover's new shell and hum to the tune of the soundtrack currently playing. The backgrounds you unlock by experimenting with the Functions give you details on the lost citizens of Cloudbank, some of which are subtly implied to be LGBT is some way, which is not central to the story, and is entirely optional. It's nice that these kinds of details were considered, and every game would improve with such features.Transistor never overstays it's welcome, and if the first playthrough wasn't enough time to spend in this amazing world, a game+ mode is available as well as difficulty modifiers similar to those found in Bastion, providing plenty of excuses to return to Cloudbank.The story takes multiple turns before you reach the climax, which will hit you square in the gut to great effect. All the while exploring themes such as socialism, religion, death, love, revenge, sacrifice, and the afterlife in a postmodern cyberpunk setting. College level dissertations can be written using Transistor as a focal point, and that is an incredible accomplishment by the developers. Every time you play this game you'll discover a new layer you may have missed the last time through. Everything about this game is subtle, the story, the characters, and the themes, allowing the players to decide what to take away from their time in this world. It never feels as if Supergiant is using Transistor as a soapbox to shove their own agendas down our throats, which games this deep tend to do.Not only is Transistor one of my favorite games of all time, I would go as far as to say it is my personal pick for Independent Game of the Year, if not decade. I would have gladly paid three times what they are charging for this game without regret, so if you're on the fence about spending $20, don't be. The soundtrack is also available on Steam for $10, which is easily worth it. The tracks carry some emotional weight though, so the developers have explicitly stated that experiencing them in the game first is ideal, and I would have to agree.			"

												I guess I might as well make the inevitable comparisons to Bastion first. It doesn't (and couldn't) have the ""amazing thing out of nowhere"" quality of Bastion. But the art direction, narration, and setting of Transistor are more to my taste.The story has a cryptic in medias res presentation and requires a lot of digging to uncover and properly arrange what is actually going on, but that was OK with me.I also was happy trying out tons of different loadouts and combinations of the combat powers -- the motivation of unlocking story/background bits, and tackling the different challenge rooms, was enough to push me into that experimental approach. And I think that made for a more enjoyable playthrough. Transistor strikes me as being a little analogous to Bioshock in that way; it's tempting to just wrench and electrobolt your way through Bioshock, and you couldn't really be blamed for doing that, but you might have had more fun intentionally trying other weapons/plasmids.Transistor definitely is flawed as a combat-heavy game with nuanced but poorly tutorialized mechanics that are also hard to visually ""read"", so I imagine many people will bounce off of it. For various reasons I stuck with it though and ended up having a very good time. I even fired up NG+ immediately and played about halfway through it again. It's a beautiful game that attempts some interesting things, and I'm glad I played it.			"

												Oh I really enjoyed Transistor. I finished the regular and NG+ playthroughs of the game across a span of about 3-4 days. One could probably rush through the story in as little as 3 hours, or take time unlocking all the lore, doing the side challenges for extra xp and game knowledge, listening to the catchy music, and stopping to smell all the roses along the way and end up taking easily triple or quadruple that.The game and combat mechanics are pretty fun, with a number of subroutines that you unlock or add to your Transistor weapon as you level up. You form actual skills with those subroutines, using a combination of active slots, support slots (that you slot subroutines into to improve active slots), and four passive slots (buffs to improve your character as a whole). Each subroutine does a different, but thematically similar, thing depending on whether it's currently in an active, passive, or support slot.There are thus many different possible and valid skill combinations and loadouts, and I found myself constantly swapping back and forth between them as I went through the game, especially once I started doing the side challenges where constraints force you to experiment and find new and efficient (or slow and steady) ways of killing things. In addition, each subroutine represents a character within the game's lore and to unlock the full lore for a character, if so desired, requires you to use their subroutine in each of the three slot types for at least one battle, each slot type unlocking about 1/3 of their character bio.Combat itself is a combination of real time and planning mode, and is split up largely into a number of self-contained encounters. Planning mode pauses the map and allows you to preview, queue, and execute in quick succession a number of attacks at once in an interface similar to Xcom or Shadowrun Returns, except that you can preview and rewind options before finally committing. There is no miss chance, or random skill damage, damage is constant but modified by variables depending on if the enemy is stunned or backstabbed, for example.Carrying out actions in the planning mode enables them all to be done in less than a game time second, so it become a power play of sorts whenever planning mode is up, but each ability used in planning mode has a cost which is subtracted from the remaining amount of action points you have in that round of planning. Once you leave planning mode, however, you cannot use most skills until the cooldown for the next planning round is up, leaving you with a few seconds of vulnerability between planning rounds. However, skills used during real time do not trigger a cooldown, and so in some cases it is very beneficial to fight things in real time (or a combination of the two) instead of always in planning mode.An interesting mechanic that I did not figure out until I was into NG+, was that while you have a certain number of action points to spend per round, not actually spending them all allows your downtime before you next skill use to be proportionally smaller, which is critical versus a certain enemy in the game. On the flip side, spending ""over"" what you normally have in planning mode locks your skills for that much longer before you can use them again!The story in the game was pretty neat, if a little on the short side, with a narration style similar to Bastion, but this time the narrator is also the Transistor and with you from the start. Like Bastion, you are dumped right into the plot to start off, and the story is revealed in pieces as you go along. The narration is touching in places, boring in others, but overall quite well done. That ending though. It came unexpected to me the first time, as I didn't think that was the end of the game yet, but hit harder the second time through for me when I knew what was coming. I didn't want to end the game. I did love the ambience though! A combination of the music and the dystopian steampunk background scenery. I am a sucker for night-time big city skylines, and the art in this game evoked so many wistful memories.A couple cons of the game: It's very easy to miss certain lore terminals and the game often doesn't let you back up if you went a little too far in one direction. It is often not obvious which way is ""onward"" and which way is a dead end with a lore piece. Your only options then are to load back from the last save (and you can only save at certain locations, though there is pretty much one before or after nearly every fight) or wait until NG+ to see what you missed. Or YouTube. The narrator is also overly talkative at times, though I guess that's a personality trait. There are also several plot holes in the story to me still, like *why* the Transistor's ownership got passed over to Red, and several other things I feel are little plot holes here and there that are not adequately explained.

												I was looking forward to this game for a long time, and have a lot to say about it, but I'll do a super TL;DR list precursor.PROS:+Amazing artwork+Particular songs of the soundtrack+Interesting upgrade systemCONS:-Plothole laden story-Combat-Short-Repetitive-Crashes-BugsFrom this point on, spoilers will be present.Transistor is something of a tactical RPG by Supergiant Games. The player is thrust into a vague situation as the famous singer Red, whom has had her voice ""stolen"" from her, as she removes a sword-like object from a corpse. It's insinuated that you knew this person, Mr. Nobody, and they protected you. The sword acts as the narrator of the story and as the majority of the player's insight into the world.Red uses the sword, the titular ""Transistor"", to fight off mysterious white invaders known as ""The Process"". The sword begins with a few attacks and has the ability to stop time (called ""turn) to plan attacks, and then execute the qued attacks. This can only be done once every few seconds, depending on how many actions were lined up, and this is the main method of playing. The player can attack outside of combat when they aren't regenerating their ""turn"" ability or when an ability is upgraded with a specific augment, but it's very slow and inaccurate. There's a multitude of skills (called ""functions""- 18 in total) which can also be used to augment other skills or Red herself. Functions are multi-purpose: not only do they act as Red's skills system, but they also unlock fragments of backstory for the game while using them in one of the three different capacities (ability, ability upgrade, personal upgrade), but the backstories are focused on the person related to the ability.The skill system is very interesting and can lead to some creative builds, but ultimately the goal is still to do gross amounts of damage, and there's only a handful of skills that will help you reach those levels. While many of these functions have interesting properties and uses, Transistor's combat doesn't really lend to using some of them more than once to unlock background story. An example of this is the function ""Get"", which pulls an enemy toward you. Due to the nature of combat, Get often is redundant or, at worst, a detriment. When executing a turn, time isn't stopped anymore- it's slowed. Faster creatures will begin to move away from your planned abilities and Get can sometimes miss or pull the wrong one. This doesn't require faster enemies to mess up, either, as the game's readout of potential damage often is misleading. When stacking attacks, the game will caculate how much damage will occur to enemies. Often it'll drop out enemies if there's too much information on the screen, but it also poorly handles damage over time and momentum knocking enemies out of range. Some monsters, like Jerk 3.0's, are able to rotate so quickly that by the time you're done buffing and debuffing, they have rotated and you can no longer backstab. This is frustrating considering that the two most simple solutions are: A, stop time entirely for the turn function, or B, remove the damage readout.Despite being flawed on many fronts on its own, the mediocre combat isn't the only thing to blame. Enemies in Transistor focus on ten different enemies. These enemies start out basic, and get ""upgrades"" as the player continues through the story. These upgrades are denoted by a 2.0 or higher designation beside the name. Despite the intent that the player needs to deal with these enemies in different ways, none of these enemies force the player to think differently. The answer is always the same: use a turn and do as much damage as possible in one go, preferably by way of AoE damage. This is absolutely true for every enemy, from hulking Jerks to artillery Cluckers. There are some attempts to break this up, such as the Snapshot's obscuring effect, but many of the abilities in the game already force the player into melee combat, so they are often inconsequential. In the later stages of the game, the player merely need to wait until an enemy is no longer stealthed to unleash flurry of void debuffs and a final cull swing.The game is rather short, and it takes somewhere in between two to six hours for a playthrough, depending on if the player does everything (interacting with spots and terminals, doing challenges, etc) or not. The player is thrust into the story as soon as they start the game for the first time, and it really never becomes much clearer. Transistor takes something of a ""Dark Souls"" approach to telling a story by having it dispersed through strings of text on functions and difficulty increasing ""limiters"". The Transistor, whom is inhabited by someone Red knows that remains nameless, is the main source of off-hand information during the game, usually to excess. The problem with this story is that nothing is ever divulged, nothing is ever expanded upon, and most information presented through functions are about people that either aren't important to the story or provide nothing concurrent that puts things into context. The game is absolutely full of plot holes to an incredible degree and it's presented in a way that would be lost on a lot of people, as it expects the player to use all abilities in all capacities and sift through the text. It's terrible storytelling, which is a shame. The story is interesting, but inaccessible unless subtitles (for Sybil, Royce and Mr. Nobody) and with some extra reading and conjecture. Conjecture is not a basis for storytelling, though; you're just witnessing an event without any context. It's like if you've witnessed a UFO beaming up some farm animals in the distance. Without the rest of the story, the game focuses on Red and Mr. Nobody's extremely obvious relationship as lovers, and Mr. Nobody talks at great length in regards to this when he's not busy filling your ears full of nonsense otherwise. ""Sea Monster's the only real choice here,"" indeed. The relationship stands somewhere around ""puppy love"" on the devotion spectrum until the end of the game, but there's really no development at all. There's no back story, outside of a few obscure references and some images during the credits.The majority of the game is spent trying to get to the Camerata in their tower, and then backtracking through some of the early areas to an M.C. Escher area (which contrasts to the Gustav Klimt inspired ""golds and shapes"" artwork through the rest of the game). The areas, while beautiful, are exceptionally similar and the game's areas bleed into each other. While there's plenty of polish, there's plenty of little things I wouldn't expect at this level of polish, like how OVC terminals are pretty much just inverted when facing the other way, including the giant ""OVC"" markings. These things become very apparent when the environments aren't differentiated, and when you're doing the same things over and over.Supergiant Games had a lot to live up to for their second game, and I can't really hold them to those expectations; they were just astronomical considering Bastion was their first fare, which was both refreshing, innovative, and honed in just about every category. Something about Transistor feels rushed, or hollow. It's hard not to compare Transistor to Bastion with all the similarities and outright references to it; a silent protagonist with a narrator voiced by Logan Cunningham battles to save what's left of their city using a deus ex machina device, all whilst encountering a few survivors and an eventual ""betrayal"" that leads the character to seek greener pastures. The only differences here are story elements, which are even more vague in this offering, and the well meaning but ultimately poor combat. I'm pressed to say that this game would be amazing for a first entry as a studio, but, it's not.Transistor is an okay game plagued with self-plagiarizing of old concepts and poor execution of new ones.

												A stylish, smart, and sexy game from start to finish.The game begins by tantalizing you with a bit of it's story, and drags you in and doesn't let you go, being vague but telling you what you need to know to get you thinking. Every moment of playing Transistor I was wondering where it would take me next, and I was never disappointed by what followed my anticipation. It has a very intereting take on a futuristic politics landscape, and has very well-thought out characters and developement.The combat is fluid and tactical, while somehow having an elegance about it. It utilizes such simple mechanics, however that does't mean it won't push your understanding of these mechanics to the limit as the difficulty definitely does ramp up as the game proceeds. The game will follow exactly what you want, and it is all up to your skill and cunning to successfully defeat all foes that come your way. The game mixes many genres but with flawless results as you level up and collect new abilities and powers a la an RPG, while you switch into turn-based strategy, and then into a fast-paced action game. The game keeps you on your toes and always tries to throw something new at you, but never going overboard and bringing you a challenge that is impassible.However the show-stopping point of this game, as similar to other Supergiant success, Bastion, is the art direction. The voice over by Logan Cunningham, and the tunes sung by Ashley Lynn Barrett seal the deal of the package as they drive home the emotion, setting, and character of the game without eveer seeming forced or clunky. The look of Transistor is sleek and futuristic and as you delve deeper into the story the surroundings transition perfectly. Near the conclusion of the game you return to where you had started but the setting has changed drastically,  and the score has been remixed. This point really displayed the kind of talent the creators have, and how powerful an indie developer can be.Transistor is a marvel to look at, a blast to play, and has a story dripping in charm and intrigue. If you were a fan of Bastion, it will not disappoint you, and I highly reccomend it.			"

Good, but less than the sum of its parts.Transistor could be lauded for many things. It's a beautiful game with a great soundtrack and wonderful voice acting. The vast array of combat options that open up as you progress allow for a staggering degree of customization. Unfortunately, it is also held back by several areas of weakness. The story, while featuring some interesting characters and an imaginative setting, ultimately felt small, like something that could have been condensed into just a short story or short film. The visually vibrant world you travel through feels somehow empty, devoid of life aside from the enemies you encounter. Finally, the combat never quite develops a pleasing sense of flow to it.Supergiant Games has again raised the bar on weaving a soundtrack into a game. This time it feels even more personal to the story since the main character, Red, is the singer. Just know before you choose to buy the soundtrack that only a handful of the songs have vocals, not counting the extended soundtrack which features a lot of Red humming. Numerous of the purely instrumental tracks have found their way into my music library, but they're not the main attraction.Similarly top notch is the voice acting. Fans of Bastion will recognize the way that it is utilized. It adds atmosphere and brings these characters to life. I must, however, disagree with the decision to have Red's voice ""taken away"" right at the start of the game. She is a fully fleshed out character, not some blank slate for players to project themselves into. Yet some of that is lost by not letting her speak. It also reduces other characters in the game to mostly talking at you in monologues where there could have been conversations. I get why it was an appealing option for the developers though. It's interesting to consider how a singer would feel and react to having one of her most valuable faculties taken away. The world surely feels more bleak and lonely this way too. You even get to hear her through the songs and occasionally in written form. However, as it is I would say more was lost than gained by muting her.While avoiding spoilers, I will say that I would have liked to have seen more out of the story. A lot of the right ingredients were there, but for the most part I would say the quantity wasn't enough or things were left too vague. I liked the characters that were there, but it could have used a couple more of them, particularly ones not affiliated with The Camerata (you're introduced to them early on). I was intrigued by the city of Cloudbank, was TOLD about some of its neat features and people, but I never SAW them. The game never fully convinced me that the place you spend most of your time in was ever lived in by everyday people. This may be a futuristic city where things like trash don't exist, but there has to have been more evidence of life left behind that could have been put into the visuals.Finally, it seems that Transistor's most divisive aspect is its combat system. I was definitely in the camp disappointed with it at first but it does get better as you unlock more options. You have several primary ""Active"" attack slots that can each be significantly altered by two secondary upgrade slots. You also have passive buff slots. Every ability, or Function as the game calls them, can only be used once until you are in New Game+ and begin getting multiples. You have to decide how you want to utilize each function: Active, Upgrade or Passive? You rarely are able to use all your functions at once.It is in the action of battle that things start to falter. The Active functions you bring into the fight and a unique ability to briefly stop time are the only tools ever at your disposal. There is no blocking or dodging aside from normal movement. In stopping time, you have an action bar that is depleted with each action you take. Once you unpause, all the actions you just planned play out at super speed. Obviously this is extremely powerful and it is counterbalanced by disabling all actions besides movement for a time based on how much of the action bar you depleted.The problem is that it is unsatisfying to use. It doesn't take skill to stop time and wail on an unmoving target and it's not fun to run around waiting on a timer afterward. If you forgo this superpower then you're left with, at most, four Active functions to use, and that usually breaks down to spamming one or two of them. If the game had any form of defensive maneuver, I think the developers knew you'd be far less likely to use the time stop. Yet that is the gimmick they went with. The most joy I found in combat was in frequently trying out new builds, including ones others suggested online.Transistor teeters on the edge of whether I'd recommend it or not, but ultimately a couple of its strengths are SO strong that it belongs in the thumbs up category. I will add that if you haven't played Bastion, that is the better game to start with and to get a feel for if you enjoy how Supergiant Games crafts their products.			"

												A gorgeous and fairly short adventure that is probably more enjoyable on a second playthrough once you fully understand the mechanics and world that the game exhibits. By the time I properly had a grasp on the combat and began to learn its ins-and-outs, I was only a couple hours off from the ending. I also didn't do many of the optional challenge rooms, as I figured I should save them for a second or third playthrough. Through a fantastic use of colour, light and music, Transistor's aesthetics wonderfully inform its narrative for a climactic and bittersweet final chapter that made my opinion of the game increase dramatically. I bought this on sale for $5 and certainly do not regret it. It's great to see games that not only have a good story and good gameplay, but can combine the two effortlessly for an interactive experience.			"

												Supergiant's new game Transistor is perhaps the best singleplayer RPG game I've played in the past few years. This game has it all - Outstanding story, amazing music, breathtaking artwork, and great gameplay to go along with it. In particular the fact that you could control the difficulty as the game went on with limiters made the game insanely fun, and the story that you could really only fully understand by taking your time to read the OVC terminals and function archives made it that much more interesting. I would recommend this game in an instant to anyone who was looking for nice, laid back singleplayer adventure. 10/10, 4 stars, 2 thumbs up. It's an amazing game.			"

												Supergiant Games have done it again. This game is as beautiful, if not even more beautiful than Bastion. However, before I go on with the rest of my review, I should say that even if you loved Bastion, you may not love this game. A lot of people fell in love with Bastion, not just because of the gameplay and music, but because of the storyline and the narrator that made you feel like you were part of the story.Now, that's not to say that Transistor doesn't have an interesting storyline, it's just that the storyline isn't as clear as it was in Bastion. That's not necessarily a bad thing either, some people like these sort of stories, I'm one of them. Transistor's story is a little more open to interpretation, whereas Bastion's was straightforward, so in this regard, some Bastion lovers may be disappointed. It's also a little hard to understand the story, even after two playthroughs, I mean, I get what's going on, but I'm left with a why at the end of the game. It's explained why in the game, but the reason just seems a bit flawed, I can't talk much more about it without spoiling things, so I'll leave it at that.As for the narrator, Logan Cunningham, I'm really glad to see that he's back in this game. The only issue I had, was that his impact on the game felt like it fell short in comparison to Bastion. The reasoning behind that, is because in Bastion, he actually played a bit more of an important role, in Transistor, however, he just seems like a big question mark the entire time. Now, while he is considered a main character, I mean, he's with you the entire time after all, it's just that they never really give much information on him. His lines in the games were mostly reactionary as well, instead of in Bastion where it felt like he was telling the story, in this game, it just feels like he's living through the story along with us.With all of that said, I still love Transistor more than Bastion.While Transistor might not be as good as Bastion on the storytelling side, the story of Transistor is still rather interesting in it's own way. Bastion was really clear cut with it's story, and that's fine, but I love the way Transistor is a lot more open with it's own story. It takes awhile to figure all of out, but I find it to be more interesting that way. The soundtrack of this game is just amazing. I don't know how Supergiant Games did it again, I usually don't keep in-game music/sounds on, unless if they're really good, and I kept mine on the entire time while playing Transistor. I'm even listening to it now while writing this review, I'll probably end up buying the soundtrack on Steam later on. The music just matches so perfectly with the game itself, it doesn't feel like a distraction, it only enhances the experience. The gameplay of Transistor is a bit more interesting than Bastion as well. Though I should warn you to look up some videos on youtube of the gameplay before buying Transistor. Personally though, I love the mix of using the turn-based system, along with just attacking without the turn system. It's a pretty interesting way to play, a good mix of both is the best way to go, in my opinion. The ability to use your functions (skills) as actives, passives or upgrades is a pretty cool concept as well. A bit limiting in some cases, but that just adds a bit more to the challenge.In terms of achievements, this is rather easy to perfect in comparison to Bastion and perhaps most games in general. There isn't much difficulty involved in many of the achievements, they're more time consuming than anything. However, since the game is rather short, it only takes like 6-7 hours for your first playthrough and then perhaps 4-5 more for your second playthrough. I finished both of my playthroughs in a little over 11 hours and got all of the achievements, so it's definitely a bit shorter than Bastion.To conclude, Transistor is a beautiful and wonderful game on it's own. If you think it'll be exactly the same as Bastion however, you may be a bit disappointed. However, Transistor is my favorite game so far this year, it did not disappoint me one bit and it only surpassed the expectations I had. I am merely warning those who think this is almost an exact copy of Bastion, it is not. Pros: + Interesting gameplay+ Beautiful art style+ Wonderful music+ Decent replay value+ Lots of different combinations for functions (skills)Cons:- A bit on the short side (6 Hours for first playthrough)- Some parts of the story could use a bit more explaining			"

												I remember when I first saw Bastion for XBLA a long while ago. I was first introduced to it by a show (that might be canceled) Called Reviews on The Run where they reviewed Video Games and Movies. A near perfect is what they gave it.A year or so after Bastion was now coming to Steam. I bought it and I loved it. I loved it more than any game I had ever played before. It was amazing.I'm glad to say that I feel the same about this game except I feel NOTHING SuperGiant makes will ever Compare to Bastion. People are saying that it's a mix of Action and Stratagy and it came be either one if you want it to. I disagree. You have a function called Turn() Using this lets you plan out attacks ahead of time causing a stategic plan to be made. If you run in not using your Turn() like some psychopathic manic then yes, you will die. You can't just fight. You must plan.The Soundtrack is just amazing. It takes classic Jazzy music and mixes in some more electric bounce music. That's pretty much all I have to say about the Soundtrack.When originally seeing the art style in the first trailer from Pax Prime 2013 (I think...) I fell in love with it. When I got into actual gameplay I wasn't a huge fan at first. Now this is me being all picky just because I didn't like Red's face. Soon I got into it and it seemed fine and natural.Overall this is a magnificant title that I recomened everyone should at least give a chance and see if you're a fan2016-01-09: After revisiting the game I believe that this game is a true masterpiece that everyone should try. From the upbeat soundtrack to the rage inducing gameplay, Transistor is truly the best game ever made. Even over Bastion.10/10 - Masterpiece			"

												This is a game with an interesting real-time turn-based system and another expertly crafted, and intriguing story that engaged me through it's entirety. If I had one minor complaint it's that it borrows some literary ques from SuperGiant's previous game, Bastion. Other than that, excellent game.			"

												A lovingly crafted game, dripping with Deco, Art Nouveau, and the Vienna Secession (Those similar to Klimt). Every element of this game is gorgeous, from the music, the art assets, and characters. It's a beautiful, romantic story, wrapped up in a golden box of a game. The combat, and how skills can be mixed, is remarkable. Skills will change depending on being a passive, active, or modifier to an active skill. You learn more about the story doing so, as well-so make sure to try all the combinations!I can't really say in words how lovely this little game has been, and I'm just very appreciative to have been able to play it.

												A very stylish Sci-Fi Noire-ish game about a strange and somewhat utopian city, ""Cloudbank"", falling to an epidemic/invasion of some kind, ""The Process"". The protagonist, a famous musician of the city called ""Red"", vanishes after one of her stage acts and finds herself right in the middle of the city's demise. The game drops you into a scene with Red pulling a tool resembling an oversized sword from someone's body, which is accompanying and talking to her and which narrates many of her actions and compensates for the city having ""taken"" Red's voice, who herself is mostly silent. With this tool, the ""Transistor"", you fight your way through the declining urban environment to the source of this epidemic trying to save the city.The game is short, but very impressive. The art design feels special and there is some pretty cool music. Cloudbank is a rather mysterious city/town, the game isn't straightforward with what world, place or time you are exactly finding yourself in. The ""traces"" of former certain city inhabitants absorbed by the Transistor to power your abilites while handling it in combat (fitting to their stories and roles within the city) give you hints to events predating Red's disappearance and are interesting to read - but overall the game loves leaving you in a wondering position for many parts, which (in a good, engrossing way) mystifies the whole experience and leaves room for own interpretations, possibly even for pre-/sequels or novels or other things that would build on the strong lore pieces which are there (I believe I have noticed this in the devs previous title ""Bastion"" to some degree too, but to my knowledge it was never worked out further, whether that is good or bad I'm not sure).Like ""Bastion"" this is a rather ""soft"" strategy action RPG in the way that you need to fight with some brains but not by being confused by millions of units and possible actions. You engage enemies with selective combat options organized at check-/savepoints, either in real-time or by utilizing a limited time-stopping/slowing planning feature. There are minor leveling elements and rather trivial but curious choices planted selectively throughout the city circling around some of its former daily routines and design questions (voting on things was popular among Cloudbank's citizens, it seems). Apparently, as a neat gimmick, the choices and a few other stats of the playerbase (like the kill count for each enemy type) are woven into this (or the game at least made me believe so). Maybe this could have been something to expend more, as it is effectively working into Cloudbank's digital and scientific ambience. You see the city through various stages of decline but without the levels building themselves up just before you (which I found somewhat irritating in Bastion), and without the ""hit and run"" concept of Bastion where you would often have a sanctuary to return to and select new levels to start from. This makes your journey feel a bit more like a real series of events rather than a level clearing maze, the city more persistent and you to be ""actually there (as much as that is possible in this mysterious world). The narrator doesn't feel as annoying as the one in Bastion sometimes does, but maybe too distant - or even lethargic - at times. But this could be the idea of his role within the story. In general I was thankful to have him as my - or Red's - companion. However I would have loved to hear Red being properly voiced too I think. I'm not exactly the biggest fan of this ""silent protagonist"" concept. Here it feels rather fitting though as the whole game is strange in a good kind of way, and it allows some certain love of detail to shine more for example when Red is answering to news feeds and polls on public terminals and correcting her own sentences while being in the middle of typing them to the point where she may even give up hope for the city herself - a subtle but strong way of projecting the protagonist's emotions despite her voicelessness.There is a little sandbox-like place in which you can practice combat and take part in some challenges. It's not as big as in Bastion, but I don't think it needs to be as it would probably only distract from the main experience. A new game will retain your level and abilites and ramp up the strength of the enemies accordingly. There are modifiers too - ""limiters"" - to make your enemies stronger and you level up faster, for an added challenge to whoever seeks it. That aside there doesn't seem any significant replay value, whether there are multiple endings I don't know yet. But the initial experience is an engaging and memoreable one, the game feels bold, thoughtful and determined and it's just impressive to see an apparent great vision turned so seemingly smoothly and confidently into a finished product that would very well deserve to be called a work of art.

												TL;DR: 1st game I've given a perfect score of 100Everything in this game is perfect except for the part where you need to rename the folders of x86 and x64 to fix a crash. Other than that, I can't fault anything on this game.Very unique gamestyle, I think this is the first time I've seen a game like these. Combining turn based combat to real time one as well as most importantly the RPG skill mix and match. It is really a ingenious design. If there are similar games (most importantly the skills system), please do let me knowPerfect pacing: Skills are slowly introduced to you same with the scaling of enemies, there are no difficulty spikes. Bosses are an exception because they should be an automatic difficulty spike. The unlocks per level feels very beneficial so every level-up counts. The game's length is also perfect based on how much they have to offer to discover all skill combination (talking about finishing the story after recursion). You can set your own difficulty by using limiters especially once you find OP skill combinations.Amazing storytelling: They kept you blinded for the story and even tries to make you think that there is going to be a plot twist with the relationship with the sword. Same with the pacing on the gameplay, the pacing on the story is also perfect. I absolutely love the ending, it was presented very simple but if you think about it, the reasoning behind it is very sweet.Technical: Graphics are top notch and fits best with the setting. OST, absolutely love it. Nothing wrong about the performance.Overall Score: 100/100			"

												Transistor. Wow. I'm consistently blown away by the visuals and music.You can get by decently by not exploring the depths of the combat system, but taking it in all in real time detracts much of the beauty of the well thought out executions you can maneuver. And the different combinations between your loadouts are interesting and I can only imagine get more creative. The story has kept me glued to the screen and my only pause was to write this brief review. The voice acting is amazing and holds up extraordinarily well with the narration. Definitely a must buy. If only for the soundtrack alone!			"

												After playing and loving Bastion, I had high hopes for Transistor.  Unfortunately, several glaring issues wth the gameplay just kept me from enjoying the game.  The story seems fine, if rather tough to piece together, so I will not cover that here.Obviously Transistor will be compared to Bastion, so I will do that as well.  The pros to Bastion's gameplay are-Wide range of weapons that can be used in combinations for different playstyles-Upgrade system that adds noticable benefits to both your character and his weapons-Strong core gameplay (dodging, blocking, attacking, etc.) that rewards skill and timing and prevents overreliance on healing items-No unnecessarily punishing elements (i.e. undodgeable/unblockable attacks), so deaths are almost always your faultTransistor on the other hand, seems to go directly against what worked in Bastion for core gameplay.-No natural block or dodge ability (aside from the teleport dash and invisibility functions), so there is no way to mitigate damage-Slow-moving character that tends to get caught on obstacles, exacerbated by the lack of a natural dodge-No healing aside from a late-game function, so some fights become battles of attrition-Several enemies whose attacks are unavoidable (dogs, creeps, jerks), even with the aforementioned functions, so fights involving these enemies are unnecessarily punishing-Environments that offer little room for maneuveringAll of this combined results in a gameplay experience that is a chore to endure, particularly later on when high-health enemies with unavoidable attacks appear in numbers.  The teleport dash function can help, but even when dashing away in a straight line enemies can still catch and damage you.  And the environments' cramped design means that you end up dashing in circles trailing enemies that keep picking away at your health in between dashes.  Fights become a race to see if you can kill these enemies before you lose a critical function.It is a shame that I could not enjoy the game due to these awful design choices.  The function system is an intriguing feature with great depth that could have enabled a wide range of playstyles.  Unfortunately the poorly-designed basic  gameplay means that this system cannot be used to its full potential.			"

												Transistor brings more of the amazing atmosphere and ongoing narration that people loved in Bastion, with an even more incredible soundtrack. The combination real-time/turn-based combat allows for deep strategy and will keep you switching up your selected functions (and the functions that modify them) to find a play style that suits you best. It is sadly quite linear: all battle encounters are static locations (though the enemies can change based on your level) and there are only one or two very small optional areas. And, unless you missed a few corners of interaction or side rooms with static art (like the opening image,) the only reason to play again is for the sake of achievements; there's not even minor alternate endings like Bastion. (And, when you see the ending, you'll probably wish there was.)That said, the positives of combat, music, and story vastly outweight the negatives of linearity and low-replay value, and I highly recommend this for anyone looking for a short, strategic brawler or just more of what they loved from Bastion. The soundtrack itself is excellent all its own, so even if you don't go for the game you should pick up the soundtrack.			"

This is a game that should be experienced by as many people as possible.

												The main reason that this game is so fun and original is the wonderful battle mode it applies for fighting the bad guys. Somewhat similar to Fallout's ""VATS"" system, you can choose to fight in real time, or pause then plan your moves to attack the enemies, restart the game and hit them. Wait a few seconds for your powers to recharge and then you can go again.But that is just the half of it. Each ""power"" has three different uses. A main use, a backup use and a passive use. So depending on where (or how) you choose to use each power (or combine it with others) you can get a huge of array of attacks, each different from the last. It really gives the player a wide choice of playing styles.And of course there is the story and the art style... and the shortness of the game, but heck, it is really worth a download.			"

As I started my NG+ run, I felt I knew what I was doing, but still had hard fights. By the time I 100%ed the game everything was melting with the combo I used. I really liked the challenge maps. They changed up your normal gameplay by setting limits, such as time or skills. People claimed the story was confusing, I claim these people are dumb.  If you listen and read everything it is made pretty clear what is/was going on.

												Enjoyable game, great soundtrack and awesome art direction. Only possible criticism is how short the story is, and I wouldn't say I sped through it - though I did miss a few collectibles and didn't bother with much of the side-challenges. Great customization options for making a build, the limiters providing an interesting adjustable difficulty.Highly recommend Transistor and I'd suggest giving it a go when you've an evening where you can commit to playing it from start to finish!

New Game plus actually has all new encounters (same story, but harder and more numerous enemies, and a new test in the sandbox). I really enjoyed it (though I love Bastion just a bit more).			"

												I love this game. A while after finishing Bastion, a game made by the same developers, I found out about Transistor and could not wait to try it out. I went into this game blind, so I wouldn't have any high expectations. The only thing I knew about this game was that this game was going to be awesome and pretty. So after actually playing the game, I felt like it was worth every penny and even more than that.The game has a beautiful storyline. I love the characters and the amazing voice acting, and the character development will make you love the protoganists or even the antagonists for sure. Fitting with the beautiful storyline comes the amazing graphics that the developers brought to you. Every stage, every fight, every moment is basically a breathtaking piece of art, hand-painted. Not to forget the beautiful soundtracks that each fit in their respective part in the game, keeping the atmosphere intact like you're stuck in another universe.But don't let the radiance of the graphics and the fluent tunes distract you, because the combat mechanics are something to keep your attention on. It's original and not repetitive at all. You can unlock new abilities on the go, making you change your strategy from time to time because you keep getting more to play with. If you don't, you'll have a hard time beating the game.In the end, if the game still hasn't gotten you in their grasp with their story, character development, graphics or music then it will try with the replayability that's available in this game. Finishing the game does not mean being done with it, because of the ""Recursion"" option, introducing procedural battle after finishing the end boss.If you love a pretty game with a nice story, I definitely recommend buying it. If it's on a sale, then don't hesitate to buy it because it will definitely be worth it.			"

												Wow, this game...The gameplay was kind of boring to me, it mainly consists of combat, and combat can be interesting and tactical, but it can also pretty dull and repetitive. On the other hand, the story, the world design, the art style and the music is simply amazing. So all in all, I liked it, though after you finish the story(about 6 hours), there's not much reason to come back to it. Still, I think that it's worth the money.			"

												Short, yet very sweet. Everything about this game is art, from the music to the graphics to the story.Transistor is a sci-fi action adventure game with a combat system that's a mix of hack & slash and turn-based. You get about 20 ""functions"" which can each be used in three roles: firstly as a combat skill, secondly as an upgrade for skills, and thirdly as a passive that effects all skills and combat. You can install and uninstall these functions as much as you like, giving you lots of flexibility. As you level up you also get the choice to use limiters, which buff your enemies. These are optional, so you can challenge yourself however you see fit.The only thing this game needs is more content. However, you can replay the game retaining all your skills and level from the previous playthrough, and there are special arenas that test your skill.Definitely worth checking out.			"

												Short version: This art-house action-RPG comes with an unconventional/semi-turn based battle system, gorgeous music and visuals, a somewhat thin but wonderfully told narrative, and remarkable integration of gameplay and storytelling.  It's a gem of a game with a decent amount of content and is absolutely worth cherishing.--------Long version: Transistor begins gently and without a lot of explanation, giving the player just enough information to know what's going on and where to go.  In short, you're on the run from your would-be assassins, fighting enemies along the way.  You have a sword that talks (voiced by Logan Cunningham, the narrator from Supergiant Games' own Bastion), and the game doesn't bog you down with needless explanations of how a lot of the setting's pieces work.  You quickly acquire abilities as you go, and these skills make Transistor special in several ways:1) Battles in Transistor work somewhat like Diablo's where you can button-mash if you want, but you can also queue up and instantly execute a limited number of attack commands or move a certain distance without enemy reprisal.  The catch is that until your Turn() meter refills over a few seconds, you can't use most of your attacks, so you have to be careful to play conservatively.  At the same time, you'll eventually become strong enough to where you can and should try to stay in real time more often, which works out well since your time-stop ability can leave YOU vulnerable if you're not careful.You can only equip a few of your skills as hotkey actives at once, and dying restores your health but disables one of your remaining skills until either you have none left, or you win the battle and make a certain amount of forward progress in the game.  This arguably leaves you even worse off than if you'd simply been forced to restart the fight, which you can also choose to do from the pause menu.  (Note that a few areas place you in big battles right after long interactive cutscenes without giving you a save point first; since battles can sometimes be immediately repeated, try not to hit ""Retry"" on impulse if circumstances turn against you.)  Enemies usually don't have a lot of defensive immunities, though, which is great about keeping you from feeling penalized for using a certain play style.  They're also smart enough to be aware of one another and to know how to protect and even heal each other.More importantly, skills never feel redundant, and they're designed to play off of each other, not to exist in isolation or to be used at random.  Your abilities have their own slots where they can plug into one another and change each other's properties.  One skill fires long-ranged arrows when put on a hotkey, but it can also be plugged into other skills, which usually increases their range.  You can later do the same thing with your own character, which grants additional benefits like a deflector shield or a health recharge--one of the few you'll get, so don't take it for granted.There are no character classes in Transistor, but the wonderful skill system allows you to customize and change up your play style throughout the game.  If you want to play a stealthy assassin, a somewhat tanky gunner, or a manipulator who turns enemies against each other, you have quite a few options to choose from.  The variety of different animations and graphical effects for the huge number of potential skill combinations is simply stunning--these aren't just throwaway stat boosts here--and it makes your abilities feel almost like they physically affect one another rather than simply doing whatever the game tells them to do.  I might have overlooked a way to do this, but it would be nice to be able to simply click an upgrade slot and see my various effect options at a glance, instead of just clicking on a skill itself and seeing the various places it could go.  In other words, ""I know what ability I want to augment, but not specifically how I want to do so.""2) This is one of my favorite parts.  Skills are connected to different characters and their individual stories, and while I sometimes don't like when a game presents a lot of its story through text, this method is genius--your abilities' text logs are divided up into parts that must be uncovered by equipping your skills in different ways.  Use one ability in its active mode to get one piece of text, then use that ability to upgrade another and get the next piece of text, and so on.  Hence, the game rewards and demands experimentation if you want to read all of the background info.  You can't get too comfortable with a certain battle strategy you like, since you have to constantly rearrange your skills and try new things with them in order to get the most out of the story, let alone the battles and their fairly sharp challenge curve.  It feels a lot more involving than simply having info dumps thrown at you because you discovered an unfamiliar character or area.Speaking of difficulty, you can customize it to some extent by turning on various options you earn called Limiters, which increase your rate of experience gain but also help your enemies out in some way.  Have fun turning them all on at once, achievement-lovers!When you're not battling, you navigate the deserted but absolutely beautiful streets and alleys of the city of Cloudbank, and I can't tell you how refreshing it is to play an adventure that takes you by multicolored, modern-looking restaurants, residential areas, and concert halls as opposed to yet another fantasy forest/desert/cave.  The city feels lived-in and familiar while still maintaining its own distinctive touches, such as weather and sky color being up to a popular vote, which you can take part in.  You'll be taking gorgeous, probably wallpaper-quality screenshots almost constantly--I have almost as many screenshots saved from 20 hours of Transistor as I do from 150 hours of Dota 2.  Even in the few cases where the game's tendency to not always explain itself makes for some genuinely weird encounters, the journey never stops being compelling and never overstays its welcome.The main story isn't that long, and while you'll fly through it on New Game Plus (especially if you turn off all the limiters after finishing the character-level achievements like I did), the various ""challenge room""-style quests will keep you up at night.  My favorites were the planning tests, where you're given a specific loadout and tasked with clearing an area in one turn, which implicitly teaches you new strategy ideas and lets you play around with skills you don't always have immediate access to.  Woe be to those who forget to take notes.The soundtrack, which Supergiant was wonderful enough to post on YouTube --

 -- is for the most part spectacular, even though some of the more intense songs sound better while in the context of the game, like when you're busy running from something dangerous.  Ashley Barrett's vocals are indescribably wonderful, and the game even gives you a dedicated button for humming along to the background music, which gets put to genuinely awesome use at times.------Transistor, despite perhaps having room for more detail in the main plot, crams more visual and musical identity into its small but thoroughly memorable scale than I can recall from a lot of much bigger games, and even without the wonderfully fun Turn() system, the skill combinations and the wonderful production values make the combat more special than any number of hotkey bars ever will.  As of this writing, the game is currently on sale for $7, but I'd say it's easily worth its $20 asking price if you don't mind a product that exchanges length for sheer specialness.

 Beautiful GameFrom the makers of Bastion, this is another beautifully illustrated isometric third person game. However, this is a very different game than Bastion, which features real-time combat and a series of upgradable weapons as well as unlockable skills and passive modifiers. Transistor, on the other hand, is semi-turn-based (recharging skill bar is used to plan combat turns with real-time in between) combat and features a series of skills that can be combined with each-other to produce different effects. The same skills can be used as active attacks, modifiers for those attacks, or passive buffs. This leads to a huge variety of strategy and a wealth of build options.This is a short game designed for replayability. It reminds me of a few other games I've played in that way--the first one that comes to mind is Squaresoft's The Bouncer. It's a short, story-driven game with combat gameplay that gets better the second (or third) time through. You continue to level-up, the challenge continues to escalate, and the depth of strategic options becomes more rewarding. Plus, you might notice some things the second time you didn't see the first... or were they there at all?Gameplay Notes: Short, but designed for re-play (and plenty of it if you enjoy the combat) Engaging strategic RPG combat system w/ lots of variety Good sense of progression and unfolding of skill / strategic options Some actions are purely for atmosphere / character, but gameplay is richStyle Notes: Art Nouveau meets Digital aesthetic Beautiful soundtrack; music is also a story element Steady reveal of an intriguing story Great voice acting and singing talent  Some things are just there for the beauty of itIf the words ""beautiful game"" sound appealing to you, chances are you're going to enjoy this. If that phrase sounds just a little too effeminate, there might be a couple design decisions in this game that rub you the wrong way. This game is from the perspective of a female singer; and while the gameplay itself is all stragegic RPG combat, the presentation is still from that delicate place. There's a button to jump up in the air for no other reason than it's a stylish, graceful thing to do. It's in the name: ""flourish"". There's another button to make the character pause and hum to the background music. This serves absolutely no functional purpose in terms of defeating the enemy--but it does serve the purpose of engaging the player with the character they are playing, and contributes to the beautiful, somber, haunting atmosphere of the game.I loved Bastion, but I might actually love Transistor even more. I know it's usually the other way around, but I found the story and style of this game to be really engaging. 9/10 Highly recommended.			"

												It's a great game. no doubt. It has a futuristic setting which brings forth many innovative and cool design concepts. Pity the story is abit too short. Overlooking that, the storyline is great. It has a touching ending, one that hits harder than bioshock infinite's ending. It brings forth questions that we must ask ourselves - Do we have to rely on technology? And to what extend? What is the worth of life, and the consequences that follow in the name of fame? How far do we go for our loved ones?Other than the story, the gameplay is absolutely fantastic. It allows you to customize your spells in all sorts of manner, promoting creativity and encourages people to keep grinding against the same enemies with different approaches. It also buffs the enemies as you progress further into the game, making it much more of a challenge then just a simple hack-and-slash game. What I like most about the game is definitely the artstyle and music. It fits in perfectly, reflecting on both the initial utopiantheme and the slow descent into the dystopia which the city becomes as one approaches the end. The option to hold tab and listen to Red sing is also a gem. Her voice protrudes out from the ambient yet invigorating background music, giving even more depth to the storyline of the game, singling it out from the conventional hack-and-slash genre type of games. Overall, it is a beautifully crafted and ingeniusly designed game. Would rate almost 10/10.Gameplay: 9/10 (It's unique style style such as the ""Turn()"" ability makes it stand out from other hack-and-slash games. The enemy units are also properly balanced, posing as a proper challenge.""Visuals: 10/10 (Absolutely stunning. Art is meticulous at the proper parts and simple yet creative at other spots. The design for the enemy units<younglady, jerk, badcell etc.> as well as the transistor is refreshing new and creative.)Concep/Storylinet: 9/10 (Very cool concept. Reveals alot about the human nature and it's instinct to be selfish. Deeper thoughts can be put into the storyline to reveal much much more about the settings and the story.)Music: 10/10 (Beautiful. Fits into the settings perfectly. Go and listen for yourself :).)Overall score: 9~/10Would recommend?: Definitely			"

												This game is fantastic. Beautiful art style, fun combat and gameplay, and boasts strong replay value (a rarity for me).  Instead of the weapon choices of Bastion, you have four separate slots in which you can make different and unique combinations of three different programs each, in addition to four passive slots.  The variety will keep you playing without a doubt. ""Dying"" removes one of your slots and the program within it until you reach a checkpoint, which forces you to experiment with new combinations if you aren't careful. Soundtrack is breathtaking and truly draws you into the game with the ""hummed"" overlay when you go into VATS / planning mode. Finally, it's all wrapped up with a cute love story featuring a Narrator™.Cons: - Mildly short, but the side content and the replay value does make up for it quite a bit. - UI is unintuitive and unfriendly (actually a rather large downside considering how much time you spent mixing and matching different programs), but can be navigated once you get used to it.Please buy this game it is sexy and awesome.

												Transistor is at the same time very similiar to and very different from Bastion. Once again the game starts in a city where some kind of catastrophic event took place and the hero must fight it and maybe find a way to undo it. You'll recognize the art style and the familiar voice of Logan Cunningham guiding you through the game, this time not as the narrator but as a companion. Even with all the similarities, Transistor ia a very different experience. The setting is much more futuristic. Everything in the game is related to programming language and sometimes you wonder if the city of Cloudbank is a real city or just some kind of complex metaphor. The battle system has a unique mix of action and strategy. Every skill (called function in the game universe) can be placed in an active or passive slot. Besides that, every skill can upgrade another skill, or even itself, leading to a huge amount of possibilities to choose from. The only negative aspect of the game is that it'll take about half the time to finish it if compared to Bastion. There is a Recursion Mode that works like a NG+ where you can start the game again retaining the level and skills from the previous run but that's it. Besides that minor flaw, Transistor is still a masterpiece.			"

'When everything changes, nothing changes.'First time i've seen reveal trailer i was already in love with this game. Music, art, gameplay, everything was just for me, even if it was just one-minute video. Then, it came to steam in pre-order. I was not thinking even one second, just bought it and started to wait.When it was finally out i could not hide my excitement. Hardly waited for it to install, then ran it from my library, and... It was just as it must be. Pure perfection.I have absolutely no complains about it. Art and graphics are, well, you can just press print screen whenever you want and set the result as your desktop picture. Gameplay is very smart and forces you to try out something new, by rewarding you with some more details of characters life stories. Music have astonishing melancholic mood that will follow you through the story, that shines like a little Supergiant Games star on this christmas tree of perfection.Well, i will say nothing more, just believe me, i'm very very choosy in regard of games. And this game, it's definitely my game of the year, and one of my favorites overall.'Sky looks blue cause we want it too.' "

												I really appreciate what they were trying to do with this game, and in a lot of ways, it's very appealing to me as a gamer. Well, in two ways in specific. The first is just how aesthetically pleasing this game is. The world, abilities, enemies, music and artwork is all really well done. The ability system is fun and I find myself wanting a Diablo style game to incorporate a system similar to this because I think it's well done and gives you a lot of customization. The combat is meh, the pacing is meh, the length of the story is very meh and, to me, the ending was meh. I don't know... I was super excited for this game for a LONG time, and can't really say it was worth the 20 dollars. I'll play through it again at a slower pace now that I know just how much every second counts and might edit this review, but I kind of doubt it. It was a decent experience, but wait until it's on sale. If you're cool with time trials and whatnot, you'll probably get a bit more time out of it than I did. But, for me, when you have a setting this cool and the story is so forced and short, it in no way was very satisfying.			"

												Psst. Hey, RPG fans. Remember how flexible, engaging, and all-around great Chrono Trigger's combat system was? How you could drop a combo-train of hurt on an enemy, or wait for a bunch of mooks to squeeze together so you could fry them all in one shot? Remember being dismayed that nobody ever used that setup again because the people who make such decisions hate innovation and fun? Well it's here, and it's even more flexible and more engaging and just a heaping platter of fun.There's a story in there too, though it feels a little aimless at times. That's not really a problem, because dang there's some great worldbuilding going on when you start sifting through function logs and other details.			"

												Transistor, from the makers of Bastion, both games are among my favorites. Transistor and bastion have many similarities, and many differences. While bastions combat is based on weapons, and a couple upgrades for each weapon, in transistor, there is only one weapon, the transistor. Instead, combat is based around skills (functions) to use with the transistor, as well as being able to augment skills by equipping skills onto skills, and providing passive buffs by equipping skills onto yourself, that combined with the turn() function and a lack of environmental clutter made the combat feel a lot more varied and responsive. Unlike bastion, transistor doesn’t have levels with a hub, but rather has you progressing through a world with occasional visits to the ‘Sandbox’. While in Bastion, pretty much all information is centered on The Kid, in Transistor, everything is surrounding Red, but not really centered on her. The story is delivered in a similar, but different manner. Again, like Bastion, Transistor is not a particularly long game, around 8 hours. However, it’s well worth investing yourself into. P.S. gorgeous soundtrack, with or without hum tracks is subjective, personally I like them with humming, but even if you don’t plan on getting it, give the ost a listen.			"

												Supergiant Did it again, an amazingly beautiful game, great soundtrack, and fun gameplay. Transistor takes a more tactical approach to it's battle system than the more chaotic hack and slack ARPG combat of bastion. In many cases you absolutely need to utilize the Plan() system and can't just rage through with a few good weapons like in bastion. The game also has a slightly more mature artstyle, and I enjoy the elements of art noveau and cyberpunk aesthetics strewn about all of the cityscapes. It really is a gorgeous game. The story is refreshing and takes some unexpected turns, and despite it being a bit too cryptic at times, i enjoyed it and thought it pulled together the game well.My only complaint is the brevity of the game. Supergiant just leaves you begging for more, maybe we'll get lucky and some form of expansion will be added. That said I still do not at all regret spending $15 dollars on this beauty of a game, however short.			"

The world does no longer face the problem of falling apart, but instead it is losing it's style. “The Process”---the equivalent of “The Calamity” in Bastion---covers the creativity made from humans, with a grayscaled and blocky veneer, which seems detrimental to this particular game, where style is easily the highpoint of the experience. The music this time around leaves the closeness of acoustic guitar picking(except for the beach soundtrack) and goes for a more distant, electronic and futuristic atmosphere. Distorted electric guitars and heavy bass lines accorded with ambiance make Transistor a sonically sound experience. The story is very reminiscent of Bastion, but yet completely different. Transistors style and sound design, as with Bastion, perfectly accompanied each other. At points I felt like the levels were specifically made with the soundtrack in mind, because it was so eerily well thought out. We start of as Red, a singer that lost her voice(it found its way to the soundtrack, though). Standing above a man with a sword in his chest. This sword can talk to us, and also play the roll as narrator. Why only this man can speak through the weapon is unknown to me, since the player ingest other fallen men and women and gain powers through this procedure, but not their voices as with the first body. At this point of the game we don't know who this man is or why we should follow his advice or directions, but it's a game, so we do it anyway. We progress through the levels and gradually begin to understand the situation, “The Process” was a failed experiment from “The Camerata” and the city is conveniently told to evacuate, so we can have that barren emptiness that is so effective when it comes to atmosphere. And The Process is what haunts us throughout the game. As we try to get to the bottom of what happened. The vagueness and convolution of the story straddles the line of being annoyingly vague and mysterious and intriguing. Where at some points I feel the story would be better told if you knew some of the things you are told in the end. That would make everything feel more natural. In this mysteriousness, the story was overshadowed by the stylistic choices and obligatory gameplay sections. It's unfortunate when Transistor could have been both if they just dropped any pretensions of being deeper and having more substance than there really was. When you get to the end of this two hour game, things will be rather clear, but you will also feel like there should be more, where there are hints and ways the story could have gone that were never shut down or explored in a satisfying way. Despite it not feeling as fulfilling as it seemed to have the potential for, it was enjoyable and the game easily grabbed you and kept you interested up until the end. The gameplay seems to be a rather contentious subject. I for one, sort of liked it. You could play it like in Bastion, hack and slash, designing your “build” for this purpose. Or you could go a more tactical way, as with a controller I thought would be more suiting. And it was! Although the combat often boiled down to using your tactical slow down time mechanism, killing one foe to then run around, trying not to die until the cooldown ran out, I really enjoyed it. There was tension in that way of playing, trying to just avoid getting hit, spamming RT. While some abilities seemed useless to me, most of them were used at some point due to the fact that you lose an ability when you lose all your health. This was a clever way of making the player use all the different devices, but it's equally as dumb when you have you remake your whole build every time you “die”. The frustration of having to go in to the these access points and try to manage your attacks when half of the things you want to use are unusable somewhat breaks immersion. See Transistor tries to squeeze in a whole bunch of different attacks and combinations into, what was for me, a two hour experience. Perhaps if the game was longer and had more uses for some of the attacks, this wouldn't be so jarring and above all boring. However, when you had the attacks you wanted, with the combinations and everything, the gameplay was a lot of fun. Beautiful colors emitted from every blow, cool sound design and every attack felt more or less powerful, but alas, that didn't mean they were. All in all it's neat parcel. Well worth it for the creativity. The clumsiness of some decisions didn't come close to ruining the experience whatsoever. So it's a worthy successor to Bastion, and it will probably stay in the same place in my mind as Bastion. As a memory of a stylistically and sonically amazing experience, while the gameplay and storytelling will surely fade out of the collective memory, sooner or later.			"

												It's difficult but try to forget that Supergiant games made Bastion; whether you liked Bastion or not is not indicative of how you will feel about Transistor.Obvious points out of the way: sublime art and music. The aesthetics are scintillating, the backgrounds and world are meticulously detailed. The characters and enemies are well animated and designed, mirroring the world around them. There's a very strong noir vibe seeping through what often feels like cyberpunk New York as imagined by Europe. There's every chance I'm just projecting my desire for Remember Me to have been a good game, but I digress.The gameplay is solid, provided you realise that operating outside of Turn() is very rarely the best option. Transistor gives you a lot of different skills and variety of ways to combine them allowing you to play however you want, additionally the game encourages you to mix up your skills so that you can unlock character information and the ""Performance Tests"" force you to improvise with randomly selected skills. Unfortunately towards the end of the game encounters become quite repetitive and even with enemies evolving it is rare that whatever combo you've perfected by that point won't be just as effective as before. New Game+ is genuinely challenging but by then you are even furthered hampered in choices and will be extremely reliant on a few exceptional skills to get you through the encounters, especially with limiters on.It is unfortunate to say that the story and characters feel like the weakest aspect of Transistor. You're dropped into the world with no knowledge of anything, and as you progress you slowly uncovers scraps of information by way of skills and terminals. The game is quite short too, and ultimately it can be quite difficult to become truly invested in either the world or characters. After talking with people and going through the NG+, there are a few nuances that are illuminated and can be appreciated but the story never takes that final step.Transistor is a good game. The worst thing you could say is that it is not Bastion. Regardless of who you are you should approach with caution and pay special attention to all the little details, from the art to the written and spoken dialogue.			"

												Transistor, a cyberpunk themed action RPG made by Supergiant Games is set in a futuristic city called “Cloudbank”. You take the role of “Red”, a young women who gains control of an extraordinary weapon. After a mysterious group nearly kills you, you start your journey, slowly puzzling the story. The art style, music, and narration create a gorgeous, astonishing and captivating place you want to be part of. Beautifully drawn and rich locations where every step is a pleasure to the eyes, the amazing music by Darren Korb, the fantastic voice acting by Logan Cunningham and the memorable, intriguing characters which grow to your heart are not the only aspects that the game has to offer. The combat is remarkably fun and fresh. While you only have one weapon, there are dozens of ""functions"" which you collect on your journey through Cloudbank. Those functions act as perks which can be  combined with each other and/or used either aggressively or passively matching your playstyle.All  in all Transistor is a masterpiece and is probably my favourite indie game. Not only I recommend on buying the game but the gorgeous soundtrack it offers which is absolutely worth it.			"

												Loved the artwork, the music, the little touches(such as Transistor's/proxy etc glow during speech, even during cut-scenes) but not a fan of the story delivery. Sure keeping your audience in 'mystery' might seem nice but when you're through 3/4th the game wondering what exactly is happening. I guess the aim was to get people to continue playing it to find what happens but to me at least, it's not really a compelling reason to play through it. I can see the appeal, esp to programmers with 'functions' as skills passives as caches limiters for extra bonus XP. Another thing I didn't like was that I couldn't read the skill descriptions and effects when placed in main/upgrades/passives at any point except at access points. This is especially frustrating when you want to read up on the background of the traces but they are locked away until you use it and guess what - can't change it at any point. Feels like an artificial way of increasing the time required to play through it.What does work:  - The music & the songs, especially in backdoor when you can replay them - The artwork - Voice acting, especially that of Royce Bracket.  Overall short but sweet game.			"

												Awesome successor to Bastion! The familiar Bastion template is present, an ARPG with continual narrative and a fixed isometric view.The gameplay mechanic is more interesting and engaging, with the abillity to plan moves and combine abilities. The progression was well paced, though it seems to expect the player to continue with game+. The art style and music themes were highly polished and fit together excellently. In terms of criticism, the game could have been a bit longer. Also, the enemies start lacking variety in the later half of the game, and some more varied scenery could have helped.			"

												*Acknowledgment*Before I delve into my review of Transistor, let me first state that I am first and foremost a tremendous fan of Supergiant Games. They released Bastion in a time I had ceased playing video games, because I found the quantity over quality insignia that most modern games paraded to be a bit much to bear. With that one release they managed to quickly overturn my decision to abstain from video games. So let me just say (to my own fault) that I have a very soft spot for the company and the diligent employees they keep.*End Acknowledgment*- With the acknowledgment in mind, I would like to begin with the good about Transistor.The strongest point for the whole game, in my opinion of course, is the soundtrack produced by Darren Korb. I could create a lengthy description for this, instead, I will just tell you “listen to the soundtrack”. The man is probably one of the best composers in video game culture, that is all.The artwork of Jen Zee is a wonderful thing to behold, and deserves to be seen. This game is no exception to that. As well, as always, Logan Cunningham's voice acting is an equal treat.The setting, world building, and most of the story are solid and deserve recognition.These things all speak strongly for themselves and no words I can put to them will do them justice.- Now with the bad.The battle system, while tremendously innovative, is irritating at best. I respect their attempt, but it clearly needed a great deal more work for creating a sense of balance. It contains all of the elements of strategy and turn-based RPGs that could be considered bad, without any of the rewards, progression, or smoothness. All in all, I feel that this aspect alone could have used at least another few months of consideration, if not a year, as it just feels hastily prepared and self-righteous.The length of the game adds to the feeling of speedy preparation without consideration. Now don't get me wrong, There are some situations where a small number of episodes, or a few hours of your time can move a piece of multimedia to create a lengthy wake of contentedness. This is not one of those cases and while replay is certainly an option, I feel completely no urge to do so. They try to expand the game with a number of puzzle based battle-challenges to unlock songs within the game, but that would bring us back to the battle system.The last of what I say rests with the story. This section contains a number of ***spoilers,*** so you should move on if you do not want this portion of the game revealed and I will post when spoilers are finished. As a majority, the story is interesting, explorative, and at many points, compelling. There are a few points within it, however, that while I understand most probably lend themselves to a particular ideology or thematic pursuit, are what I feel to be gargantuan mistakes in not only the story of the game, but in writing as a whole.With the exception of Royce, each and every confrontation with the Camerata was unfulfilling, if not completely vapid of context. The characters are introduced in a very dynamic scene where they murder Red's implied and nameless lover, which is roughly the most substance you are going to get from them. The battle with Sybil is almost confusing because it feels out of place and unexplored. We do have the before mentioned cut scene, yes, but that is all we have at that point and all we get. Then we move on to Asher, and the seemingly implied arch-nemesis, Grant. Here we receive a number of communications with Asher along the way, which seem to be imploring you to garner at least a little bit of sympathy, if not just understanding for these characters. However, finally reaching them and discovering they had committed suicide, without properly introducing these supposed antagonists was (pardon my language) a ♥♥♥♥-poor story decision and shows (with evidence from the fantastic story writing in Bastion) that this was either a very unconsidered, or very lazy writing decision. I must apologize for my harshness in this respect, but I feel like I can give nothing but honesty to a company who's work I am so partial of.I must say that all of the confrontation/interaction with Royce felt incredibly well developed and was by far the most interesting part of the entire tale (with a lot of good progression leading up to it).  However, the suicide of Red not only seemed entirely uncharacteristic of a protagonist who pursued the Camerata so vigorously despite her nameless lover beckoning her not to, and who also fought so desperately to prolong her life against Royce's assail to emerge to a world she can attempt to make a better place, but it also felt like an incredibly unnecessary punch to garner some strong emotional response. At pulling on heartstrings, Red's death was certainly success, but it was at the cost of abandoning all character and story development up to this point.Now if there is an alternate ending I am unaware of, I would be willing to explore further. With things as they are though, I don't see my self playing this game again at any point in the near future.***end spoilers***I had to take a lot of time to mull over how precisely I felt overall with this game, and as much as I truly desire to give this game a thumbs up, I am needing to go with the opposing thumbs down.I do wish Supergiant a great deal of success and hope that any future releases are true gems that speak for the greatness that I know they are ultimately capable of. Also, perhaps my response to Transistor may be best summed up by the Buddhist phrase “Expectation is the root of all disappointment”. Many people are really loving this game, and I will continue to have my gamer soft-spot for Supergiant Games, but in continuing with honesty, this game needed more development and consideration for gameplay and story and I'll just have to sit-back an enjoy the soundtrack and artwork while waiting for the next release.

												It isn't fun.Don't mince words with any junk about how it made you cry. Don't waste your time singing the praises of a video game because of its art or its music or (god help you) its story.The movement is slow and clunky. Pretty much every attack option leaves you wide open to enemy fire (your enemies suffer no such restrictions, of course).The idea is that you're going to freeze time and belt out a series of attacks, but every time you do that it stops being an action RPG and becomes a plain old RPG. After freezing time, you can only attack out of Turn with the aid of upgrades (for individual moves), so your choices are to be effective in combat or to be involved in the combat, basically.There's some genuinely cool ideas. No one's going to deny that. Combining all your moves to give them cool side-effects is really nifty, the setting is fascinating (and ties directly into the gameplay) and there's real merit to blending strategy with action like this. But it all sort of falls flat on its face with how uninvolved it is.All Transistor needed was a couple more mobile attacks, the sort of thing you can use on the move or that doesn't slow you down massively, and a dodge roll. ♥♥♥♥ that gives you REAL options when you don't want to use Turn.It put in a flourish and a sing-song button instead.Make of that what you will.

												WARNING: SLIGHT SPOILERS, SO IF YOU HAVE WEAK METABOLISMS, READ THE LAST PARAGRAPH!!!Supergiant Games have done it again. Transistor is a beautiful game that blends both gameplay and story so fluently that I forget that I am playing a game at times. The story begins with a mute singer who has just experienced her attempted murder, only to be saved by a bystander. The savior's voice and soul are transferred to the sword, which she carries around to find out what is happening to her city, and off you go.One thing that stood out to me was the narrator's voice this time around makes more sense to actually hear, instead of Bastion's narrator, who you just sort of, could hear all the time for no real explanation. I know this really wasn't much of an issue in Bastion, but I like to see how the writers have grown up even more than Bastion's amazing story, which leads to another improvement: terminals. We've all been there trying to collect audio logs, but this time around, it's a bit different. Since Red has no voice, these terminals provide ways to communicate with the Transistor, which gives the player more motivation to go after them, rather than just skim over the story. Personally, I think this is a genius way to integrate both the present and the past stories of the game into one.With such a great story, there has to be some glitches involved. My main problem is after the ending. And don't get me wrong, I LOVED the ending. I never thought how that would be the end, and it was a good conclusion to the arcing story between Red and her sword. But the problem is afterwards, the Recursion. In Bastion, there was a reason to play it over, as there were references to how you ended the game before, and as such have a different experience as before. But now, the game was ended with only one choice, so there really was no point to replay it, except for gameplay value. I guess the developers were going for a more linear story, which is perfectly fine, but I just expected a similar weave to the story as Bastion.Now, I mentioned gameplay before, and it is good. Not amazing, but good. It takes Bastion's hack-and-slash type and mixes a bit of turnbased action. When a Turn is activated, one can move freely across the field setting up attacks, using up your meter above to do so. Once you are done, you then watch your actions and hopefully dominate the field. The catch with using this system is that you must wait for the meter to fill up again before you may attack again, in Turn or out of. I find that is a good balance, but if you aren't able to dominate a powerful enemy in your Turn, then you are pretty much screwed. Luckily for me, I actually liked the Turn system, but if you don't, you may not have fun with the game, especially towards the end with Man enemies, and the final boss. Which brings up what happens when you die. When Red is defeated in a battle (hence the Turn meter is down and you lose all health), she loses a function that you have under the abilities bar, and you can't get it back until you reach two different function stations. This is an interesting aspect, but it can be quite annoying, as it is often random on what you lose. For example, I once lost my main attack function, and was left with my dodge and my load functions, which do nothing in battle without a good attack. I guess this is the point as it punishes you for losing rather than just spawning you to the last checkpoint, but in my eyes, it is ultimately just wasting my time as it adds not much towards my experience except annoyance.Another issue is the extensive upgrade system. There were many combinations that one could make with their functions, but the problem was the GUI. You had to go through each function one at a time to see what upgrade you could add to a function. This could've been simply fixed by the ability to compare the upgrades with each function, rather than the other lengthy way. Not much of an issue, but it can be hectic near the ending when you have ten functions you have to go through at a time.Lastly, the art style. Remember Bastion's art style? How alive the world felt? Well, magnify that by 10, and add some city elements towards the environment, and you got Transistor. The colors vibrate off the screen, and you wish that the city, maybe even the enemies, were existent. Really, there isn't much to say, but to just look at. I once just stopped playing and watched the background for a good minute. The artists know to not mess with a good formula, and luckily they didn't.----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------NO MORE SPOILERS AFTER, LAST PARAGRAPH/VERDICTTransistor truly adds more to the Bastion formula, but it still latches a bit too closely towards Bastion. However, this isn't a bad thing, as Supergiant Games are playing it safe and not making a completely different game, which is what we want. We want the same feel of atmosphere from Bastion, which we got with more interactions but less replayability. We want the same gameplay feel, which we got with more options but less hack-and-slash. And we want the same story and experience, which we got with more passion but less nonlinearity. So, do I recommend Transistor? If you liked Bastion and like a bit of change, you'll love this new addition. I sure did.			"

												Transistor excels in so many ways, I don't even know where to start.It essentially accomplished what a game means most to me: innovative gameplay mechanics, good storytelling, and state-of-the-art visuals, design, and music. But what makes Transistor stands out so much is that it demonstrated immense strength in all of the areas.Game MechanicsAt first, it seems like a generic hack-and-slash game (that is, you simply walk around and beat things up with your ""skills""). That's not how half of Transistor works. Later it will reveal a new mechanic that allows you to literally pause the game and plan out your next actions. This is the true beauty of Transistor: you get the action-packed combat mixed together with a strategic problem-solving manoeuver, allowing you to experiment on how you can chain together different moves, and knowing which combo is best used for which situation.In Transistor, you get to equip 4 ""skills"" at a time, known as Functions. Functions works in such a way that each function could be operated either as an Active slot, an Upgrade to enhance your Active Function, or a Passive slot that grants you certain perks in combat. Once you get a number of Functions, the possiblities of Function combinations are endless. This is where Transistor truly shines, and after finishing this game twice, I have probably yet to discover hundreds of other possible Function combinations to work on.The ArtSupergiant Games is renowned for its stunning visual art and unforgettable soundtracks, and Transistor is the best example you can get. All the background art you see in the game is hand-painted, and every music piece is woven seamlessly to the game. Besides, Supergiant Games made a really sweet move of creating the main character as a singer. Almost all the elements of the game revolved around her music — your character lost her voice and you're determined to get it back, you get to hear her humming to her own tunes, and you could unlock in-game soundtracks which you can play anytime. Basically, music is an integral part of Transistor, and Supergiant Games did an amazing job on this.Transistor's backstory may seem mediocre at first, but everything slowly unravels, and it all builds up until the last chapter (watching the end credits broke my heart into pieces). The story was presented in such a way that you have to head to different spots along the landscape and get a hint of what's going on. Even each Function actually originates from a character, so each Function has a story to tell. In order to fully appreciate the story, I suggest you inspect all the Functions and every nook and corner you find (or simply head over to the wiki, everything is there). There's also a sword that talks. Nothing is better than a talking weapon.ConclusionI believe that Transistor is the hallmark of an innovative game produced by creative minds. It's not something you get to see very often in these few years, so I fully recommend it to anyone who loves games as a means of entertainment and artistic expression.TL;DR, Transistor excels in every aspect, innovative and refreshing game mechanics, great artistical value, and nothing beats a talking sword.

												The world looks amazing, the music throughout the game absolutely wonderful, and the gameplay solid, deep, varied and interesting. The amount of skills and the possible different combinations that you get are mind boggling, and most have very significant effects on the way you play the game. Combat can be done strategicaly with the Turn mode, or just plain old regular real time action, and are just equally as viable and fun!Though you are presented with a central plot, much of the lore is tied to the gameplay in an interesting manner and presented in a way that not only allows you the freedom of choosing how much of it you want to read/see/hear, but also adds to the sublime world Supergiant has created. The game has atmosphere, it has character, and it's a testament to how good Supergiant is at building a world, which in my opinion, is second to none.Despite how different this game is from Supergiant's previous game, Bastion, to compare both games is inevitable. Cloudbank is in most ways busier than the areas surrounding Caelondia, but its aethetics are darker and more muted. The music in Transistor is a bit more synthetic compared to the more instrumental nature of Bastion's music, but is no less wonderful. Gameplay wise, Transistor outperforms Bastion in every which way, offering more options and a more fleshed out combat system. Narrative wise though, it feels like Transistor falls short of Bastion by way of being just slightly less coherant and emotional. But, it is still really well done and stands on its own really well.My only complaints about the game is how short it is, because I find myself just wanting MORE. While Recursion mode (New Game+) satisfies my desire for more gameplay, I also want more of the story, more of the music, and more of the world. Also, the game sometimes fails to explains the mechanics of its skills properly, leaving you to either figure some things out for yourself or consult a guide.  Should you play this? Absolutely. Definitely do consider buying the soundtrack alongside the game, but do not hesitate to give the music a listen first by way of free streaming courtesy of Supergiant themselves. I only wish the soundtrack had the different variations of all/most of the songs, such as the BGMs with Red humming to them, or the instrumental versions of a few others.http://store.supergiantgames.com/products/transistor-original-soundtrack-digitalUPDATE: Supergiant has released an extended version of the soundtrack with the aforementioned humming and instrumental verions.

												Mini Transistor review (spoiler free): I'll start out by saying a lot of love went into that game. The music, sound design, voice acting, and overall art direction are top notch, which is all the more impressive when you find out that a team of twelve built this game from the ground up. The painted world feels just as beautiful as Bastion's, even though you won't be visiting locations that are as varied.The combat can be a little confusing at first do to the sheer number of ability combinations and the amount of planning that's involved, but you definitely get the hang of it with some experimentation. You will feel kind of limited initially since you won't have enough ""memory"" to equip and use all your abilities with passives and upgrades. As a result you will be sitting there with a lot of your ability, upgrade and passive slots empty, even at the end of the game. The difficulty feels like it scales quite nicely. As the game progresses enemies will upgrade in parallel with you, gaining new abilities as you gain tem yourself. And if you feel like the game is still too easy you can equip ""limiters"" (similar to the shrines in bastion) to make the enemies more difficult, which allows you to get a bonus to experience. I did wish there was an easier way to see some of your stats. You will have to do a bit of digging in order to find out what exactly what your health, damage, ability cost, and turn() values are.I clocked the game in at around 10 hours, though I spent a lot of time tinkering and trying to figure out the best combinations of abilities, upgrades and passives, and I did all the challenges you can unlock initially. I thought the story was a little weaker than bastions in that you have to do a lot more investigating to figure out exactly what's going on and the world doesn't feel as integrated with the gameplay. After beating the game I felt like I knew the broad strokes of  what was going on, but I felt like there are definitely some gaps to fill.

												Transistor is one of those artsy-fartsy games that also happen to have great mechanics. You get to mix, match, and augment abilities together in probably hundreds of different ways, so you can create your own unique fighting style or try someone else's optimized build. The art and music are top notch, as other reviews will undoubtedly remark on. Some of the songs were catchy enough that they resurfaced in my mind weeks and months later, and I couldn't recall what they were from, only that it must have been good.The character design is also worthy of praise, especially the dynamic duo of protagonists: A singer who's lost her voice, and a sword who's lost everything but his voice.The setting could be considered cyberpunk, but to me it has more of a computer programming theme as there are analogous concepts that are more easily understood by the technologically literate. Transistor's story can be confusing and a tad controversial, but I'm of the opinion that it had plenty of depth. If you like puzzling things out in your games you'll love it, if not then you might still enjoy the gameplay. It's relatively short if you're not into the whole ""new game plus"" thing. So why not dive into Cloudbank's pseudo-digital ocean and see if you can swim.			"

												The world looks amazing, the music throughout the game absolutely wonderful, and the gameplay solid, deep, varied and interesting. The amount of skills and the possible different combinations that you get are mind boggling, and most have very significant effects on the way you play the game. Combat can be done strategicaly with the Turn mode, or just plain old regular real time action, and are just equally as viable and fun!Though you are presented with a central plot, much of the lore is tied to the gameplay in an interesting manner and presented in a way that not only allows you the freedom of choosing how much of it you want to read/see/hear, but also adds to the sublime world Supergiant has created. The game has atmosphere, it has character, and it's a testament to how good Supergiant is at building a world, which in my opinion, is second to none.Despite how different this game is from Supergiant's previous game, Bastion, to compare both games is inevitable. Cloudbank is in most ways busier than the areas surrounding Caelondia, but its aethetics are darker and more muted. The music in Transistor is a bit more synthetic compared to the more instrumental nature of Bastion's music, but is no less wonderful. Gameplay wise, Transistor outperforms Bastion in every which way, offering more options and a more fleshed out combat system. Narrative wise though, it feels like Transistor falls short of Bastion by way of being just slightly less coherant and emotional. But, it is still really well done and stands on its own really well.My only complaints about the game is how short it is, because I find myself just wanting MORE. While Recursion mode (New Game+) satisfies my desire for more gameplay, I also want more of the story, more of the music, and more of the world. Also, the game sometimes fails to explains the mechanics of its skills properly, leaving you to either figure some things out for yourself or consult a guide.  Should you play this? Absolutely. Definitely do consider buying the soundtrack alongside the game, but do not hesitate to give the music a listen first by way of free streaming courtesy of Supergiant themselves. I only wish the soundtrack had the different variations of all/most of the songs, such as the BGMs with Red humming to them, or the instrumental versions of a few others.http://store.supergiantgames.com/products/transistor-original-soundtrack-digitalUPDATE: Supergiant has released an extended version of the soundtrack with the aforementioned humming and instrumental verions.

												Supergiant Games have a reputation from their previous game Bastion, to create strong stories that host powerful soundtracks and detailed art. Transistor is no dissapointment, this game is huge step up from Bastion, showcasing unique gameplay mechanics, with a fully customizable weapon at hand. Though this is one of the biggest feautres of the game, the story, soundtrack, design and love for the characters in the game got me through to the end. This game has such a deep story of lost love and the struggles to reunite with that one. Not only is the soundtrack well written and fitting with the game, it flows with the story development and events that occur through your playthrough, the stylised art is painstakingly detailed, and geometrically themed to maintain the futuristic feel in cloud bank.Though there were few flaws, some people may find the combat mechanic a bit repetitive, though that is merely encouragement to mix the Transistor's abilities around for a different approach during conflict.The story is well written and heartfelt, while keeping soppiness out of the picture, beginning in the middle of initial conflict, which renders the protagonist unable to speak her mind and leaves the player to discover hidden details along the way, giving a satisfying and over all great ending. If I were to give this game a rating it would have to be 9/10 just because no game is perfect, but this cut so close, I love having a game the doesn't prolong important story development and yet still tells it powerfully, as well as the art and soundtrack winning me over, a truly moving game.9/10 "

												I often find myself remissed that ""I'm not up to date with the latest games,"" or that ""I don't play as much as I used to.""  Perhaps that's because I don't find many games like Transistor.  I recently found myself in the thralls of illness, and thus free from my daily responsibilites.  I decided to use this spare time to play the recently purchased Transistor.  In Transistor, the female protagonist (Red) is guided by an unknown familiar that is somehow trapped in the weapon that she wields: The Transistor.  You soon learn that they took her voice and she is driven, initially, by a sense of revenge and justice.  However, as the story unfolds, more questions arise as new entities are encountered and new perspectives are obtained.  Ultimately, many questions are left unanswered at the end of the story.  Even though you never truly know some of the details about Red's life before our story begins, and are left with a hazy understanding of the world that Red lives in, you gain absolute clarity of her character.First: Transistor was great to play.  Easy to pick up and learn, lots of options for upgrading and combining skills, and a nice medium for employing different strategies in fights.  The concept of essentially pausing battle in order to carry out attacks was very heavy early in the game, and it wasn't until later that I realized that it also played as an action/rpg style combat where using the transistor for planning was optional.  It proved to be beneficial to be proficient in both types of combat as I moved through the game. It was fun, challenging, and engaging to take the different challenges and encounter new enemies with abilities that I was already familiar with using against them.I found the story to be one of the best stories for any video game I have played.  It was compelling, it was beautiful, it filled me with sorrow and it filled me with joy.  It wasn't just the story that was compelling though; the way that they used Red's 'acquaintance' in the transistor to drive the story was a spectacularly subtle mechanism for keeping the player up to date with how Red might be moticated or directed by each event in the game.  The music didn't really stick out in this game for me.  To clarify: the music was great.  Many games really showcase the music, or to use the music to alert the player to a change in envoronment or mood.  In Transistor, the music fits seamlessly into the story, the gameplay, the entire experience of the game.  The music is a huge part of the game, helping to immerse the player into the ""Transistor experience"" by helping establish the setting rather than distracting from it in order to let you know that you're in a new place, or that danger is afoot!The artwork? Beautiful.  Like the music, it seemed perfectly suited to this story to provide the most engaging, immersive experience.  It's easy enough to find the art for the game online or previews, so I won't say much more here.Everything about this game worked together to provide a wonderful, spectacular experience that I have been encouraging others to try since I've played it.  My love for video games has been rekindled, and I hope to see more games like this.  How is the replay value?  I'm going to find out!			"

												...This game is a work of art. From the gorgeous style, to the genre choice, to the fantastic music, to the characters who initially just seem like ghosts of what they could be, yet slowly grow on you. The lines are well done, and everyone winds up having a personality of some kind that you begin to relate to them. The combat is fresh, not something I've seen before (and I've been gaming a long time mind you), and they didn't slack there either. I played with a lot of limiters, but even without them, I can tell you that this one will take you a little while to get used to and will definitely test you. It's a strange blend of action, strategy, RPG, turn based combat, and even shooter all mixed together into a masterful blend that I initially dreaded, and by the end of the game (fantastic ending) was in love with.This is the sort of game that was made with passion and dreams. This is the quality of game and the determination to make a fantasy that stands out amongst other dreams real for us gamers. I highly recommend this game, and I'm not entirely sure what audience I could think of that wouldn't find something appealing here. Talking swords, sci-fi, angry hardware trying to take over the world, over-eager scientists, lasers, giant explosions, godzilla-esque monsters, and VERY frustrating hairstyles... yeah, this game has a lot of nice quirks worked in all throughout. You'll love it.			"

												Transistor portrays an excellent story over an incredible world, that, states very nearly nothing, forcing players to have to piece it together through the limited dialogue of the supporting cast, and story logs from the abilities.The combat of the game is very unique, yet slightly reminiscent to that of Parasite Eve, with an incredible 38,416 potential uses for those functions.As for aesthetic, this is one of the two areas that the game outshines any and all competition (arguably, even that of Bastion) with a purely phenomenal and atmospheric soundtrack, that goes along outstandingly well with the awe-inspiring beauty of the visuals. Another game in which Darren Korb shows that he has the complete inability to make a bad song.			"

												Thumbs up because:- Pretty- Quality voice actor (a true rarity!)- Flexible combat skill management system- Innovative non-death penalties for losingShame I don't enjoy playing it. Especially since Supergiant also made Bastion, the undisputed best creative work mankind has ever produced.The plot? I don't get the plot, which is amazing considering how much talking that damn memory-stick-for-a-sword does. At the onset, characters are introduced in quantity and events transpire rapidly... I promptly acquired an unrecoverable amount of plot knowledge debt. Storywise, Transistor quickly spreads out in width, but not in depth... not until my anticipation had degenerated into indifference. I perpetually felt one step behind whatever was happening.Transistor has a hybrid real-time/turn-based combat system (which makes up the bulk of the game) that isn't worth dwelling on. It's admirably done, and there's surely an audience for it, but I found it repetitive, predictable and boring.The way that Red's skills are managed however... this is the good stuff. The real good stuff. Your combat abilities are called ""functions"". They sit in a great, big uncategorized pile. You can combine and use them however you see fit. Functions can be ""installed"" in 1 of 3 ways; as one of your 4 active abilities, as upgrades to those 4 abilities, or as passives. There are combinations that work very well, and combinations that work very poorly. Playing around with them is a treat. And you WILL play around with different function combinations whether you like it or not... because when your health runs out, rather than die, you lose the use of an active function. It stays disabled for long enough that you'll be compelled to replace it with something else in the meantime. It's a clever alternative to traditional gaming death that doesn't break flow, does invoke a penalty, AND promotes experimentation. Out of desperation, I was forced into using function combinations that I never would have otherwise... and oftentimes the effects were a pleasant surprise.I believe that other people will find virtue or indifference where I find fault. Thumbs up and uninstalled.			"

												As someone who is not normally a fan of the ""Hack and Slash"" genre, Transistor is still very enjoyable. The ability to slow down combat and plan ahead provides a unique and tactical element. Also, with each attack having a primary, secondary and tertiary effect, there are hundereds of combinations. This can have it's downsides, as there are certain loadouts which are clearly OP, but the fact that subplot can be found out by using attacks in different ways encourages you to experiment.One of the highlights is certainly the soundtrack, which is both atmospheric and greatly adds to the game. This game is certainly worth trying out, even  if it might not immidiately seem like your sort of game.			"

												I can often tell within the first hour or so of a game whether or not I will enjoy playing it. Sometimes a game takes longer than that to suck me in, but Transistor was not that game. From the quick opening, the clever combat design, the stunning world on display, the customization options presented to the player, the mysterious yet alluring characters introduced, and above all the incredible sound design and soundtrack, I'm hooked. After one hour in I can't wait to plug in again.Some other reviewers say the game starts slow and I agree with them - it has a quick opening and the story moves rather fast, but the game takes its time introducing you to things. But like a party where you find out that you want to be friends with every new person you meet, once you've gotten into it you won't want to leave.			"

												I have never before played a game that compelled me to complete it quite like I have with Transistor. In fact, it's the first game I can honestly say I've managed to get every Achievement with.The gameplay does suffer some very minor issues - sometimes movement with the Turn() function doesn't always aim it where you want it, or the game assumes you press keys when you aren't. Generally, this doesn't impact the gameplay itself, so it kind of becomes a moot issue.The music and artwork are downright haunting. The story is difficult to grasp. But this game has that special something that should stick with you.Play this damn game if you have any appreciation for what games are and what they can be. I get the feeling this one is going to be sticking with me for a very, very long time.			"

												Following from their smash debut hit, Bastion, Supergiant Games raises the bar with yet another incredible title.Transistor boasts uniquely hand-drawn artwork and visuals (which catches the eye with splashes of color and design), an absolutely fantastic soundtrack (which reacts and changes seamlessly according to ambience, scripted events, character progression and actions), simple yet complex mechanics (isometric viewpoint similiar to Bastion, but with an added layer of turnbased combat, as well as mergeable skills and abilities), on top of another astounding narrative and a deeply layered plotline. Transistor is a carefully crafted product, lovingly refined and polished by a dedicated, creative and passionate team of developers, as well as an exceptional performance by Darren Korb and vocalist Ashley Lynn Barrett. Transistor is unfortunately a very short game (but as was previously seen in Bastion), comes complete with specific attributes or ""upgrades"" resulting in a much tougher experience. Transistor also incorporates another layer of replayability - Recurse, which allows you to replay various parts of the story, or if preferred, new game plus.All in all, Transistor is an absolutely fantastic, creative and unique video game and is deservedly a masterpiece in indie development! I highly recommend Transistor and it's seperately sold soundtrack as they are both most definitely worth the money and the time.			"

												Riding very much off the coat tails of Supergiant's previous beloved, Bastion, Transistor has at least been built with some articulation of what made the spiritual predecessor so compelling. An absolutely gorgeous hand-painted cityscape with a woozy yet full-bodied soundtrack makes it clear Supergiant knew what the first thing that came to player's minds were. Throw in another smoky voiced narrator voice to follow the antangonist through to the end of the journey, and it would seem Transitor is on to another winner.Well... it fails in a couple of fundemental ways. Yes, we can recall the lovely artstyle, music, *that* voice actor for Bastion, but part of the universal charm was the slick, smooth combat to follow up on a compelling storyline. The former is failed with Transistor, exchanging for a slightly more clunky affair, your character taking a moment to attempt most attacks, even needing to recover from the jaunt ability. The wide variety of upgrades, potions and weapon combinations are exchanged for a universal sword, the namesake of the game, with four primary abilities where you can assign your collected powers as either secondary additions, upgrading potency, number or secondary functions of your powers, and four passive slots. It seems that this could hold a lot of potential, but for the most part those combinations don't surprise or allow for in-depth theorycrafting. You just slap what you like to your abilities, make them more powerful/numerous/have an extra projectile thrown in and mash away. The ""Turn()"" system also does now allow for much depth, particularly end-game considering how enemies enjoy countering or simply dodging your best laid plans.The story starts off incredibly promising. I was anticipating a very Film Noir experience thrown in to a heavy sci-fi (Read: Not cyberpunk) universe. Alas, it mostly repeats the same apocalyptic overtones of Bastion with an unsatisfactory and, frankly, confusing conclusion that leaves far, far more questions than answers and no clear antagonist to despise, the ""Big Bad"" showing up very late and with not much moustache twiddling to be had.There are a few neat little touches that I enjoyed: The slick UI and artwork is just as gorgeous as the rendered graphics, you can see other players on their adventure via Dark Souls-esque ghosts around you, and there is even a button to hold to make the protagonist, Red, hum out a lovely counter-melody to whatever soundtrack is playing at the time. There is also, apparently, a procedurally generated post-game series of challenges to experience, but... the gameplay just didn't grab me enough to really care.I can't *not* recommend this game. The narrator, again, just about makes it, and the relationship between him and Red's conclusion enough was sweet enough. It *is* satisfying to watch said best laid plans work out just as you expect and watch a screen full of baddies die in one little turn, and the world, despite confusing and mysterious, is at least dazzling to explore. £15 though? Wait for a sale. Even taking my sweet time I easily steamrolled through this bite-sized treat in six hours.			"

												I finally reinstalled the game on my account... I played this shortly after it came out, while staying with a friend of mine for a couple of days, and even though it's been a while, I always kept thinking of how truly fascinating the game is.Please don't get misled by the screenshots, which might make the game look like some cartoony, overly colored game for little children. It isn't. This game truly has an incredible vibe to it, it's like a little work of art. I will not get into the story, which is something you really should try to discover yourself.Don't spoil it for yourself by reading about it before playing. Just install and play. The game will tell you what you need to know, and will probably captivate you within minutes...that's what happened to me.The voice-acting, story, the music, the vibe, the art-style... all of that is amazing. It's not hard to learn, but it does get challening after a while. However, the combat is SO much fun, and there is a ton of variety regarding your abilities.Please try this one. I would recommend to watch some gameplay, but a) that would spoil the story, which would suck a lot and b) it's still a different experience to actually play yourself. If you are totally unsure, wait for a sale, but I don't think you'll regret this if you like:- Story- Atmosphere- great music- turn based combat (its pretty optional to use that at least at first, but later becomes essential)- a game that is not just the 700th remake of another successful game before, or only relies on EITHER story or gameplay. I don't use this phrase a lot when it's about a game, but this IS a little work of art. Beautiful in so many ways, and I am AMAZED I am writing these words, but that, to me, is the best way to describe this.			"

Transistor is like a beautiful woman with whom you somehow land on a date.

 If The Great Gatsby were a video game I really don't write a lot of reviews, like, at all. But I enjoyed this game so much; it physically compelled me to do so. Rarely has a video game caused me to spout praises about it to millions of strangers on the interwebs. This one did, big time.  Artistic direction, plot development (no spoilers) It's hard to talk about this game without mentioning the stylized presentation. Transistor shows influences from Supergiant's previous game, Bastion. Whereas Bastion's toon-like presentation contrasted with the somber themes the game explored, in Transistor, the developers made the game feel almost impressionistic. Cutscenes and plot elements are introduced in parts and pieces on a background palette of neon lights and gilded society. Much like how Bioshock gives you the choice of picking up optional voxaphones, the clarifying parts of Transistor's story are introduced via optional newscasts and recordings. The female protagonist looks like she stepped out from the Roaring Twenties, and the game feels and plays like a jaunt through The Great Gatsby if the book also featured murderous enemies at every turn. The protagonist's accomplice will narrate and banter with her throughout the game. Plot elements are introduced organically, and it's almost too easy to feel the emotions behind choices and actions the protagonist takes despite her being pretty much mute for the entire game. I found myself satisfied in almost every artistic aspect.  Music and voice acting The original soundtrack. Is. Awesome. The writter and producer of the soundtrack, Darren Korb, describes the music as ""old-world electronic post-rock."" Ashley Barrett, who sings many of the lyrical songs in the game, is suberb at giving the protagonist's (past) voice. The music strikes that rare balance where if you stop to appreciate it, it may just steal your breath away, but it's never intrusive when you're getting mauled by enemies in the heat of battle. Narration by the protagonist's accomplice is sassy, hilarious, conversational, and at times heartwrenching. It gives a sense of how the two interacted with one another in the past. Other characters who make appearances are memorable and unique; each character has their own linguistic quirks that differentiate their speakers. Nothing cookie cutter here.   Gameplay Combat is tight, clean, and rewarding. Gameplay happens in real-time, but the protagonist has the ability to pause time and lay out a series of combat moves reminiscent of KOTOR or X-Com. Battle abilities are acquired sequentially through plot and with every level the protagonist gains, and they can be mixed and matched to create endless variability, damage potential, and combat philosophies. Each ability is linked with character backstory that is unlocked through use, which encourages you to try novel combinations of skills. Enemies scale in difficulty reasonably and foes behave logically. They will heal damaged allies. They will buff their tank as he smashes your face in. And they will cause headaches for you if you aren't careful. For added challenge, the game features handicaps that make gameplay much harder but will reward the protagonist bonus experience. There is also a built-in, plot appropriate haven of sorts that the protagonist can access for scenario battles and a sandbox practice mode. After the first playthrough, you have the option of starting over again with a game-plus mode, retaining all progress with enemies starting out much stronger. It is one of the few games where I didn't think twice about playing the game again right after I beat it. And I played it until I got every single achievement and searched every single corner. It made me neglect basic necessities like eating. And sleep. And personal hygiene. And I didn't mind. Overall While writing this review, it was actually quite difficult for me to separate discrete pieces of this game into music, gameplay, etc. It is such a well integrated package that one aspect is in complete alignment with another. Gameplay introduces plot. Narrative augments gameplay. And the art pulls you into the gameplay. And the feels. Oh, does this game have the feels. The only other game that I can remember that has left me feeling like this is Portal. They are both a bit on the shorter side in terms of gameplay length, but the density of gameplay is tremendous. The white dwarf star of games really. Every moment feels meaningful, nothing is drawn out. There are no ♥♥♥♥♥♥ parts to this game. It is pure, concentrated fun with a shot of the feels right where it hurts. But it hurts so good.10/10 would (and did) play this game again (and again). And I honestly think this game is worth its full retail price.			"

												Transistor, SuperGiant's follow up to the incredible Bastion, somehow manages to improve on their previous offering in every conceivable way.  I'm going to avoid spoilers in this, so I'll be mindfully vague at points.The music is amazing.  I mean, if you just set it out on its own and listened to it, it is brilliant.  However, more than just that, the music is integral to the plot.  They use the music to tell the story via lyrics.  At times plot and music is blended so well it leads you to question whether they are diegetic or non-diegetic, not unlike brilliant pieces of film such as Trois Couleurs.  The graphics are aesthetically wonderful.  Myself, I've never been a big proponent of attemps to use realism in gaming, I far prefer a well done art style that fits the world we're playing in, and style is something that simply oozes out of Transistor.  From the usage of vibrant colours juxtaposed against stark white landscapes in later games to the deco styling prevalent throughout, you will drool over this game if you have any love of comics, art, or cartooning.  Absolutely wonderful.The story is a strong narrative told in an unorthodox way.  I'll be honest, this won't be for everyone.  The story isn't spoonfed to you, you need to work for it a bit.  You have to unlock all 3 facets of all your functions, read between the lines of conversations between characters, listen to all the terminal reports and only then, at end game, do you really start to pull everything together into a functional whole.  If you take the time, however, it does make it worth your while.  The game paints a stark portrait of Orwell mixed with Huxley to create a world of immediate and meaningful gratification that overwhelms the populace's drive for freedom and the ability to stand against a tyranny, whether purposeful or merely incidental, from the people who control it.  Hardly new or different in terms of a story, but told very well and in an interesting way.This game easily creeped into my top 5 of all time, can't recommend it heavily enough.			"

												This game is a thing of beauty. Like, seriously. If anyone ever tells you that vidyagames aren't art, just show them this lovely.Enough sweet talk, here are the pros 'n' cons:Pros - Gameplay is awesome and appeals to two kinds of players: Strategic ones and the Tanky ones. I loved the planning mode.- Beautiful visuals. The colours fit every scene nicely.- Gorgeous soundtrack that compliments Ashley Barret's voice. While it can be listened on its own, which i do often, the soundtrack reaches its full potential in-game.- Well made story that leaves the user with questions and room to speculate.- The narrative is even better in this one than in Bastion. (Not to say Bastion wasn't great, i loved it to bits) All the one-sided small talk The Transistor does is cute, hilarious, but still melancholic. I can't imagine being in a sword is fun after all.- The secrets you can discover and all the additional info about the residents of Cloudbank is intriguing and the unlocking of them forces the player to switch their playstyle from the usual set.- Great variety in enemies. Whew! That was a lot of pros, here are the cons.Cons - The loss of abilities and attacks or ""functions"" became frustrating to me. I get it, it makes you switch up your playstyle (which i complimented above), but i hated having to wait to get my favourite attacks back and it crippled me. Interesting gimmick, but not for me.- Many functions seem useless.-The game was unbearably short. Sure, there's always the replay mode that lets you keep your stats and functions, but resets the story. I don't like replaying a story, so not for me. I feel like they rushed the story.- Price is too high, in my opinion. It might be worth it to just get this in a sale. Unfortunately i missed my opportunity, so i decided to slap my wallet at GabeN, since i couldn't wait.  All in all, this game is fantastic. I'd recommend it to everyone and anyone. Just keep the cons i listed in mind.  "

												This game is gorgeous. Supergiant Games has stunned us with Bastion already and I wouldn't think that they will come up with something as good as Bastion.

												This game is gorgeous. Supergiant Games has stunned us with Bastion already and I wouldn't think that they will come up with something as good as Bastion. It's gone further than Bastion maybe not with its story but with gameplay, soundtracks, art and references to computer science. Transistor has taken its place in the top games of my life.			"

												This game was special all right. It had me captivated for weeks after finishing it. The gameplay, story, music and the art style are all blended seamlessly into this dreamlike experience.If you like art nouveau or humming songs, this is for you.Is it worth the full price? Yes definitely. It is a unique experience with decent replay value and that alone is more than worth the price.Still sceptical? Wait for a sale. You are in for a nice ride and it would be a shame to miss out on that.			"

												Transistor left me spechless. At the time it came out I didn't even had a chance to put my hands on Supergiant Games Bastion, so I had to play it first, so I could feel the style of its developer. And now that I played both I can say that the game feel was surely saved (if not enhanced). The graphics are just fascinating. Bastion also has great visuals, but the setting here is different and comparing these two is kind of stupid. Can say the same about the music. As a Kid, you had to put up a new home for yourself and the others, you were the only hope, the person that felt kind of sad and scared of the burden, but on the other hand brave and ready for the unexpected. And so is the music. Transistor puts you in a sci-fi city, and the situation Red is in is really tough - her voice is stolen, the man that is close to her heart is stabbed with a somewhat electronic sword, and there is a group of people that are chasing her. Most songs have that post-rock feel to them, which made me melancholic and sad, and relaxed at the same time. But there is one thing I'm sure about - the soundtrack to Transistor is something else.Since it's hard to not to compare it to Bastion, I need to say one thing - it really is a great enchanting game, but Bastion is a bit better, imo. There are not much games that give you goosebumps, but both of the games did that to me. !!Bastion Spoilers!! The part where you're carrying Zulf back to the Bastion, accompanied by the Setting Sale, Coming Home song was much more impressive than the Transistor ending. Maybe the culmination part of Transistor should have the ending song being played during it, but anyway, that's just my opinion. Transistor is still a great game, and it's definitely 10/10. I recommend it to everyone who played Bastion, and to everyone who likes the game's plot to make you slightly sad, but satisfied.			"

												Wow! What a game! Thrusting you right into the action, Transistor begins with Red and her companion the Transistor; a hybrid magical and technological omnipotent sword. With the Transistor by your side and acting as the narrator, you make your may through CloudBank, a futuristic utopia where everyone has a voice, whether that be what the weather will be, to what food your favorite restaurant will serve that day. But underneath it all something is brewing, and it is up to you to unstir the great storyline that this game has to offer.The game contains very engaging combat that can either be done on the fly, or via a tactical planning phase where the user is allowed a certain amount of actions per turn. Each mode has their own strengths and weaknesses, but while the planning mode may leave you vulerable for a few seconds after you have had your turn to act, it definitely seems to be better in almost all cases over the on the fly version. Although the combat in this game is great, Supergiant Games once again proves that they are king when it comes to art direction. The music in the game is a masterpiece, constantly setting the mood of the game as you progress throughout the many streets of CloudBank. This combined with the stellar hand drawn backgrounds and beautiful 2.5D art style makes it pure audio and visual bliss.Though some may disagree that Supergiant Games have not created a game as good as Bastion, I wholeheartedly disagree. Transistor is something different. Something that cannot be compared to Bastion, and something special that must be experienced by everyone. Get this game, you will NOT regret it.			"

												Beautiful game, amazing illustrations, nice music, interesting battle mechanics, clever level-up options, sh!t story.But mostly it's an eye candy. You should smash your F12 key screenshoting the whole game game for that matter.Needs to be played twice so you can truly enjoy the battle sequences which are the most important aspect of the game. It's hard for me to enjoy turn-based rpgs that much, it's wonderful. You need to try it out!It's a pity the story was so...well it wasn't bad but felt nonexistant even though at times you could tell that the creators really wanted to create a believable world and put a considerable amount of effort in order to do so. I've read analyses about what everything ment etc that I also found pointless. If you've ever read half a shelf of sci-fi books you'll get it in the first playthrough and maybe be as dissapointed as I was. There was also an underlying ""philosophical"" message concerning the essence of the human condition that actually doubled as a plot device, but it was just funny at best. Don't concern yourselves with the story, just smash the control machine(s).			"

												Better than Bastion?  Maybe.  Like the previous offering from Supergiant Games, Transistor delivers on multiple fronts:1. Visuals: Transistor is aesthetically beautiful in a way that few other games are and if Supergiant continues down this particular road, all of its games will be instantly recognizable.2. Sound: The same awesome narration with a new voice follows us into Transistor.  It's topped off by another beautiful soundtrack from the Supergiant team that you'll want to listen to many times after completing the game.3. Gameplay: Where some might have found the gameplay in Bastion a little simplified, Transistor kicks it up with a hybrid turn-based/real-time combat system, numerous weapon combinations and enemies with unique abilities that make battlefield strategizing more of a priority.4. Story: Perhaps the only place where I could knock this game, Transistor follows in the footsteps of Bastion with a couple interesting twists and a really solid story backed up by bits of in-game lore, but leaves some of the world-building up to player theorizing.  This can be a positive or negative depending on what you're looking for in a game.  Regardless, Transistor still manages to craft a compelling narrative that outstrips a lot of games on the market today.In short: I can't think of any remotely good reason not to buy or recommend this game.  It's a great example of what happens when a group of developers and artists come together with a solid and unique vision and pull it off.			"

												Supergiant's second game has much to live up to. Their first game, Bastion, was a fantastic gem with great storytelling and good, if sometimes frustrating, gameplay. So how's Transistor?It's actually quite different than Bastion, and yet is also similar. The gameplay is no longer a hack and slash spamfest, but a very thoughtful combat system that rewards planning rather than button mashing. Naturally, I prefer this to Bastion and its damned challenges, since i'm not very good at that frantic sort of stuff. You also choose from a variety of abilities for combat, and you can attach other abilities to your ""main"" ones to make those ones do cool stuff. A favorite example of mine being adding an ability that pulls enemies in and attaching it to a large AoE effect that makes enemies take more damage, giving me this lovely black hole... thing that puts enemies in one place where I can proceed to blast em. Good stuff. :DSo combat is, in my opinion, improved. How about story? Here there is still great quality and that lovely narration, in a different form, like there was in Bastion. It does take some time to unfold however, and until that point you are basically running about killing stuff because... I don't know. Fun? Also the game is rather short, with the main storyline lasting about 6 hours. There are lots of challenges and other stuff, but I cleaned everything out in 16 hours - or about half of my still-unfinished Bastion playthrough. Lastly, the ending was, well, something I have mixed feelings about.Transistor is a good game that improves upon Bastion in some areas (combat, art), maintaing the previous high quality (soundtrack), while weakening slightly in others (story and length). The sum of all the parts however is certainly something worth looking at. If you liked Bastion (and if you didn't you are strange), then go ahead and pick this one up too.Enjoy! :D			"

												Transistor is an Sci-Fi themed Indie-ARPG, with a kinda similar atmosphere as Bastion, even tho the general story and gameplay differ.The strongest points in this game are the beatiful and enjoyable music, the wonderful and appealing art, a refreshing combat system, consisting of real-time as well as tactical paused and planned out combat, the flexible difficulty system, where you can change the difficulty of this game in many different ways, and last but not least the way of story-telling through narration, which  reminds me of Bastion.The story might be confusing at first, but if you listen carefully and read all the descriptions and backstory, you're going to enjoy the amazing and interesting story line of Transistor.The weakest link of this game is the very short length, even shorter than Bastion, but i'd much more prefer quality over quantity, and this is without a doubt a quality product.If you enjoyed Bastion, are a fan of Indie-like game or want to experience a kinda different gameplay than usual games, Transistor is the right game for you, but you might want to wait for it to go on sale.

												There is love in this game. Love in the design, the story, the music. The essence of what was great in Bastion has been refurbished to fit the environment of Transistor. They are noticeably similar, but all-together different. Bastion is more of a hack and slash, while Transistor relies on tactics and positioning to make combat the most effective. A familiar aspect, Logan Cunningham, the narrator of Bastion has returned to voice the narrator of Transistor. While the voice is the same, the tone and style of it is noticeably different. ""Rucks"" of Bastion speaks like a storyteller, full of authoritative power and wisdom. In Transistor, the narrator is a large sword that holds great technological power. This narrator speaks in the constant present, holding conversations, granting advice, but there is a totally different feel to it as it seems like the narrator is more of a changing character than Rucks was. The point that I am attempting to make is that this is not Bastion 2, but still very similar to an experience that was obviously Bastion-esque. It is slower going at the beginning in my opinion than Bastion was, learning the new combat and leveling mechanics, but it is certainly worth the initial learning process. Supergiant Games has made two of the most wonderfully designed games with Transistor and Bastion. It will be worth following their future developments, as they have made unique experiences that are worth supporting. Also, press Tab when you're in the game. It's just that little extra aspect that makes me love this game.			"

												Just beat Transistor, and I think it's safe to say that yes, it does live up to Bastion in every way.But that's not to say it's just a reskin of bastion as the trailers would have you believe at first glance, because it isn't. It plays very differently; while Bastion tested your reflexes, Transistor will test your pre-planning ability.Transistor has a V.A.T.S.-like core gameplay element that allows you to plan your attacks ahead, but unlike V.A.T.S. from Fallout, using this will leave you very open to attack. Using this function will disallow any offensive action until it recharges; so you must use it effectively because the enemies are much faster than you are. Especially the ""Fetch"" enemies which are basically like dogs that love to follow you around faster than your evade speed and chomp the ever loving ♥♥♥♥ out of you repeatedly.The soundtrack is very different to bastion. I wouldn't say it doesn't live up to Bastion's, it's just very different in it's genres presented, and that is totally okay because it's still as great as you would expect from Supergiant Games and fits the cyberpunk setting very well. Speaking of the setting, it's beautiful. I love how you get the sense that the creators had this whole other rich, lore filled world planned out in their head but could only make ""Just a video game"" about it. It's not expositioned to you as most games would do, it's just there, which is exactly what the secret to making a setting like this is supposed to be like, because it means that you get the feeling that even without the main character and their plight, it would still exist. I give this game a ""Buy this right now""/10, even despite it's minor hiccups, which I will now list.Every now and again, the game locks up for a few seconds. This is guesswork at best so take it with a grain of salt, but I believe it may be caused by an unoptimized sound cache reset because the dynamic soundtrack is played in chunks of audio that change and layer as you do certain things. It could also be an enemy spawning issue, but again, I don't know for sure. It's so minor and infrequent that it's just worth noting, although not really a bother, since it seems like something that can be patched out. This has only happened in the challenge rooms so far, but some of the enemy capabilities are at odds with good gameplay design when their strengths are combined together. This one time, I accidentally knocked a ""Cheerleader"" (Basically a radar that makes enemies invincible) next to a vine, which heals other enemies. So the vine was healing the cheerleader, the cheerleader was shielding the vine, and the remaining fetch would go back to the vine to heal itself and be shielded every time I got it's health really low, and transistor time or whatever it's called wouldn't load fast enough to let me finish off the fetch before it did so. I'd show a screenshot of what happened, but there's currently an error with steam that won't let me upload it. Anyway, I had to restart the challenge map, but it never happened again thoughout the entire game.Another thing is that this game, while very enjoyable, should be played in short bursts. I beat it in one 9 hour sitting, and it began to feel repetitive by the end, as any game would. Just when it started to change the enemy variety up by adding in the ""Men"" which are basically these enemies with special abilities that throw pretty much tracking explosives at you, the game ends. They're fun to fight, but they show up so late game that you barely have time to enjoy their presence, though I'm sure I'll see more of them on my New Game+ playthrough. This one is a nitpick and not really necessary so disregard it if you wish, but: At the end there is a part where you fight an enemy who also has transistor time and can preplan attacks against you. The multiplayer potential for that is amazing, because the fight was actually very enjoyable. I would have loved a 2 player mode for that sequence that you unlock after beating the game, even if it was just local pvp on one PC/Console instead of over the internet, but I understand that there are probably engine limitations and whatnot so it's just a fleeting pipe dream.The story, while very gripping and entertaining, didn't have any characters I could personally relate to or connect with, so when certain things happen throughout the game, I found it hard to really, truly care. But that's probably just because I'm a cynical ♥♥♥ hole, the writers told the story they wanted to and they did it effectively, even if some of the characters didn't really get much development outside of the biographies that add to themselves by the end of the game.Aside from these issues though, I fully and wholeheartedly recommend this game. At $19.99 as a brand new price for this memorable experience of a game, you can't go wrong.			"

												Transistor is probably the most beautiful game I've ever played.As you would expect, it's a lot similar to Bastion in some respects, but it's also more complex and engaging. Visually, the only other game I ever played that maybe looked better is Journey. Maybe. The writing is superb, subtle where it needs to be, but also quite funny, and, best of all, it actually ties really, really well into the gameplay mechanics. I won't get into details to avoid spoilers, but I'll say that Cloudbank is a fascinating setting, and unlike anything I've seen in other cyberpunk tales.In my opinion, Bastion's main fault was the simplicity of its combat system. It wasn't bad by any means, but it also didn't allow for a lot of depth. Transistor fixed that and created one of the most engaging combat systems in recent memory in the process. It's a mix of real time and turn-based combat that works surprisingly well, where you can mix and match a number of skills, each of them tied to a character in the game, and the more you use them in different ways, the more you learn about the respective character. It's a great way to keep your playstyle constantly changing, and it ties really well into the story.Darren Korb is back and his music is as good as ever, possibly even better. Ashley Lynn Barrett voices the protagonist, Red, and the songs she sings are not only beautiful, they're all directly tied to the game's story.And finally, Logan Cunningham is back, which should be reason enough for you to buy this game.

												This game is bloody amazing. I didn't get into Bastion, somehow, though from what I've heard it was also a great game. But Transistor I know is great. My playtime is a bit low since I mostly played the game on PS4, and there I'm halfway NG+.The combat system is extremely interesting and original. One thing is the timestopping feature (or something more like ""planning phase"", to be exact) combined with how the damage works. But the really amazing part is how there are multiple clever combinations of abilities and skills, and even modifiers to make the enemies stronger. It'll take a whole playthrough to just find out all of them, and figuring out how they work together, and with the difficulty scaling up just fine, you're bound to have a good time. While I could praise the combat system forever, that wouldn't make a very interesting review. So just know that it's awesome. The only bad thing really was that there were just a few skill combinations that made the game feel a bit too easy. But that kind of thing exists almost everywhere, really, and it definitely wasn't enough to make the system feel flawed at all.The voice acting was nice (and while this has nothing to do with the Steam version, it was just SO COOL to hear the Transistor's voice from your controller... It was like you were really carrying the thing!), as was the atmosphere — the feeling of being alone was only emphasized by the fact the only voice you ever heard was, well, a sword. The storytelling was interesting, too; facts being revealed in a nice, slow pace to keep things shrouded in a mystery, to be revealed slowly, bit by bit, through various means.That's what I have to say for now.

												I was surprised how different the gameplay is from Bastion. The combat is mostly turn based and there's no environment hazards other than enemies. The system for selecting skills and upgrades is very unique and really encourages trying different combinations. I like how the complexity grows over time, but never feels overwhelming. It has the same clever system as Bastion for customizing the difficulty with debuffs for rewards.The story is bat-♥♥♥♥ insane, even more so than Bastion. It turns out to be a similar sort of apocalypse, but it feels like most of the collapsing is happening offscreen. I don’t really follow how all the character including your own fits into it. At the same time this makes the world feel very massive.I miss the destructible and animating environments of Bastion, but these are incredibly beautiful. All the character an enemy design is wonderful. The music is amazingly good, but is much harder to describe than Bastion’s mix of Indian and Western.It’s tough to live in the shadow of Bastion. This isn’t my favorite game this year and didn’t meet my very high expectations, but I still like almost everything about it and was left wanting more. It probably the most stylish turn-based combat games I’ve ever played. It’s pretty different from almost anything else I’ve ever played including Bastion, so it’s worth experiencing for that. "

We're not going to get away with this are we? What happened when you combine great gameplay with amazing skill mechanic, creative plot and remarkable soundtrack. Find it interesting? Happens one of the best unique game that calls Transistor. Same as Bastion you can find here tons of similarities from mute main character to the same narrator actor (Logan Cunningham).

												Well, that was playthrough #1. After doing all challenges, listening to and reading everything I possibly could and only once having to use the ""Retry"" function, Steam tells me I have 7 hours under my belt.The following is my critique of the game, ignoring the New Game+ mode (for now). While I do reference Supergiant Games' first title, Bastion, quite heavily, the points I make should also be accessible to players who have yet to play Bastion (seriously, get that game). While I try to be objective, some sections of this review are highly subjective; the game suffers from virtually no technical (and thus ""objectively objective"") faults and what I point out as bad may appear as ""creative"" or ""challenging"" or just ""different"" to others.Please refer to additional reviews and critiques before you decide whether or not you want to buy Transistor.THIS CRITIQUE CONTAINS VERY MINOR SPOILERS!If you want to avoid even those, skip to the conclusion section at the end.Transistor is an isometric tactical Action-RPG with a linear story.First of all, the things I was happy with - THE GOOD:- The MUSIC, obviously. Darren Korb and Ashley Barret did an amazing job and the music leaves little to be desired. It's a different style than Bastion's soundtrack, so, of course, whether you like it more or less than Bastion's is a matter of taste, but it is very atmospheric and carries the game together with- LOGAN CUNNINGHAM'S NARRATION. No surprises there. The music may be the soul of the game but the expert narration (and fantastic voice acting) are its heart.- The DESIGN. The world of Transistor is original and colorful; the ""feel"" is the same as in Bastion but it has a distinctly different theme; the result is stellar.- CUSTOMIZATION. The ability to collect a variety of skills, all of them with different effects, depending on whether they are active, passive or modifying an active skill, makes for some interesting (and tough) choices as to how you want to play. Not everything works well but you can try everything.Now to the things that I was less impressed with - THE MEH:- The COMBAT SYSTEM. Sadly, it is nowhere near as great as (I) expected. Precision is not its strong point and those who were hoping for Frozen Synapse levels of refined tactical combat will be disappointed, as will be those that expected a slick Hack&Slash. Some sections are almost impossible to beat with only one of the modes but intelligent use of both does not help in all situations and more often than not (especially later on), you can find yourself cheesing the game in less-than-fun ways when you encounter fights that are frustrating enough that you'd like to skip them, due to issues with- The BALANCING. Few enemies are balls-to-the-wall hard, but many are insanely annoying. Having to deal with enemies who have the ability to cloak themselves (which, somehow, also makes them invulnerable) without the player having any way to disrupt this cloak (other than waiting for them to deal damage to you) or to damage them in cloak makes several mid- and endgame sections downright infuriating. Especially if said enemies are rapidly regenerating health. Several enemy attacks cannot be avoided and the player's ability to heal himself is extremely limited, making the whole combat system less a matter of skill and more one of a proper choice of abilities (which is where the combat system is at odds with its RPG elements); due to this, some fights (especially boss fights) and victories are anything but satisfying and can leave a bitter aftertaste.- The CHARACTERS. While Bastion had only a few characters with little depth but strong-enough features to make them relatable and carry the story, Transistor has almost none. ""The voice"" is the strongest one by far but remains a lot more blank than Bastion's narrator. The female lead, Red, has even less than that (or Bastion's Kid). The human antagonists are hardly characterized at all and what remains is a faceless menace that changes the world around you and attacks you constantly... and yet fails to really make you feel threatened.- The STORY. Where Bastion's story was about a simple goal for most of the game (restoring the Bastion), Transistor lacks direction. You feel like a tourist who is being guided from one landmark to the other without any drive or ultimate goal behind it, which becomes even more apparent at the game's conclusion. The plot works with local tension only (i.e. short-term obstacles and goals). The lack of strong characters makes it hard to build-up a bad guy and the pace at which the city changes and the threat swallows it leaves no time to make you care about it or its inhabitants. Unlike the Bastion, you didn't build it with your own two hands and, despite being in a city, you never get a chance to interact with anybody. This leaves the romance as its only redeeming factor... except it isn't either, because the main characters' interaction is very one-sided. The sad truth is: Transistor's story is forgetable.And finally - THE BAD:- WORLD DESIGN (SCOPE AND DEPTH). While the design is great, you hardly see anything of the city (or the rest of the world). Vistas are few and far between and the game doesn't feature any maps or background information that allows you to see the ""big picture"". Sadly, this devaluates most of the ingame biographies and what lore there is because it becomes that much harder to relate to for their lack of context.- The ENDING. It certainly isn't Mass Effect 3 levels of terrible but, frankly, it makes no sense. The game's conclusion renders pretty much the entire hero's journey pointless and I have to ask what motivation Red had in the first place. That isn't to say that it isn't beautiful in several ways but nonetheless highly disappointing if you were hoping for a well-written story.- The LENGTH. From what I have heard from several people, 7 hours is not a good time. It is quite possible to beat the game in under 5 hours. New Game+ may add replay value here, if you truly enjoyed the combat system and don't share my gripes with it, but if you don't, it leaves the question of value for your money. And, regardless of New Game+, my impression is that the game tries to do too much in too little time - Introducing you to a world, threatening this world and making you its involuntary savior has worked before... but it doesn't work for Transistor.MY VERDICT: (Or: tl;dr)Transistor is a good attempt to solve a task that was almost unsolvable - To create the next ""Bastion"". Design-wise, it is every bit as strong and a true treat for the eyes and ears, with some great ideas on how to keep progression interesting and your game experience unique. But a closer look reveals a system that tries to combine real-time and tactical combat and, as a result, is the master of neither. The beautiful world that seems so full and interesting is a facade, a mere stage decoration with too little behind it to keep it from falling over when leaned on, leaving a lot of the ingame lore without sufficient context. And while music and narration are great, they cannot hide the fact that the play itself is boring and the characters forgotten as soon as they leave the stage.Supergiant Games gave their game and its world too little time to introduce themselves and captivate you and the result is all the more disappointing for it.Nevertheless, I recommend Transistor for the interesting experience it is; you may find the combat system and story, despite their flaws, more satisfying than I did and, either way, you do not want to miss out on the soundtrack and Logan Cunningham's sexy voice. Supergiant Games deserves the money for a brave attempt, even if this attempt falls short. If you aren't dying to play Transistor right now, pick it up once it goes on sale.			"

												Transistor is probably an afterthought to many gamers out there, but to anyone who has played Bastion, this game is a must buy. To those of you who do not know the majesty of Supergiant games, Bastion and Transistor both share epic qualities that seem to be missing from most games today.In the simplest way to define Transistor: this is art, truly inspired art. I'm literally at a loss when it comes to reviewing this game. Supergiant manages to pull you into their story and make you feel like you are a part of it. Each character has some unique facet about them that can intrigue the player. Abilities are explained through some fabrication of a character's life. Everything has its mark in Transistor's world. The story is simply magnificent and a main driving point to the game. As a player, your eyes are met with a glorious palette of colors uniquely blended across the canvas of the game world. Every building, every character, and even every enemy, meshes together in loving unison. Nothing seems out of place and it all looks beautiful. Also, without fail, Supergiant delivers another amazing soundtrack for their game -- to compliment the beautiful scenery and character design, the background music is just as eloquent and wonderous. And to add to the soundtrack even more, the in-game music can be interacted with with the main character. Have you no will to play the game,  the soundtrack alone is worth the price. As short of a review as this may be, Supergiant did not disappoint -- not even in the slightest. I would highly recommend playing Transistor AND Bastion, if you haven't already. Thanks for your time.*Disclaimer: This is an opinion, obviously. You do not need to agree :p			"

 Bastion  was my favourite game of 2011. So you could say I was highly anticipating  Supergiant Games  next release -- which was revealed to be  Transistor  in 2013. After a long and patient wait, I've completed Transistor and I would like to share some of my thoughts and perhaps answer how it stacks up to Bastion.The story revolves around a character called  Red , who seems to be a singer superstar in the city of Cloudbank. After Red wakes up from an assassination attempt by a sinister group of high ranking public figures known as  The Camerata  and realising her voice was also stolen... Red pulls The Transistor out of a mysterious body next to her, and attempts to unravel what exactly happened to her. Little does she know though, that The Transistor can talk, and actually seems to know her. As Red starts to make her way out of the district, she is attacked by an army of robotic intelligences known as  The Process , who seem to be controlled by The Camerata.The story is more abstract, subtle and darker this time. I would say the story is not as immediatetely likeable as Bastion's story -- as the narrator for Bastion basically narrated and spelled everything out for you in a clearer way. In Transistor, the narrator is also your companion,  (voiced by Logan Cunningham once again, though with a much less gravelly and cool sounding tone) . You are more encouraged to explore the world this time to find out more about Cloudbank's lore instead of relying on the narrator.What is amazing is how the story also mechanically ties into the gameplay . You come across various slain characters in the story that you absorb into The Transistor, gaining new abilities. Abilities are multifaceted, so each ability can be used as an active/upgrade/passive and can be mixed and matched for some cool possibilities. You unlock character lore by using each ability in one of the 3 types of slots. It's quite a brilliant and elegant way of doing lore if I must say so myself.You have 4 ability slots which can be upgraded (via leveling up) to have 2 upgrade slots each and you can also unlock 4 passive slots. As you can imagine, this gives Transistor much more depth and customisability this time around compared to Bastion. You can play the game in real time like any normal ARPG... but Transistor also adds a layer of strategic depth with it's new feature called the planning stage -- letting you pause, queue and plan your attacks (with a short global cooldown for all your abilities as a penalty).There is no overworld hub this time like in Bastion, but you do come across back doors -- taking you to a mini oasis of sorts. Here is where you can access all of the challenges known as  tests . Beating each test unlocks a track for you to listen to. Supergiant also added a feature where if you press tab, Red can hum to every track in the game. I love and appreciate this small attention to detail. You can also gaze up at the stars on your hammock and listen to what the Transistor has to say on your current situation and also play with your process dog named Luna (Dota reference?).The idol system from Bastion also makes its return, but in the form of limiters in Transistor. Limiters can be toggled on and off making the game harder but also granting more experience with each limiter you enable (up to 10 limiters). Limiters also have their own lore to be unlocked by using them at least once. The game becomes VERY CHALLENGING with 10 limiters enabled and is not for the feint of heart.The music for Transistor is also incredible once again. It has a bit more of a jazzy and eery sci-fi vibe this time compared to the more upbeat tunes of Bastion. In only 2 games, Darren Korb has cermented himself as one of my favourite game composers of all time. Instant classics, and I can't wait to hear more from this very talented man.Now, I'm praising this game to the high heavens, but what are some of my  dislikes ? Every time you are taken to 0 health, one of your abilities will be overloaded, and can't be used until you reach the next checkpoint. It is a unique way of handling failure, but I didn't really like the idea of having your skills being stripped from you as it can basically ruin the idea of your build if you make a mistake. It also seems random on what skill you will lose -- which is  severely  punishing -- especially when you are trying to complete some of the later performance tests where if you lose 1 crucial skill, you basically have no hope of finishing the test without restarting the whole test and playing flawlessly. The developers also forgot to add a restart test option to the menu which was frustrating when you are attempting them over and over. Frankly, I also didn't think the tests/challenges were as well designed as they were in Bastion.Transistor is another monumental achievement by Supergiant Games. It shows they are maturing as a developer. Some people probably thought Bastion's narrator was a bit of a gimmick, and that the story was all it had going for it. Transistor shows that Supergiant also understand how to craft a more mechanically deep and subtle game this time, while still sticking to their strengths of unique story-telling via narration and music.

												As a preface, I would like to state that SuperGiant's previous game, 'Bastion,' is one of my favourite games of all time. If I present an obvious bias or compare the two games on unfair grounds, then I appologise in advance.   First let us discuss what Transistor does right. The gameplay presented is the same isometric world navigation that was apparant in Bastion, the major difference being its approach to combat. It abandons the hectic run-and-gun/hammer skirmishes of the former and instead takes a far more intelligent plan and execute method. The player can temporarily pause time and plan out their battle strategy before hitting the pause button again and watching it play out at lightning speeds. The numerous variaties of enemies and the layouts of the battlefields provide ample chances to scratch that 'General Chessmaster' itch. The massive amount of weapons (called 'functions()') alsoadd to the tactical depth of this game. Each weapon can be equiped in one of four wepon slots, where it functions normally, firing lasers, dropping bombs etc. Each weapon may also be assigned to either a passive slot, providing you a powerful, perk-like bonus, or to an upgrade slot, in which one weapon buffs the other (LASERS THAT ALSO DROP BOMBS!?). The amount of combinations is truely staggering and will be greatly apprieciated by gamers who like a more intelligent approach to their combat (myself included).   Next the art style. Although the more charming cartoon-like character proportions from Bastion are gone in favor of a more realistic-(ish) art style, the vibrant colours and tones make a glorious return. The mood and the tone of various scenes are masterfully enchanced by use of reccuring temperatures and unique art assets. The forboding height of Coudbank City, as presented soon after the beggining of the game, is alleviated by the cool yellow and blue lighting, giving it a more distant, lonesome feeling, to give one example.   And the soundtrack, oh my, the soundtrack. I was so thrilled to hear that Darren Korb would be returning and boy does he deliver in the audio department. Echoing guitar riffs and droning synthesizers, alongside beautifully melancholic vocals do wonders to nail the sad, lonely cyberpunk feel that is so greatly apprieciated by big nerds such as myself. Particular standouts for me are 'In Circles,' 'Forecast' and 'The Spine.'  And now to cover what I personally was let down by. The story. WAIT! Allow me to expand. (No spoilers don't fret!) The characters themselves are very nicely portrayed, with excellent moments of individual characterisation, but I took issue with the game's plot, its over-arching story. You are dropped right into the world with zero idea of who these characters are, where you are, or what the hell is going on in general. 'But that happened in Bastion too!' I hear you shout. Yes you woke up in a floating bed in Bastion with zero understanding of what was happening, but this created a sense of wonder as the game's  plot was quickly given to you, (The world blew up, but the Bastion can fix it) and as you progressed the world, characters and other various story flavor was gradually revealed to you in satisfying amounts from level to level. And most importantly by the game's end all questions had been answered. This is not the case with Transistor. Although it does a good job with the aforementioned characterisation and also with the same story flavor being drip fed to you, major components of the the plot are flat out not explained, which frustrated me greatly as it gave me difficulty in understanding vital things such as character motivations. These questions are also not addressed, or at least not in any way a near satisfactory level, by the games end. The final boss in particular was very confusing for me, the fight itself comes out of nowhere and takes place in a very strange location and I found myself thinking 'WHAT THE HELL IS HAPPENING? WHY ARE WE FIGHTING NOW? WHERE-WHA-BUT I DIDN'T.........' and soon after the fight the game ends. The ending itself is rather emotional, but I couldn't get into the mood the game wanted me to due to my extreme frustration and confusuion owing to the fact that the credits were rolling and my questions had not been answered. Now I'm not some fool who only enjoys simple by-the-numbers stories, I understand that not all questions need to be answered, but jesus christ SOME would have been nice. Thematically , the game is not as strong as Bastion. It is clearly attempting to make commentary on topics such as the irrelevance of an individual in a system, and the fickleness of the general public but it falls flat if suitable context is not provided.   To summerise: Wonderfully cereberal combat with powerfull art and sound direction that is only let down by its adequately explained story. Or maybe I'm just ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.			"

												MUSIC AND ARTWORK:Absolutely fantastic.  They do a wonderful job together of drawing you into this surreal world.10/10UI:Flawless.  UI's in games are usually pretty bad, and I'm a UI-stickler.  However, this game's UI was clearly carefully thought-out by a professional.  It always contained all the information I needed, yet was never in the way.  There was never a time I wanted to do something and thought to myself ""Crap, how do I do that again?""10/10GAMEPLAY:The fighting in this game looks artificially similar to Bastion, but the ability to pause the action and execute multiple attacks in succession makes it feel completely different.  The battles end up being much more about turn-based tactics than quick reflexes.Different powers are unlocked throughout the course of the game.  Each power can be used as an attack, an upgrade to a different attack, or a passive boost.  This mixing-and-matching opens up a wide variety of strategies for each fight; if one matchup of powers doesn't work well for a fight, you can try again with a *completely* different strategy.  This keeps the game fresh and interesting, even on subsequent playthroughs.On the forums, many people complained about the battles being repetative, but I completely disagree; due to your ability to completely change your lineup of powers, every battle felt fresh and interesting.My one complaint is that you only start out with three (I think?) powers, so you have to wait a short while before you can make the more interesting matchups.  And since the game is so short, ""a short while"" ends up being half of the game.8/10STORY:This is where things turn sour.  The story in this game is very open-ended, to the point of being lazy.  It's (obviously) difficult to critique the story without giving any spoilers, but suffice it to say there are a LOT of story-elements that are never explained or even hinted at.**Minor spoilers ahead** (but I'll keep things vague to avoid ruining the story)All of the characters are hilariously under-developed, even (or *especially*) the main two.  It's to the point where, when you fight one of the bosses, you not only don't feel anything when they die, you don't even know why you're fighting them to begin with.  Also, one very obvious lead-up to a boss-fight ends in a very contrived, almost non-sensical Deus Ex Machina.As for the the main two characters, you end up not caring what happens to them, because you barely know anything about them.  On top of that, the ending feels incredibly forced and out-of-place.The whole thing reeks of lazy writing.**End of minor spoilers**2/10GAME LENGTH:The game is pretty short - only about 5 hours long, and that's *if* you complete all the side-challenges you can.  The game feels like the creators had planned on there being more content, since all of the side quest-y stuff (unlocking all the character-stories, finishing the side-challenges, the majority of the optional achievements) are impossible to complete in a single playthrough - you don't meet enough enemies or enter the ""Backdoor"" enough times to complete them.It feels like at some point the developers said ""I think we've worked hard enough, let's just polish and release it already,"" so they did.  This is corroborated by how incomplete the storyline is.5/10OVERALLI don't regret my purchase, but I was expecting more.  Some people will think the gameplay and wonderful atmosphere make the game worth $20, even if it's so short and lacking on story (or, if you're the artsy type, maybe you enjoy open-ended stories).  Others will feel betrayed by the lack of content.  Depending on which type of person you are, I'd either recommend buying it now, or waiting for a sale, respectively.  But either way, I think it's worth playing.8/10			"

												Alright, I'm going to say this first: A year ago, when the first trailer of this game was revealed, I cried so much. Not only was this going to be another game from SuperGiantGames, the creators of one of my favorite games, Bastion, but the trailer was excellent, blending in beautiful music with awesome gameplay and cutscenes. I forgot about the game over time, with college and projects distracting me, and it was only until a month ago that my love for the game returned. Just like many fans of the game, I was ""riding the hype train"" as the release date got nearer and nearer. As soon as it was on Steam I preordered it and the soundtrack, which was $30 out of my wallet.Was it worth it? Very much so. I might be still riding the hype train some, but I can still recognize the positive and negative aspects this game has.Story------------------------------------------------I was rather surprised on how the story went. Instead of focusing on Red as the character who advances the story, I found that the Transistor, the sword-like weapon she wields, did most of that job for her. It talks and knows her in some way, but also Red is somewhat of a silent protagonist. She's not like Gordon Freeman from the Half-Life series or Chell from Portal, as you can make her hum by holding the tab button (when I learned I could do that I squeed loudly), but is mostly silent throughout the game. Players will understand why this is early on in the game. Still though, Red and the Transistor work well together and make an amazing duo.The Transistor, being both a main character and the main tool of the player, is not some ethereal being with all the answers. It acts more like a regular person, one that feels love and courage and a sense of honor. This personality, plus Red, can make the player feel attached to both characters as they bond throughout the game. During my playthrough, I got to a scene where the pair finds a bath house and Red proceeds to wash herself. Of course the actually washing isn't shown, but the way the Transistor reacted to this made me laugh. That's what really showed me the Transistor's regular personality.I did enjoy the story as a whole and the ending is a must-see. However, I was disappointed that not much was explained about the setting of the game. If one is to save a city/ town/ country/ etc they should know the importance of it. Yes there are a lot of people in Cloudbank, some very good people, but I would have like to know more about the actual. ""How did it come to be?"" ""What was in the city that made it so grand?"" ""What was the economic structure before everything went to hell?"" ""Who was in charge?"" Those questions, and some others, were some that I felt should have been answered because they would have helped the plot make sense.Gameplay------------------------------------------------The gameplay in Transistor is different from Bastion. It's more strategic because your main ability, Turn(), freezes time and allows you to set up a number of combos and positions in order to maul your enemies to dust. Though you can also use your abilities on their own, a chain of attacks with the Transistor (the sword-like weapon our heroine, Red, wields) can clear a battlefield in seconds. Plus, if you make a mistake with your planning and have yet to initialize it, you can always go back, redo it, then unleash your power.As always though, there's a catch: After using Turn(), there is a recharge period where most of your abilities are unavailable to you and your more often defenseless. The results of what you can do though definitely outweigh the risk. Turn() to me made the game strategic, but also fast-paced at times. You have to analyze your situation and really think instead of just rushing into battle. Planning and is a major part of the game and it's what makes it so fun.You have four skills at your disposal, but you also have an upgrade slot to each (plus another upgrade slot that you can unlock later on), and passive skills that are always constant (a total of four you can unlock). Each of these three types slots give different effects to each skill and that, plus the the number of combinations you can set for upgrades, gives you a wide arrange of possibilities. For example, one of my favorite skills was ""flash-stepping"", with added bonuses of releasing balls of damaging energy along my path and a parasite that chewed away at an enemy that it homed in on. A harmless flash-step because a deadly barrage.The difficulty of the game goes up as you go through the game and it became quite tough at times and sometimes repetative. However, I find it to be not too hardcore, but good middle ground, with easy bits at the beginning and angering parts at the end (though I'm also a fast learner and have experience in video games so it might be different for other people).Other------------------------------------------------The art style of Transistor is very similar to Bastion's. It's very well done, with great effects and cutscenes through the story. Not only that, but the music fits well throughout the game. Both of these combined create a beautiful canvas as you set up your attacks.Oh yeah, there isn't really a menu. You just get thrown into the game.Overall------------------------------------------------To wrap up all this review said, Transistor has:+ Great main characters+ Great gameplay+ A wide variety of play styles+ Game mode plus+ Graphics/ art style+ Awesome music/ soundtrack- Lack of info on Cloudbank/ main setting- Short playthrough (if that's a bother)- Sometimes repetive fight scenesThis was definitely a fun game to play. It was just how I expected it to be and thrilled it was like that. Though somewhat short (I beat it in about 9 hours as I collected stuff and enjoyed the story), it does have a New Game Plus mode similar to Bastion's where you have all the progress from the previous game and start from the very beginning. Only thing different is that all the enemies are tougher, so you still have challenge as you fight once more through Cloudbank. I'll be definitely going through it soon.If you're a fan of Bastion, I highly recommend that you get this game. If you like RPGs, strategy, and some fast-paced fighting, I also recommend you buy this game. Twenty bucks was definitely worth it for me and many others who preordered it as well.			"

												I am an enormous fan of Bastion - and have been following the development of Transistor with hesitant optimism ... Wondering if they will be able to capture that same magic that Bastion had ... since it was such a unique and new voice in video games when it first came out ...I can say ... without a doubt ... that they have captured all of the magic that made Bastion great ... and that the music, the art style, the narration, the combat system ... just everything about this game is everything I had hoped it could be .... I am only a small part through the game but already while I am typing this ... I am thinking about the game ... and the world that is there to explore ... and the small touches they have used to bring that world to life around you ...SuperGiant Games have done an absolutely incredible job ... this is a game everybody should play ... at least once! 8-)For those who would rather see the art and hear the music ... here is the first part of my playthrough of the game 8-)

Other times I can recognize quality surpassing such an arbitrary ratio within an hour of play. Transistor is one of those games. The voice acting is, as always, top notch. The music is amazing, I might buy the album. For ♥♥♥♥'s sake, there's a ""hum"" button and your charactor will hum along to the background music. Talking swords. Dude. Talking. Sword.

												Short and sort of flat, Transistor could've been a lot better, longer and deeper. The combat has potential, but you can miss it entirely in that whooping 2,5 hour long that is Transistor. Art and sound design are top notch, but Bastion did it better. Transistor stops being Transistor and goes back to being Rucks about 40 minutes in, albeit lacking old mans charm and powers of observation.Get Bastion and then Transistor with 75% discount.			"

I feel like I should actually write a serious review of this game.I'll start by saying: If you didn't like Bastion, you won't like this at all. The storytelling is very similar. The game is also pretty short, I finished clocking in at 5 hours (did not 100% obviously, you need NG+ to unlock all the different powers and such). But during NG+, I don't see the story changing much. It will be something for only completionists.But, outside of that I found Transistor to be a great experience. Supergiant delivers again with a chillingly beautiful soundtrack, Darren Korb proving his skills at composing. As a person who loved the art style of Bastion, Transistor does not differ a lot from it with the exception of having more ""3d"" models as compared to the mostly 2D Bastion, this is most easily seen on your protagonist. The voice acting in the game is top notch, Logan Cunningham giving another near perfect preformance on his character and as the narrator. The enviroments are always beautiful to look at, if a little confusing to navigate at times. The story kept me hooked all the way through the game, with the characters being fleshed out along the way, never feeling generic and always very enthralling.The combat in the game was a very interesting idea executed well, but not to perfection. It can feel tedious at times and frustrating at others when something just doesn't lineup perfectly. Endgame, you will probably have a combo that will be able to instagib the strongest enemies, you only obstacle being the cooldown bar on your Turn(), which is the main form of combat in Transistor. It's a strategic pause that allows you to set up a bunch of moves that enemies can not react to for the most part. With the backstab mechaninc and the variety of Functions (moves), it has more uses than just being a ""VATS"" like way of fighting ala Fallout. While recharging, its a game of dodging attacks before you can go back in on the enemies.Where the combat really shines is how varried you can make your moveset. Each unlockable function is very different than the last, and aren't just moves: they can be infused to combine with other functions (Example: combine the knockup and the pull functions to create an AOE pull) or can be used as passive traits, all taking up some of your power bar, limiting how many functions you can have going.The stories included with each function are a very nice touch that fit the asthetic very well, but unlocking all 3 pieces can be a pain sometimes, since each one will need to occupy each of the 3 uses (passive, upgrade or move) to unlock the full story. Luckily, you only need one battle in each use to unlock each part and with an upgrade station seemingly after every battle you should unlock them all quickly and be able to go back to a more comfortable moveset. There was only a few spots in the game I would consider ""hard"", for the most part your average player should be able to blow through their first NG with relative ease. The enemies aren't the brightest, not to say that they are bad, but sometimes they will just stare at you as you recharge behind a wall, not even bothering to try and pressure you to move. Death is also really hard to achieve, after reaching 0 HP you will get a ""free turn()"" where you can try and save yourself or win the fight with your what you have left. If you fail and get hit again, you will lose one of your functions socketed. But, since you will usually have 4, chances are you will most likely never lose them all. I have never lost one, so I could not say if they are gone forever, but seeing the difficulty of the game I assume you recover them at the next station. The only time dying will really matter is in the training & challenge areas, where if you die once or twice you may just restart a challenge.Is it worth playing through? Absolutely, it's a beautiful experiece. Is it worth the current $20? That's a bit more debatable, due to it's shorter length. I wouldn't say not to buy it, but the second it goes on sale it is a must grab.			"

												I had high expectations because of Bastion. But i don't recommend it because of some points:* The narration. Bastion had an innovative narration and this game tries to copy that but in the end it just make random comments and it really distracts you from the game. ""Oh, i guess they don't like to swim"" as you pass by a pond. ""Let me tell you a joke.. What's the difference between... You know what? nevermind"" during a lift ride (loading screen disguised)* The Combat. It is nice in the beggining but gets repetitive really fast. you do get some powers but they mostly play out the same. You fully heal between fights and can save everywhere. If you die, you don't really die as the time stops and you lose one of your attacks until the second next checkpoint. I really wish it had more depth, but in the end it was  1- stop time 2- queue some attacks 3- run as your time stop ability recharges 4- repeat* The story. I am a little biased because i skipped all terminals. Or maybe i skipped them all because the reading doesnt really fit the action oriented gameplay. I didn't understand many points but in the end i didnt bother going after the information. I was just happy the game was ending. Also, I didn't care about the protagonist.* The protagonist. Female silent protagonist. you are supposed to feel her emotions through her music (why is she a singer anyway?) and like her because of her appearance (red haired, nice body, etc). But you don't. She is shallow. Lacks personality. She just does what the sword tells her to do. The ending went against what was being shown, though.* The length. It was quick. Surprisingly quick. When the final cutscene appeared i though I was just less than halfway though but it was actually the end. I was just level 11 and still had space for countless powers and upgrades. i didn't even unlock most restrictions.  What happened ?* The linearity. I guess if they went a route a little more like bastion it would have been better. many stages that you get a new power per stage, or something like that. But this game just makes you follow the path and that is it.I really loved the ending, though. But it doesn't make the game any betterI wish i liked it, but i really didn't.			"

What I liked: EverythingWhat You Need to Know: The art style is gorgeous just like they did with Bastion The music and main character singing in some songs is peaceful and fits the mood perfect You get a dedicated hum button, that's sole purpose is to hear the majestic voice of Red( main character) Main story might be hard to fully grasp for some people. Like who some characters are, what's this sword in my hand's purpose? and what the overall arc of the story might be. I loved the story The talking sword , similiar to the voice in Bastion, offers great dialogue and story to keep your engaged Combat is so satsifying and easy to understand. You get abilities and each have a main use, passive and secondary use, all vary depending on which you choice, giving alot of combations Combat is like a diablo style game, but you pause the game to chain abilities before activating them. A cooldown is needed afterwards to use your abilities again You can still go real time, but it's harder and actually slower New game plus starts the game with the leveled up enemies and your abilities, you won't have all unlocked once you first beat the game There are challenges that are optional, but really great, that help you level up, unlock music to listen to in-game, with a challenge room only for NG+My Score:A+Price:$5Completed in:6 hours first time( more if you go NG+, which I did)Games similar:  Bastion ShadowRun "

												One of the tags for this game is for its soundtrack, and understandably so, with its gorgeous music and vocals that you will find yourself humming to yourself long after you play it. But this game has many other strengths as well, from the stunning art to game play dynamics to the intriguing, futuristic world that feels so hauntingly believable. And last, but certainly not least, is the story itself. Wonderfully told in a very dynamic style not much seen these days that will keep you playing forward just on its merits alone. Plus the relationships between characters and how they fit in the story, and character development are executed in a delightful manner. Warning: You may get slightly attached to them.Overall, this is a very well put together game that was a real pleasure to play. And, even if you don’t play many RPG, turned-based games (like myself), this one is still definitely worth checking out.10/10 I am playing again (trust me you’ll want to play again).			"

It took me 10ish hours while doing a lot of the challenge mission thingies, but I didn't do all of them (the dogs' fault mainly).

												Very rarely is it that a game can surprise me - and Transistor managed to surprise me with just about everything.  It set the perfect mood with its beautiful art style and soundtrack.  The gameplay was variable without being overbearing and tied into the storytelling elements with seamless grace.  In short, Transistor is the kind of game I get to play perhaps once every couple of years, if I'm lucky, and it will stay with me for a very long time to come.  Mainstream titles wish they were as good as this.

												I just beat this game and here is why you should buy it.Good:- Very good engaging story- Superb music- Beautiful artstyle, especially during the cutscenes.- Combat system is like nothing you've seen before, with the choice of switching between real-time and a planning mode, without either feeling superior.- Very deep upgrade system that let's you play like you want to play.- Has a New Game+ mode called Recursion that randomizes enemy encounters, so you can replay it with added difficulty if you feel like it.- Has a 'limiter'-system that allows you to change the difficulty on the fly with various different debuffs/buffs to you and the enemies respectively. Adding difficulty this way gives bonus exp.- Has checkpoints that allow you to change your loadout almost every 2-3 minutes.Bad/not as good:- Took me 4 hours to beat, could have been a little longer, but wasn't needed. It provided the necessary closure.- The gameplay is mostly just moving from fight to fight. You walk a (mostly) pre-determined path and once every 2 or 3 minutes you fight something. Not sure what they could have done to make this better though, since I found the combat system really enjoyable.- Some of the lore is locked behind your combat abilities, and this lore is unlocked by using the abilities as just a normal ability, as an upgrade to an existing ability, or as a passive bonus. I understand that this is done to make you explore different ability-combinations and to try out all of the different combinations, but I found it annoying that I had to change away from my favorite loadout if I wanted the complete story.

												I enjoyed Bastion. Bastion had pizazz. And honestly, have always been a sucker for the isometric camera in games. So this was one of those safe bet kinda things. The short version of this is: I thought Transistor was terrific. Doesn't overstay its welcome. Fun take on combat and on that tired ol' skill tree.Play if you like: Portishead, Bastion, noir stylings, sci-fi jazz, le 'moods'.   Also, (Supergiant Games own) Greg Kasavin's favourite game of all time is Ultima V on the Apple II. That's on record. Ultima V is also one of my favourite games. So really this thing couldn't have done wrong. Guess that renders all this kinda moot.			"

Characters are way better than some ""big"" rpgs, action is fast, deep and full of strategy and adrenalin, and art and soundtrack are just godlike. I never was into that indie genre, but now I may reconsider this. Tiny little game wich doesnt even have a main menu is way better that many AAA projects. Authors are really talented and they really wanted to make the Game, to make user think and not just watch some move-like crap with QTE.			"

 Truely AmazingMy First review to a game, i will try my best to tell you the pro's and cons with my personal expierence throught the game.I am an Indie Game Lover. Transistor is one of those titles that  pulled off what indie game spirit is all about. It is visually stunning with isometric graphics and a beautiful setting in a futuristic world which looks something like futuristic tokyo. It has a narrative story which is well driven with a mystery element to it.The most amazing part of the game though, is the GAMEPLAY and the Combat mechanics with no tutorial given, it is left for the player to figure it out. The controls are like MOBA(if you play from a keyboard+mouse), but the gameplay is nowhere near it(in a positive way), the combat style is highly customizable which gives every player the chance to adapt and change their playstyle as required and making the game more enjoyable. With a large repertoire of moves and the adrenaline rush obtained from implementing combos and  the stratergy of planning the moves makes the game unique and fun to play.Pros--Highly cutomizable gameplay mechanics -Stunning visuals- Phenomenal Soundtrack -Well Narrated storyline with a Mystery element - Good Difficulty level of the game(which may be a con for some players)Cons--Occasional framedrops and lag but its indie so can't really complain-No tutorial may be a negative for first timers or people new to gaming-Slow driven storyline and not that strong.( for me gameplay superceded the weak story)			"

												This game is everything you'd expect from SuperGiant Games, which is great, but also a little disappointing. The artwork, music, story and acting is phenomenal, and the gameplay is rock solid --- just like Bastion, by which I mean that it's great like Bastion is great, but also that it's great in pretty much the exact same ways that Bastion is great. It's not Bastion 2, but you wouldn't know it if it wasn't for the title. I can certainly understand that it'd be nearly impossible for SuperGiant Games to release a game without having it constantly compared to Bastion --- and maybe that's why they chose to not deviate too much from what made Bastion amazing. I don't know. But I have already played Bastion and been thoroughly amazed by it. Obviously a second iteration of the formula isn't going to leave the same impression, and thus Transistor falls a little flat, which is completely unfair to say after using adjectives such as ""phenomenal"" and ""rock solid"" about it, but that's the reality. It's a phenomenal and rock solid game that somehow doesn't quite impress as much as you'd expect it to. I'd still recommend it in a heartbeat though. And, I do want to say that the biggest deviation from SuperGiant Games' previous indie smash hit, the combat system, is really, really good and it makes battles feel very futuristic, manageable and awesome.TL;DR: This game has everything that Bastion had --- and more. And that is, however weird it may sound, probably its weakest point.			"

												An excellent game from the creators of Bastion; The art is just as beautiful while being more urban-focused as opposed to the more natural/outland stylings of Bastion. The story is fed to you through monologues from your weapon (the Transistor) and through news and information terminals scattered throughout the game.Definitely buy this with the soundtrack, the music is excellent and atmospheric.

												Game Name: TransistorOriginal Release: 2014Personal Rating: AEstimated Playtime:18 HoursMultiplayer/Coop?: NonePlayed on: Steam ControllerTransistor is an indie game created from the same makers of Bastion. It is a unique rpg that has an interesting balance between turn-based gameplay and real time gameplay.Controls: When I played this, I used the Steam Controller. It wasn’t hard to use at all, and it seemed rather natural to use a controller with the game. Joystick seemed prime for the movement option, and the four buttons on the face of the controller worked really well with the four skills that you have to use in-game.Graphics: This isn’t a Crysis level of graphics. Coming straight out of an indie studio, it seems unique and more like art. Cut-scenes mix in well with the 2.5D gameplay, and it’s easy to figure out what is happening as time goes on.Music: Much like Bastion, Supergiant Games (the creators) release excellent soundtracks and this is no exception. Between the songs that you unlock and Red’s (the Main Character) humming, you find yourself playing the game for the music instead of the gameplay.Overall: Transistor has a unique and potent combination of great music, easy controls and compelling gameplay, all within a fun game with an interesting plot. No super strategy is needed as you will eventually figure out the game throughout time. I would recommend it at any price, but it does drop down during the sales.			"

												Before anything, I will preface this and say if you have any interest in ARPG's and are looking for a wonderful and short experience, you SHOULD pick this game up. Well worth the $20 in my opinion.  If you want a detailed explanation, feel free to read and a TLDR is at the bottom.PROS:◘Visually pleasing to the eyes, absolutly gorgeous presentation in both animation and the enviornment.◘Sound design is top notch.◘Narration done throughout the game is fun to listen to.◘Can play with either mouse or keyboard.◘Fairly intriguing theme and story get you interested◘Should run fairly well on most machines.◘Fairly challenging as you can easily be ""killed"" multiple times during any battle.     ○When you ""die"" in combat, 2 things can happen: The first is on the brink of death you engage a emergency Turn mode (Turn is explained later below) and can fight to kill a few more enemies. The second possibility is that you ""break"" a function from combat for a while, and after visiting 2 (or more) Function Kiosks you can reactive them. If you break them, you are then forced to play around with your kit to experiment with new loadouts.◘Variety of combat with many different enemies with various different upgrade versions of them.◘Absolutely STELLAR combat system along with the configurations along with it (Which are detalied below)     ○As you play the game, you obtain various skills and upgrades through leveling up or finding them around the world and they are called Functions.     ○You can use these Functions in 3 ways: The first is the Active Function which you use for combat that does its base effect. The second is the Upgrade Function, where you take one of your Functions and use it to augment another Active Function, giving it special or different effect. And lastly is the Passive Function, in which you take a Function and put it into a passive state where it will always give a effect, or activate at specific under different conditions. EVERY Function in the game connects together in one way or another.     ○As you play the game, you are allowed to fight in either real time where you cast your abilities against the enemies movements and actions with no cooldown penalty, engage the Turn system to pause the game and tactically decide how you want to approach the situation. In Turn you can move almost instantly anywhere and manually aim your shots and action which are limited by a action bar. You then execute the procedure and watch your plan unfold rapidly. However, the downside to this is that once you are done with your Turn actions, you cannot use your abilities until your Turn meter has recharged. Because of these 2 systems you have a choice as to how you want to fight your battles.◘You can use ""limiters"" to further increase the difficulty of the game and gain a small amount of bonus EXP for leveling.◘New game plus mode with all of your stuff you unlocked. CONS:◘The UI can be just a little bit wonky with assigning Functions to various roles.◘Because the story is not made apparently clear at first, you can easily get lost.◘Turn actions that detail the effects may not always be accurate, as enemies may dodge and it doesn't tell you that information.◘May be just a bit short for some, as I and other have managed to beat the game at around 6 hours.◘Because there is new game plus and not much more, some people may not find a lot of replayability from this, resulting a 6 hour experience for $20 dollars.◘The only real set of graphics options are just resolutions.TLDR: Great combat, visuals and fun for ARPG fans. Can be beaten in about 6 hours, and depending on the user the new game plus can offer replayability.Can be of a bumpy ride for the first hour for people to get used to, but you get over it quickly.Overall, I feel that just about everyone should buy this beauty. The devs that made this deserve every dollar they earn and then some for the amount of effort and love that was poured into this game.			"

												I just beat this game and here is why you should buy it.Good:- Very good engaging story- Superb music- Beautiful artstyle, especially during the cutscenes.- Combat system is like nothing you've seen before, with the choice of switching between real-time and a planning mode, without either feeling superior.- Very deep upgrade system that let's you play like you want to play.- Has a New Game+ mode called Recursion that randomizes enemy encounters, so you can replay it with added difficulty if you feel like it.- Has a 'limiter'-system that allows you to change the difficulty on the fly with various different debuffs/buffs to you and the enemies respectively. Adding difficulty this way gives bonus exp.- Has checkpoints that allow you to change your loadout almost every 2-3 minutes.Bad/not as good:- Took me 4 hours to beat, could have been a little longer, but wasn't needed. It provided the necessary closure.- The gameplay is mostly just moving from fight to fight. You walk a (mostly) pre-determined path and once every 2 or 3 minutes you fight something. Not sure what they could have done to make this better though, since I found the combat system really enjoyable.- Some of the lore is locked behind your combat abilities, and this lore is unlocked by using the abilities as just a normal ability, as an upgrade to an existing ability, or as a passive bonus. I understand that this is done to make you explore different ability-combinations and to try out all of the different combinations, but I found it annoying that I had to change away from my favorite loadout if I wanted the complete story.

												Where to begin ...So far the game is good just like the soundtracks but not as good as bastion was imo.The game is very short, I think you can end it in 3h-3h30 if you rush it, i did it in 5 because most of the time i was trying some ""side mission"" and was experimenting the combination between the skills and there are no difficulty through the whole game but I still recommand the game to support SuperGiant Game to develop more games like Transistor and Bastion, but you might want to wait a sale to get it because 18.99€ might be a little expensive for 3h of gaming.7/10			"

												While the game is quite short, it's a lovely story with some breathtaking visuals. The combat system is fresh and fun, but is easily gamed during your second playthrough, where you can make some pretty OP combinations. Compared to Bastion, this game feels a little weaker, story wise, but the gameplay is much more solid this time around.If there was one thing that I'd criticize this game for though, it feels like this game was built for controllers.8.5/10			"

												Transistor is an RPG by the creators of Bastion. Similarly to their previous game, the art, story, and sound design are all fantastic. The combat is a weird hybrid between real-time and turn-based that will probably be hit-or-miss with most people. The robust skill system was incredible and is probably one of Transistor's best features.The combat is different than most other games. You can move and attack in real time, but you'll find it difficult to survive without using the Turn() feature. Turn() pauses the game and allows you to plan out your next few movements and attacks. The planned actions will then be executed very quickly, without the enemies being able to attack or move. Turn() then goes on cooldown for a few seconds and most of your skill won't be usable. This creates a turn-like tempo in the the fights where you attack with Turn() and then play defensively when it's on cooldown.  The combat takes a little getting used to and won't be for everyone, but it really works well with the skill system.The skill system is one of the games best features. I didn't unlock all of the skill on the first playthough, but there are at least 16 of them. Each skill can be used in 3 ways.1. Active Skill: The skills you use in combat. You get 4 active skill slots.2. Augementation: Each active slot has two augmentation slots which alter the effect of the active skill.3. Passive Skill: Each skill has a different passive effect when placed in one of the 4 passive slots.Although this seems to be overly complex, you only start with a couple skills, the 4 active slots, and an augmentation slot for each of them. You gain additional skills and slots when you level up so the game does a good job of easing you into the skill system. Furthermore, the game does an excellent job of pushing you to experiement and try new skill combinations. I had a lot of fun experimenting with the skills and trying to find effective combinations.In conclusion, Transistor is a great game. If you liked Bastion, or are a fan of turn based RPGs, you should get this game. If you're unsure that you'll like the combat, you should look at a couple gameplay videos, but try not to spoil the story for yourself.			"

												A spiritual successor to Bastion? Well, that's right, but it's not just that. This game has a whole lot of content to be explored, such as the backstory of Cloudbank, the reasons behind the Process starting their attacks on Goldwalk, how and why Red got the Transistor and what's the connection between her and the one inside the Transistor. The battle system couldn't be more impressive, as you must have a lot of vision on what will happen to decide your own actions in a turn, taking into account not only the reactions you cause with your actions, but the actions the enemy may take when you attack. One such example is the Younglady (no spoilers are given), which can be somewhat frustrating at first, but it still makes you want to keep trying untill you finally manage to break the pattern. This not to mention the huge amount of possibilities there are to use the Functions in many different ways, using them as Active, Passive or Upgrades. I was very satisfied with the story, gameplay, visual, soundtrack... The game as a whole is astonishing. I highly recommend giving it a try if you like RPGs, and even if you don't enjoy RPGs that much, you may change your mind with this game.			"

												It's beautiful, it's unique, and it's got an engaging storyline to boot! For the first few minutes I wasn't sure if I was playing the game right or getting the most out of the experience. I knew I had to be doing something wrong. But in time I got the hang of it, and found that nearly dying every round was just part of the fun.But there's more to it. What really turned me off was halfway through the game I realized that there wasn't anything new turning up. I felt like I was just doing the same-old challenge, over and over again, just with different enemies. It didn't feel exciting anymore. It was a menial task to fight.Don't get me wrong, though.

												Transistor is a game with many, many great aspects, but one inherent flaw that will completely kill the game for many (particularly those who are less gaming-inclined). Let me start with the good bits:- The soundtrack is superb. It's just a small notch below Bastion's. The vocal pieces are great as well.- The art style is clear and concise. It suits the game, and the full-screen images and between-area cutscenes are nice.- The difficulty curve was implemented solidly, and the game includes a ""Limiter"" system (identical to the Idols in Bastion) which allows you to tweak the difficulty as you see fit by adding various new strengths to the enemies.- Combat is a bit clunky, but it makes sense within the game's premise. The Turn() system rectifies this by turning Transistor from an action game into a strategy game -- you have a ""freeze time"" ability which allows you to plan out your next moves and execute them afterwards.- All of your abilities (called Functions) can be equipped as active abilities (4), upgrades for active abilities (2 each), and passive abilities (4). It can get a bit convoluted and for some reason the menus didn't play well with my XBox controller's analog stick, but other than that it was fine.The humongous downside to this game is in death. When you die, your most powerful active ability will ""overload"", rendering it unusable until you have passed enough checkpoints. Essentially, this means that when you die, your character gets significantly less powerful -- and not just for the current encounter, either. Numerous Limiters cause your character to have less MEM (to equip Functions with) and cause those Functions to overload for longer. You could equip a very powerful ability that you don't plan to use to offset this -- but Functions cost MEM to equip, and your MEM is very limited until you approach the maximum value (which won't be until your second playthrough). Even with max MEM, I did not have enough to equip 4 decent actives, 4 passives and all upgrades for each active.This can be an incredibly frustrating process, and I often found myself dying repeatedly on purpose after the first death just to restart so I wouldn't lose everything for so long -- particularly with 10 Limiters on. If you are not very good at video games in general you will get very frustrated very fast, as the game is horribly unforgiving when it comes to death. I consider myself to be pretty OK at games but I still found this a bit irriating -- tolerable during the normal game but downright ridiculous with 10 Limiters.This game could easily be a 9/10, but I feel that dying completely soils an otherwise-wonderful experience. I'd be perfectly ok with flat-out dying and having to restart, or any other penalty really -- but not the one they chose. Not sure what they were thinking.So, all in all,""6/10 it was ok"" - Foffy			"

What I liked: EverythingWhat You Need to Know: The art style is gorgeous just like they did with Bastion The music and main character singing in some songs is peaceful and fits the mood perfect You get a dedicated hum button, that's sole purpose is to hear the majestic voice of Red( main character) Main story might be hard to fully grasp for some people. Like who some characters are, what's this sword in my hand's purpose? and what the overall arc of the story might be. I loved the story The talking sword , similiar to the voice in Bastion, offers great dialogue and story to keep your engaged Combat is so satsifying and easy to understand. You get abilities and each have a main use, passive and secondary use, all vary depending on which you choice, giving alot of combations Combat is like a diablo style game, but you pause the game to chain abilities before activating them. A cooldown is needed afterwards to use your abilities again You can still go real time, but it's harder and actually slower New game plus starts the game with the leveled up enemies and your abilities, you won't have all unlocked once you first beat the game There are challenges that are optional, but really great, that help you level up, unlock music to listen to in-game, with a challenge room only for NG+My Score:A+Price:$5Completed in:6 hours first time( more if you go NG+, which I did)Games similar:  Bastion ShadowRun "

												I usually trudge through a game's actual gameplay to get it over with, but Transistor's gameplay was so enjoyable and solid that I found myself playing through the entire game again the very next day. The deep customization of your abilities with the various Functions(), the blend of real time frantic play with the powerful frozen planning of Turn(), and difficulty scaling done right make all the game extremely enjoyable to play. There are unbelievably powerful ability combos in the game, but you're always facing enemies that can meet the challenge. If you're not, then there's still the combat modifiers and restrictions you can add. Story-wise, the world is significantly more sparse and spare than Supergiant's previous title, Bastion, but it seems to be an intentional choice: a bit of mystery allows for varied interpretations and a long narrative shelf life, which is what I think they were going for in this game. I think they leaned a little too far in the direction of limiting information, but the game doesn't suffer for it too much. I think the endgame buildup and final fight were excellently executed and they are going to be a favorite among the games I've played.			"

												8/10 - Transistor is the first title released by the studio Supergiant Games since their excellent piece of work - Bastion, and just like Bastion; this game has plenty of charm. Lovely visuals, satisfying music and wonderful voice acting (particularly from Logan Cunningham, the man who played the Stranger in Supergiants' previous game, coming back for another smooth performance) are all to be expected here.The playtime is about 10 hours. For better or for worse, the story is kept vague throughout. Also - for better or worse - the combat system allows you to stop time in order to plan out attacks. This helps plot out attack patterns and devise strategies accordingly - but on the other hand it can make the combat feel disjointed occansionally.Overall the game is lovely, endearing and tugs on a few emotional heartstrings. Also the game has a hum button! You have to love a game with a hum button!			"

But on further NG+, I began to see how fun it was to mix and match the different weapons, and try much harder runs with the limiters activated.  All in all, I think it was money well spent.  If you want an engaging story, you probably won't find it here.  But there's lots to enjoy.  The art and music direction goes without saying -- great!			"

												A bittersweet tale accompanied by beautiful artwork and soundtrack, Transistor truly is a gem that should be played by many. It excels on many levels, and has definitely become one of my favorite games up to date.The story of Red, a singer gone mute, and her companion sword, the Transistor, is told with just the right amount of ambiguity and subtle cues. Decidedly leaving some questions open while you play, Transistor invites you to piece it together yourself - the little hints regarding Red's background and how she ended up on her own are stunning to put together. Paced just right, it is truly a unique experience for the player. The gameplay, too, is quite fun. The mixture between turn-based strategy and action helps the player to find their own rhythm - a rapid, high-risk approach, or a carefully planned out attack: It is up to the player. Furthermore, the RPG elements of this game are very entertaining. Even though I found myself very comfortable with a certain set of functions early on, the game encouraged me to try out new combinations both through story and challenge incentives. I have to say that I am glad that they did, for I've long left my original set behind. And now with New Game+, one can explore even more of its versatility!And of course, Transistor stands out as a visually stunning, and audibly well told tale that was to be expected from Supergiant Games. Like Bastion, all assets have the beautiful 2D quality to them, and take it to the next level. Jen Zee's art direction is impeccable and truly comes to shine in this beautiful game. Darren Korb's soundtrack complements the visual side of it with a  jazzy and relaxed style, truly emphasizing the artwork of the game. Transistor is a game that every gamer should have in their library. Every aspect of it is outstanding - gameplay, visuals, soundtrack and storytelling - and thus makes it a gem worth having.			"

												Bastion 2: Electric Boogaloo is a fantastic game, and a more apt name than it should be. That said, while the game has many key similarities to Bastion (art style, certain plot points, music, the same narrator), it also has many key differences, even some more subtle ones in those similarities I mentioned. Most obvious is that it's sci-fi rather than fantasy, the story as a whole is bit more subtle and atmospheric, and the battle system is... turn-based...???Regardless, it's a ton of fun, the music and art are just as good if not better than the amazing precedent Bastion set, giving us a lot more vocals of the singer behind Build That Wall from Bastion (there's even a hum button this time around! it is the most important button, you can literally have your character hum to the music at pretty much any time), and having a more tech-heavy-feel to it in general.Point is, it's a fantastic game, buy it 500 times.

Gameplay is pretty innovative and unique (something between turn based combat and action combat) and also fun, with lots of possibilities to try out (all the possible combinations).The story is kinda weird, but awesome too. I mean, the game directly starts with you pulling out the Transistor out of a man's body. And... that's about all that you know. But that not only makes it interesting to go through the game to understand the story, it also makes it fit the game even more, since Red herself has little idea of what's really happening.It's just a really good game in pretty much every aspect.

												'Transistor' merits artistic recognition for its soundtrack and design. The game is visually interesting and colourful, and I'd recommend it purely for its visual showcase. Unfortunately, the storyline is somewhat confusing and hard to follow; I began to grasp the story toward the end of my first play-through and on my second, and unavoidably more challenging play-through, the story began to make more sense. Perhaps this was intentional, hoping to ensure good replay value. I didn't mind playing the game again, as the gameplay was fun (and at times challenging), however poor storytelling is certainly this game's downfall.			"

												Transistor is a 2D isometric adventure game done by the same creators of bastion. Like bastion, the game looks beautiful, has a good soundtrack, and similiar to bastion, you're accompanied by a narrator/partner of sorts.  Unlike bastion, the combat is a bit different. Your character is slow, and doesn't really posses a guard, instead you can use evasive skills or initate turn(), which pauses the game and lets you queue up a certain number of actions.  It's an interesting mechanic and the way the game is set up lets you customize your abilites very well and inutitively. However, combat at later levels starts to get boring, you're either stunlocking the enemies or just hiding for your turn() to recharge, it's not at all the fast pased quick acting combat in Bastion.  I don't want to spoil anything, but the final boss is awful, it's like they shoved in a jrpg boss into an action game, you can't do anything about attacks, it's all about dealing damage quicker than it can.Wasn't a fan of the ending either, but that's a more personal thing.

												Transistor: Not a bad game. Supergiant play to their strengths, which is an isometric 3d world with beautiul art, a sweet soundtrack and a narrator that narrates everything about you in a nice rich voice.The problem I have with it is largely that, though. Supergiant stuck to their strengths and did not really push much of any boundaries, and it wasn't really that novel; Bastion 2.0, really.The main innovation is in the combat system, which I do sorta like - hate having to use Turn(), love how all your attacks work as primary attacks, upgrade modules or passive items. I also like the semi-online aspect, where you can see ghosts of other people, a'la Dark Souls. (At least, I'm pretty sure they are, and I'm sure the numerous polls you use are actually being formed by other players voting as well)One bug I had, which wasn't fatal, but severely annoying in that my game randomly locks up for maybe 3 seconds when I do things like attack.Worth buying -- if you've played Bastion, though, might want to wait until it's like $15 or cheaper instead of the full $20, because they feel like the same game almost.

												Different play-style and atmosphere than ""Bastion"" but same great art direction, voice talent, and music.  Combat is very customizable, with the ability to tailor combat to fit your play-style as well as adjust difficulty level on the fly.  A very polished game overall*.  Would highly recommend if you are interested in moderately short, cheap adventure game with interesting game-play, intriguing characters and plot line, and style to spare.* Note: I encountered a weird glitch at launch dealing with collisions in combat and don't know if they were fixed since then as I picked this up at launch (Day 1); it wasn't game breaking, though.  I am not sure if it was related to the fact that I was running on a Crossfire setup, just throwing it out there as a warning in case someone else encounters it to.			"

This migh sound like a cluster♥♥♥♥, but it works out really well. It offers a huge amount of customization for a lot of different playstyles, and encourages you to do so in a clever, story integrated way.The plot is, well, not entirely clear at some points, but it is a very engaging story as a whole.Buy it.

												Transistor is a visually stunning game from the devs that made Bastion. The amount of detail in the areas that you don't even spend much time in is incredible. Hard to really say much more about it... it's a very unique style, similar in many ways to Bastion, but  more squared townsquare types of areas as opposed to the more natural style of Bastion (which was less angles, more curves.)Just like Bastion, the soundtrack is perfect and fits so well. It's something you can listen to outside of game and still be pleased.The story is delivered via dialogue and in-game text via computer terminals. The story is ok, but is just incredibly shallow and vague. Character motives are never really explained, it just feels like there were a few events that were described or implied, and you just have to go, ""oh okay."" It seems like a very small episode of a much larger story.The game play itself is actually fairly challenging and consists of a mixture of real-time combat and turn-based combat. Enemies appear on screen and you can attack them, but more often than not there are many of them, they're fast and disruptive. The turn-based combat is a mode you enter into, then you get to plan out your moves and attacks before having them execute in slow-motion. It's really satisfying, but is manadatory through the majority of the second half of the game. You just take way too much unavoidable damage otherwise. The enemies themselves actually feel fairly frustrating a lot of the time. There are certain units you REALLY have to priortize, otherwise you just won't win the fights. While priortizing those targets, you're pretty much getting attacked by all the others. Later on in the game these mechanics are less strategic and just more frustrating. There is also not much variety in the enemies... so the encounters end up being X amount of these guys, Y amounts of these guys, fight. Kind of lame, as it removes some depth and strategy that could come from complex fight scenarios, and instead goes for ""just throw more guys at him.""Attacks are called functions, an you unlock many, but can only equip 4 of them. The extras can be socketed into your 4 main functions to upgrade them (additional effects), or as passives that activate based on certain conditions. There's a lot of variety here, and different abilities work better in certain situations than others.If you lose all your health in combat, instead of dying one of your functions gets overloaded and you have to continue on fighting without it. I'm pretty sure the function that gets overloaded was the last one you used prior to ""death"", but not 100% sure. This cycle continues until you run out of functions completely I suspect (I never had this happen though.) It's a nice way of lessening the chances of you getting stuck and not being able to get by to continue the game... which is good because sometimes you get really unlucky in a fight and it prevents you from feeling like the game hates you as much. Functions become useable again after you access a couple of switcher terminal things later on in the levels, so until then you pretty much have to swap them out with other functions or go on without 4 functions.Overall, I think this game was pretty enjoyable. It has a very high level of thought and polish put into it. The combat system is incredibly good, but the combat scenarios are weak and frustrating at times. The game doesn't necessarily feel ""fun"" to play, which is the same gripe I had with Bastion, but that doesn't mean it wasn't enjoyable or not worth a playthrough. I think this mainly stems from both these games not really having ""low"" or ""bad"" points that make the great points stand out.The game is also incredibly short... I beat it in ~5 hours according to steam, and I tried to interact with as much as I could find. This is probably the biggest ""issue"" with it... it just ends up sort of unfulfilling. It does however have a New Game + mode, so you can continue to level and unlock more things, as well as a lot of ""challenge"" levels where you can hone your skills. I think this game should have had more hands working on it, in order to really make the scope much larger in terms of gameplay and story. There is absolutely no filler in the game which is good, but like I said earlier in the review, it feels like an episode of something much bigger.... so huge amounts of potential left unexplored. Still, the amount of time, effort and detail that went into this game is really apparent in every way imaginable. For what it's worth, if you've played neither of these games, I'd highly recommend playing Bastion before this.			"

												It's hard to describe this game without using the word ""beautiful"" at least several hundred times, along with other adjectives, such as ""amazing"", ""addicting"", and ""magnificent"". I'm shocked how some people don't realize its true intentions as rather a story you are thrown into to experience first hand. I'll try to explain this further with no spoilers:The beginning throws you straight into the game; no main menu, no background story, nothing. I had to YouTube the game just to make sure I hadn't accidently skipped an intro cutscene, but sure enough, what I was seeing was the way it was intended to begin. Already, I was impressed.Gameplay felt comfortable. No stretching my tiny, feminine fingers out to reach oddly specific keys. Mouse controls were smooth and responsive. I never had a problem getting stuck on anything or walking into walls. My first time playing through I obviously relied on the Turn() aspect of the combat quite a bit, but towards the end and on my second time around, I realized the benefits of using both styles of combat, using the real time more for specific enemies that either evaded the effects of Turn() or were not of importance to waste it on. The key feature of applying Functions as a normal active function, an upgrade, or a passive stat was genius and allows for any person's unique fighting strategies. With how flexible the combat is, I'm surprised people have complaints about it.The characters and dialogue of the entire game were enthralling and immersive. I felt highly connected with Red's character, and knew so much about her despite her ailment. That never stopped her character from shining through. Her sassy yet proper attitude was visible in her actions, not to mention how weak and afraid she truly was. She didn't have the amazing super strength to lift such a giant sword all the time. It would constantly dragged behind her, but she would gather her little strength to unleash amazing attacks, usually having to lift herself and the sword back up off the ground afterwards. She was constantly playing with her hair and adjusting herself, but obviously was not too absorbed in her looks, seeing that she tore such a beautiful ball gown to shreds for the sake of being able to run. Mr. Nobody, as he titles himself at an early point and what I prefer to call him since, no, he is not the Transistor itself, still shines through despite not even having a body. His voice acting is absolutely amazing. Every word meant something. Some lines made tears well up in my eyes. He had attitude as well, much more sarcastic and joking, but he was just as believable as Red.The story, while I won't say much, was just beautiful. It's never what you expect, but not hard to follow along with. I will say the trailer gives false ideas and practically lies about the true story. Playing this blind is an amazing experience. Do me a favor and when Mr. Nobody starts talking, don't cut him off. Let him speak. All the dialogue means something in the story and if you cut him off, you could lose so much of the true story and not understand things in the future. A lot of playthroughs on YouTube do this. Don't cut off the experience for yourself. Take the extra time to sit there and just listen.The music is just fantastic, and the little hum you can play for each track gives it a new spin and practically makes it a different song. All the music is addicting and plays perfectly along side the gameplay. The music is mellow and slow, so you never feel rushed in a battle, making the combat feel smooth and relaxed rather than frantic. The music is meant to calm you in the fray of battle and does so quite well. The art speaks for itself. Even if you hate the game, you can't deny its beauty. Everything looks hand painted. The 3D models are high definition, to the point where Red's facial expressions are visible. I'm simply obsessed with the artistic style they chose.Final boss and ending sequence brought me to tears. I sobbed like a little girl, but for good reason, so don't judge. I had been near tears for most of the game due to its music and voice acting and the end pulled the final strings to my heart. It has been a very long time since a game has done this for me. I will ask you all again something here; if you beat it, when it asks you to play the recursion, at least watch the intro again. If the slight secret difference in the intro does not compel you to play more, than I'm not sure what will.To be blunt, I'm kind of an expert on this game. I've been tracking it since its announcement at E3, watched all the demos and trailers, received it on the release day, have the soundtrack on my phone, and at the time of posting this I have racked up about 14 hours on the game. I will say if you're expecting a casual game of the typical demographic of 13-17 year old boys, this has no time for you. This game requires patience, attention, and heart. It is not the game's fault if you do not feel the need to provide it with these then seek to trash it for ""not being good enough"". Before you judge it, follow my suggestion of listening to all the dialogue and at least attempt to finish it. The game should take someone who is not rushed about 10 hours; not long at all. This game is a story and an experience, not something you can mindlessly blow through.My final rating is 10/10, simply because it brought me to tears not once, not twice, but three times, and I'll happily cry again just to play through it once more to immerse myself in its beautiful story.

												Before anything, I will preface this and say if you have any interest in ARPG's and are looking for a wonderful and short experience, you SHOULD pick this game up. Well worth the $20 in my opinion.  If you want a detailed explanation, feel free to read and a TLDR is at the bottom.PROS:◘Visually pleasing to the eyes, absolutly gorgeous presentation in both animation and the enviornment.◘Sound design is top notch.◘Narration done throughout the game is fun to listen to.◘Can play with either mouse or keyboard.◘Fairly intriguing theme and story get you interested◘Should run fairly well on most machines.◘Fairly challenging as you can easily be ""killed"" multiple times during any battle.     ○When you ""die"" in combat, 2 things can happen: The first is on the brink of death you engage a emergency Turn mode (Turn is explained later below) and can fight to kill a few more enemies. The second possibility is that you ""break"" a function from combat for a while, and after visiting 2 (or more) Function Kiosks you can reactive them. If you break them, you are then forced to play around with your kit to experiment with new loadouts.◘Variety of combat with many different enemies with various different upgrade versions of them.◘Absolutely STELLAR combat system along with the configurations along with it (Which are detalied below)     ○As you play the game, you obtain various skills and upgrades through leveling up or finding them around the world and they are called Functions.     ○You can use these Functions in 3 ways: The first is the Active Function which you use for combat that does its base effect. The second is the Upgrade Function, where you take one of your Functions and use it to augment another Active Function, giving it special or different effect. And lastly is the Passive Function, in which you take a Function and put it into a passive state where it will always give a effect, or activate at specific under different conditions. EVERY Function in the game connects together in one way or another.     ○As you play the game, you are allowed to fight in either real time where you cast your abilities against the enemies movements and actions with no cooldown penalty, engage the Turn system to pause the game and tactically decide how you want to approach the situation. In Turn you can move almost instantly anywhere and manually aim your shots and action which are limited by a action bar. You then execute the procedure and watch your plan unfold rapidly. However, the downside to this is that once you are done with your Turn actions, you cannot use your abilities until your Turn meter has recharged. Because of these 2 systems you have a choice as to how you want to fight your battles.◘You can use ""limiters"" to further increase the difficulty of the game and gain a small amount of bonus EXP for leveling.◘New game plus mode with all of your stuff you unlocked. CONS:◘The UI can be just a little bit wonky with assigning Functions to various roles.◘Because the story is not made apparently clear at first, you can easily get lost.◘Turn actions that detail the effects may not always be accurate, as enemies may dodge and it doesn't tell you that information.◘May be just a bit short for some, as I and other have managed to beat the game at around 6 hours.◘Because there is new game plus and not much more, some people may not find a lot of replayability from this, resulting a 6 hour experience for $20 dollars.◘The only real set of graphics options are just resolutions.TLDR: Great combat, visuals and fun for ARPG fans. Can be beaten in about 6 hours, and depending on the user the new game plus can offer replayability.Can be of a bumpy ride for the first hour for people to get used to, but you get over it quickly.Overall, I feel that just about everyone should buy this beauty. The devs that made this deserve every dollar they earn and then some for the amount of effort and love that was poured into this game.			"

												I give transistor ⅗ stars.I bought Transistor solely because it is from the same developer that made one of my favorite games, Bastion.  While Transistor is still a good game I was somewhat disappointed.The Good:  -As of mid November 2014 I didn’t encounter ANY bugs or instability issues, a common complaint at launch-The graphics are good, but should still work on lower-end systems-The turn based gameplay is well done for the most part-Reasonable price for a game at 6 hours of play-Has some replayability to it-While not the best story, and a little confusing at times, I think the ending ties everything up nicely and makes you think a bit. Even though the story was lacking it kept me coming back for more to finish the game.  The Bad:-The graphics, in my opinion, are not nearly as clever as Bastion.  Bastion used beautiful bright cell-shaded/watercolor style graphics to illustrate a strange and troubled world.  Transistor relies heavily on a beautiful but dark watercolor style that looks more sophisticated but is less enjoyable to look at for 6 hours of game.-The characters aren’t as likeable, developed, or funny, as Bastion’s.  The narrator of Bastion was one of the best features.  In this game the transistor character makes soft-pointless observations throughout the game that don’t add very much creative value-The turn style gameplay is again, in my opinion, a step back.  In Bastion I spent hours mastering the various weapons in the proving ground.  This game has a similar proving ground structure but the turn style combat feel easy and disconnected.  I imagine many gamers will  disagree with me on this point.-Music is a large element to the game and passing various tests unlocks more music.  However, I found the music itself to be pretty boring and uninteresting.  I have fairly broad taste in music so I imagine many will agree with me.  I’m glad I didn’t pay extra to get the boring soundtrack because I cannot imagine wanting to listen to it at any time.Based on these reasons, I give the game ⅗ stars.  Yes, it is fun, and it is well done; but it could be so much better.  I will likely follow this developer and buy future titles with the hope that they are a bit more fun than this one. "

												Supergiant has outdone themselves with Transistor. As with Bastion, the musical score is stunning and the storyline is engaging. However, they've upped the ante with the combat, giving you plenty of options and different combinations to try. And, if you're into lore (as I am), then there's plenty of that too. The world is amazing, too. The game doesn't take long to get through, but that's not particularly a bad thing in my opinion. At the time of this writing, I just finished the first playthrough (and the time is including the time I took to read through all the lore that I have unlocked at this point). If you enjoy action RPGs, or action games, or RPGs, you will probably enjoy Transistor. Well worth the money.			"

												Didn't even take me 20 minutes to realise just how good this game is.Should've won Game Of The Year, Destiny paled in comparison.Truly beautiful, this games masterfully orchestrated music tells the tale of two lovers in a dull world pitted against them.Look into the lyrics and the themes of the game, it's deep and has inspired so many fans of the game into the subjects of what their interpretations may be. for instance, the song In Circles, or the ingame version - ""_n C_rlc_s"".This song itself depicts many things, but it's clear that the first boss you kill you have a connection with her that goes beyond regret, love, and intense feelings of guilt. you almost pity the boss as you take her soul and condemn her for her actions that she herself guilts for.. they loved each other but one lost to the ""process"".Here's a link to a mix of the two songs, it was interesting to hear as well, but please listen to them individually as well:

The game touched me through the dialogue even though most of it is between a girl without a voice and a sword. The relationship between the two had me rooting for them from the beginning. The ending was bittersweet. I'd highly recommend anyone who likes tactical games to try out Transistor.Also, the soundtrack to this game is well worth the buy. I didn't purchase it at first, but I went back to buy the soundtrack after playing the game.			"

												This was probably the best Steam Summer Sale 2014 game I purchased. A very linear game, but with much more customization than expected. Combining multiple skills into one powerful skill, and those you choose not to use to attack with can be used passively on youself so they don't go to waste. Transistor has the same narrator feel that Bastion did, making the story feel just as great as their previous game.Would highly recommend to purchase this during the Winter Sale if you enjoy a mixture of Action/Turn Strategy *Not 100% Turn Based*Its worth the NewGame+ it has to offer, which I will need to begin now..

												Transistor, Supergiant Games' second release, is an enthralling, unique experience that meets and shatters any expectation one may have about it. If you've played Bastion, and are wondering how Transistor fares in comparison with it, know that this game pulls all the right inspiration from SPG's previous release, but maintains its own identity to set it apart as something truly original.Like Bastion, Transistor is a narrative-driven game with emphasis on configurable gameplay, i.e. loadouts. There's optional difficulty modifiers and the game plays in standard psuedo-isometric fashion. But the similarities end there. Unlike Bastion, Transistor's fighting system is much more diverse and complex; more RPG, less action-adventure. A core component of that system is something called 'Turn()' mode, which essentially shifts the game from real-time to turn-based action. I find Transistor's combat system to be incredibly unique, and something that enables multiple play styles to shine through.The story of the game, while similar to Bastion, in that it's a linear, narrative-driven plot, is again, just superficially similar. While the narrator in Bastion is more so telling a story, the narrator in Transistor isn't really a narrator at all. He's another character, with his own perspective and reactions on what's going on around him. He doesn't really tell the story so much as he does experience it. The real meat of lore is actually acquired through using abilities you've gathered in various ways. This is a vastly different take on storytelling because one may not have even uncovered the whole thing through one playthrough. I believe though, that the game meant to be played like that; it's meant to be played through more than once. And it's obvious, as the New Game+ mode is called a 'Recursion'. For some, this may be a turn off, which is understandable. After my first playthrough, I was left with more questions than answers. It left a slightly sour taste in mouth, but after playing more and uncovering all that there was to be uncovered, I enjoyed the story much more than I initially did. It's a very different way to tell a story, but I think fans will appreciate it.Overall, I highly recommend Transistor. It has creative, unique gameplay with a story that is equally as intriguing. Not to mention the beautiful art and soundtrack, which is worth buying in its own right!			"

												Transistor is nothing less than a phantamagoria. Perfectly blending spectacularly beautiful graphics and epic combat, the game is instantly addictive and will warrant more than just a couple of playthroughs. The semi-turn-based combat system and the nigh-endless combinations of skills makes each battle utterly unique and the ingenious addition of Limiters (special power-downs that you can equip to make the game more challenging) ensure that the game remains balanced even at the higher levels, when certain skill stacks become ludicrously powerful. The gameplay is perfectly complemented by seamless combat animations and absolutely gorgeous isometric environments that flow like liquid neon into one another. The game wears its artistic influences on it's sleeve - heavily indebted to Alphonse Mucha and Gustav Klimt as well as films like Tron and Akira, the game is a visual feast for anyone into art, film and visual culture. The sound design and voice talent is also hauntingly beautiful, the two working in harmony to create a mood of wistfulness and Romanticism.I do have some minor gripes, as any honest player should. First is that despite allusions to a great story, we never quite get the full tale due to the absence of characters with more than one dimension. The romance between the nameless ghost in the titular machine and the protagonist, Red, is never explored in depth because Red is mute. In the absence of her voice, all interactions between the two are one-sided narrations. The conceit that Red's voice is lost, while a voice is all that remains of her narrator/lover is suitably poignant, but in the absence of relatable (read: visible) reactions from Red, it misses the mark somewhat. The villains are similarly flat and exposition of their motivations is vague at best. Although the voice-talent is superb, the dialogue that was written for the actor sometimes becomes a little too sentimental and without fully fleshed-out characters this can push the boundary dangerously close to absurdity when we are expected to care about certain events in the story in which we are not invested. These issues could have easily been addressed through the inclusion of animated cutscenes instead of the beautiful, but static images that hold their place. This makes me wonder if the developers hadn't initially intended to include cutscene animations, but hit some sort of snag. Despite this fairly lengthy critique, this game deserves your attention. My minor complaints should by no means overshadow my enthusiasm for this fantastic title. The gameplay and visuals are absolutely stunning and more than warrant putting down money for this game. 8 / 10			"

												Absolutely gorgeous game in every sense of the term. Amazing art, music, and animations. The gameplay is engaging, simple but deep. Being able to switch more or less freely between tactical and real-time combat makes the game feel exciting wthout any sense of panic or urgency. Unfortunately it is rather short, and the option for a New Game+ does not make up for it, but that really is its only shortcoming.			"

Nothing less than chills down your spine from the outstanding performance of the narrator as he pours emotions into you by simply speaking.Stunning backgrounds, new combat system that keeps you suspended, amazing vocals and music.

												A bittersweet tale accompanied by beautiful artwork and soundtrack, Transistor truly is a gem that should be played by many. It excels on many levels, and has definitely become one of my favorite games up to date.The story of Red, a singer gone mute, and her companion sword, the Transistor, is told with just the right amount of ambiguity and subtle cues. Decidedly leaving some questions open while you play, Transistor invites you to piece it together yourself - the little hints regarding Red's background and how she ended up on her own are stunning to put together. Paced just right, it is truly a unique experience for the player. The gameplay, too, is quite fun. The mixture between turn-based strategy and action helps the player to find their own rhythm - a rapid, high-risk approach, or a carefully planned out attack: It is up to the player. Furthermore, the RPG elements of this game are very entertaining. Even though I found myself very comfortable with a certain set of functions early on, the game encouraged me to try out new combinations both through story and challenge incentives. I have to say that I am glad that they did, for I've long left my original set behind. And now with New Game+, one can explore even more of its versatility!And of course, Transistor stands out as a visually stunning, and audibly well told tale that was to be expected from Supergiant Games. Like Bastion, all assets have the beautiful 2D quality to them, and take it to the next level. Jen Zee's art direction is impeccable and truly comes to shine in this beautiful game. Darren Korb's soundtrack complements the visual side of it with a  jazzy and relaxed style, truly emphasizing the artwork of the game. Transistor is a game that every gamer should have in their library. Every aspect of it is outstanding - gameplay, visuals, soundtrack and storytelling - and thus makes it a gem worth having.			"

												I could go on and try to write a detailed and objective review of the game, and try to look at it from different angles, but I can't. I can think of extremely few titles that are as much of a product of love and care, as detailed and as emotionally engaging as Transistor. It's not a single element that does it - it's everything in the game coming together in one awe-inspiring work of art that is unique and completely breathtaking, From its artwork and environment design to its themes and backstory, its fleshed out and relatable characters and its heartrendingly tragic story and conclusion. I went in with really high expectations, which I usually really try not to do, but not only were my expectations met, they were exceeded in all aspects. There wasn't a single thing that stood out to me as being there just as a filler - everything looked and felt like it had an important role and was relevant to the overarching plot. It says so much with so little, and invites you to explore the world yourself, which you undoubtedly WILL do, because the immersion I felt playing Transistor has only been matched by 2 titles in all my years of playing games since the NES era. The amazing attention to detail is not only worthy of the highest praise and enhances the atmosphere hundred-fold, it also serves to strengthen the emotional connection you feel to Red and Breach(). And the music... Oh my GOD, the music. I really, genuinely can't find words to describe it. The way it's interwoven with the story, the way it reflects the environment and the way it changes with it, the absolutely tear-inducingly gorgeous vocals of Ashley Barrett, the way it peaks and dips at key points, the intensity and beauty of it made me shed tears so many times. The small touches like the Flourish and the humming are incredible additions. The humming especially is one of the saddest things in the game in terms of its significance.I don't want to touch on the story itself, because that's something one must experience on his own, but I will say this: Transistor isn't a dystopian RPG. It isn't a tactical or strategic action RPG. More than anything, it's a tragedy with a heart-rending love story interwoven into it; a tale of choices and consequences. I CANNOT recommend this game more. I could go on praising it forever, and it deserves every last bit of it. I don't know how Supergiant did this. I can't fathom all the work that went into Transistor and its soundtrack, but it was worth every bit, because what they started with the gorgeous Bastion, they did so much better with Transistor. They have grown so much in so little time, and I mean that in the best way possible. THey've developed and matured as a studio even more.Of course, they won't get the recognition they deserve, because people will be too busy praising the next cookie-cutter bland multi-million dollar AAA title, likely a shooter, and Transistor won't win many ""awards""; it likely won't be GOTY or whatever other overhyped title people care about. But really, to me, that recognition isn't worth that much. What IS worth something is the way Supergiant touched the hearts of so many fans and showed that, once again, they can deliver a product of IMMACULATE quality. And to me, that means more than any award ever could. It's the best game I've played this year so far by a huge margin and I doubt anything will surpass it.Thank you, Supergiant. Truly.""See you in The Country...""			"

												This is a truly wonderful game with a wonderful story. The gameplay is the easy part to talk about. It's a hybrid turn based strategy and action game, where you have a sword that charges up and lets you use a bunch of big hits. It's not terribly difficult in its base setting, but if you turn on Limiters (which are like the god statues in Bastion) as you get them then the game will keep you on your toes. The enemies aren't as deep or challenging as they were in Bastion, but you have a large variety of customizable attacks and bringing down a big pack with an innovative combo is quite satisfying. The story meanwhile is a boldly told and rich tale. But it's a story that's going to demand that you're giving it your whole brain's attention. You have to combine what you read in the function biographies with the Transistor's ongoing narration with the little news bulletins you keep seeing everywhere. The motivations of the antagonists, along with the nature of the apocalypse that the city is going through, are secrets that the game expects you to patiently piece together. But if you give the narrative the effort it's asking you to give it, you find a really rich and well realized world. You won't really get what happened until the end, but that's what makes the game so rewarding.Logan Cunningham is, of course, the voice of this game, but unlike the Bastion there are other characters here and I have to say that added a lot. Though really, much of the tale is told through artwork and music. The gradual twisting of the vibrant city into grey nothingness mirrors is quite striking. In any case, this is an utterly fantastic game. Acquire it promptly.			"

												Transistor is a beauty of a game, literally. The art-style is to die for... The battle-system takes a little getting used to in the beginning, but its ability customization is top-notch; might even be a bit too much if you wanted a simple hack-and-slash type game (which it is not), but you can almost play it as such.A wonderful game, albeit a tad short, but so worth your money and your time.

												First off Transistor was amazing. Another unique world elegantly crafted by Supergiant Games, very interesting gameplay I loved to tinker with and another OST that suplemented the atmosphere of the world of Transistor. >>> I WILL NOT TO SPOIL ANYTHING, things will be clear after the fact, I really like this developer and I want to support >>> them in their indeavors, since they are doing something new and interesting.  Main character Red, is strong, resilient, and graceful, even though silent trough out the game (like in Bastion), trough her (players) actions becomes adamant in her mission.   The male chacater (also the narator) is someone who doesnt want be THE hero, but HER hero, he has great Hero Complex issues. He starts off being very misterious and then (almost forcibly) changes, similar to a drunk man confessing his feelings (but considering how and when it happens thi analogy is perfect), but he find liberation in his stupor and completes his as a character (nearly). I didnt like him that much, since I expected him to be something else, but I can see some of myself in him, even though I dont like it.  Enemies are awesome, the main antagonist(s) are interesting, they have motives and drives, they arent EVIL in the traditional sense of the word, but they are aganst Red (protagonist, ergo, you). You want to find out about more about them.  Gameplay and story are fused and work and play well together, its rewards you. Skill and upgrade system is nothing like I have ever seen, and is a breath of fresh air, it limites yoou in a way to make most of what you have and the way you want to play. I hope I see something like that in another game.  Story is tightly knit, it has its path and follows it, there is no clutter or bloat to spread the hours. It gives you a great satisfaction to learn more and explore the world that is before you.   Music is amazing! That is all, I am listening to it right now.Is this more of the Bastion type game? Yes, BUT this just proves there is more ways to skin a cat,  you can see Bastions influence, but only in very very general sense, as you play and imerse yourself you see that Transistor is just a sister to Beastion, related, yes, but completely separate person.Just, buy and play it. Be happy.			"

												If you liked Bastion and would play it again, then Transistor is well worth it.If you found it to be somewhat lacking, then I don't honestly feel that the reworked combat alone will be ultimately satisfying.Before I dive into the other parts of the game, I feel it is worth mentioning that the PC version suffers a few hiccups here and there, especially with KB+M controls. Being able to aim your attacks in Turn() is nice, but the game will often snap your attacks to enemies you're mousing over instead of the tile you're aiming for. Almost every attack is (or can have) AoE, so this is kind of a big deal. The game used to stutter hard on my rig, but no longer does so with the first update. However, that very update broke camera controls in Turn(), making it difficult to aim or move off of the screen. The game is definitely playable with a controller, and I recommend trying that.Now, the game's individual parts are not bad-- the art direction is gorgeous, and you really couldn't ask for more from the music or Logan Cunningham. The combat system is at first pretty deep, and allows for the player to flesh out their own arsenal and playstyle, but provides little incentive for the player to actually experiment once they've unlocked all the attached lore (executed pretty neatly) and discovered their winning combos.But there is ultimately something missing both from Bastion and Transistor. I've found that they both leave you wanting more-- not necessarily in a good way. There is little exploration or risk/reward beyond the critical path, and perhaps the addition of one or two extra mechanics might have tightened it up a bit; made it feel more substantial. I acknowledge that it sounds superfluous, and hopefully it won't bother you as much as it did me. I really want to appreciate the sentiment of elegant game design, because the game does feel like it's pretty clean of unnecessary or tacked-on bits (aside from NG+). I think the real flaw is that you aren't really introduced to any new gameplay mechanics outside of combat, and the combat does not stay fresh forever. Again, maybe it is unnecessary and it won't bother you, but them's my two pickles.Regarding NG+: don't bother recursing through the game for the story. All that's new is one or two lines at the start, different enemy setups, a second pair of every function (you can power up a function with a second instance of itself) and of course the achievement.

But really, to me, that recognition isn't worth that much. What IS worth something is the way Supergiant touched the hearts of so many fans and showed that, once again, they can deliver a product of IMMACULATE quality.

												Another great game from the makers of Bastion. Excellent gameplay coupled with a one of a kind narrative makes this mysterious story both quite memorable and replayable. The soundtrack alone makes this game worth at least one play through if not more. Transistor has a very neat way of introducing challenges as well as altering modes of difficulty through ""limiters,"" these are sort of down-grades that can create a challenge, but reward you with greater experience. The higheryour level, the greater number of ""Functions,"" or abilities you have at your disposal. While some abilities may not seem very useful directly, they usually have a benefit ifused passively. Utilizing different combinations of abilities allows for a wide range of play-styles and tactics. Transistor has such a great take on gameplay mechanics that it is entirely refreshing and a lot of fun. Considering the above, the one minor drawback, to me, is how vague the world is. However, I can't really consider that a negative, because the world of Transistor and everything in it can be open to interpretation. GIven this I think Supergiant has accomplished a pretty awesome feat, making the player use their imagination in both the gameplay/strategy as well as the story they've told. I highly recommend Transistor to just about anyone.			"

												I have controversial feelings about this game.It has great things like gameplay, atmosphere, interesting ideas, quality sound and graphics.But the plot is rather dull. You don't understand what happened, why happened, who are these people and what is going on. It feels like the authors wanted to make impression of deep meaning and mistery with all these unspoken things, or probably it should contribute to teh drama - but at the end it boils down to just messy heap of random facts and random words.Plus, overliance on the background narrator (the sword, in this case) is really annoying. He talks just for the sake of talking.I still can recommend it, but it is significantly weaker than Bastion.			"

												First off Transistor was amazing. Another unique world elegantly crafted by Supergiant Games, very interesting gameplay I loved to tinker with and another OST that suplemented the atmosphere of the world of Transistor. >>> I WILL NOT TO SPOIL ANYTHING, things will be clear after the fact, I really like this developer and I want to support >>> them in their indeavors, since they are doing something new and interesting.  Main character Red, is strong, resilient, and graceful, even though silent trough out the game (like in Bastion), trough her (players) actions becomes adamant in her mission.   The male chacater (also the narator) is someone who doesnt want be THE hero, but HER hero, he has great Hero Complex issues. He starts off being very misterious and then (almost forcibly) changes, similar to a drunk man confessing his feelings (but considering how and when it happens thi analogy is perfect), but he find liberation in his stupor and completes his as a character (nearly). I didnt like him that much, since I expected him to be something else, but I can see some of myself in him, even though I dont like it.  Enemies are awesome, the main antagonist(s) are interesting, they have motives and drives, they arent EVIL in the traditional sense of the word, but they are aganst Red (protagonist, ergo, you). You want to find out about more about them.  Gameplay and story are fused and work and play well together, its rewards you. Skill and upgrade system is nothing like I have ever seen, and is a breath of fresh air, it limites yoou in a way to make most of what you have and the way you want to play. I hope I see something like that in another game.  Story is tightly knit, it has its path and follows it, there is no clutter or bloat to spread the hours. It gives you a great satisfaction to learn more and explore the world that is before you.   Music is amazing! That is all, I am listening to it right now.Is this more of the Bastion type game? Yes, BUT this just proves there is more ways to skin a cat,  you can see Bastions influence, but only in very very general sense, as you play and imerse yourself you see that Transistor is just a sister to Beastion, related, yes, but completely separate person.Just, buy and play it. Be happy.			"

												Transistor, Supergiant Games' second release, is an enthralling, unique experience that meets and shatters any expectation one may have about it. If you've played Bastion, and are wondering how Transistor fares in comparison with it, know that this game pulls all the right inspiration from SPG's previous release, but maintains its own identity to set it apart as something truly original.Like Bastion, Transistor is a narrative-driven game with emphasis on configurable gameplay, i.e. loadouts. There's optional difficulty modifiers and the game plays in standard psuedo-isometric fashion. But the similarities end there. Unlike Bastion, Transistor's fighting system is much more diverse and complex; more RPG, less action-adventure. A core component of that system is something called 'Turn()' mode, which essentially shifts the game from real-time to turn-based action. I find Transistor's combat system to be incredibly unique, and something that enables multiple play styles to shine through.The story of the game, while similar to Bastion, in that it's a linear, narrative-driven plot, is again, just superficially similar. While the narrator in Bastion is more so telling a story, the narrator in Transistor isn't really a narrator at all. He's another character, with his own perspective and reactions on what's going on around him. He doesn't really tell the story so much as he does experience it. The real meat of lore is actually acquired through using abilities you've gathered in various ways. This is a vastly different take on storytelling because one may not have even uncovered the whole thing through one playthrough. I believe though, that the game meant to be played like that; it's meant to be played through more than once. And it's obvious, as the New Game+ mode is called a 'Recursion'. For some, this may be a turn off, which is understandable. After my first playthrough, I was left with more questions than answers. It left a slightly sour taste in mouth, but after playing more and uncovering all that there was to be uncovered, I enjoyed the story much more than I initially did. It's a very different way to tell a story, but I think fans will appreciate it.Overall, I highly recommend Transistor. It has creative, unique gameplay with a story that is equally as intriguing. Not to mention the beautiful art and soundtrack, which is worth buying in its own right!			"

												Transistor is one of those games that has a stunning artwork, amazing narration, and a wonderful storyline.It was one of the few games this summer sale that I really wanted to try and I was not disappoitned as I played through. The game touched me through the dialogue even though most of it is between a girl without a voice and a sword. The relationship between the two had me rooting for them from the beginning. The ending was bittersweet. I'd highly recommend anyone who likes tactical games to try out Transistor.Also, the soundtrack to this game is well worth the buy. I didn't purchase it at first, but I went back to buy the soundtrack after playing the game.			"

												'Transistor' merits artistic recognition for its soundtrack and design. The game is visually interesting and colourful, and I'd recommend it purely for its visual showcase. Unfortunately, the storyline is somewhat confusing and hard to follow; I began to grasp the story toward the end of my first play-through and on my second, and unavoidably more challenging play-through, the story began to make more sense. Perhaps this was intentional, hoping to ensure good replay value. I didn't mind playing the game again, as the gameplay was fun (and at times challenging), however poor storytelling is certainly this game's downfall.			"

												Transistor: Not a bad game. Supergiant play to their strengths, which is an isometric 3d world with beautiul art, a sweet soundtrack and a narrator that narrates everything about you in a nice rich voice.The problem I have with it is largely that, though. Supergiant stuck to their strengths and did not really push much of any boundaries, and it wasn't really that novel; Bastion 2.0, really.The main innovation is in the combat system, which I do sorta like - hate having to use Turn(), love how all your attacks work as primary attacks, upgrade modules or passive items. I also like the semi-online aspect, where you can see ghosts of other people, a'la Dark Souls. (At least, I'm pretty sure they are, and I'm sure the numerous polls you use are actually being formed by other players voting as well)One bug I had, which wasn't fatal, but severely annoying in that my game randomly locks up for maybe 3 seconds when I do things like attack.Worth buying -- if you've played Bastion, though, might want to wait until it's like $15 or cheaper instead of the full $20, because they feel like the same game almost.

												It's clear that an immense amount of TLC went into the creation of this marvelous game.With an incredibly intuitive combat system that still manages to remain fast paced to keep you on your toes, Transistor is the perfect blend of turn based and real time action gaming. Infinite combinations of Functions - this game's ""skills"" - allow you to create your own play style as you see fit, putting a good amount of strategizing outside of battle as well.Transistor's graphics and art are definitely top notch. While my device isn't optimized for gaming at all, I'm still able to run the game fairly smoothly, although I of course cannot enjoy it in all its beauty. The original soundtrack is good enough to be worth buying as DLC.Finally, Transistor's story is one that will make your head hurt - in a good way! It doesn't have any ugly plotholes or leave you confused, but you will definitely be pondering about it for quite some time after completing it.Though I bought Transistor on sale, I can truthfully say that it is more than worth its full price; I absolutely recommend buying this game to anyone considering doing so.

												Transistor is a lovely game; it has beautiful artwork, a great soundtrack, an intriguing setting and fun gameplay. I would thoroughly recommend it to anyone. It has a few flaws: Transistor was a very easy game, it appeared to have some conflicting design decisions (specifically two of the limiters) and had some balance issues/shallow combat in parts.

												First off, beware. This game is short.That said, I loved it. Story is confusing, but in a good way. Makes you think, makes you work for the backstory. I also REALLY did not see some of the plot points coming. Gameplay is fun, and very customizable. You have the sandbox zone for the occasional change of pace. It's a game that I feel like should seem grindy, but isn't at all. I had fun from beginning to end.New game+ is fun, though in my limited encounters with it it is just the original game but with your progress saved.Worth 20 bucks? I would say maybe, but ONLY because of the short length. Wait for a sale or price drop, this game is worth every penny of 10-15 dollars.			"

												8/10 - Transistor is the first title released by the studio Supergiant Games since their excellent piece of work - Bastion, and just like Bastion; this game has plenty of charm. Lovely visuals, satisfying music and wonderful voice acting (particularly from Logan Cunningham, the man who played the Stranger in Supergiants' previous game, coming back for another smooth performance) are all to be expected here.The playtime is about 10 hours. For better or for worse, the story is kept vague throughout. Also - for better or worse - the combat system allows you to stop time in order to plan out attacks. This helps plot out attack patterns and devise strategies accordingly - but on the other hand it can make the combat feel disjointed occansionally.Overall the game is lovely, endearing and tugs on a few emotional heartstrings. Also the game has a hum button! You have to love a game with a hum button!			"

												The amount of love and skill that went into this game is incredible.As a person years late to Bastion, Transistor was the first game I experienced from Supergiant Games. I decided to finish both games before writing this review and personally I feel that this game is more favorable even though its story is more linear in comparison. It is absolutely worth every penny.The artwork, Jen Zee's work, is so beautiful I want to cry. The soundtrack for this game among the best I've heard and I highly recommend buying it if you can. Voice acting felt intimate and natural & the hidden array of diverse side characers were an interesting touch. All of this gave life to the otherwise enigmatic and vaguely-defined world of Transistor.Furthermore, the combat system in this game is very rewarding and can be made difficult for those who want that spicy challenge. The developers tried something new and it worked.Supergiant please take my wallet and soul.			"

												I could go on and try to write a detailed and objective review of the game, and try to look at it from different angles, but I can't. I can think of extremely few titles that are as much of a product of love and care, as detailed and as emotionally engaging as Transistor. It's not a single element that does it - it's everything in the game coming together in one awe-inspiring work of art that is unique and completely breathtaking, From its artwork and environment design to its themes and backstory, its fleshed out and relatable characters and its heartrendingly tragic story and conclusion. I went in with really high expectations, which I usually really try not to do, but not only were my expectations met, they were exceeded in all aspects. There wasn't a single thing that stood out to me as being there just as a filler - everything looked and felt like it had an important role and was relevant to the overarching plot. It says so much with so little, and invites you to explore the world yourself, which you undoubtedly WILL do, because the immersion I felt playing Transistor has only been matched by 2 titles in all my years of playing games since the NES era. The amazing attention to detail is not only worthy of the highest praise and enhances the atmosphere hundred-fold, it also serves to strengthen the emotional connection you feel to Red and Breach(). And the music... Oh my GOD, the music. I really, genuinely can't find words to describe it. The way it's interwoven with the story, the way it reflects the environment and the way it changes with it, the absolutely tear-inducingly gorgeous vocals of Ashley Barrett, the way it peaks and dips at key points, the intensity and beauty of it made me shed tears so many times. The small touches like the Flourish and the humming are incredible additions. The humming especially is one of the saddest things in the game in terms of its significance.I don't want to touch on the story itself, because that's something one must experience on his own, but I will say this: Transistor isn't a dystopian RPG. It isn't a tactical or strategic action RPG. More than anything, it's a tragedy with a heart-rending love story interwoven into it; a tale of choices and consequences. I CANNOT recommend this game more. I could go on praising it forever, and it deserves every last bit of it. I don't know how Supergiant did this.

Logan Cunningham once again brings the character alive in front of our faces.The combat is creative and complex, you will never run out of fun trying out new strategies.The artistic world is so surreal and beautiful sometimes you want to live in it.The music is so sad and sweet, you will listen to it even if you are not playing the game.10/10 Supergiant Games rocks!P.S.: Also check out SG's new game Pyre! Their third game which is Fantasy-RPG-Football, yes you hear right, somehow they managed to mix them together and created yet another unique game!			"

												Honestly... I didn't like the look of this game when I first saw it. I watched review after review and I was constantly balancing on the bridge on whether or not to purchase it. Eventually I decided to take a leap of faith considering that the same company brought out Bastion. At first I was confused with the game mechanics, but I caught on relatively quickly. As usual, the artwork is amazing. And Don't get me started on the storyline... It sounds simple, a beautiful protagonist is stripped of everything and fights back to regain what was hers. But by the end of the game you are truely attached to Red and The Transister.If you loved Bastion, give this a go.And if that didn't pursuade you... The Transistor is voiced by the same guy who Narrarated Bastion.I weapt... I weapt like a little girl in this game and I am not affraid to admit it			"

												I planned on 'acquiring' the soundtrack after finishing Transistor.Instead, I bought it.That should pretty much sum up how much I enjoyed this game...On more specific notes... Combat: The combat is brilliantly designed, challenging and engaging, with a level of -meaningful- customization that actually hurts to think about. Every time I reached a station where I could change my 'loadout', I did; and everytime, it completely changed the way I interacted with the environment and the enemy. I never 'settled in' to a particular playstyle, because I felt compelled to experiment.Music: It is not only *expletive* amazing, but your character can and *is* be an integral part of it. This is the only game I know of where music is almost more immersive than the story.Graphics\Animation\Art\etc: Look at the screenshots above and then imagine it barely does the game justice. The travel sequences alone are just... yeah...Story: Find out yourself (but I thoroughly enjoyed it).Summary: If you don't have the money to buy the game, perform 'favours' and acquire some.  "

												It's hard to describe this game without using the word ""beautiful"" at least several hundred times, along with other adjectives, such as ""amazing"", ""addicting"", and ""magnificent"". I'm shocked how some people don't realize its true intentions as rather a story you are thrown into to experience first hand. I'll try to explain this further with no spoilers:The beginning throws you straight into the game; no main menu, no background story, nothing. I had to YouTube the game just to make sure I hadn't accidently skipped an intro cutscene, but sure enough, what I was seeing was the way it was intended to begin. Already, I was impressed.Gameplay felt comfortable. No stretching my tiny, feminine fingers out to reach oddly specific keys. Mouse controls were smooth and responsive. I never had a problem getting stuck on anything or walking into walls. My first time playing through I obviously relied on the Turn() aspect of the combat quite a bit, but towards the end and on my second time around, I realized the benefits of using both styles of combat, using the real time more for specific enemies that either evaded the effects of Turn() or were not of importance to waste it on. The key feature of applying Functions as a normal active function, an upgrade, or a passive stat was genius and allows for any person's unique fighting strategies. With how flexible the combat is, I'm surprised people have complaints about it.The characters and dialogue of the entire game were enthralling and immersive. I felt highly connected with Red's character, and knew so much about her despite her ailment. That never stopped her character from shining through. Her sassy yet proper attitude was visible in her actions, not to mention how weak and afraid she truly was. She didn't have the amazing super strength to lift such a giant sword all the time. It would constantly dragged behind her, but she would gather her little strength to unleash amazing attacks, usually having to lift herself and the sword back up off the ground afterwards. She was constantly playing with her hair and adjusting herself, but obviously was not too absorbed in her looks, seeing that she tore such a beautiful ball gown to shreds for the sake of being able to run. Mr. Nobody, as he titles himself at an early point and what I prefer to call him since, no, he is not the Transistor itself, still shines through despite not even having a body. His voice acting is absolutely amazing. Every word meant something. Some lines made tears well up in my eyes. He had attitude as well, much more sarcastic and joking, but he was just as believable as Red.The story, while I won't say much, was just beautiful. It's never what you expect, but not hard to follow along with. I will say the trailer gives false ideas and practically lies about the true story. Playing this blind is an amazing experience. Do me a favor and when Mr. Nobody starts talking, don't cut him off. Let him speak. All the dialogue means something in the story and if you cut him off, you could lose so much of the true story and not understand things in the future. A lot of playthroughs on YouTube do this. Don't cut off the experience for yourself. Take the extra time to sit there and just listen.The music is just fantastic, and the little hum you can play for each track gives it a new spin and practically makes it a different song. All the music is addicting and plays perfectly along side the gameplay. The music is mellow and slow, so you never feel rushed in a battle, making the combat feel smooth and relaxed rather than frantic. The music is meant to calm you in the fray of battle and does so quite well. The art speaks for itself. Even if you hate the game, you can't deny its beauty. Everything looks hand painted. The 3D models are high definition, to the point where Red's facial expressions are visible. I'm simply obsessed with the artistic style they chose.Final boss and ending sequence brought me to tears. I sobbed like a little girl, but for good reason, so don't judge. I had been near tears for most of the game due to its music and voice acting and the end pulled the final strings to my heart. It has been a very long time since a game has done this for me. I will ask you all again something here; if you beat it, when it asks you to play the recursion, at least watch the intro again. If the slight secret difference in the intro does not compel you to play more, than I'm not sure what will.To be blunt, I'm kind of an expert on this game. I've been tracking it since its announcement at E3, watched all the demos and trailers, received it on the release day, have the soundtrack on my phone, and at the time of posting this I have racked up about 14 hours on the game. I will say if you're expecting a casual game of the typical demographic of 13-17 year old boys, this has no time for you. This game requires patience, attention, and heart. It is not the game's fault if you do not feel the need to provide it with these then seek to trash it for ""not being good enough"". Before you judge it, follow my suggestion of listening to all the dialogue and at least attempt to finish it. The game should take someone who is not rushed about 10 hours; not long at all. This game is a story and an experience, not something you can mindlessly blow through.My final rating is 10/10, simply because it brought me to tears not once, not twice, but three times, and I'll happily cry again just to play through it once more to immerse myself in its beautiful story.

												Game Name: TransistorOriginal Release: 2014Personal Rating: AEstimated Playtime:18 HoursMultiplayer/Coop?: NonePlayed on: Steam ControllerTransistor is an indie game created from the same makers of Bastion. It is a unique rpg that has an interesting balance between turn-based gameplay and real time gameplay.Controls: When I played this, I used the Steam Controller. It wasn’t hard to use at all, and it seemed rather natural to use a controller with the game. Joystick seemed prime for the movement option, and the four buttons on the face of the controller worked really well with the four skills that you have to use in-game.Graphics: This isn’t a Crysis level of graphics. Coming straight out of an indie studio, it seems unique and more like art. Cut-scenes mix in well with the 2.5D gameplay, and it’s easy to figure out what is happening as time goes on.Music: Much like Bastion, Supergiant Games (the creators) release excellent soundtracks and this is no exception. Between the songs that you unlock and Red’s (the Main Character) humming, you find yourself playing the game for the music instead of the gameplay.Overall: Transistor has a unique and potent combination of great music, easy controls and compelling gameplay, all within a fun game with an interesting plot. No super strategy is needed as you will eventually figure out the game throughout time. I would recommend it at any price, but it does drop down during the sales.			"

												This is the kind of story and game that's worth a second, or even third, play through, because the first time around just isn't enough to enjoy every little detail. And the details are definitely worth looking in to. The mechanics are stupidly fun to play with. Darren Korb absolutely knocks it out of the park with the soundtrack much like he did with Bastion. And the story, though you may have some qualms about the ending, is deep and lovely in its own right. The overall experience of the game flows very well, and everything just feels cohesive.			"

												In Transistor, you play as the silent starlet and singer Red, traversing the eerily empty yet colourful city of Cloudbank. The city is slowly being overtaken by a mysterious force known only as the Process, and Cloudbank's leaders have something to do with it. Desperate to put a stop to whatever's happening, Red goes out to hunt -- but not alone. She carries a sword-like contraption with her known as the Transistor, whose dulcet and heartfelt tones guide her (and you) through a decaying world...Pros+ Beautiful, mesmerizing art & visuals+ The Transistor's narration of the game+ The dreamy, cyber-like soundtrack+ Combining functions for cool attack abilities+ The overall emotional impactCons- Combat can get a bit repetitive- The main story could have been longer & more in-depth- Some story elements are left deliberately vagueThis one of the most beautiful & artful games I've ever played! The overall cyberpunkish atmosphere, the gorgeous artwork, the hauntingly loving voice of the Transistor... The game has story elements that are quite familiar in the sci-fi sphere, but its execution is just so good. I fell in love with Red, the Transistor, and their world in a little over five hours already, and bawled my eyes out at certain points during the story. The emotional pacing, aided by the superb soundtrack, was fantastic. The upsides of this game far outweigh any downsides -- which for me personally, were the slightly repetitive combat (mostly due to lots of the same enemy types, I think) and the fact that the first run-through of the story was not longer, meatier & more in-depth.Like sci-fi, strategical planning in combat (on pause), and a deeply emotional story? Then this one's for you. This game is a perfect little jewel, with my compliments to Logan Cunningham's excellent voice acting as the Transistor.			"

												I really like Bastion and was really excited for SuperGiant's next game.  Transistor did not disapoint.  The fighting style was unique and interesting because you had to combine moves together to make them more powerful and give unique secondary abilities based on which ones you combined.  I was also surprised to find that I didn't stick with one set of moves the whole time. Transistor did a good job of making abilities good in some situations and bad in others.  It became very strategic once you got more moves and it was a lot of fun. But by far the BEST part about Transistor was the music and art.  Bastion was one of my favorite games not because the gameplay was the something I had never seen before, but that game was a paradise for your eyes and ears.  I always thought Bastion had the best soundtrack in a videogame but after playing Transistor I was blown away. The vocals for the songs are by the same person who sang ""Build that Wall"", (Ashley Barrett) except in this game you get to hear the full potential of her voice, and let me tell you, it is the best voice I have ever heard.  It fits the tone of the game really well.  The art in this game is also amazing. Particularly the colors and overall style was what really looked great.  This game also does a great job of making the story interesting by making you figure out what it is based on clues it gives you throughout the game.  In fact one of my favorite aspects was reading through character files looking for clues on what was going on.My only complaints about this game kind of negate each other.  What I mean is, I took the game quite slow, and I still finished it in 7 hours, which with how much I enjoyed it seemed short.  On the other hand, the combat system was starting to get a little repetative so I don't know that I would have wanted it to go much longer.  Overall I loved this game, and with the very interesting story, amazing music, and incredible art, I felt like it almost should have been a movie instead of a videogame for how beautiful it was. 9/10			"

												Very rarely is it that a game can surprise me - and Transistor managed to surprise me with just about everything.  It set the perfect mood with its beautiful art style and soundtrack.  The gameplay was variable without being overbearing and tied into the storytelling elements with seamless grace.  In short, Transistor is the kind of game I get to play perhaps once every couple of years, if I'm lucky, and it will stay with me for a very long time to come.  Mainstream titles wish they were as good as this.

												Transistor in many ways expands on the unique elements of Supergiant's earlier title, Bastion. First and foremost is continued use of Bastion's characteristic piece-by-piece narrative structure, this time with the help of a new narrator whose rough mumbling voice is surprisingly well suited to the staggered delivery. The game further draws inspiration from Bastion's niche musical style, bringing that surreal feminine voice to the fore with a hummed melody over almost every track in the game and continuing with the dark isolating tunes that leave the player stuck within the character's head in an unknown world.Using a similar camera and layout structure as Bastion, Transistor's gameplay sets itself apart through a series of equippable nodes collected throughout the story, each with its own unique effect depending on whether it's used as the base attack, an upgrade to a base attack, or a passive item. These nodes can be temporarily sidelined when your health runs out in combat and, as challenges become harder and your collection of nodes becomes larger, you'll find yourself shuffling them about into new combinations before each new stretch of the game, crafting hundreds of different attacks from the dozen or so nodes you will collect.This game is gorgeous, by the way. The colors are mind-numbingly vibrant at times and the in-game stills give you that same giddy feeling you get when flipping through an ""Art of ..."" book for your favorite movie or game. If eyes could weep, well... never mind.While many of the things that make this game a masterpiece are drawn very clearly from the success of Bastion, Transistor stands alone in much the same way as Tolkien's books outside of the LOTR or Monty Python's work outside of The Holy Grail have done. It is a much desired expansion of Supergiant's own storytelling and game design.**The soundtrack is on Spotify for anyone who's curious.			"

												This game is everything you'd expect from SuperGiant Games, which is great, but also a little disappointing. The artwork, music, story and acting is phenomenal, and the gameplay is rock solid --- just like Bastion, by which I mean that it's great like Bastion is great, but also that it's great in pretty much the exact same ways that Bastion is great. It's not Bastion 2, but you wouldn't know it if it wasn't for the title. I can certainly understand that it'd be nearly impossible for SuperGiant Games to release a game without having it constantly compared to Bastion --- and maybe that's why they chose to not deviate too much from what made Bastion amazing. I don't know. But I have already played Bastion and been thoroughly amazed by it. Obviously a second iteration of the formula isn't going to leave the same impression, and thus Transistor falls a little flat, which is completely unfair to say after using adjectives such as ""phenomenal"" and ""rock solid"" about it, but that's the reality. It's a phenomenal and rock solid game that somehow doesn't quite impress as much as you'd expect it to. I'd still recommend it in a heartbeat though. And, I do want to say that the biggest deviation from SuperGiant Games' previous indie smash hit, the combat system, is really, really good and it makes battles feel very futuristic, manageable and awesome.TL;DR: This game has everything that Bastion had --- and more. And that is, however weird it may sound, probably its weakest point.			"

 Truely AmazingMy First review to a game, i will try my best to tell you the pro's and cons with my personal expierence throught the game.I am an Indie Game Lover. Transistor is one of those titles that  pulled off what indie game spirit is all about. It is visually stunning with isometric graphics and a beautiful setting in a futuristic world which looks something like futuristic tokyo. It has a narrative story which is well driven with a mystery element to it.The most amazing part of the game though, is the GAMEPLAY and the Combat mechanics with no tutorial given, it is left for the player to figure it out. The controls are like MOBA(if you play from a keyboard+mouse), but the gameplay is nowhere near it(in a positive way), the combat style is highly customizable which gives every player the chance to adapt and change their playstyle as required and making the game more enjoyable. With a large repertoire of moves and the adrenaline rush obtained from implementing combos and  the stratergy of planning the moves makes the game unique and fun to play.Pros--Highly cutomizable gameplay mechanics -Stunning visuals- Phenomenal Soundtrack -Well Narrated storyline with a Mystery element - Good Difficulty level of the game(which may be a con for some players)Cons--Occasional framedrops and lag but its indie so can't really complain-No tutorial may be a negative for first timers or people new to gaming-Slow driven storyline and not that strong.( for me gameplay superceded the weak story)			"

												This game, one word, AMAZING. The creators that brought us Bastion, another fantastic game, have done it again. I have finished playing through this game twice now to get all the achievements which I have done. It's so addicting. The combat is very unique and strategic. The story itself is fairly short however there are several extra things you can do like read all the terminals that you can find or do all the ""Tests"" in the break area that you can access ever once in awhile throughout the game.The tests get fairly challenging and to increase difficulty of the game overall you can turn on ""Limiters"" which make the fights tougher depending on what each one does. The more you have on though the more XP you gain per fight, so it's a good trade off. New Game+ is available which let's you keep everything you have gotten so far including level of course. It makes the battles harder right off the bat and with the Limiters on it's quite difficult.All in all I give this game a solid 10/10, honestly one of the best games I have played in awhile and anyone that was a fan of Bastion should really pick up this great and unique game.P.S: The music, they did an amazing job again just like they did in Bastion. :3 Enjoy guys!

												It's clear that an immense amount of TLC went into the creation of this marvelous game.With an incredibly intuitive combat system that still manages to remain fast paced to keep you on your toes, Transistor is the perfect blend of turn based and real time action gaming. Infinite combinations of Functions - this game's ""skills"" - allow you to create your own play style as you see fit, putting a good amount of strategizing outside of battle as well.Transistor's graphics and art are definitely top notch. While my device isn't optimized for gaming at all, I'm still able to run the game fairly smoothly, although I of course cannot enjoy it in all its beauty. The original soundtrack is good enough to be worth buying as DLC.Finally, Transistor's story is one that will make your head hurt - in a good way! It doesn't have any ugly plotholes or leave you confused, but you will definitely be pondering about it for quite some time after completing it.Though I bought Transistor on sale, I can truthfully say that it is more than worth its full price; I absolutely recommend buying this game to anyone considering doing so.

But on further NG+, I began to see how fun it was to mix and match the different weapons, and try much harder runs with the limiters activated.  All in all, I think it was money well spent.

												I usually trudge through a game's actual gameplay to get it over with, but Transistor's gameplay was so enjoyable and solid that I found myself playing through the entire game again the very next day. The deep customization of your abilities with the various Functions(), the blend of real time frantic play with the powerful frozen planning of Turn(), and difficulty scaling done right make all the game extremely enjoyable to play. There are unbelievably powerful ability combos in the game, but you're always facing enemies that can meet the challenge. If you're not, then there's still the combat modifiers and restrictions you can add. Story-wise, the world is significantly more sparse and spare than Supergiant's previous title, Bastion, but it seems to be an intentional choice: a bit of mystery allows for varied interpretations and a long narrative shelf life, which is what I think they were going for in this game. I think they leaned a little too far in the direction of limiting information, but the game doesn't suffer for it too much. I think the endgame buildup and final fight were excellently executed and they are going to be a favorite among the games I've played.			"

												Supergiant has outdone themselves with Transistor. As with Bastion, the musical score is stunning and the storyline is engaging. However, they've upped the ante with the combat, giving you plenty of options and different combinations to try. And, if you're into lore (as I am), then there's plenty of that too. The world is amazing, too. The game doesn't take long to get through, but that's not particularly a bad thing in my opinion. At the time of this writing, I just finished the first playthrough (and the time is including the time I took to read through all the lore that I have unlocked at this point). If you enjoy action RPGs, or action games, or RPGs, you will probably enjoy Transistor. Well worth the money.			"

												Transistor is a game best described as unique. The game looks, plays, and sounds like nothing else out there, and, even more impressively, exexuctes nearly all of these innovative ideas to perfection. The best game of 2014 so far. Pros: - The combat. It's a hybrid of turn based strategy and arena action a la Bastion. The standard mode allows free movement and usage of up to 4 equppied abilities (mostly) without cooldown. Pressing space initiates Turn(), which allows you to expend a set number of action points to move and perform abilities at hundreds of times the speed of the standard mode. Turn()'s cooldown length varies based the percentage of action points you used, and all abilities are locked while these points regenerate. Its a brilliant system made more so by the enemy design that forces you to quickly and strategically switch between the two modes. - The customization. Every ability is a function that can be equipped as an active ability, a passive ability, or overload an active ability with additional functionality. Additional memory and slots to equip functions unlock as the game progresses, allowing for a staggering number of highly unique loadouts. This system allows for nearly any playstyle imaginable to be viable. Using a method in one of its three roles unlock additional backstory material, strongly encouraging experimentation without ever forcing anything. Losing all health in a battle temporarily locks an ability each time it happens, further encouraging creative loadouts while waiting for the locked ability to restore. - Tests and limiters. The game features 23 tests (and additional Access tests available only on a second playthrough) of your ability to use Turn(), to survive unwinnable situations, to clear enemies with only select functions available, and your speed in standard combat. The majority of these tests are very well designed and often very challenging. All are entirely optional and unlock tracks for the music player. Similarly, limiters are fully optional abilities unlocked at various points in the story that can be equipped to increase the challenge and XP gain of combat. They're a clever way to provide and reward customizable difficulty. - The art and music. The screenshots and videos on the store page really don't do it justice. Transistor is one of the best looking and sounding games ever made. - The story. Like Bastion, the critical parts of the story are delivered largely through narration. Unlike Bastion, the non-critical majority of the story is found in terminals, function descriptors, and view points that are all fully optional and found only through exploration. All of it is interesting, well written, and best left to experience on your own. - New game+. Transistor calls NG+ ""Recurse."" This allows you to play through the game again with all of your abilities and limiters from before. Enemies also retain their abilities, however. Recurse also provides access to higher player levels and additional tests that are not unlockable in a single playthrough. Cons- Some of the dialogue is a bit weak. Notes:- The story is much better than it gets credit for. That said, it's much more abstract that what you usually see in games. There's a good chance you won't like it if you're looking for a story that gives every question a clear resolution. This applies especially to the ending. - The game is about 5 hours long on first playthrough. Recurse can likely double that. I think it's good enough to justify a $2-$4 an hour price tag. If you don't, wait for a sale. - Although by no means necessary, some basic knowledge of programming terms will likely make the game more slightly more interesting. It's entertaining to see how some terms were turned into combat abilities, and knowing what a few mean in reality will add a bit to the story. None of it is essential for understanding.			"

												First off, beware. This game is short.That said, I loved it. Story is confusing, but in a good way. Makes you think, makes you work for the backstory. I also REALLY did not see some of the plot points coming. Gameplay is fun, and very customizable. You have the sandbox zone for the occasional change of pace. It's a game that I feel like should seem grindy, but isn't at all. I had fun from beginning to end.New game+ is fun, though in my limited encounters with it it is just the original game but with your progress saved.Worth 20 bucks?

												8/10 - Transistor is the first title released by the studio Supergiant Games since their excellent piece of work - Bastion, and just like Bastion; this game has plenty of charm. Lovely visuals, satisfying music and wonderful voice acting (particularly from Logan Cunningham, the man who played the Stranger in Supergiants' previous game, coming back for another smooth performance) are all to be expected here.The playtime is about 10 hours. For better or for worse, the story is kept vague throughout. Also - for better or worse - the combat system allows you to stop time in order to plan out attacks. This helps plot out attack patterns and devise strategies accordingly - but on the other hand it can make the combat feel disjointed occansionally.Overall the game is lovely, endearing and tugs on a few emotional heartstrings. Also the game has a hum button! You have to love a game with a hum button!			"

												The amount of love and skill that went into this game is incredible.As a person years late to Bastion, Transistor was the first game I experienced from Supergiant Games. I decided to finish both games before writing this review and personally I feel that this game is more favorable even though its story is more linear in comparison. It is absolutely worth every penny.The artwork, Jen Zee's work, is so beautiful I want to cry. The soundtrack for this game among the best I've heard and I highly recommend buying it if you can. Voice acting felt intimate and natural & the hidden array of diverse side characers were an interesting touch. All of this gave life to the otherwise enigmatic and vaguely-defined world of Transistor.Furthermore, the combat system in this game is very rewarding and can be made difficult for those who want that spicy challenge. The developers tried something new and it worked.Supergiant please take my wallet and soul.			"

												Think of it as Diablo 2 with an optional turn-by-turn mode in a beautiful art deco apocalypse.To boil it down, you choose between 'functions' (which work like attacks in Pokemon: of many, you only get four at once) to mow down robots in a gorgeously-rendered future city. The kicker: every few seconds you can pause the action, move about, and queue up a combo of attacks. When you unpause, you whoosh about the battle spitting explosions. You've got a few seconds of helpless fleeing - then you're off again, chaining up attacks.Trust me: nothing beats laying down three consecutive damage multipliers on a high-level enemy then knocking them off in a single hit. Difficulty can be raised with optional handicaps called Limiters.There's a clever system around the functions themselves, too: any function can modify another or provide a passive bonus. I.e., you can add a quick-firing attack to a slower one – increasing the slower attack’s speed, but forgoing the quicker attack entirely.			"

												Transistor: Not a bad game. Supergiant play to their strengths, which is an isometric 3d world with beautiul art, a sweet soundtrack and a narrator that narrates everything about you in a nice rich voice.The problem I have with it is largely that, though. Supergiant stuck to their strengths and did not really push much of any boundaries, and it wasn't really that novel; Bastion 2.0, really.The main innovation is in the combat system, which I do sorta like - hate having to use Turn(), love how all your attacks work as primary attacks, upgrade modules or passive items. I also like the semi-online aspect, where you can see ghosts of other people, a'la Dark Souls. (At least, I'm pretty sure they are, and I'm sure the numerous polls you use are actually being formed by other players voting as well)One bug I had, which wasn't fatal, but severely annoying in that my game randomly locks up for maybe 3 seconds when I do things like attack.Worth buying -- if you've played Bastion, though, might want to wait until it's like $15 or cheaper instead of the full $20, because they feel like the same game almost.

												'Transistor' merits artistic recognition for its soundtrack and design. The game is visually interesting and colourful, and I'd recommend it purely for its visual showcase. Unfortunately, the storyline is somewhat confusing and hard to follow; I began to grasp the story toward the end of my first play-through and on my second, and unavoidably more challenging play-through, the story began to make more sense. Perhaps this was intentional, hoping to ensure good replay value. I didn't mind playing the game again, as the gameplay was fun (and at times challenging), however poor storytelling is certainly this game's downfall.			"

												Transistor is a 2D isometric adventure game done by the same creators of bastion. Like bastion, the game looks beautiful, has a good soundtrack, and similiar to bastion, you're accompanied by a narrator/partner of sorts.  Unlike bastion, the combat is a bit different. Your character is slow, and doesn't really posses a guard, instead you can use evasive skills or initate turn(), which pauses the game and lets you queue up a certain number of actions.  It's an interesting mechanic and the way the game is set up lets you customize your abilites very well and inutitively. However, combat at later levels starts to get boring, you're either stunlocking the enemies or just hiding for your turn() to recharge, it's not at all the fast pased quick acting combat in Bastion.  I don't want to spoil anything, but the final boss is awful, it's like they shoved in a jrpg boss into an action game, you can't do anything about attacks, it's all about dealing damage quicker than it can.Wasn't a fan of the ending either, but that's a more personal thing.

												This was probably the best Steam Summer Sale 2014 game I purchased. A very linear game, but with much more customization than expected. Combining multiple skills into one powerful skill, and those you choose not to use to attack with can be used passively on youself so they don't go to waste. Transistor has the same narrator feel that Bastion did, making the story feel just as great as their previous game.Would highly recommend to purchase this during the Winter Sale if you enjoy a mixture of Action/Turn Strategy *Not 100% Turn Based*Its worth the NewGame+ it has to offer, which I will need to begin now..

												Transistor is a game with many, many great aspects, but one inherent flaw that will completely kill the game for many (particularly those who are less gaming-inclined). Let me start with the good bits:- The soundtrack is superb. It's just a small notch below Bastion's. The vocal pieces are great as well.- The art style is clear and concise. It suits the game, and the full-screen images and between-area cutscenes are nice.- The difficulty curve was implemented solidly, and the game includes a ""Limiter"" system (identical to the Idols in Bastion) which allows you to tweak the difficulty as you see fit by adding various new strengths to the enemies.- Combat is a bit clunky, but it makes sense within the game's premise. The Turn() system rectifies this by turning Transistor from an action game into a strategy game -- you have a ""freeze time"" ability which allows you to plan out your next moves and execute them afterwards.- All of your abilities (called Functions) can be equipped as active abilities (4), upgrades for active abilities (2 each), and passive abilities (4). It can get a bit convoluted and for some reason the menus didn't play well with my XBox controller's analog stick, but other than that it was fine.The humongous downside to this game is in death. When you die, your most powerful active ability will ""overload"", rendering it unusable until you have passed enough checkpoints. Essentially, this means that when you die, your character gets significantly less powerful -- and not just for the current encounter, either. Numerous Limiters cause your character to have less MEM (to equip Functions with) and cause those Functions to overload for longer. You could equip a very powerful ability that you don't plan to use to offset this -- but Functions cost MEM to equip, and your MEM is very limited until you approach the maximum value (which won't be until your second playthrough). Even with max MEM, I did not have enough to equip 4 decent actives, 4 passives and all upgrades for each active.This can be an incredibly frustrating process, and I often found myself dying repeatedly on purpose after the first death just to restart so I wouldn't lose everything for so long -- particularly with 10 Limiters on. If you are not very good at video games in general you will get very frustrated very fast, as the game is horribly unforgiving when it comes to death. I consider myself to be pretty OK at games but I still found this a bit irriating -- tolerable during the normal game but downright ridiculous with 10 Limiters.This game could easily be a 9/10, but I feel that dying completely soils an otherwise-wonderful experience. I'd be perfectly ok with flat-out dying and having to restart, or any other penalty really -- but not the one they chose. Not sure what they were thinking.So, all in all,""6/10 it was ok"" - Foffy			"

												In Transistor, you play as the silent starlet and singer Red, traversing the eerily empty yet colourful city of Cloudbank. The city is slowly being overtaken by a mysterious force known only as the Process, and Cloudbank's leaders have something to do with it. Desperate to put a stop to whatever's happening, Red goes out to hunt -- but not alone. She carries a sword-like contraption with her known as the Transistor, whose dulcet and heartfelt tones guide her (and you) through a decaying world...Pros+ Beautiful, mesmerizing art & visuals+ The Transistor's narration of the game+ The dreamy, cyber-like soundtrack+ Combining functions for cool attack abilities+ The overall emotional impactCons- Combat can get a bit repetitive- The main story could have been longer & more in-depth- Some story elements are left deliberately vagueThis one of the most beautiful & artful games I've ever played! The overall cyberpunkish atmosphere, the gorgeous artwork, the hauntingly loving voice of the Transistor... The game has story elements that are quite familiar in the sci-fi sphere, but its execution is just so good. I fell in love with Red, the Transistor, and their world in a little over five hours already, and bawled my eyes out at certain points during the story. The emotional pacing, aided by the superb soundtrack, was fantastic. The upsides of this game far outweigh any downsides -- which for me personally, were the slightly repetitive combat (mostly due to lots of the same enemy types, I think) and the fact that the first run-through of the story was not longer, meatier & more in-depth.Like sci-fi, strategical planning in combat (on pause), and a deeply emotional story? Then this one's for you. This game is a perfect little jewel, with my compliments to Logan Cunningham's excellent voice acting as the Transistor.			"

												Game Name: TransistorOriginal Release: 2014Personal Rating: AEstimated Playtime:18 HoursMultiplayer/Coop?: NonePlayed on: Steam ControllerTransistor is an indie game created from the same makers of Bastion. It is a unique rpg that has an interesting balance between turn-based gameplay and real time gameplay.Controls: When I played this, I used the Steam Controller. It wasn’t hard to use at all, and it seemed rather natural to use a controller with the game. Joystick seemed prime for the movement option, and the four buttons on the face of the controller worked really well with the four skills that you have to use in-game.Graphics: This isn’t a Crysis level of graphics. Coming straight out of an indie studio, it seems unique and more like art. Cut-scenes mix in well with the 2.5D gameplay, and it’s easy to figure out what is happening as time goes on.Music: Much like Bastion, Supergiant Games (the creators) release excellent soundtracks and this is no exception. Between the songs that you unlock and Red’s (the Main Character) humming, you find yourself playing the game for the music instead of the gameplay.Overall: Transistor has a unique and potent combination of great music, easy controls and compelling gameplay, all within a fun game with an interesting plot. No super strategy is needed as you will eventually figure out the game throughout time. I would recommend it at any price, but it does drop down during the sales.			"

												Short Review, for the lazy.Slightly reminiscent of Bioshock in tone, this game does a superb job of tying the story and the gameplay together without it being obtuse. As you progress through the game and level up, both the story and the gameplay get much deeper and more engaging, which I found sublime.I 100% recommend this game to anybody who liked Bastion, the original Bioshock, or even video games in general and 69% recommend this to absolutely anybody. One of my favourite games of all time.+ Exciting combat that continually gets deeper+ Story is engaging, with more to be found for those who care to look for it+ Story and combat interwoven beautifully+ Wonderful Art and Sound design+ NG+ Mode and non-story content+ Option to make the game harder for rewards- Story is on the short side for a single playthrough- Some mechanics are under-explained "

												+ Awesome Soundtrack+ Great Narrator / Guiding Voice+ Beautiful Graphics+ Interesting Combatsystem+ Intriguing Characters and StoryTransistor is a true beauty among the many available games there are.As soon as I started the game I wanted to know: What exactly happened here? Who is this woman/main-character we're controlling? Whats up with this sword? I tracked along the streets of the beautiful town to find that out and soon met enemys, trying to stop me.The combatsystem is really nice, but really interesting for me was how I could change the ensuing fight before it even happens. You can have different abilities with different characteristics.. and switch them around! That way, you can create the set of abilitys that you are most comfortable with to battle. And the battle itself can be altered as well with modifications - some simply strengthen the enemy, others give them shields, but in the end the harder battles will be rewarded with more experience.But the best part of the game are still its graphics, everything is so well made and beautiful. I would have loved to just walk around and look at everything.Getting to know the characters even better would have been nice too, but every game needs to end - And this ending.. was a surprise for me.

												Gorgeous art, good voice-acting, superb worldbuilding and characters. The gameplay is interesting - thanks to the key mechanic of psuedo-turn-based pausing, it's challenging without being inaccessible to those that can't or don't want to deal with a lot of difficulty. It is only about 10 hours of gameplay, but frankly I've never considered that to be all that important as long as it's a product as polished as this.			"

												A deeply inspired game. Transistor not only has a nice aesthetic, but a handful of well implemented and creative gameplay mechanics. It is a healthy marriage of arcade power-ups and tactics, where player experimentation is key. For games that promise both live and turn based action, the player is usually given the choice between either - in Transistor you will want to master both forms of gameplay if you wish to gain the edge.The most intriguing part of the game is the power-up system. Throughout the game the player collects a series of ""functions"". These functions can be used as new attacks - choosing up to a total of four moves. Each function has a unique effect, letting the player choose from sneak attacks, long range strikes, clustering explosions, summoning minions, and more, or any combination of these. But the functions aren't limited to simple attacks. In addition to the four move slots, the player also has four passive slots to install their functions, and each move has two upgrade slots. The upgrades are really something special, allowing the player to improve and expand on or even change completely the nature of a move. As the player collects more of these functions, playstyles can become more and more diverse. The number of possibilities are staggering.The gameplay itself is challenging enough that certain combinations may be found ineffective or require careful planning and skill to use. This is what makes the game whole as an interactive experience. The player has to strategize, adapt, evaluate, refine, rearrange. You can't just brute force your way through (though certain combinations do give a whole new meaning to ""brute force""). You can't just grind to max stats and max gear.If you like games that emphasize tactics and positioning, and enjoy making lots of experimental play styles. THIS is the game for YOU. If you don't, well, do me a favor, play it anyway.			"

												To all those that have only played 2 hours and think the combat is boring, you have to give the combat a chance. Once Red obtains new functions and you turn on all the limiters it actually becomes quit strategic and the multitudes of function combinations is just staggering.The Music and Art direction is phenomenal.The story is mediocre, and sometimes the voice over work just seems off, however that is not a common occurrence.There are still some launch day bugs, but this is just the first week I guess.It's a great game, marred only be its brevity. Ran the course of the game twice. Generally had on limiters a majority of the time, finished at about 50% into level 29, 30 is the cap, confirmed on my third play through. All this took me about 20 hours, where as with Bastion I put in 35 to accomplish everything.The second playthrough was actually better in my opinion, because it opened up some new challenges.I wish it had an arena with hordes of enemies like Bastion, which was my favorite part of that game.

												Transistor was an absolute delight to play through. Definitely not a walk in the park but it also wasn't super easy. The experience is definitely best enjoyed playing with the added difficulty provided by Limiters and in Recursion Mode where you keep your progress but replay through the game with heightened difficulty. Enemies will scale up to your current level and ability in the game in the 2nd go-around.Praises aside, the game has some performance issues that will hopefully be ironed out in future updates and I feel like the experience was missing something. I was under the impression that the game would have some more puzzle features given an earlier sequence, but it's almost entirely combat oriented with Turn() being a strategic, puzzle mode.I would recommend this game to anyone looking for a a refreshing experience and who enjoys an immersive environment. This game's captivating soundtrack, art style, and general tone makes me wish I could have known more about Cloudbank and explored the city more.Thank you Supergiant for this amazing game! After playing it at Day of the Devs back in October I was eagerly awaiting the game's release!Can't wait to make my way through more of Recursion mode!			"

												Alright, first and foremost let me point out that I have recommended this game, which will contrast with what will sound like a negative review. If it comes off that way it's because I felt like Transistor could have been so much more, but standing next to Bastion it's withering in the shade. Overall it was an enjoyable experience, but at the end of the day I'm glad I got it on sale or I might have been very disappointed.Let's start with the things I enjoyed about the game. The thing that jumps out first is that there's a lot of love behind this game. You can tell that Supergiant wanted to really connect with their audience by creating an immersive world and characters that you can sympathize with. The real-time/active-time combat tries new things while staying grounded in somewhat familiar territory for most strategy/rpg fans, and being able to 'socket' abilities into other abilities makes for some interesting emergent play-styles.Now for the things I didn't find very enjoyable, or thought could have been done better:First- about that immersive environment Supergiant wanted to create in Transistor. Personally, I felt like that was a total whiff. They should have called this game Esoterica, because it's filled with fluff that is never explained. It's like picking up a sci-fi book you've never read before and know nothing about- picking a random page in the middle, and reading for four hours. By the end you know more than you did at the beginning, but you're still lost for the most part.. you're missing fundamental information to make sense of the story.As far as the characters go, I wanted to feel connected to them- I read every little bio and sought out every OVA station to learn more about the world and its inhabitants- but it feels hollow. Like they're trying too hard to live up to Bastion, which achieved greatness in both gameplay and storytelling almost effortlessly.I found the ""narrator"" in this game to be completely obnoxious. In Bastion the narrator added a lot of flavor and backstory to the world, since as a third party witness to the events that were going down, he could provide information that the player needed to feel connected to the things that were happening around them. In Transistor, he just monologues.. it's like going on a road trip with somebody who can't make meaningful conversation and doesn't like the sound of silence so they read every billboard you see. Eventually you would rather swerve into oncoming traffic than hear that there's a Cracker Barrel in 2.7 miles.The game itself is reasonably fun, if a bit repetitive (which is kind of a strike against it in its own right... how can a game with so much personality be repetitive after only 3 hours?). The ability socketing system is a very interesting spin on the whole 'play how you want RPG' genre. It's easily exploitable for those who want an easier time with things- but for players looking for a challenge can apply handicaps that award you with additional experience at the cost of a harder game. I would have liked to see a bit more variety here, but it's clear that they were designing a 4 hour game and not a 20 hour game.I ran into a LOT of bugs, which was disappointing considering how late to the Transistor party I am. Supergiant has had ample time to fine tune the experience- but I was running into issues where all of the AI models were missing (you could mouse over them and get tooltips, but the models were missing). A few times during combat I was teleported outside of the ""ring"" and couldn't get back in, so I was locked into a combat state and couldn't end the fight- so I had to force-close and restart. And just pathing issues in general.. plenty of times I'd click on a point to run to, but Red would choose the most bizarre path to get to an unobstructed position. This happened frequently during combat turns, where the incorrect path taken would basically ruin all of the proceeding commands (attacks firing into thin air, etc). It wasn't so frequent that it was game-breaking, but it happened enough to merit mentioning.And if you don't want any spoilers, this is probably a good spot to stop reading because I need to vent about something that happens at the very end of the game.Still here? Okay. So one of the things I'd read about this game was that it had a ""strong female lead"" and that supergiant was doing a great service to female gamers with Transistor. Now, full disclosure- I'm a dude, so it's entirely possible that I don't get it. I fully recognize that I may in fact lack the extra ""X"" chromosome to understand what girl gamers are looking for in a game with a female lead. However, at the end of the game when Red chooses to off herself to be with this guy we (the player) know nothing about had my eyes rolling into the back of my head. I felt like it was a cheap romantic plug at the end of what could have been a somewhat interesting (albiet confusing) story. Here she is with the 'brush' that could remake the world- she could un♥♥♥♥ everything that the calimari or whoever destroyed. But instead she rebuilds a plaza, then sits down next to the narrator's body and stabs herself with the big blue sword. Poetic I guess? Maybe we need more context. Maybe the world isn't worth saving if they can't be together, but Supergiant gave us NOTHING on this guy. Not a name, not a backstory.. nothing. His bio card is ""Unknown"" with zero information. Anyway.. It's worth playing. It has its problems, but it did not live up to my expectations at all.			"

												A bit on the short side, but the game has a good story, an amazing world with some amazing lore, a stellar soundtrack, and an amazing artstyle. The combat is a bit clunky when it comes to its Turn() system and the amount of time you have to run around like a headless chicken before you can fight again in and out of Turn(). As stated above, the game is short which is sad seeing that there's a beautifully crafted world layed out before you with enough lore to make the city come to life, even if you don't meet more than two or three actual people(barring the character profiles you can unlock throughout the game). Speaking of characters, the characters were alright; there wasn't enough of the game to get truely attached to any of them, which sucked at the end. Overall, I think this game is great; I can't stress that enough, even with its problems. I highly reccomend getting this game and the soundtrack on sale, and set about 5-6 hours aside for a short, but sweet story.			"

												From the creative geniuses at Supergiant Games comes Transistor, a birds-eye sci-fi RPG with a strategic twist in its gameplay functions that creates a gaming experience that is both refreshing and unique in today's video game market. The first thing the player will notice in the game is the art-style and narrative reminiscent of Bastion; stylized environments, characters and enemies that can be instantly recognized and a story that is unveiled in little pieces through the smooth tones of the games narrator, who is actually the talking sword you're using throughout the game. Which creates a much more atmospheric effect than Bastion as the narrator is sharing in your experience instead of outlining what happens as you play. Transistor's story is difficult to percieve at the beginning, but as the player progresses and pays attention to the narrative and ques from the world one can piece it together over time. For the gameplay, Transistor is similar to Bastion in the birds-eye view controls and sporadic groups of enemies that have different strengths and weaknesses that you must approach in a careful manner or else you risk exposing yourself to more damage than needed. However, that is where the similarities between the two games end. Transistor uses a ""Turn()"" function that allows the player to pause combat in order to plan out their movements and attacks, then executing them in rapid succession, Turn() is mildly similar to the VATS system in Fallout 3, but much more unique and reactive than simply ""clik on whurr u wanna shewt and hope u dunt miss"". Turn() is useful for allowing yourself to punch a hole through enemy defences or to allow yourself some breathing room. However the drawback that must be taken into consideration is the short cooldown after Turn() ends, during which you are completely vulnerable as you cannot attack until the cooldown duration ends. Turn() gives players endless possibilities when combined with the notable selection of specific attacks that you are given access to, which can range from a simple energy blast to a quick dash, and even summoning a friendly unit to help you in combat (which can also be controlled during Turn()). One thing that makes the combat fast-paced and reactive are the ""cells"" dropped by all enemies when killed. Cells have a roughly 10 second cooldown timer when dropped, and if aren't picked up before the duration ends the enemy you just killed will respawn with full health, which in my opinion makes the combat much more dynamic and fast paced. Another point of interest in the combat system is the power selection and upgrade system. The player gathers a good selection of abilities throughout the game, but you can only equip four at a time. Never fear, because you can take the other abilities you gathered and use them to upgrade the abilities you currently have equipped to create powerful combinations. The only thing keeping you from upgrading yourself to over-powered proportions and keeping the gameplay balanced is the memory, which will require consideration while upgrading.Finally, instead of chugging down health regenerating items in combat like in Bastion, the player instead needs to be absolutely mindful of their current health. When your health is depleted you will automatically enter an ""Emergency Turn()"" that gives you the chance to eliminate the immediate threat. But once you execute the Turn() you still only have one hitpoint left, and if you get hit again during the cooldown you will return to full health but one of your abilites will be ""overloaded"" and cannot be used until you reach an ""access point"" (which not only act as save points but also are the only places where you can equip and upgrade your abilities). Esentially your abilities act as your lives, and the more you ""die"" at a certain area, the more difficult that area will become.To summarize, Transistor is in my opinion much more fun than Bastion and a game I thoroughly enjoy playing. I honestly recommend Transistor to all who are reading this review.			"

												This game was made by the same studio that made Bastion. It kept the best part of Bastion and added its own touch.Just like Bastion, this game is not just a game : it's a piece of art. Everything in it is beautiful, the artstyle, design, story telling, and musics are absolutely stunning. I only emailed a dev team - to express my satisfaction with a game - twice : one time for Bastion, the second time for Transistor.BUY IT, It's short but absolutely amazing.			"

I cried from this game. No, really. I seriously cried emotional tears of sadness AND joy to this game. Please, for the sake of your life, buy this game. Play it. On a side-note, it's a strategy/RPG on an isometric landscape. The strategy comes in with how you take out enemies or use their attacks to your advantage. The RPG comes in with how you can setup your abilities in the way you like it.10/10 (if there was a way to say 11/10 without making it sound sarcastic, I would.

												Transistor is quite possibly one of the best games to come out in the past 5 years.Everything about this game hits the sweet spot in a way I can only hope to convey in words, The world building is masterful and I would expect no less from the likes of Super Giant games being the master of the art. The gameplay is a mesh of Tactical RPG and an Action RPG, There being a way to switch between real time and the planning stage makes the game go as fast as you want it to go and tailors your combat choices accordingly. The story is somewhat the games weakpoint as it is somewhat vague but very open to interpretation so it will give you some food for thought. This game is worth £30, let alone £15 and should be a must play for people who are into masterful worlds and and rich gameplay. My only complaint would be that the game is a bit on the short side but that is fixed by new game plus letting you keeping all your upgrades and functions while starting from the beginning of the game again. Transistor is a enjoyable albeit short experience that I can recommend to anyone.			"

												A bit on the short side, but the game has a good story, an amazing world with some amazing lore, a stellar soundtrack, and an amazing artstyle. The combat is a bit clunky when it comes to its Turn() system and the amount of time you have to run around like a headless chicken before you can fight again in and out of Turn(). As stated above, the game is short which is sad seeing that there's a beautifully crafted world layed out before you with enough lore to make the city come to life, even if you don't meet more than two or three actual people(barring the character profiles you can unlock throughout the game). Speaking of characters, the characters were alright; there wasn't enough of the game to get truely attached to any of them, which sucked at the end. Overall, I think this game is great; I can't stress that enough, even with its problems. I highly reccomend getting this game and the soundtrack on sale, and set about 5-6 hours aside for a short, but sweet story.			"

												Transistor is an art-aesthetic game made by the same people behind Bastion, which will give you a good idea of what to expect from the game from a graphical perspective so I won’t waste time on that (except to say that it’s really pretty). As the story goes, you play a rogue vocalist on a quest to find out the meaning behind the mysterious events happening around her. The most important of which involving the accidental death of one of her biggest fans by a sword called the Transistor. You might think the gameplay is somewhat similar to Bastion and if you were to ignore the Turn() aspect, you would probably be right. However, this is where the game distances itself: at any point during combat, you can stop time and plan your next few moves, in a sequence, to be executed when you press the end turn button. This allows for some significant advantages over certain hardy foes that would normally steamroll you in real-time. Additionally, each of the processes you pick up can be slotted in one of three roes: active (for active-weapon use), upgrade (boosts active weapon), or passive (various passive benefits). This allows for a wide variety of process assignments that really lets you find your own personal combat style. If for some reason, you find the game to be too easy, you can add ‘limiters’ you have earned at any save point to spice things up in exchange for extra experience.I found the narrator to be a bit sycophantic, almost to the point where I expected him to wear a fedora and use phrases like “m’lady” while rambling about what it is to be “a gentleman” (especially certain parts of the game where he resembled a drunk version of himself with embarrassingly low levels of restraint). Despite all the cringe, the game is pretty fun and a good challenge if you turn on all the limiters and there are some challenge sections that may warrant a replay if you so desire.			"

												Alright. I played Bastion and I didn't care too much for it, and Transistor honestly just feels like Bastion 2 rather than its own game, but as far as sequels go, Transistor is a pretty good  sequel. It's a game that builds on everything its predecessor established with high polish. The gameplay is fun (moreso than Bastion for me because being able to stop and figure things out in the middle of some clusterf*cks is really all I wanted so that Bastion wasn't so frustrating to me), the art is beautiful (and I love this 2D/isometric pastoral handpainted fantasy that Supergiant has because it ages really well--see Legend of Mana), the music and voice acting are great (of course), the plot is um. Well it's okay. There's a lot of unanswered questions. And I wish it didn't all feel so familiar.I do think the weakest ideas of the game are where it obviously copies right from Bastion. Silent protagonist lead on by a snarky narrator. Little squiggly comma monsters that run around a lot and annoy you. Giant monster that attacks the screen randomly. Skill challenges for bonus powerups. The antagonists never meant for this apocalypse to happen.There's a part of me that wishes that what the game leads you to believe at the start (that you had just murdered someone with your talking sword and were now on the lam) is the thread the game ran with. Still. It's not everything I could hope a game like this to be, but I can't deny that this is a good one and that it kept me going to the end, I even seem to have taken a lot longer than most people, just because I liked chewing the scenery and reading the lore. And I like that there's queer characters too. That's like a bonus, but I try to give devs props for it whenever they do it and it doesn't suck.			"

												A decent game with nice combat system. And... that's pretty much it. Everything else besides combat had a drop since the Bastion. Bastion had some beautiful and different locations, here everything kinda looks the same. Bastion had some nice music, the music in here is kinda forgettable. When it comes to plot... Well, Bastion didn't have much in terms of plot too, but the little it had was at least well presented and left a feeling that there is more story to be told. Here plot is not only scarce, but poorly presented too, it's difficult to follow and impossible to care about.So... My rating would be 6/10. It's still fun to play, combat is very good, it's just game looks like it would have so much more to it and, as it turns out, it doesn'tAlso, be wary: this game is technically illegal in Russia.

												Let me start of by saying that what I write below is from the eyes of a person who has recently finished Transistor. At the beginning I knew this game was going to be good. The narrative pulled me along - and the world never lost it's curious nature. I found myself wanting to know what was next every moment I played. Something unique about transistor personally, for me. I haven't seen many games that pulled me a long the way it had. From an Artists perspective - may I just say this game is gorgeous. It's truly beautiful. I tried to savor every single location because of it. The immense use of color and vibrancy in some areas is literally awe inspiring. The designers and Artists who put their time into this game must have really enjoyed the whole process - because I can't fathom anything of this quality being made without considerable love and devotion to it. Gameplaywise? This game was challenging and fun. The way combat worked was unique to itself - and I enjoyed how much customization your abilities had. It's honestly impressive and fun to sit there figuring out how to build a character. I found myself drawn to a combination of summoning my pet luna and using her in conjunction with other control abilities. But there were so many different ways to go about this. The soundtrack, well.. how else can I put it? I'd have bought this if it were just /music/ it is so wonderful. But the narrative it flows along with can't be put to the side, either. The narrative the game follows gives quite a few on the songs an amazing meaning to the lyrics and themes - I enjoyed listening to each song and seeing how it told things the story hadn't quite covered. The story - my god the story. I'm not the toughest guy in the world, but I sure as hell don't cry over nothing. Without revealing too much, let me tell you the person who made this game's story was a genius. It's so beautiful on so many levels. I pride myself on the ability to take something away from a game's meaning and message - and this is a game that has a beautiful message at it's heart. If I had to say one thing about the ending, I would say it was exactly what I wanted - but not what I had expected whatsoever. You are always on your toes during the whole experience - you never quite see where it's going - and that's the most amazing thing I've ever experienced in a game of 2014. I reccomend this to all of my friends - and pretty much the whole gaming community. This is something you don't want to miss. It's truly something that won't be forgotten. 10/10			"

												Transistor is a rather unique game, coming from the developers of Bastion, Supergiant Games. While some may have been expecting a story and gameplay similar to Bastion, it is fortunate that Supergiant Games did not down that route, and it is important to remember the following: Transistor is not Bastion, and Bastion is not Trasistor. That doesn't mean they don't have a few things that are alike, but they are very different games.Much like Bastion, much of the 'narration' of the game, if in this case it can be called that - is once again voiced by Logan Cunningham, who voiced the narrator of Bastion. Here, though, the voice is much more laid-back and relaxed rather than the rough voice he used before. It works, and helps distinguish his 'character' from being yet another narrator. You'll be hearing him a lot.The gameplay is quite solid, although, much like Bastion, not too difficult, for some not being difficult enough. To remedy that, there are the Limiters - which act much like Bastion's Idols - which make the game harder. The way you fight in Transistor will rely on you using the functions you have available, and the best thing about them is that they can 'upgraded' with other functions to change their effects slightly or fit into a 'passive' slot that passively affects things. For example, the first function you get, Crash(), does 50 damage and very temporarily stuns enemies. In another function's upgrade slot, it will make that other function temporarily stun the enemy. In a passive slot, it will reduce damage by 25% percent. There are 16 different functions in total, and that allows for a lot of different combinations . This allows you to use whatever functions fit your playstyle. For example, there's one that 'masks' you, making you effectively invisible to opponents, and another that temporarily switches their allegiance from opposing you to serving you. All of these functions can be used inside and outside Turn(), which is a fairly important mechanic: it stops time, and allows you to plan your moves, then perform them in a matter of seconds, but has a cooldown that spans several seconds, in which you can move - but can't use any functions. This helps when dealing with large amounts of opponents, or when you want to backstab them and they just won't stop moving. This also leads to situations where using Turn() wouldn't be necessary or very hard, due to the nature of some opponents - sometimes you will have to wait for the right time to use it, or decide whether to use it at all.In terms of music, it fits the game's world, and is very good. Obviously, that's no surprise, this being a Supergiant game after all. But it's the songs that have lyrics that stand out. In Bastion, there were only a few, about two or three. In Transistor, there are five. What's even better here, is that you can 'earn' the music to listen to them in what is basically the closest thing the game has to a hub by completing the game's challenges. Story-wise, the game doesn't give much exposition. Most of the story can be gathered by inferring from what the game shows and tells you through the 'narration', as well as the function files. This is probably where the game falls short for some, as some things are not immediately obvious.			"

												This won't be very in-depth, and will only cover the basic aspects of the game. Click here for my full review.[www.thatvideogameblog.com]Transistor is easily my game of the year, and one of my favourite RPGs of all time. Over time I've looked back at the experience and I've come to the conclusion that, of all the games I've played in the past fifteen years or so, Transistor may just be the best out of all them. I ended up clocking in at around thirteen hours, but that includes the time in which it was alt tabbed to write my review. In created few hours, I played one of the most complete, engaging, immersive and beautiful games ever made. Without a shadow of a doubt, Transistor is a masterpiece.Mechanically, it plays out like an isometric RPG in the vein of Fallout, but with real-time elements and less skills to upgrade. The end result is a very smooth combat experience that still has a heavy emphasis on strategy without ever being overbearing or overcomplicated. Players use the Turn system to pause the game, queue up a series of attacks, and execute them. Once this is done, they will have to wait a short while before pausing the game, forcing them to play in real time, which more often than not means running for cover and re-positioning yourself as your enemies go on the offensive.Transistor makes up for its short length with mechanical depth. Each skill or ""Function"" can be used in one of three ways. First, they can be used as an active skill to defeat enemies in combat. Second, they can be used as upgrades to the aforementioned active skills. Finally, they can be used in a passive slot, with each granting you a unique ability. This system allows for a wide variety of distinct playstyles, which adds immense replayibility and variety to an already hugely enjoyable action roleplaying experience.As the icing on the cake, each Function corresponds to a person in the city of Cloudbank, the setting of the game. Using your skills in a variety of ways unlocks lore titbits that detail the backstory and fates of the world's denizens, allowing you to piece most of the story together yourself. Not only does this encourage players to experiment with as many different loadouts as they can, it also gives players a simple way to slowly uncover the game's lore without feeling as though the narrative is being crammed down their throat. In fact, much of Transistor's narrative is told this way.Much like BioShock, Transistor features a utopian city that has seen much better days, the backstory for which is slowly revealed through dialogue and narration sprinkled throughout the campaign. The story is always subtle and never ham-fisted. Most of the plot is delivered by the Transistor itself - voiced by the brilliant Logan Cunningham - the talking sword you'll be using to cut a swath through the Process, the primary antagonistic force you'll be fighting.Fighting the Process is as hard as you want it be. It never feels like it's being padded out unnecessarily, and offers additional challenge in the form of ""limits"". Limits add rules to the game such as enemies dealing more damage and having to be hit once before collecting their cells which, if not collected, will respawn the enemy. Brilliantly, using these will also reveal additional lore and grant the player extra experience points, which can be used to unlock new skills and upgrades. Losing all of your health doesn't mean dying either. If your HP hits zero, your most expensive skill will become overloaded and unavailable to you until you visit two more access points - the terminals at which the player can change their loadout. This is an elegant solution that keeps the action flowing, whilst still discouraging players from screwing up, and pushing them to try different tactics if what they're currently doing isn't working without constantly taking them out of the experience.All of this, and I haven't even mentioned how beautiful the game looks. It's beautiful. Seriously, it's Jen Zee. You can see the screenshots, you know incredible it looks, and no amount of words will do Zee's work justice. The game sounds just as magnificent as it looks, featuring the talents of Darren Korb and Ashley Barrett, who have created a soundtrack as soothing as it blood-pumping. You see that original soundtrack for sale up there? Buy it.There's not much else I can say about Transistor, except that feels like the most complete and well-polished experience I've ever had the sheer joy of playing. It's a near-perfect and complete work of art, one that easily earns every cent of your money and second of your time.			"

												This was a great game and a work of art. A lot of complaints about price, but its cheaper Dollar/Hour than a movie at the theatre, so i say go for it. Similar and different to Bastion. Has limiters that let you toughen up the game to your liking as well which Hardcore gamers can appreciate.			"

												Playing this game was an absolutely beautiful experience, and here's why:-The concept is original and so well excecuted that it leaves me begging for more, yet I feel completely satisfied.-The battle system is revolutionary. Turn() adds a lot of strategy to something that could very well have been just another normal hack and slash game.-The customization of The Transistor that allowed for every program you get in the game to either be used as an active skill, an upgrade to a skill, or simply a passive skill for your character, leaves infinite possibilites for customization. It is hard to find something like that in a linear game such as this.-The art. Holy ♥♥♥♥, man. I was enthralled when I played Bastion because of the craftsmanship that went into every little detail, but this game was on a whole other level.-THE MUSIC. Bastions music, which was conducted by Darren Korb, was flawless. When I saw the preview for this game at E3 last year and heard ""We All Become"" I knew that Supergiant Games and Darren Korb would not dissapoint me with this title. And guess what: They ♥♥♥♥ing didn't-All the little things. The narration of the Transistor throughout the game, the fact that you can have the protagonist hum along to the soundtrack, etc.-Last but definitely not least: the characters. For a silent protagonist, Red found a way into my heart very fast. The relationship between Red and The Transistor was beautiful. Simple, yet complicated.I am honestly so happy that I played this game. Absolute 10/10.  "

												Alright. I played Bastion and I didn't care too much for it, and Transistor honestly just feels like Bastion 2 rather than its own game, but as far as sequels go, Transistor is a pretty good  sequel. It's a game that builds on everything its predecessor established with high polish. The gameplay is fun (moreso than Bastion for me because being able to stop and figure things out in the middle of some clusterf*cks is really all I wanted so that Bastion wasn't so frustrating to me), the art is beautiful (and I love this 2D/isometric pastoral handpainted fantasy that Supergiant has because it ages really well--see Legend of Mana), the music and voice acting are great (of course), the plot is um. Well it's okay. There's a lot of unanswered questions. And I wish it didn't all feel so familiar.I do think the weakest ideas of the game are where it obviously copies right from Bastion. Silent protagonist lead on by a snarky narrator. Little squiggly comma monsters that run around a lot and annoy you. Giant monster that attacks the screen randomly. Skill challenges for bonus powerups. The antagonists never meant for this apocalypse to happen.There's a part of me that wishes that what the game leads you to believe at the start (that you had just murdered someone with your talking sword and were now on the lam) is the thread the game ran with. Still. It's not everything I could hope a game like this to be, but I can't deny that this is a good one and that it kept me going to the end, I even seem to have taken a lot longer than most people, just because I liked chewing the scenery and reading the lore. And I like that there's queer characters too. That's like a bonus, but I try to give devs props for it whenever they do it and it doesn't suck.			"

												A decent game with nice combat system. And... that's pretty much it. Everything else besides combat had a drop since the Bastion. Bastion had some beautiful and different locations, here everything kinda looks the same. Bastion had some nice music, the music in here is kinda forgettable. When it comes to plot... Well, Bastion didn't have much in terms of plot too, but the little it had was at least well presented and left a feeling that there is more story to be told. Here plot is not only scarce, but poorly presented too, it's difficult to follow and impossible to care about.So... My rating would be 6/10. It's still fun to play, combat is very good, it's just game looks like it would have so much more to it and, as it turns out, it doesn'tAlso, be wary: this game is technically illegal in Russia.

												I loved this game. It had an amazing soundtrack, interesting characters, and beautiful visuals. The beginning of the game can be quite overwhelming, and the combat takes a bit to get the hang of, but as you unlock more options and abilities, the game really opens up. My only negative is that the game took too long to give the player all the combat upgrades, and you don't really unlock everything until NG+. But the game gives you lots of time to take in the environment, learn and master the combat, and really learn about all the characters. Transistor doesn't completely match up to Bastion, but it's definitely worth playing!			"

												The art intrigued me into clicking on the trailer... and my heart was lost. From the first beats of the music, to the soothing voice of the narrator... when the second trailer followed, with Her singing, and I was won over. Bought the game in a heartbeat, and I believe even if it wasn't on sale, I would have done the same.It took me 12.5 hours to complete. Truth be told, I'm not good at games. Perhaps a pro would have completed it faster. But I loved lingering around, listening to Red hum... and exploring every nook and cranny just to listen to more of His voice. The game lets you set the pace, with no shortage of save points, and no awful penalties when you can't keep up with the battle mechanics. I followed no guide, and pannicked when I first lost a function - but still I went on, progressing. Sure, the enemies and their upgrades are hard - but after a few rounds of losing, you'd get the hang of it. And hey, hearing His concerned voice in the background makes it well worth the hits.Love everything about the game. 10/10 would play again.			"

												The atmosphere, as you might expect from the trailers, is incredible. What you won't understand from the footage is just how finely woven the storytelling is for a game whose main character has had her voice removed in the story. It starts in medias res (in the middle of the action), and unfolds plot points through beautifully illustrated flashbacks, the transistor's dialogue, and even the game mechanics themselves. Your skills are traces of people, and as you use these skills in more varied ways you unlock more information about the person the trace is from, the world they lived in and the cabal of characters they came in contact with. Combat is clever and surprisingly fast paced for the sort that lets you jump into a paused planning mode. Take advantage of the Sandbox planning areas, Red's humming mechanic and unlocking all the information in traces and limiters. Though your character can't speak, her personality is revealed through the transistor, her input into computer terminals, her actions or lack of during cutscenes, and the soundtrack that you will absolutely not regret buying. The story is deep enough to make sense and propel you forward while still leaving you wide open to theory crafting at the end. My only complaint is that I don't want to leave the game and the <10 hours of gameplay, while bittersweetly satisfying, will not be enough to appease you once you've fallen head over heels in love with this world.

												My name is Red. I have a sword but it's not a sword, it's a transistor. Don't worry about it, it still kills people. Well, processes mainly, but it killed that guy I liked. I think I liked him? Anyway, it wasn't the swords fault. Some people really disliked my singing and decided to stab the guy I was crushing on, leaving the transistor/sword imbedded in him. The transistor/sword talks to me. It's the spirit of the dead guy. He rambles on about something that I don't understand and he talks over news articles I'm trying to read. Then he forgets what he's trying to say and in the process becomes even more annoying as he tries to make sense of his own existence.  On my quest to avenge the guy I barely know I meet a few other people but I can't understand a word they say. No, wait, subtitles give them a voice. I still don't understand why they hate me but I kill them all regardless. I read all about them in my notes but whoever wrote these bios seemed to leave out some rather important bits, like why I care. Still, the pictures are pretty and after I kill them they mingle with my dead boyfriend(?) on the other side. At least they don't talk to me when their dead.And so I drag my very heavy transistor/sword through the sectors annihilating everything in my path stopping occassionally to admire the beauty of the fading world and for a bite of sea monster pizza from Junction Jan's only to recurse and do it again, expect this time... no, I still don't know what's going on...

												One of the best games i've ever played.It's a short game, you can complete in about 5/6 hours, where you fight sets of enemies (called ""Process"") as you progress through the story.You fight the enemies with your abilities, that the game calls Functions. The interesting thing about it is that even though you have a set of abilities, the same ability can be used in different ways: as an active ability, as an upgrade to another ability or as a passive ability. The game tells you what each ability do in each of those 3 roles. This leads to an endless number of possible ways you can combine your abilities. Not only that but it does it in a very good way, since there's not exactly an obvious choice of ""loadout"" and multiple alternatives are viable and effective to fight against the enemies. It really leaves space for you to use the abilities the way you fell more comfortable with. In the beginning it might be hard to figure out which abilities to use and how you will use them, the amount of choices you have is a little bit overwhelming, but as you play you will learn the weaknesses and strengths of each one until it's really no longer a problem. The game helps you with that, you are given only a few abilities to use at the start and you unlock new ones little by little.The combat itself is very innovative. You can use your abilities just pressing its button, just like in an mmo or Diablo. But more often than not, you will be using the Turn() mode. In this mode the game is paused and you can plan your movements and the attacks you will do, then execute the plan. The game has no difficulty selection, but you can customize how hard the game can be by using the Limiters, some of them buff your enemies while others nerf the player in general. By choosing Limiters, the combat will be harder but you will receive more experience and level up faster as a result.This makes up the core mechanics of the game, which i greatly enjoyed.But an excellent mechanic is not only what this game has to offer.The visuals and the art style is incredible, i would dare to say it is the most beautiful isometric game i've ever saw. Really really good. The soundtrack is also very good, not only it is good on a musical standpoint as it also fits the game perfectly and contributes greatly for a better immersion.I would highly recommend this game to anyone, if you are still not sure, wait for a sale, otherwise buy it full price. And you may also want to grab the soundtrack. You will want it after playing the game. "

												It's hard to review a game with such little flaws. The story is a masterpiece, could easily be extrapolated to become a critic of our society, the soundtrack, jesus ♥♥♥♥ing christ the soundtrack, if you played you know there aren't words to describe it. The graphics are ridiculously beautiful, scenarios are quite detailed, enemies not much but that's to be expected, won't say why since it would be a spoiler.Okay, so, to sum it up pretty poorly, the game is about a utopian city where the people who live there can shape it however they wish, until something goes wrong. You are in charge of finding out what went wrong and why. At first i thought it would be something like, ""yeah well theres the supervillain who wanted the power all to himself"" or something along those lines, as it usually is. I was wrong. Oh boy, i was.Without further ado, let's get to numbers and proper review of the game's aspects.Pros:+ Brilliant backstory+ Amazing soundtrack+ Gameplay mechanics mixes a lot of many games together, making it unique+ Very well designed, looks almost like a piece of art coming to life+ Has good replay value, since it has a ""new game+"" like feature+ You can customize your abilities to match your playstyle+ You can customize the difficulty setting of the game by messing exactly with which part you want easier/harder+ Very interesting way to develop character backgroundsCons:- Rather short game, you can finish the main story in about 5 hours- Even if you can choose the abilities, some of them are overpowered, making them almost mandatory- Battles become a chore after certain abilities are unlocked- Price is a little high for a game so shortWith about 26 hours into it, i have unlocked everything there was to unlock and got all achievements the game had. Even though the price is not ideal, it's still worth the extra effort, and if you can buy it on a good sale, the price problem is gone.Final score: 8.6/10. If you're a fan of games with more thought provoking storylines, or like new/unexplored combat systems, this game is for you.			"

												Highly recommended. Transistor has an amazing audio-visual style and a strong emotional story. The gameplay is fused into its sci-fi world, and everything about it is blended with jargon from informatics, computers, programming, technology etc. The combat system is evolved, engaging and suprisingly deep and diverse.The Good(1) Art-style is awesome. (2) Music is fantastic, original and merged with the story. Red, the protagonist, is a singer who has lost her voice, and for that reason there's a dedicated ""Hum"" button, where the game pauses and Red hums to background music! (3) Combat system is a very interesting and well balanced blend of real-time with pause-and-give-orders: You can fight in real time (which is hard!) or you can use the ""Turn()"" command to give orders which are then executed sequentially by Red while her enemies are slowed down (nearly stopped). After that, Turn() requires several seconds to recover before you can use it again; it the meanwhile you can't use any abilities and just need to run around in real-time avoiding enemies.The Bad(1) The story can be confusing. Despite the very few characters, it's often hard to understand why Red, the protagonist, does what she does. It took me two playthroughs and reading a thorough guide, to understand what was going on. Nevertheless, you can ""breeze"" through the game just for the feeling without losing much, but understanding the story adds to the emotional experience. (2) The sci-fi jargon --informatics, computers, programming, technology-- can also be confusing. I have some skill in the department and it wasn't all that easy for me either. The GUI is good at explaining things, but you gotta spend some time to check things out. (3) The game is not good at revealing the depth of its combat system. Also, with the main story being relatively short, you can reach the ending and beat the game without needing to grasp the mechanics. My second playthrough (NG+) was much more entertaining, as was doing all the optional ""Tests"" offered.*** Comparison to Bastion: I liked Bastion's narrator better, as well as the delivery of the story, which was way simpler. Also, I believe that Bastion was better at hooking you up into its gameplay. Transistor has much better combat system, but it's not so good at hooking you up. Transistor's visuals, music and ""world"" are much more interesting.*** I played this for more than 20hrs, completed the story twice (first play-through and NewGame+) and got almost all the achievements.

There you could play free games. Some of them were too artistic to be called of a certain genre really.

												Short Version:Does this game generally objectively fulfill perceived goals: Yes.Should you buy this game: Yes.How does it chalk up to Bastion?: They have similarities, but Transistor stands on its own. In some ways, it is superior and more mature than Bastion, while in other ways, Bastion has an edge in storytelling.Long Version:Transistor is beautiful. Transistor is inspired by Bastion in many ways, and that's abundantly clear from the get-go. From the similar ever-present voice of Logan Cunningham, to the angled top-down approach, Supergiant is definitely playing to their strengths.Transistor, visually, has a great feel. Pre-rendered maps have stunning detail and effort. While Bastion in places had a pieced together, stylized look in the Calamity-stricken ruins of Caelondia, the city of Cloudbank is fully fleshed, and takes on strange and interesting changes as the enemies of the game - ""The Process"" - make their mark on the city.Transistor is linear. That's okay. Linear is not always bad, though your adventure feels more or less on rails throughout the entire game. Some may consider this a flaw. People coming from Bastion, however, probably are not expecting much here. It is, however, worth noting that Transistor does -not- have different endings.Transistor's soundtrack is breathtaking - the music alone easily justifies half the cost of the game. The music played in various scenarios takes on different variations depending on circumstances, and the world becomes muted and quiet while the haunting voice of the protagonist - Red - takes center stage during the Turn(). Musically inclined peoples want this soundtrack, if not the game too.Transistor is short. People generally expect to get more hours from a video game than they can realistically play in a day without a binge session. If it were full price, that might be a problem. Fortunately, the nice low price of 20$ means that a 6-8 hour playthrough (assuming you do not rush through content) will strike a sweet spot. The game values your time and effort, and nothing in the game feels like ""busy work"", nor does anything feel like filler. The game, contrary to what some claim, feels like pure substance.Transistor is a bargain - the game is effortlessly worth more than it costs.Transistor's combat is varying shades of complex. In time, you will find that some abilities may feel somewhat superfluous and certain abilities like Void() become more or less necessities in gameplay with highest difficulty settings enabled - ""limiters"" in game. The game does an admirable job of respecting the intellect of its player - there are very few tutorials or listed instructions in actual gameplay, and you are encouraged and rewarded with bits of story and background when you experiment with the various ""Functions"" that are made available to you throughout.Transistor leaves a lot to interpretation. If you prefer a story where everything neatly ties up in the end, and you are left satisfied and ready to move on to the next big thing in your day, Transistor will leave you unsettled. The game offers a peak into a dire moment in Cloudbank's story, and as you play a mystery unfolds that descends into chaotic circumstances that few could possibly predict. Because the game is short, there is ultimately only so much that can be done to lend clarity to some of the events of the story, and you will likely be left with questions that will leave you scratching your head for days to come.That's not to say the game is pointless, absurd, or nonsensical. It is simply the sort of game that seems more or less designed to haunt you, be that good or bad.The game, despite it's great strengths also suffers from limitations of the developers. Transistor's probably largest flaw is that the story is TOLD to you, and not SHOWN as well as some may like. Earned story tidbits more or less being fed in the form of static images and a few paragraphs of vague background information begin to feel like a substitute or a placeholder where something better could have been implemented - brief cutscenes or playable intermissions where we can watch events unfold in other places. It feels like a missed opportunity to elevate the methods used to tell the story. Why it's done this way, I can only guess - this is the first title that Supergiant Games has self-published, and only their second game. They're a very small name in gaming for now, and that means that a lot of the things we may expect and take for granted in other games are not options to them.All that said, I can wrap it up. It's a gorgeous, fun, interesting and expressive game that is presented at a price so low that you really can't lose. It's flaws are minor enough that it becomes easy to forget about them and simply bask in the enjoyable combat mechanics and the sultry tones of the sword in your hands as you explore the computer-like city of Cloudbank.

												Transistor is a game that drives my heart into the world of cyberpunk and dystopian science fiction. It’s not just about gorgeous presentation and addictive combat, but I also realize the fault of human creation.The more you advance in Transistor, the more you understand how the truth of the Cloudbank. Most of the time, Transistor is your main weapon and storyteller. Transistor also gives you strong narrative, telling what is going on, and comments on your interaction even each terminal is worthwhile to read.As you fight against The Process, the main feature is shined out. Transistor’s combat can split into real-time approach and turn-based approach which give you planning phase to set your position, target, and set of skills. The variety of skill as you progress through the game make Transistor has unique combat and gives player’s choice to try out their own skill build. Even the limiter feature which works like player debuff, and test rooms offer challenge and thinking rather than spamming for win. However, it can be frustrated for cool down after turn mode is used as you may have to run around in small area while some enemies can constantly harm you. It is just minor issue which you can get over with once you get your perfect build.Transistor is such a unique and great experience. Not just engaging combat, but I fell in love in polished art design, story, and memorable soundtracks which create what people like in the game. And I’m pretty sure you will enjoy much as I do once you get deeper into The Cloudbank. "

												Following up Bastion would be a hard act for anybody, so it can be a forgiven a bit that Transistor is what I'd call Supergiant Games' sophomore slump. It's a game that leans a little too heavily on the familiar, yet seems a bit unsure of how it wants to present itself as a separate new entity. You've got your talking Transistor which functions as the game's narrator, you've got Jen Zee's unmistakably fantastic art direction, and you've got Darren Korb's trancey-blues fusion soundtrack, and all those elements come together fairly well for the most part. Transistor is a gem to behold and contains nothing but fantastic audio candy for days and days. Unfortunately the gameplay and story lack the shine and polish Bastion had. The combat is a good mixture of real-time and turn-based combat, allowing you to use skills at the press of a button or queue them up to unleash with certain timing. Customizability is a huge factor since every skill in the game can be active, support, or passive, and the combinations are almost endless. That said, with all the strategy a system like this could bring, it's fairly easy to bulldoze through almost all enemy encounters with a few of the skills you start with, and even easier once you start playing around with combinations. While discovering these ridiculous combinations is fun and rewarding though, it throws every bit of strategy the game promises and throws it out the window fairly early, and by the end of the game battles become tedious. Transistor's storytelling takes a different approach to Basion's. You're immediately thrown into Transistor's world without much of an idea of what's going on and you're railroaded through the adventure at a Final Fantasy XIII, purely linear breakneck pace. The story does have a decent resolution, but the world, characters, and motivations of Transistor's cast are either too vague or hard to grasp. Everybody talks as if the player knows what's going on and there's not much expository dialog to help clear much up. Each skill you obtain has a character profile associated with it, but these provide mostly flavor text and there are some questions that are simply left unanswered and a plotline or two that get completely lost in the shuffle. Transistor is in no way bad, but it's easy to feel disappointed with it. The breakneck pace with which it presents itself and the abrupt ending make it feel almost rushed in some ways, even with as gorgeous as it is on the whole. If you're undecided on it right now, I'd say wait for a sale.			"

												Do you like a game with breathaking graphics that can abosorb you into its world?Do you like to see a great story, told in a great way? Do you wanna be part of that story?Do you like and appreciate good music?Do you like interesting gameplay?Do you like learning more and more for the world you play in, by doing things?The game is exactly what I personally cherish as an experience.It's like watching a huge artistic painting, listening to a great music album, reading a great sci-fi book and playing a video game at the same time.Lots of years ago, before Steam, there was Kongregate. There you could play free games. Some of them were too artistic to be called of a certain genre really. Thus users silently made a special tag, a genre named ""Art"".Supergiant Games make pieces of art, not just games.A game that made me cry deserves all the credit for it.I didn't beat the game, this game beated me.

												Transistor, aesthetic wise, think Blade Runner meets Cowboy BeBop.  But that really isn't a fair description at all.   First of all I want to say I am not a big RTS fan at all.  So I was very much on the fence about Transistor.  I got it in the Winter Sale of 2014 and just got around to playing it and boy was it a treat.  Gameplay aside this game is ART.  The visuals are stunning and the soundtrack is stellar as we have come to expect with composer Darren Korb of the previous SuperGiant game Bastion acclaim.  Ashely Barrett (also from Bastion fame) has some outstanding vocals as well.  I am not going to compare this game to Bastion they are both good in thier own right.  I enjoyed the Real time/Planning kind of gameplay Transistor brought to the table.  Really unique.  It's a great game albeit short.  I didn't do any extras or training missions and the story took me about 4 hours.  The story (to me) was kinda ambigous and convoluted, but I think that was the point to get people discussing theories and what they interpreted it as.  All in all it's a great game, pick it up if you want to see some gorgeous visuals, hear some great music, and have a unique experience only SuperGiant can deliver :)			"

												Short Version:Does this game generally objectively fulfill perceived goals: Yes.Should you buy this game: Yes.How does it chalk up to Bastion?: They have similarities, but Transistor stands on its own. In some ways, it is superior and more mature than Bastion, while in other ways, Bastion has an edge in storytelling.Long Version:Transistor is beautiful. Transistor is inspired by Bastion in many ways, and that's abundantly clear from the get-go. From the similar ever-present voice of Logan Cunningham, to the angled top-down approach, Supergiant is definitely playing to their strengths.Transistor, visually, has a great feel. Pre-rendered maps have stunning detail and effort. While Bastion in places had a pieced together, stylized look in the Calamity-stricken ruins of Caelondia, the city of Cloudbank is fully fleshed, and takes on strange and interesting changes as the enemies of the game - ""The Process"" - make their mark on the city.Transistor is linear. That's okay. Linear is not always bad, though your adventure feels more or less on rails throughout the entire game. Some may consider this a flaw. People coming from Bastion, however, probably are not expecting much here. It is, however, worth noting that Transistor does -not- have different endings.Transistor's soundtrack is breathtaking - the music alone easily justifies half the cost of the game. The music played in various scenarios takes on different variations depending on circumstances, and the world becomes muted and quiet while the haunting voice of the protagonist - Red - takes center stage during the Turn(). Musically inclined peoples want this soundtrack, if not the game too.Transistor is short. People generally expect to get more hours from a video game than they can realistically play in a day without a binge session. If it were full price, that might be a problem. Fortunately, the nice low price of 20$ means that a 6-8 hour playthrough (assuming you do not rush through content) will strike a sweet spot. The game values your time and effort, and nothing in the game feels like ""busy work"", nor does anything feel like filler. The game, contrary to what some claim, feels like pure substance.Transistor is a bargain - the game is effortlessly worth more than it costs.Transistor's combat is varying shades of complex. In time, you will find that some abilities may feel somewhat superfluous and certain abilities like Void() become more or less necessities in gameplay with highest difficulty settings enabled - ""limiters"" in game. The game does an admirable job of respecting the intellect of its player - there are very few tutorials or listed instructions in actual gameplay, and you are encouraged and rewarded with bits of story and background when you experiment with the various ""Functions"" that are made available to you throughout.Transistor leaves a lot to interpretation. If you prefer a story where everything neatly ties up in the end, and you are left satisfied and ready to move on to the next big thing in your day, Transistor will leave you unsettled. The game offers a peak into a dire moment in Cloudbank's story, and as you play a mystery unfolds that descends into chaotic circumstances that few could possibly predict. Because the game is short, there is ultimately only so much that can be done to lend clarity to some of the events of the story, and you will likely be left with questions that will leave you scratching your head for days to come.That's not to say the game is pointless, absurd, or nonsensical. It is simply the sort of game that seems more or less designed to haunt you, be that good or bad.The game, despite it's great strengths also suffers from limitations of the developers. Transistor's probably largest flaw is that the story is TOLD to you, and not SHOWN as well as some may like. Earned story tidbits more or less being fed in the form of static images and a few paragraphs of vague background information begin to feel like a substitute or a placeholder where something better could have been implemented - brief cutscenes or playable intermissions where we can watch events unfold in other places. It feels like a missed opportunity to elevate the methods used to tell the story. Why it's done this way, I can only guess - this is the first title that Supergiant Games has self-published, and only their second game. They're a very small name in gaming for now, and that means that a lot of the things we may expect and take for granted in other games are not options to them.All that said, I can wrap it up. It's a gorgeous, fun, interesting and expressive game that is presented at a price so low that you really can't lose. It's flaws are minor enough that it becomes easy to forget about them and simply bask in the enjoyable combat mechanics and the sultry tones of the sword in your hands as you explore the computer-like city of Cloudbank.

												Sometimes, after playing a lot of competitive multiplayer games, you just have to step back and enjoy something much more authentic like Transistor. This game allowed me to really appreciate a story based single-player game as I was drowned in a breathtaking world with its own unique atmosphere and gameplay.During my first few minutes in to the game, I instantly recognized the amount of work Super Giant Games put into Transistor's presentation. The visual aspect of the game consists of beautiful hand drawn art, a vibrant colour scheme, smooth animation, and excellent character design. The auditory aspect is also just as outstanding as the visuals; the soundtracks consists of a mix of haunting guitar rifts and electronic music which captures the mood of the empty and haunting city of Cloudbank, and the voices and sound effects are also on par with this.The gameplay is also unique and makes the game more strategic compared to Super Giant's previous game, Bastion. The turn system allows you to plan your attacks, but there's also a mix of mechanical play with this, such as having to decide the best times to switch to turn mode or real time. I also really enjoyed how the functions worked (which are the skills), as there are thousands of possible combinations as you can use, since you can either use the function as an active, a passive, or you can stack the function on another function to add a unique property. I also liked how they added limiters in the game to make the game much more challenging in a unique way that rewards the player.			"

												Absolutely loved this game.While you simply cannot beat Bastion's soundtrack or narrator, Transistor's soundtrack does not disappoint, and the Hum feature is really cool. I enjoyed the world and storyline, though both can be confusing at times.The battle/customization system is awesome, based on Functions used in Active, Upgrade, or Passive slots, in addition to the given Turn() Function which allows you to pause battle and plan out your next few moves. Trying out different combinations is encouraged through optional tests the player can complete for experience at various points throughout the game, as well as receiving information on a Function's associated character as you use it in different slots, but the game allows you to use your tried-and-true combos enough that you don't feel you're constantly having to switch things around (though I found it fun to). Once you beat the game, you have the option to start Recursive Play, where you keep your User Level and all Functions/Upgrades and start the game anew, earning the same Functions as before allowing their use in more than one slot. I enjoyed this second playthrough, though I really wish that you could continue the original story instead of restarting. COMPLETELY, 100% worth the money if you pick it up on sale, and I highly recommend you do.			"

												So I just 100% completed this game, might as well get on a high horse of opionon and run my motuh off,Firstly, to save you the time, get it. I'd say don't get it for a narrative experience, the one it provides is good, whole and satisfying but by no means is it what I enjoyed most about the game. Players of Bastion may be slightly miffed to hear this as it was certainly the focus of Bastion, tha amalgumation of music, voice acting, art and narrative gave an almost cinematic experience in Bastion that left a lasting impression, and while all of those traits are bought into Transistor and done well, the ambiguity in the story is left for the player to explore, as a reult I found it less satisfying until you uncover as much as you need to in order to really understand the charecetes and events.What I really enjoyed in Transistor was its gameplay, it simply gets better as the game goes on, and its for this reason I see it as a must to at least try recursion, which allows you to unlock all the skills again, making some incredibly powerfull and therfore enjoyable combinations. The game provides the right amount of challenge to force you to explore its brilliant match up system. No combos are bad and any startegy is worth a go. Special mention to the music and vocal work, while the narrative may not be all that impactful theres certainly a strong sense of immersion created through the music and art. Not bad considering they were all recorded in a closet.I don't know why I wrote a review this long. Can I go back to Uni yet?			"

												If you prefer quality over quantity this game is for you. Transistor is a fantastic game with amazing soundtracks that you hear throughout the game. The gameplay itself is quite unique but the best way I could describe it is if you had Dragon Age:Origin's ability to stop time and every move or attack you plan,sucked up this time bar that let you stay in that frozen time and after you unleash your barrage of attacks it would just charge back up read for you to use again. This is pretty crucial to most combat in the game so you'll tend to spam it as soon as it comes off cooldown. The story when you first start is pretty confusing and I pretty much had no idea what was going on until I was done with a 1/3 of the game and the game isn't really straightforward with the storytelling so you pretty much have to go through with the tidbits that are given to you at the beginning and just complete the puzzle by either completing files or going through OVC terminals or just listening to what the characters say during their dialogues. The customization allows you to format abilities you can use during a battle, augment those abilities onto another ability that enhances it in some way, or you can decide to augment it onto your body. You can pretty much switch however way you want it anytime during the game provided you get to a terminal which is pretty common throughout the whole game. I was actually impressed with how the game looked overall and it pretty much looked like a work of art, not counting the gameplay aspects or the phenomenal soundtracks. The replayability is pretty much the same as Bastion and it lets you restart over and is called Recursion, keeping your abilitites and level so you can go through the whole game fighting the same late game enemies you would be fighting at the end of the game. Transistor is short, you could probably finish the whole game in around 10 hours but sweet jesus it's 10 really good hours without even touching the Recursion aspect. Transistor is GOTY material, buy it, try it, cry at how short it is.			"

												Supergiant Games' second release is once again defined by its narrative and Logan Cunningham's sexy, sexy voice. Much like Bastion, there's a theme (sort of) of the world broken, and once again you have the key to piecing things back together. Gameplay provides a very well-done array of ways to approach the enemies, and encourages heavy experimentation until you find something you play well with and like.World design, from art to sound, is once again the shining star in the game. Every detail is gorgeously hand-drawn, every piece of music milking that beautiful neo-noir style for all it's worth. Logan Cunningham's voice work is more expressive and drawing this time around, though every bit as ♥♥♥♥♥♥ic as before.All in all, a truly wondrous game to behold, one of the very few games released these days which truly have a vision behind them. Its only flaw is that there isn't enough of it to last, but still much preferable to a narrative that drags on.

												If you prefer quality over quantity this game is for you. Transistor is a fantastic game with amazing soundtracks that you hear throughout the game. The gameplay itself is quite unique but the best way I could describe it is if you had Dragon Age:Origin's ability to stop time and every move or attack you plan,sucked up this time bar that let you stay in that frozen time and after you unleash your barrage of attacks it would just charge back up read for you to use again. This is pretty crucial to most combat in the game so you'll tend to spam it as soon as it comes off cooldown. The story when you first start is pretty confusing and I pretty much had no idea what was going on until I was done with a 1/3 of the game and the game isn't really straightforward with the storytelling so you pretty much have to go through with the tidbits that are given to you at the beginning and just complete the puzzle by either completing files or going through OVC terminals or just listening to what the characters say during their dialogues. The customization allows you to format abilities you can use during a battle, augment those abilities onto another ability that enhances it in some way, or you can decide to augment it onto your body. You can pretty much switch however way you want it anytime during the game provided you get to a terminal which is pretty common throughout the whole game. I was actually impressed with how the game looked overall and it pretty much looked like a work of art, not counting the gameplay aspects or the phenomenal soundtracks. The replayability is pretty much the same as Bastion and it lets you restart over and is called Recursion, keeping your abilitites and level so you can go through the whole game fighting the same late game enemies you would be fighting at the end of the game. Transistor is short, you could probably finish the whole game in around 10 hours but sweet jesus it's 10 really good hours without even touching the Recursion aspect. Transistor is GOTY material, buy it, try it, cry at how short it is.			"

												Transistor is an iteration of the great top-down 2d action RPG game Bastion. Once again Supergiant Games delivers a perfectly themed fantasy world (sci-fi this time), with beautiful handdrawn graphics, and a superb soundtrack from Darren korb. Once again the story just starts from scratch, and is told to you bit by bit as you progress through the game. The story has the same metaphorical vagueness about it, that lets your imagination play it's part, and make it feel more personal and relevant.At first glance it would seem that this game would be a no-brainer to recommend for anyone who liked Bastion, but there's quite a big game changer in Transistor: Turn based combat. Yup, you have the ability to stop time and plan your moves, and then ""release"" time again and watch your actions unfold. This comes at the penalty of not being able to use your weapons (functions) for some seconds afterwards. That is unless you've applied a certain upgrade to a function, then you can always use that particular weapon. But you only gain this upgrade later in the game, and you'll only have 1 instance of it, unless you're on your second playthrough.Personally, I felt the turn based element just increased the tactical depth of the combat, so I see it as an improvement, but I can see how it might put some people off. You could of course choose to use it as little as possible, but I reckon you'd be severely handicapped, and some parts would be impossible (speed tests e.g.).The only mentionable complaint I have is that there is no ""Retry with same loadout"" option during the tests. It's pretty annoying having to reconfigure all the slots from scratch every time.The game is pretty short (6-7 hours including all the tests I reckon), but if you like the game as much as I did, you wanna recurse() the story as soon as you've completed it, and get all the achievements, which btw are relevant and very achieveable :)90%			"

Beautiful art and music, coupled with an entertaining combat system with huge amounts of options towards attacking, debuffing, summoning canines to bark at enemies are making it an even better experience.

												Well, I just finished my Recursion and can now finally review the game.The fights are basically played in an arena - a closed area on the map - and require a lot of thought in skill preparation and use as well as character placement.Their are two ways to wage a fight. Either you go the classic active way (like any action game), or you can use the Turn() function which allows you to stop time and plan your attacks at leisure.While in Turn(), everyone freezes and a bar appears at the top of the screen, this bar represent the total of actions you can take (for those who know of it, imagine Legend of Legaia's system). Moving and attacking eats a part of the bar depending of the skill and isn't done right away, instead you plan all hte attack which will be carried out when you finish the Turn(). The actions are then done at lightning speed, often taking a number of enemies to the grave at once with good planning.About the skills :You will equip skills (which you acquire by leveling and by finding people) at savepoint, in up to 4 active slots.Every skill is totally different from another both visually and practically. One can debuff a group of enemies in an area while the other will make you invisible for a while.Then you can equip those skills as passives for the active skills or for yourself. A skill that makes you drop explosives packets on the ground as active will increase the damage and blast radius of another as passive. Character passives can increase your total HP, reduce damage taken, reduce cost of abilities during Turn()...The game isn't too short, but not really long. It took me 7 hours to complete my first run and 9 hours to Recurse through the story. Recursion is basically New Game+ wherre you keep everything and replay the story while the enemies are end-game level and randomized through the areas.The scenario can seem confused, but is very enjoyable with many things to learn.Apart from the Sandbox - which give acces to a practice area and a number of tests as well as some miscellaneous stuff, a big one being the jukebox - there is no side content.The art is sublime and serves very well the game. The music nicely compliments the action and events throughout the game and is a jewel to listen to. I give a solid 9.5/10 for this well crafted game. Really enjoyed it.			"

												I was expecting a lot of this game, given that I loved Bastion and the reviews are extremely good, but I didn't manage to like it, even if I tried.The storytelling is sketchy, bland, disconnected. It manages to create an atmosphere, but not a solid story. The gameplay is interesting, the combat system is amazing, but has serious downsides: It messes up your build as a punishment for screwing up, and it depends too much on the ""turn programmer"". Challenges available were also pretty weak, and everything was way too lineal.Anyway, it's a great and enjoyable game, but small flaws can make it pretty disappointing.			"

												Before we begin, let us establish something that should be obvious from the game's title, but apparently isn't to some players: THIS IS NOT BASTION 2Playing it like it was Bastion 2 can only lead to frustration and disaappointment. To appreciate Transistor, you must approach it respectfully, on its own terms, and not guided by your own expectations, as, really, you should be doing with every game worth talking about.While it uses some of the same innovative mechanisms that were introduced in Bastion, it is not, nor does it try to be, more of the same - something I admire with Supergiant's production that, apparently, some players of the game find frustration with. They could've easily printed money by making a Bastion 2, but chose to make something original instead. How can you not admire such a departure from the unscrupulous money grab that is sadly becoming the norm in this hobby?I've likely already gifted you this game if we're on reasonably friendly terms. But for everyone else, allow me to say that, speaking as an experienced gamer, this is my favourite game. It is, in a word, perfection, and those of you who know how critical I can be of these things should know I do not say that lightly. Perfectly harmonized design, art direction, music, writing, everything. The team at Supergiant, earning themselves a place as my personal favourite developers, and in any case an honoured spot on the true A-list, have here created another superbly crafted game that I warmly encourage everyone to try and experience.

												A couple of things - one - Puzzlefox's excellent thumbs down review adequately summarizes many of my complaints about the game, lack of variety, almost non-existent story, a tedious rather than rewarding challenge area, and simplistic enemies.  So there is that - having loved bastion to tag this game with any of those things (which it excelled at) is really disheartening. However aside from those issues I had some of my own (ignore my logged playtime, I got in about 3-4ish hours off the books.I still haven't finished this game. I may come back and change my review if I can ever stand to drudge my way through it. Until such a time - here are the reasons why despite loving bastion and SuperGiant; I consider this game a misfire and would only recommend it to people when it's on sale or if they simply want to support the studio without buying multiple copies of bastion. Combat.I really like turn-based games. I am enjoying my third playthrough of Invisible Inc at the time of writing this review, I also actually mucked around with the challenge modes and New Game + in Bastion, so I can get into some hack n slash. What I can't get into, no matter how hard I try, is violently switching between those two formats over and over in a fight. Or more accurately, I can't get into doing a ""turn"" and then running around or hiding for a few seconds while it recharges. It breaks my immersion, feels tedious, and honestly makes every fight in the game a chore. I know some people are really into this; and it clicks for them. I am deeply envious of those people because if the game had full turn-based I am positive I would have at least had the stomach to make it to the end.Story/NarrationI am combining these two, because I have yet to make it to the second boss (I am assuming there are three) in any playthrough and the second nail in the coffin is the narration. I love Logan as a voice actor, he essentially sold Bastion for me, and I'm not saying he needs to display a huge range in the early game. However - dribbling the story out slowly is simply less effective for me when he sounds so utterly emotionless and bored while delivering every single line. His dry quips never land, and honestly it's like they woke him up after trapping him in a sound booth and made sure he only recorded lines while still wiping the sleep from his eyes. Again - this might change in Act 3 or something - but if you bore me in the beginning I may never make it that far.Style.Initially I was really loving the art design. I still love the menus, music, and overall style. However one thing I lamented is that as I move from one section of the city to the next, I can barely tell any real difference. Part of what worked in Bastion was that each area felt distinct. With this game each area might have some slight variation, but the overwhelming same-ness of it all started to really wear on me. It didn't help that the random white blocks that popped up detracted from any sense of geography or style. In Bastion it was shop-carts, barrels, and plants. In this game it's just white blocks. White blocks. White Blocks. I'm not sure what they were going for here but it definitely contributed to my overall boredom.So inevitably it comes to this. If I had to rate it on a scale, I'd give it a 5/10. A well-polished game from a really good developer that simply misses several of the targets I really needed it to hit. However I don't get a scale, I just get a recommend or not. I don't recommend it, certainly not for $20. No one is sadder than me that I feel this way, and I sincerely hope their next game wins me back over. "

												This game is an Art Project... Not a game. It plays horrible, combat is repetative and favors spamming. I could forgive the combat if the story was interesting but I honestly could not give a damn about any of the ""Characters"" or the overall story. Your Sword says pretty much little to nothing of interest, and it's hard to believe there was any sort of relationship between the protagonist and this man who's spirit is now trapped within this sword, if there was a relationsip it must have been a pretty boring shallow one. Overall I was just bored, the visuals are great but not enough to carry a crappy story and repetative gameplay.			"

												The player starts in the middle of action without any hint of what is going on. Soon, he will put put pieces together revealing the past events and the main plot. The story is great  and the amazing voice acting really contribute for the storytelling. Also, the art creates a beautiful futuristic immersive city.  The combat machanics are very addicting combining elements of strategy/rpg and real time action. The game offers a lot of ways to aproach battle and it's a lot of fun testing the different combinations of skills and planning every move. And the music - oh! The music! - The soundtrack perfectly blends with the mood, the plot and the gameplay and the songs are responsible for the greatest moments of the game (What a voice!).It could have a bit more of exploration, but this doesn't interfere with the experience.Great game, I recommend.

Honestly if you are looking at some pure story driven games this is the one that you should look at first. Beautiful artstyle, music is just out of this world and a very satisfying ending. The game is about 5-6 hours which is on the short side nevertheless the game is extremely good with fun combat, plenty of different skill combinations to use and a few achievements if you feel adventurous afterwards.

												Transistor.I honestly can't tell which one, Bastion or Transistor were more to my liking. Both have their awesome unique mechanics and stunning music.When you start the game, you don't have a main menu, instead you are put right into the game. This really took my by surprise. I think you'll understand what I mean once you launch the game.So, lets get on with it.The Plot: 10/10Just like in Bastion, you are thrown right into the game without any introduction. Just a gal with a sword-like object which apparently talks. First I had no idea what was talking to me. The further you go into the story, the more is revealed, along with the backstory of Red (the main character, the musician). Soon it appears that 4 villans, the Camerata, those who basically own the city Cloudbank. Not only that, they are mostly scientists who care for the city, but made a mistake, and... well, you'll find out.Gameplay: 9/10Bastion had a right-left-midbutton gameplay, while here you get abilities that you use. Not only that, it is also followed with Turn() feature, a planning feature that allows you to stop time and make actions like walking and using abilities for the price of Turn() potential (lets call it that). For instance, a Breach() ability (your very first ability you have access to) uses 20 Turn().Not only that, you get some introduction to different characters who these abilities belonged to. For example, Red's ability is Breach(), an ability that stuns the target and makes it more vulnerable for 1.6 secs. Another one was a racer, when you used the transistor to ""absorb"" his essence, you retrieved an ability that allows you to blink. Furthermore, you can read info on these abilities that reveal about the character.Each ability can also be used as a passive or an upgrade to a different abilities. They can be swapped at any time when you get to an access point.And of course, remember the Shrine in Bastion? Here you have so called ""Limiters"", they work exactly the same as those things in the Shrine, except they also reveal info on the ""Process"" if used.Music: 10/10I won't comment on this. No point.Visuals: 10/10Seriously, the visuals are just amazing. Some may complain tho, that they don't like cyberpunk stuff, but to me, the art in this is majestic. The lights, the sketches, everything deserves a 10 in my opinion.Duration: 7/10Sadly, its rather short, but if you play with limiters you may get a longer enjoyment from this. That's exactly what I did with Bastion. Yet Transistor is still shorter than Bastion. I really wish it either had a continuation or just a longer gameplay. That may ruin the plot however.Replayable? Yes, definitely. Its worth replaying. Unlike Bastion, you don't have to grind here to get levels (because you can't, lol).Overall:I really want to give it 10/10, but I can't. I honestly just can't. I want it to be a bit longer, I want to get more enjoyment, maybe have a reality where Process comes from, where I can destroy its core, where I can have some sort of a choice like in Half-Life at the very end, or... I don't know. I just feel the urge for this to be longer.So any way.9/10, I can't wait for Supergiant games to release a new game. Maybe soon, maybe later, maybe next year (I actually heard they are working on a new game to be released in 2017).TL;DR Transistor is awesome, has great music, gameplay mechanics and great plot. If you feel like you need a game that would allow you to relax and feel some enjoyment, then this is it. I am a Dota 2 player myself, and nothing relaxed me more than Bastion and Transistor (especially transistor, tbh). Go buy it.			"

												When you buy Transistor, you don't just buy an amazing game, you buy a ticket to a feels trip! But seriously though, this game is amazing. I was immediately in love with the game within the first few minutes. The asthetic is different and unique. The gameplay is fun and very customizable. I can't even describe how amazing the music is. The world and its lore is very interesting, and you can find out more about people if you so desire. And it isn't that hard to get said lore. Seriously, get this game. It's a masterpiece and is probably my favorite game (for real). The one downside though is it is fairly short, but it has replayability. There's a new game plus mode where you keep everything and your levels and start from the beginning.			"

												Things I liked:gameplay is very intersting in that it combines both real-time and turn-based elements to combat. Just watch some gameplays and you will seeThe art is candy for your eyesThe soundtrack is candy for your ears  Innovative dedicated hum buttonAs you progress, you will unlock a variety of different abilitites. You have main slots for active abilitites, mod slots that allow you to modify active abilities, and passive abilities. What's really cool is that you can put any abilities into any slot and create all kinds of combinations.Datsoundtrack thoIf you have a dualshock 4 controller, there's a pretty cool feature in the game that works specifically with it I think. I'm not sure about the XBox One controller though.References to computer programming that I don't get.Things I didn't like:This game is not as popular as undertale			"

												Transistor is an action RPG where you try to find out the myth about the sword called Transistor.At the same time,you will be chased by enemies,who are trying to take your sword by...killing you.For the gameplay itself,you are tasked by taking out enemies,who in turn give powers for your sword and then you configure it using passive stat slots,active stat and upgrade ones.Its short though,as it takes about 7-8 hours to be completed.And yet...the story is good but short,soundtrack is great,artwork is good,gameplay is good and the combat system...i found it underwhelming and easy.So,my rating on this game is 7/10 because of *easy* combat system,short story and its features aren't perfect.

												Totally stunning. Every scene in this game is a work of art and I couldn't get enough. I really dig the story and how the world itself isn't explicitly described; you just have to take all the aspects you're given and piece together your own impression of this sci-fi dreamscape. In terms of gameplay, I enjoyed the combat system. I don't often come across a game with multiple interchangable skills that really encourages me to try different combinations. Usually I find my 2 or 3 favourites and stick with them all game, but this system of losing/regaining skills gave me the extra push to experiment, and that was cool! The soundtrack is magnificent, as everyone says (I'm sure it would sound incredible on vinyl *wink nudge*). It's all the little touches that made this really special for me, like finding a peaceful, pretty spot and letting Red hum a tune. It's easy to tell that a lot of love and care went into this, thank you! I'd recommend this to anyone.			"

												Transistor may be the classiest, most stylish and beautiful game I've ever played. It also seems very innovative. It's an evolution on the super-saturated acrylic painting style of Bastion (Supergiant's previous game), incorporating an intricate 1920s art deco interpretation of neon turquoise Tron glow, visually somewhat similar to Bioshock.The sound track is an integral part of the beauty. Not at all just background noise, it's closely integrated into the context. It's smoothly haunting with the protagonist character humming soulfully along at the push of a button (strangle compelling).This game quite closely resembles it's predecessor in many ways:
Both are top down, isometric view.  Poignant, with pretty little side-on 2D cutscenes that augment the in-play storytelling. Tales of personal loss and societal/city devastation, picking up (or picking through) the pieces. Disembodied voice-over narration from another character, but one who's physically present in context this time.  Mute protagonist, again an explanation is worked in here excellently.  There are unlocks that make play harder (for slightly more experience gain), as well as collecting new abilities.But it departs from Bastion's pure, practised skill - aim and click, continuously rolling action bonanza - by injecting a kind of seamless turn planning mechanism into the real time action. This allows, and demands, far more tactical thinking in the heat of battles. It's rewarding as you can escape tight spots in style and beat heavy odds. Plus, of course, this gives plenty of time to stop, think and analyse the situation. Great for those of us who don't always quite have the mental processing speed of fighter pilots.The abilities, known as ""functions"", form the core of the game experience. They are not only used as novel new active attacks, but also modifier upgrades to any other ability you have. Or, as a passive abilities that are always active. Thus there is a combinatorial explosion of possibilities as you proceed to accumulate them.The huge, buried depth of game mechanics (that must have taken a whole lot of careful design and coding) reminds me most of Magicka's spell system. There, elements are combined in real time to be blasted out like guitar chords. But composing new Transistor skill combinations is a separate  setup process done at ""Access Point"" checkpoints. I found all the descriptions a little hard to juggle mentally while shuffling between the different information screens. It's also time consuming, and a little bit more fiddly than necessary, taking me at least as long, overall, as the actual fighting. So probably too long, unless this suits your mindset somewhat, with the play flow thoroughly interrupted. The game is all about figuring out synergistic load-outs and combo strategies.Players are incentivised to try out many combinations, since there are narrative expanding character biography snippets which are unlocked by using each new ability once (in combat) in each of the 3 types of slot. There's also opportunities to quickly test out ideas and practice, away from the main story progression, in a literal beach themed ""Sandbox"" area. So you're unlikely to stick to one favourite setup for long. It would be real shame and I'm not sure how much that would even be possible. The battles are quite varied, so will often demand quite different approaches. Enemy types are randomly varied to an extent too, on each re-try (or re-play).Each ability embodies archetypal personality traits of a particular character and they are woven into the story ark to be picked up along the way. It's pretty clever, and really gives a sense of double meaning, that everything and everyone is a metaphor for parts of a computer system, perhaps, like (the original) Tron. Programming functions personified, or vice versa.The plot sets out like ""Kill Bill"" (2003), but, as details are incrementally expanded via a variety of interactions, a very nuanced exploration of big societal themes is rendered, with the antagonists being sympathetic, tragic and their purpose and motivations understandable. At large, it is a reflection on the potential flaws of an absolute (participatory) democracy, even in an otherwise utopian environment. Here, the 'Process' (collective name for the robot enemies) also feels duplicitous - sounding almost like they are talking about understanding (and subverting) the politic process. Then, of course, the dangers of concentrated power - how small personal flaws might cause everything to unravel. Here, ""The Camerata"" has resonance, to me, of the Khmer Rouge, or some other revolutionary force, that accidentally caused huge losses when applying its ideology.So there is certainly much depth to this game, on many levels, with no doubt many real world references tied in. e.g. ""Royce Bracket"" may be named for Winston W. Royce, computer scientist who coined the term 'software engineering'. ""Young Ladies"" perhaps a tip to Neal Stephenson cyberpunk novel ""The Diamond Age: Or, A Young Lady's Illustrated Primer""...? Talk of ""The Country"", a reference to Shakespeare's line: ""The undiscovered country from whose bourn, No traveller returns""...?I don't feel that every single plot detail comes together in a perfectly defined way. Some things are deliberately left open to interpretation more than others, but I'm sure there will have been tweaks and compromises during development, interfering slightly with narrative sense. The mapping of game mechanics onto plot, while ever clever, and more thorough than most any other title, is not perfect. For example, the new game plus ""recursion"" mode doesn't seem able to have a direct, causal, logically consistent plot mapping (however much you overthink it). Regardless, Transistor definitely has a rewardingly complex, detailed story. One that will bear re-examination after first completion. Recursion is ideal for this. It also lets you carry on to pick up second copies of each ability function, for even more extreme setups. I personally reached max level just before finishing my second run, then picked up the final, challenging (10 limiters) achievement within 30 minutes of starting a second recursion. Perfectly paced for 100%-ing the Steam achievements; very satisfying.Value wise, it yielded about 40 hours of engaging play time for me. A large part of that was spent compulsively experimenting, as I like to do in such games (if they draw me in). This can be done in the context of regular combat, by simply restarting that section, back to your last access point where you can change things up again. But it is also the main utility of the sandbox, aside from trying to beat your highest single turn total damage figure (fun!). You reach this area via 'back doors' which crop up periodically in the main game. Also in this area are a whole bunch of differently structured tests and challenges, which pretty near double up the game's content and again encourage exploring and understanding the various functions: Time trials, escalating rounds of engagements to survive with a limited function set, etc. There are a half dozen logical puzzles that particularly tickled me, showing the flexibility of the turn() system. I wish there'd just been a few more... :-)			"

The music is wonderful, with the simplicity of look and complexity of combat, you find yourself truely immersed in the city of Cloudbank.			"

												This is a beautiful game with an interesting story and a peculiar combat system that blends turn-based and real-time combat.  You can unlock peices of the world's lore by useing your skills in combat which is very interesting for me and forced me to use almost all of the skills to find out as much info as possible.  I would say more but i don't want to spoil anything for you.			"

												If you appreciate elegant story telling, excellent voice acting, challenging and unique combat, incredible music, and downright breathtakingly beautiful art then you will enjoy this game. I first purchased this gem a few years ago during a sale only to try it out and discard it, what a huge mistake. After picking Transistor up again and giving it the attention it truly deserves I was blown away. It had me hooked instantly and before I knew it six hours had flown by. Everything about this game is polished to a shine from the unique story telling to the stunning art. Albeit short by most standards every minute of this game is filled to the brim with beautiful art, a captivating narrative, and fun semi-turn based combat. This game also has a sort of new game + I did not try it out but I assume it adds a fair amount of replayability if you're into that sort of thing. I would recommend playing this game at night with the lights off to fully enjoy the art this game has to offer.Overall pretty good game would recommend, ez value.			"

												I bought TRANSISTOR at $13.39 and I got about 20 hours of high-quality playtime out of the purchase. I consider that a great buy.So many elements of this game standout: - The combat mechanics are fully customizable, strategic, and introduced in layers - as you play, not thrown at you all at once. There are so many creative ways to build that the heroine truly becomes your own. - The mixture of real-time/turn-based combat is seamless, and cleverly left in your control. I wish I could find more games with this system! - The story is compelling and told beautifully in sound and color (although much of it is open to your own interpretation). The voice-acting and artwork are first-rate.The downside is, the game will leave you wanting more - but in my experience, that is how all good books and films end. We wish there were another chapter.			"

												Transistor is made by the same people who made Bastion and you can really tell. This isn’t an insult, just a statement of fact. There are a lot of mechanical similarities between the two games, as well as some style elements. I loved both games, but I think Transistor is the better game. I like the style better and it seems to have more polish as well. That said, the fifth performance test is pure crap. I got to the 9th wave of 11 and played for more than an hour and I was at 100% health and not a single bad guy was injured, because they could go stealth and heal to 100%.			"

												Transistor is by far the best single-player experience I've had in a while. This game quickly immersed me in its unique world and original story. The soundtrack was stellar, Darren Korb did a wonderful job, not to mention Ashley Barret's vocals. The gameplay was very strategy-based but managed to stay well-paced enough to keep me interested. But what really made the game for me was Logan Cunningham's performance as the Transistor.The mere fact that the Transistor had a voice and personality was a great choice. Without him, the game would've felt lonely and fairly empty. The dynamic voice lines that made the Transistor react to situations made him feel a lot more real and I eventually fell infatuated with his and Red's relationship. The few other characters were also very well done, and the voice actors for them were all phenomenal.The gameplay, as said before, was unusual but fun. The ""turn"" mechanic I had not seen in a game before, but it was very well polished. I found myself trying out functions left and right for new effects which proved very useful, less I go through the entire game with Joust as an Active Function. Many of the fights were simple once I understood the core mechanics, so I added ""Limits"" in order to challenge myself. I found this to make some specific fights harder, while most stayed the same difficulty.The art and music added to the feel of the world's dystopian setting. I can't really describe this any better than it would be for you to just watch the trailer or pick up the game. Both are among the best that the video game industry has offered in this decade.If you are looking for a fairly short game with a lot of replayability, this is definitely the game for you. While not the most challenging game, it's definitely one worth playing through once or twice or five times. Between the breathtaking ambience, stunning performance, and astounding story and gameplay, Transistor is definitely one of my favorite games from the last few years.			"

												ProsNice graphics and music. Awesome voice acting . Nice ""artwork"" and ""feeling"" during the gameCreative and interesting skills systemFun and moderately challenging combatNice atmospere and good storyNo grindingCons Short playtimeNo multiple save slotsNo ""Sand box""No difficulty setting I would recommend the game to those who appreciate the good music and and nice graphics.The voice acting was well excuted and personally it was one of the best voice I heard in general , really soothing and deep voice. The atmospere of the game was also nice. These things made me engaged in game. However, I dont like the lenght of the game (1 story mode play would take Probably 3 - 6 hours for the most users) and sometimes I just lost where to go because basically no maps available. And too many ""discarding"" thing.What I meant the""discarding"" thing is that - basically you choose one of the things that you can get when you lev up.It can be skill A , skill B and more MEM or more skill upgrade slots something like that and you choose 1 of these choices.This is very fine and I really like the choice in the game. However , I found later that the choice is permanent and theres no ""Skill respec"" until the end , and no turning back even in ""new game+"". So basically , I missed almost half of the skills / choices and there was no way to just ""have fun"" with the skills I missed on sandbox or something . If they had one , I coudnt find it.(Edited later : I found that after after leveling up several times more, I do get the all the skills. so this is not true. No scratch from beginning option though)Speaking of skills and lev up stuff, the skill system is but quite interesting. It is really fun expermenting with these stuff. One ""element"" can be active skill and can be fuction as the passive skill and even upgrade other skills. It makes A LOT OF the skill set possible. It gives you a lot of choices, makes you think a lot , and makes you creative. And at least for the ""elements"" you have, you can change anytime you want on the check point (But no discarded elements) The combat can be played both real-time and ""turn based"" but i think the game meant to be played on turn based. But If you are real quick with the mircro and the planning stuff , I think you may be able to play on real time only. The problem about the combat thing is that there's no ""hard and easy mode"" on the game so you are stuck with the ""normal"" . Otherwise, the combat was fun and pretty nice. Slightly lack of diversity of the enemy but I would say good enough.7.5/10Overall , the game is quite memorable one , and it has some issues but most people would appreciate the game.Don't buy the game if you are looking for huge amount of playtime of the game.

												Oh man.After having played through Bastion, my expectations for this game were high.I was not disappointed.Everything was solid, the combat was a really fun variant of a turn-based system, it's fairly easy to play through (only 4 hours). The balancing is done very well, since enemies get more abilities and strength at the same rate as you do, keeping combat fairly fresh rather than a tiring grind. The game can be quickly made unforgivably hard with ingame options for those who like a challenge.The artstyle is also very beautiful, but to me the highlight of this game is the soundtrack, like just about every other reviewer has said. The story is a bit hard to get into, but if you pay some attention to the information you hear and read, you'll understand, although I wish there was more lore to be found.I bought this for somewhere around 10€, and it was worth every cent of it. I wouldn't mind paying the full price for it.There really isn't any more to say other than ""Get it, you won't regret it""			"

												If you're familiar with their other game, Bastion, then you have a good idea of what to expect.The game begins with the female main character, Red, pulling the sword named Transistor out of someone who has just been killed.  The rest of the game is essentially her seeking answers and battling with the fallout of that individual's death in this really unique and original world they've created. The game is extremely polished.  Like Bastion, they pair the visuals, music, and narration perfectly.  The game is absolutely dripping with style and attention to detail.  The combat system is really solid (and pretty challenging) as well.  You have four main abilities, or functions, that can be active at one time.  Each function you gain in the game contains the essence of a fallen individual of the city, whose lore you can read about once you possess it.  Each function has a main, secondary, and passive property.  Each one also requires a certain amount of memory, so which abilities you can run at the same time will depend on how much you have invested in increasing your max memory capacity.  The combat can be performed in real time or you can execute the turn() function and plan your moves ahead like a turn based game.  It's highly customizeable, albeit a little overwhelming at first (there is no tutorial but you do run have occasional access to a practice zone throughout).  I completed the playthrough without unlocking all of the passives or secondaries.  I guess that is supposed to draw you towards playing it again. My complaint is that the game is so compact.  It took me about 5 hours to complete.  I guess I played with minimum limiters (kind of like talents you pick to make certain aspects of the game more difficult in return for bonus xp), but if you need to have a multitude of these limiters to stretch out the experience of the game, then maybe somethings wrong.  Additionally, there are only a handful of enemy types (they get progressively more difficult as you advance in the game).  This leads to the combat getting a little repetitive in some combat filled areas.The game is very unique and well made, and I would absolutely recommend it.  However the $20 price-tag seems to have been made with the notion that the buyer would do multiple playthroughs.  I'd pick it up on sale instead.			"

												Transistor’s the kind of game that made me immediately jump back in to take on New Game Plus. I wanted to continue exploring the excellent combat in new, more challenging scenarios.

												Transistor is a gorgeous game, it is pleasant both to the eye and to the ear. For the eye, it blends hand-painted elements with nicely-lit 3D environment and objects, makes the whole game looks like a painting. For the ear, the sound tracks are otherworldly beautiful, it’s always nice to stop and just listen to the protagonist--Red singing.Transistor creates an unique atmosphere with a futuristic city and creative action planning/upgrading system. Actions in the game are neat and has thousands of combinations, you can creatively combine so called “functions” to customize your desired effects and styles. Though the overall length is a bit short - I think it is justified with its pricing -, it sets a brilliant example for must-play indie games.			"

All in all a game well worth the money and a soundtrack well worth adding to your purchase. On thw whole, a great game with amazing art and voices, truly an environment you find yourself immersed in. While the end left me less satisfied than the end of Bastion, it was more amazing a story than most 60 dollar games give you.			"

												If you're familiar with their other game, Bastion, then you have a good idea of what to expect.The game begins with the female main character, Red, pulling the sword named Transistor out of someone who has just been killed.  The rest of the game is essentially her seeking answers and battling with the fallout of that individual's death in this really unique and original world they've created. The game is extremely polished.  Like Bastion, they pair the visuals, music, and narration perfectly.  The game is absolutely dripping with style and attention to detail.  The combat system is really solid (and pretty challenging) as well.  You have four main abilities, or functions, that can be active at one time.  Each function you gain in the game contains the essence of a fallen individual of the city, whose lore you can read about once you possess it.  Each function has a main, secondary, and passive property.  Each one also requires a certain amount of memory, so which abilities you can run at the same time will depend on how much you have invested in increasing your max memory capacity.  The combat can be performed in real time or you can execute the turn() function and plan your moves ahead like a turn based game.  It's highly customizeable, albeit a little overwhelming at first (there is no tutorial but you do run have occasional access to a practice zone throughout).  I completed the playthrough without unlocking all of the passives or secondaries.  I guess that is supposed to draw you towards playing it again. My complaint is that the game is so compact.  It took me about 5 hours to complete.  I guess I played with minimum limiters (kind of like talents you pick to make certain aspects of the game more difficult in return for bonus xp), but if you need to have a multitude of these limiters to stretch out the experience of the game, then maybe somethings wrong.  Additionally, there are only a handful of enemy types (they get progressively more difficult as you advance in the game).  This leads to the combat getting a little repetitive in some combat filled areas.The game is very unique and well made, and I would absolutely recommend it.  However the $20 price-tag seems to have been made with the notion that the buyer would do multiple playthroughs.  I'd pick it up on sale instead.			"

The game doesn't provide enough of a challenge or variation in combat situations to actually use the multiple combinations you can make to your satisfaction.

												Transistor is a unique game to say the least. It expects the player to dig into its world and find the story for themselves, from reading skill descriptions to finding the terminals hidden in the nooks and crannies of the world. Super Giant flexes it's art muscles again and delivers some of the best 2D artwork in a game. It is truly a piece of art in motion. In addition to the top notch visuals, Transistor boasts one of the best gaming soundtracks. I find myself listening to the cd over and over while at work. The combat is a unique blend of strategy and an action game where the player can freeze time and plan out their attack on the ""Process"". As with Bastion, there are game modifiers that make this game tougher, making the need for this planning mode essential. I cannot praise this game enough. A run through of the story may be a brief 6 hours but it does not over stay its welcome and feels complete in almost every way. The game does not hold your hand and expects you as a player to dig into the world to get the most out of it.			"

												I really like this game. The music is beautiful, as are the visuals. The voice acting is nice, tho there are some weird pauses between lines. I sometimes find myself waiting for the second half of a sentence that never comes, or thinking a line is done and then it continues a few seconds later. A little weird. But the quality is very high. And I love that sword guy's voice ;oPThe combat system is enjoyable. Lots and lots of options to play with. You have a number of skills that can be either used as a primary skill (like hit 'em with the sword, or shoot a bolt of energy at a distant foe), or they can be slotted into a different primary (like add damage, or AoE to some other skill), or they can be used to provide a more general buff (you have a damage shield, or all backstabs do more damage). That's really clever, and it is surprisingly intuitive to use. I'm a huge fan of the pause-time-and-queue-up-your-actions mechanic as well.I'd highly recommend it, if you're into RPGs.			"

												Okay, where do I begin...Overall, yes, I would recommend it, just because Supergiant made a unique experience with a definitive art style.That being said, the game to me is very flawed, especially when you compare it to its spiritual predecessor, Bastion:1) This game is incredibly short. You can beat it in 3 hours, if not less. There is a time and place for games as short as this (Journey, where replays are encouraged). 2) You spend half the game going through a few maps, get to a certain area, and lo and behold your final destination was JUST PAST where you started the game in the opposite direction. You spend the second half retracing your steps through a disfigured Cloudbank 3) Combat and customization are very limited. Combining your abilities in new, unique ways was actually rather satisfying, especially when you discover a new combination to trounce enemies ahead of you. Other than that, there is almost no character progression other than increasing your RAM (literally) and junctioning moves together.4) There were two voices (if you don't count Red's occasional humming), and I didn't feel an emotional connection to either of them because of how they were voiced. It was as if they took a page out of William Shatner's book of acting on pausing mid-sentence, coupled with very monotonous expressions. 5) Biggest complaint about the story though has to be how disconnected I was to all of it. I will say that the ending was well done, though. I can see the rationale behind it. 6) There was almost no tutorial to speak of. I had to figure out almost everything by myself. Any tutorial that was there was hidden behind technical lingo resembling computer code, which I suppose fits the game's style.6/10. Support your indie devs!			"

												I picked this game up during the ""Supergiant games"" sale a while back, and definitely didn't regret it. There quite a bit to love about this game, from the beautiful artwork and soundtrack, to the customizable skills and unique battling system, which really require you to think in order to defeat your enemies. The story was intriguing and really required you to dig deep into the game to figure out all of its secrets. Transistor only offers about 10 hours of gameplay, but there is a ""recursion"" option (sort of a ng+) to delve into after finishing the main story. "

												I fell in love with this game the first time I played it. The world is beautiful and complex, and the characters are compelling. The fighting style is unique, which really goes a long way to set the game's atmosphere. The story isn't always as clear as I would have liked, and it left a few questions unanswered. I found some points of the game made a lot more sense as I played through it a second time. Over all, I'd say this game was a smashing success. 10 out of 10!			"

												A bit conflicted on this. While the art and music are great and gameplay seems solid, there is simply too little of it. The game doesn't provide enough of a challenge or variation in combat situations to actually use the multiple combinations you can make to your satisfaction.

												Supergiant is steadily becoming one of my favorite developers.  Bastion was amazing enough, but Transistor went even further with the strength of its art, music, sentimental narrative (Cunningham's voice is become quite iconic in its own right!), and more than anything, its mechanics with the customizable ability system, setting it apart from Bastion entirely.  Both of their games make me realize why I now prefer smaller companies in gaming: a smaller number of dedicated people making a smaller game seems much more likely to never lose sight of their creative focus, and the end product is often a more memorable and rewarding experience than an big budget pile of trendy mediocrity where things either drag on to the point of tedium, or abruptly end in unfulfilled disappointment.My only regret is that I can't SPECIFICALLY explain why I love Transistor so much without spoiling what makes it so memorable, so I'm stuck with being vague.  All I can say is that I was extremely happy to play this game, despite...well, if anyone's finished the game, they know.  After the emotional reaction I got from Bastion, I would expect no less from Transistor.  They delivered exactly what I was hoping for, and let's just say there's a very good reason why I refused to buy this game without the soundtrack bundled in.  I only wish I could get an artbook to go with it.I really wish I didn't have to be so cryptic, but this is one of those games that you just do not spoil.  It's just so refreshing to see a game like this.			"

												First, I'll do the quick one: If you liked Bastion, just buy this and go. The story and music may not be as good, but the art and gameplay are even better somehow. Go go go.For everyone else: Transistor is an absolute blast. The mix-and-match nature of the combat system leads to all sorts of fun experimentation. The semi-turn-based nature is also unlike anything I've never played before, and that alone makes this game worth trying out. It takes a bit for things to really open up, as you have very few powers for the opening bits of the game. But once you've got a sizable arsenal, this game shines like a diamond. The setting and story are delightfully unusual, but immediately familiar to anyone who enjoyed Tron or Reboot. Supergiant still knows how to make a wonderful soundtrack, and Logan Cunningham is a welcome return as the voice of the eponymous Transistor.So what's not so great? The back quarter of the game does drag a little bit, and if you want more info on the world than what the story offers you, prepare to do an awful lot of reading of people's bios in menus. And while the general storyline and ending are fine, they do leave a lot up to guesswork and interpretation. That's not to say it's too complex, just that I was left wanting to know a bit more. Twenty bucks may be a bit high for some, as the game can be beaten in a few sittings. On the other hand, it also means the game is very tight. There's little wasted space, and there is a ""new game+"" feature if you're just not done once you're done. I highly, highly recommend this game to just about anyone, even if action games aren't normally you're thing. The combat is very adjustable to be as forgiving or brutally punishing as you like, and the turn system often makes it as much about thinking through a problem as about running around like a maniac.

												Transistor is staggeringly beautiful. All of the art, the setting, the music, the writing, all of it. It's also a pretty big departure from Bastion, which was made by the same developers. Yes, it's the same perspective, and there's an ever-present narrator, and the protagonist is mute, and you can increase the difficulty in a piecemeal fashion. The similarities end there. While you can play Transistor like an action game, it really requires more strategy than that. It has an active-pause system, where you can pause the action, plot out a set number of attacks or movements, and then unpause to see the results. The main loop ends up being pause, attack, run, which leads to a lot of guerilla tactics, more than straight out blasting enemies.The ability system is also super interesting. Every ability, whether it's a straight attack, or a cloak, or a bomb, can be used as-is, attached to another ability to lend it different qualities, or set as a passive bonus to yourself. This leads to a ton of combinations of attacks. Some work better than others, but they all feel unique. The limits to the system is that each ability has a memory requirement, and you have a memory limit. So you can stack up on a couple heavy hitters, but you limit yourself to a small number of attacks or bonuses. Likewise, you can have a full complement of attacks and bonuses, but you'll be lacking the most powerful of them. The one complaint I have is that the story is less straight forward than most video games. That doesn't mean it has a bad story, or that it's incomprehensible. It just takes more attention to the details than most. By the end, you'll probably get the gist of it, but expect to be a little disoriented.			"

												Ok this will be hard to explain to anyone who hasnt played Bastion, the game previously produced by the same developers (Which i highly recommend you play after this, or before - My preference). But to someone who does not know this genre or at least the playstyle, the best way to describe it would be: an Action RPG, with puzzle solving elements. Fast paced real time fighting, with some turn based elements. until you play it you wont understand. But there is an ability similar to Fallout 3's slowmo shooting. The gameplay is fluid, challenging and extreemely rewarding. I encountered VERY few bugs and problems throughout the game and sense an extreme amount of replayability.As for the Story. Wow. Don't worry about trying to understand the story at first it unravels itself beautifully. There were, for me, big ""aahhhh"" moments of realisation and understanding. It wants you to find out everything about the Process, which is your adversary in this game. I wont say much more about it, but it is very cleverly implemented and can be quite difficult to work it out. But theres lots of backstory and Lore for those who love to read and immerse yourself.For me this gets:Gameplay: 8/10 fast, fluid, incredible amount of combat combinations and solutions to fights. but it seemed some were just comepletely unusable. But this is only with 2 playthroughs and still i havent used every combination.Story: 9/10 its intriguing and really makes you want to know more. May not have the best Depth but its solid and they give you enough of a story, and dont drown you in one.Graphics 10/10 : Oh my word this game is beautiful, it has the most fantastic and intricate artwork ive seen in this century. Truly a masterpeice and trumps all AAA titles in terms of beauty. Also with the ability to run on probably any hardware at a good level means its open to all kinds of audience.PLAY THIS GAME.

The mix and match skill system is cool, as is the VATS-like combat system.  My only real complaint is the game does a poor job I think of explaining the combat system.  It doesn't have a huge learning curve, but it takes a little getting used to.  Good- Art and animation are gorgeous.- Soundtrack is possibly the best I've heard in any game.- Cool skill system where almost any build is valid and useful. - Combat system is fun once you get the hang of it.Bad- Pretty short (10ish hours)- Vague story that didn't really grab me.- Combat system could be explained better early on.Ugly- Void, Crash, Mask, BACKSTAB!

												Outstanding. Never expected anything less than a matserpiece from the creators of my all-time favourite Bastion, and this is even more.Transistor is, by far, the best game I played yet (yes, even better than the last Bioshock), but it is more than a game - unbelivable imagery, that got me standing on ingame ""view points"" and just staring. The style, the lighting, the colours! Elaborate combat system, that you can never be bored by, because of numerous ways to execute your foes with new, never seen (at least by me) before ""functions"" upgrade system. The amazing story is supported by breathtaking music created by Darren Korb, who, by the way, is from now on the only person allowed to wear whiskers and still be praised by yours truly.I probably would have gone turbo-gay for Logan Cunningham, the voice of Transistor (also the narrator in Bastion), but, thanks to Ashley Barrett, who voices the main hero and sings the most of the soundtrack, I am still where I was.If in your gaming you seek something more than a timewaster, if you have the craving for sophisticated experiense, if you want to understand what a ""work of art"" is - you get yourself this game, and you play it.Thanks to Supergiant Games, videogames will get recognised as art, just like cinema and theatre.

												6/10This game was made by the makers of Bastion, so I had my hopes up. Sadly, while the graphic style and music is gorgeous, the story and gameplay are lacking cohesion. Similar to Bastion the action is controlled from isometric view and has lots of action rpg elements. There is real time combat and a turn mode, which stops the action and allows you to plan moves, which are then executed. Combat in real time is clunky, as the enemies move much to fast to evade, which forces the player into the turn mode. Consequently the game forces hit and run tactics. Stop the action, move close to the enemy, hit him with a few spells and run out of range. Rinse and repeat.One of the few good things about combat is the endless combinations of skills you can use. Each of the skills can be used as primary or enhancer of another skill. Sadly, you will end up using the 1-3 heavy hitting spells, without ever experimenting too much.All in all the developers did not succeed making this a cohesive game. Graphics and sound are great, gameplay and story telling are lacking. So you find yourself walking down pretty hallways without ever caring about the enemies you kill or knowing what exactly happened in this dystopian world.			"

												Transistor is made by SuperGiant Games, who are well known for their other masterpiece: Bastion. Both of these games have similarities with the isometric view, and feelings of being lonely. What Transistor does to break the mold and to step out from behind Bastion's shadow is amazing. It's sci-fi centric, and the musical selection of jazz is a great mood setter. Combat contrasts greatly from Bastion. In Bastion, the combat was fast-paced with very little cooldown and strategic plans. Transistor is all about the strategy standpoint as your attacks are slow as molasses, but brings in the mechanic of stopping time and planning attacks that will be automatically executed very fast after you set the plan. The artwork is beautiful and is very colorful. The levels are greatly detailed. The only voice heard during the game is the voice of the sword (i guess this will be a common theme among games by SuperGiant). If you are a fan of Bastion, this game is a must buy. If you didn't play Bastion and like games with strategic mechanics fused with some action, this is a perfect example.Transistor gets a 10/10 in my book.			"

												Well, this here is a quality game. Lets start with its strengths: STORY, MUSIC, VISUALS, GAMEPLAY. Everything about this game shines immensley. Every aspect is so well polished I often had to take moments away from the game because it just got too impressive. That being said, there are some flaws... While the story was well executed there wasn't any exposition or call to action, which meant you don't progress because you want to save the land, you progress because you know thats where the story is. Also, the combat has a huge amount of depth and I wish they would have made some kind of multiplayer mode to accompany that. Finally, the game was a tad short. If we got that little bit of exposition that let us live a regular day in Red's world, it would have felt longer, but since we didn't, the game lacks the punch something like Mother 3 gives you. Still a good game, but it falls shy of being perfect. Like literally, centimeters away from perfection.BUY IT.			"

												Virtually every gameplay screenshot could be your new sci-fi-themed wallpaper (the game's native resolution is 1920×1080), and the soundtrack covers more influences (drum and bass, folk, post-rock) than Bastion. This is Supergiant's first self-published game, and from what I can see, they made good use of their Bastion money.Native support for PlayStation 4 controllers, so PS4 buttons will be displayed in-game.

												I can't recommend this game more - SuperGiant has combined fantastic story telling, wonderful characters, beautiful graphics, and spectacular music (really, buy the soundtrack too along with the game). It's a short story - realistically you can sit down and finish it in a single day - but like Bastion, it's an emotional touching story and the game has excellent replayability.  Transistor has easily become one of my absolute favorite games.			"

												This game was so much fun. I'll make it short: environment is beautiful, soundtrack is superb, story is great. There really aren't any tutorials and it is not clear what is going on at first, which just makes it all the more intriguing.  The combat system is ""turn based,"" so to speak, and while that may be a turn off, chaining together combos with a variety of functions is quite enjoyable. There are about 12 hours of gameplay, and more achievements can be had via a second playthrough, however there is not much else in terms of replayability. Still, those dozen hours make for a daggone good time.			"

												One of the best game i have ever played, period. I wish i could forget everything about it just so i could expereince it again.The gameplay is fun and creative, allowing players to switch between a fast paced hack-n-slash to a slow, more strategic pace. You can set powers you unlock as you play the game as actives, passives and even upgrades to existing powers, allowing a ridicoulous amount of versatilty in how you want to play, this also makes the game more replayable along with its new game+ mode.But what really got me was the style of the game, its mood, music, art style (oh my god the art is so beautiful) and deep story feels unlike any other experince i've had with a game, leaving me with a heart-wrenching feeling when it ended.Buy this game.

												Rather than repost my entire review from Cheerful Ghost, I'll just link it HERE[cheerfulghost.com]. The TL/DR version: It's sci-fi action with RPG elements in a lush environment, contrasting desolation with electric life. A thinker, a doer, a sad state of affairs, and the entire mystery is accompanied by a brilliant, flowing soundscape. I can't recommend it enough.			"

												I feel comfortable using the phrase ""Art Game"" to describe Transistor.The holistic experience of the graphics, sound, and gameplay is superb. The almost-a-puzzle-game battle system is challenging, but the slowly unfolding storyline motivates you to keep moving forward. Play this game if you like games that push video games forward as a viable medium for artistic expression.			"

												TL;DR: Transistor is a good game, and it will make you feel good.Transistor is a narrative-driven turn-based game that always seemed to be reminding me of the Tron universe. It's in the middle of an apocalypse, yet it has an eerie peacefulness about it. As you go about the world and destroy the monsters that are transforming the world, you can't help but take a step back and listen to the protaganist Red hum along to the background music, or look out over a pier for a few seconds and think about the history of a town you never knew. Something about this game calms you down. All of the mechanics seem to cater to a casual playstyle, although some moments can be very intense. Even the fast and reflexive combat system seems to be designed to make you breathe. You can take as much time as you want to plan out your moves, take a breather, take a break from the loud fighting music and explosions that are happening around you. It's calming.Of course, there's the narrator. The more I play games with great narrators like The Stanley Parable or Bastion (the latter of which was the same creator of Transistor). The narrator of Transistor is more personal than the two, though. It addresses the character, not the player. You are simply an observer to this story, and the narrator is unaware of your existence. This game is between Red and her love. You are granted the gift of watching. It's very touching and emotional at some points to realize that this story has to end somehow, and the few moments where the narrator leaves you feel so void and wrong. I'm not really sure what to say about the narration in this game, other than it's not really narration at all. There's just only one character with dialogue.As I said, everything in this game seems to be designed to make you feel calm and content. As evil and chaotic as some parts of this game are, all of it makes you feel reflective, nostalgiac almost. It's a good feeling. This game will make you feel good. It's a pity that I can't think of eloquent enough words to describe this game. Maybe it's because there's a woman screaming nonsense in the other room and I can't process thoughts (sorry if parts of this review don't make sense, but I honestly can't hear myself think), but I think mostly it's because when you find something that is truly beautiful, it doesn't take well to words, and although I wouldn't say this game is pure beauty and art, it is beautiful, and it is deliberate in its design. That's all I ask from a game.			"

												This is indeed a very short game, but I feel the length is actually very good - it doesn't outstay it's welcome. The story, though actually simple on the surface, has many MANY pages of lore you can find - the abilities are people too.

												This game is beautiful. The visuals are so breath taking you want to screenshot the entire game. The story line is intriguing and is build in a similar fashion to Bastion. That is, as you go along you understand more and more until things begin to click. There did seem to be a lack of tutorial however, it makes you engaged to figure out things on your own. You discover what items and abilitys do, and how you get them, each with a unique story, ultimately adding to your discovery of the story line. The gameplay is increadibly unique and fluid, with a fair amount of stratagy laid in to it. The shear number of ability combinations is stagering, with each ability having a attack, amplifier, or passive trait depending on where it is socketed.I would recommend this game, whether it is for the unique combat, amazing visuals, or intriguing story. 10/10			"

												Overall: 6/10I must say that this is not my usual kind of game and I confess I bought it just because it was on sale and ""looked nice"", in the end though I'm quite happy with it. In a nutshell: you get to play a redhead rockstar, inside some sort of virtual reality, defeating ""monsters"" with an upgradeable sword while enjoying a nice scenary and listening to a good soundtrack.PROS+ Artsy graphics, a pleasure to look at.+ Relaxing and soothing original soundtrack.+ Some innovative ideas (combat system, character level up) that deserve being implemented and tried out in more meanigful games.CONS- The storyline is too obscure to be fully enjoyed- The game is very short (took me 10 hours or so, but that's because I'm clumsy, I figure 4-5 hours is what it would really take)- No real replayability (platform structure, very similar levels, pretty much on rails) unless you really want to understand what is going on.

												As I've expected, Supergiant Games has done it again: A beautifully crafted masterpiece of an indie game. Good soundtrack? Check. Logan Cunningham providing yet another good voice for a character? Check. Story and combat to keep you glued to your screen? Check. My only gripe? The short, yet sweet storyline. Lasting for only around 4-6 hours, it's quite an enjoyable experience albeit short and slightly expensive (although I consider that $20 paid for itself). I suggest getting it on sale for a lower price, but even with a high pricetag it's well worth it on its own. If you want to support the devs even more, grab the soundtrack. It's amazing.Final Verdict: Solid 8.5/10. It has its rough edges and it's obviously not a perfect game. It, however, is ♥♥♥♥ing amazing so grab it anyway.			"

												This is honestly one of the best games I have played in a very long time (Since Bastion). I think the problem that most people are seeing is that they wanted a Bastion 2, instead they got a completly diffrent game. The gameplay is fun to learn and use well, as if you make a mistake you're punished for it. Darren Korb has outdone himself, and Ashley Barrett has the voice of a goddess. Another problem people see is that you have to find the story for yourself. You can't just walk through everything and have the story layed out for you, you have to try new weapons and combinations, you have to search every alley, and even if it's only for a little remark made by the Transistor, it helps bring the world together. I can see how the game isn't for everyone, some people don't want to explore just for tiny remarks, or read about how the Antagonists chose certan people to make ""disappear"" and why those people were chosen. This game isn't a new Bastion, not by a longshot. Once you realize and accept that then the game really shows it's true colors. I would reccomend this game to almost everyone, but explain what kind of game it is.TL;DR: The music is a treat. The gameplay is a treat. The art is a treat. Anyone with half a brain would give this game a try.			"

												This is an aural and visual feast, which is no surprise coming from the makers of Bastion. What was most surprising was the elegant combat system. A psuedo turn based mechanic and an adapative weapon loadout system made combat by far the most interesting part of the game. The story lost me, I'll be damned if I could follow it. It didn't seem to matter, it's a short game (about 4-6 hours) and I was glad it ended when it did. Any more and it would have been over indulgent, the chocolate eclair of gaming.			"

												Transistor is a unique game to say the least. It expects the player to dig into its world and find the story for themselves, from reading skill descriptions to finding the terminals hidden in the nooks and crannies of the world. Super Giant flexes it's art muscles again and delivers some of the best 2D artwork in a game. It is truly a piece of art in motion. In addition to the top notch visuals, Transistor boasts one of the best gaming soundtracks. I find myself listening to the cd over and over while at work. The combat is a unique blend of strategy and an action game where the player can freeze time and plan out their attack on the ""Process"". As with Bastion, there are game modifiers that make this game tougher, making the need for this planning mode essential. I cannot praise this game enough. A run through of the story may be a brief 6 hours but it does not over stay its welcome and feels complete in almost every way. The game does not hold your hand and expects you as a player to dig into the world to get the most out of it.			"

												Easily one of the best games I've ever played. I absolutely loved the story and the world. The story was short, sweet, and to the point; it didn't drag out, and it wrapped itself up with a nice definitive ending that left me with a sense of completion. The world was fleshed out wonderfully through side data and peripherals and the awesome soundtrack really helped me feel like I was in Cloudbank. In fact purchasing the soundtrack is pretty much one of the best decisions I've ever made. The combat is definitely where this game shines though. Challenging and rewarding, I really felt like there was a sense of creativity and 'playing your way' that I've rarely found in anything else. You can find whatever strategies float your boat and roll with them, and despite that the enemies aren't exactly pushovers either. Definitely worth every penny.			"

It doesn't treat you like a gibbering man-ape and dump everything in your lap right at the start. It teases, it hints, I would say more but part of the allure is figuring out exactly what is going on for yourself.The only con I can think of is that it is on the short side, 5-6 hours for a playthrough stopping and doing everything possible. However, there is a recursion mode (New Game +) which allows you to play through it again with varying difficulty. I played through the game in one sitting and immediately hit the recursion button.Bottom line: It is beautiful in both sound and visuals, intriguing in story, wonderfully written and acted, causes an actual emotional reaction, and is an absolute joy to play.

It does lack in content such as enemy types and actual combat but there is a NG+ mode which offers harder enemies and random amounts of them. I rather enjoyed the story, I just wish there was MORE of it. It leaves the player to fill in the gaps themselves, not unlike Dark Souls but a little more forward.I was a huge fan of bastion and had the biggest hardon for its OST so I am extremely biased but yeah it felt like money well spent.10/10 will listen to soundtrack on repeat for years to come.Oh im sorry were you looking for an unbiased review?

Without formally identifying or constructing her as so, Red is presented as a strong female protagonist; this means she is without any of the clichés that so often inhibit this archetype. Supergiant masterfully pulls off a plot that gives her agency and the ability to sculpt a world inhabited by a cast of colourful characters whom the player learns about through the Functions() of the Transistor. The diversity of the characters, in particular, is to be commended: there are black and mixed-race, gay, lesbian and transgender characters.The Function() system is at the heart of the game; it allows the player to combine different attacks and abilities in either primary, upgrade, or passive slots, resulting in a unique experience with approximately 22bn different combinations to be had. The system encourages experimentation, and so leads the player in to a kind of exasperating perfectionism: you want to get your loudout exactly right. The mix of frantic, fast-paced real time action and the suspended realm that Turn() provides to plan a sequence of moves is something quite unique and, surprisingly, it doesn't get tiresome. The enemies are varied enough to keep the battles interesting; they regularly upgrade themselves to match your own increasing prowess and there are enough different kinds to always provide a challenge.The soundtrack is both touching and transcendental; it encapsulates the changing pace of the game, from the arid mystery of a deserted Cloudbank at the beginning to the decaying ruins of a Processed world at the end. The mixture of electronica-esque synths, ambient Portal-like sounds and well-timed guitar riffs give suitable gravitas at just the correct moments. The music feels alive; it actively changes as you switch between states and the Turn() mode.It's the little things in Transistor that really complete it. Flavour text is what drives the realism and the allusions to software and programming are delightful to see. The different chapters of the plot and the scenes are strung together well enough so the entire game flows. Romanticised additions like the motorbike and the posters add a sense of fun  to the game and an importance to the role that Red has.The most striking element of the game is probably the artwork; the visuals are stunning and utilise different hues, colours, art styles and changes in lighting to illuminate Cloudbank. Cloudbank is a city inside a computer, but it feels very much real. The nuanced dichotomy of an organic, breathing world that is seen through the window of Red and the basic binary foundation that underlies the entire premise is linked delicately with endless, gorgeous pieces of artwork and cutscenes and this is remarkable.What makes Transistor a gem is the seamless integration of the idiosyncratic creativity of these elements -- music, artwork, plot and mechanics -- that would only be expected to find in the most successful of indie games, with the overall polish that usually only blockbuster games can pull off. The entire game has a glistening shine that suceeds in being both immersive and compelling, pulling the player into the digital utopia of Cloudbank and refusing to let them go. Certainly a niche game, but it can't be recommended enough.			"

												From the same people that brought you Bastion (which you should have played at least twice by now) comes Transistor. Beautiful music, gorgeous art, solid gameplay, incredibly deep story, and the outstanding voice acting that they've become known for makes Transistor another proud feather in Supergiant's hat.			"

												I think the Noire flavor and the intentionally opaque plot are a compliment to combat well refined. They took the standard of Bastion and elevated it to the next level, allowing freedom to compose your own style of battle. Along with the limited Turn Based mode to plan out an attack? It combines with the gorgeous art for a FUN game.And really, it is.			"

												A fine game, indeed. Beautiful world, characters and soundtrack, variety in skills and loadouts, intriguing story (a bit dissappointing ending, if understandable considering that there wasn't anyone left to save if i understood it right) and absolutely addictive combat, which is a good mix of strategy and smash-them-to-bits-before-they-do, if a bit repetitive however. The way they give you the lore is intriguing, literally by trying everything. Not in the same way as Bastion, however, with the commentator talking about everything and anything you interract with (still many things though) but when you experiment with your loadout, you get more info about the inventer of the tried out skill, who is usually in a high cultural position, like a local social butterfly who organizes most of the events in the city, so when you read about the inventer, you are told more about the world at the same time, instead of ""shoveling it into  your brain by force like Bastion,"" as some would say. This, however, leaves the lore a bit vague to those who don't read it with passion great enough, and possibly just a little bit less vague to those too. I'm also not sure about the pricing though, about the same as Bastions would have been more acceptable. Overall, however, it was worth it.			"

												Supergiant have nailed it again with Transistor- wildly beautiful art style, fantastic soundtrack and a unique twist on turn based/real time gameplay. The plot is a little hazy to begin with, and does leave a lot to interpretation, but the way the characters are fleshed out by a) using them in game (some you meet can be selected as upgrades to the titular weapon) and b) Logan Cunningham's wonderfully understated voiceover is just another feather in the cap of these developers. Whilst the pace wavers a little in the last third, it's a satisfying conclusion to their sophomore effort.If you're a fan of beautifully rendered, atmospheric, intriguing and innovative games, you should pick this up.

Keeping the same artistic flavour and excellent soundtrack, Supergiantgames have still managed to create something that is unique in its own right.

												I played this game start to finish in about 4.5 hours, and when I say start to finish, I mean I literally did not get out of my chair. So that tells you two things: this is a short game, but it's also a very good one.The story is... not sparse, but there's a lot of background detail left for you to fill in, kind of like Dark Souls. Bastion was the same way, but this is even more so.The combat is enjoyable; you can go real-time, use the Turn() system to plan out all your attacks (but then be mostly unable to attack while Turn() recharges), or some mixture of both. The music is aces and I highly recommend buying the soundtrack.Overall, if you've played Bastion, this is more of the same, but that's not a bad thing at all.			"

												Transistor is the second game by Supergiant Games, developers of Bastion. I really enjoyed Bastion, but I definitely think it was flawed. Transistor builds upon everything in the best way possible, and is absolutely fanastic as a result.First thing is the art. Oh man it's amazing. There is so much diversity in colour and style for some of the setpieces, and all of the enemies are really unique. Without spoiling anything, I will also say the shift and direction of the artwork towards the ending of the game is really fitting and very well done. It's a really wonderful sight to take in while playing, and it's all backed by an amazing soundtrack. Supergiant actually just released the soundtrack on vinyl on their store and I grabbed a copy - it's a great pressing! Next thing; the story. One of my dislikes of Bastion was the cohesiveness of the story. I understand that they were trying something different with the narration, and that itself was very cool, but it was still too much for me to wrap my head around. When I finished the game for the first time, I barely had any understanding of what transpired. Transistor is a massive improvement. The presentation of the story and world have much more clarity, yet the storytelling itself is still very artistic and unique. The pacing is also much better than in Bastion, which I found dragged on a bit. While things did move a little fast in the beginning, I found I was able to piece together the setting by myself pretty accurately. However, I didn't like that tidbits of information on characters (which are the only way to really understand the setting of the narrative) are withheld until the player uses that character's function during an enemy encounter. This sucks because there are a limited amount of encounters throughout the game. Yes, there are more than enough encounters to reveal all information, however some encounters are obviously more difficult than others, so using an unfamiliar function may not be the best choice. I personally didn't encounter any problems, but this is still limiting to players who may not find the combat as easy.And that brings me to the combat. It took me a little over an hour to get used to it and understand it, (there's a very minimal tutorial on it) but once I got the hang of things, I really enjoyed it. It's a nice blend of real-time and turn-based elements. However, the whole home area system isn't well done. I think it would have been better if you could go to the beach area (an area where you can practice the combat) at any point in time. Also, it would have been nice if you were able to look up any function whenever you wanted to see how it worked instead of waiting to find one of those access points. Otherwise, the combat itself is very fluid and unique, and proves a challenge when limiters (options that increase difficulty by say, spawning more enemies, or limiting your powers etc.) are in use.I would give Transistor a final score of 8.9/10. This is a really great game and I highly recommend everyone experience it. It has an amazing soundtrack, beautiful artwork, fun combat and a fantastic story.			"

												What a masterpiece, Bastion was very good but this was just awesome.  The narration in those two games makes for a truly magic experience, this game is like a song you cherish.  I started the game again as soon as I finished it, I never do that..!  The combination of the different attacks you can do make for a varied gameplay and the art is just as amazing as it is imaginative. Easy to grasp in every way and you can crack up the battles almost as much as you like, so it's definitely a buy. I would even buy at full price because it's such a gem for me and I like to support developers that deserve their money if we want them to make more awesome game..!			"

												You played Bastion. You loved it and can't wait to play Transistor, but hold on. This game is not what you expect it to be. That doesn't mean its a bad game by any means, but this is a completely different experience from what you are expecting. Combat is mostly turn based and the game runs on rails for the most part. The game is also not fully fleshed out. Its obvious they ran out of ideas, time or money because the game doesn't quite set up the story as well as their previous one. You get character biographies from using skills but there is nothing more. The moments you do encounter other characters are brief and you will never get the answers you want about the setting. Where does this take place? What is the process? What were the Camerata's goals? The game teases at an explanation but stops short of actually filling in the blanks. Buy this game on sale and enjoy it for the brief distraction that it is. You will probably enjoy it.			"

												This game is amazing! As expected from Supergiant Games, the soundtrack and art direction are both stellar. There are two different choices for combat: real-time combat and turn based combat. In the turn based combat you can plan out your moves and execute them at the end of the planning turn. Your moves are called functions and can be implemented as an active, upgrade, or passive. The number of combinations surpasses even Bastion which leads to lots of flexibility to match all kinds of play styles. The story and cutscenes are also great.The game is a little short, it took me about 6 hours to beat. The whole experience was worth it though. You can also recurse through the story after you beat the game and keep all of your old functions. To recurse through the story and get all of the acheivements it took me an additional 12 hours (I liked wasting time testing out function combinations).If you liked Bastion, you will love Transistor. I can't recommend this game enough. Amazing.			"

												Transistor is the second game from Supergiant Games, the creators of the critically acclaimed Bastion. It is an Action-RPG set in a futuristic sci-fi world full of dangers and mysteries. Transistor features a gorgeous hand-drawn art-style, a brilliant soundtrack and great voice-over as well as a deeply satisfying combat system. You play as Red who has been rendered mute at the beginning of the game and found herself in the possession of a mysteries sword that talks to her during the course of the game. While you uncover the secrets behind the sword and the mysteries of Cloudwalk City, you battle tons of enemies in a mixture of real-time and turn-based combat. During a combat situation you can enter a turn-based mode which enables you to give Red specific commands which she will subsequently execute upon pushing the “activate” button. This will give you the upper hand in most situations as each individual enemy type requires its own strategy. However, after executing these commands, Red will remain vulnerable for a couple seconds and if she loses her health points during this period, she will lose one of her four abilities and continue the fight with less abilities and a higher difficulty until the next checkpoint. Therefore, you have to choose wisely how to tackle each encounter. The game features an extensive upgrade system with active and passive abilities which you can combine at will in order to match you preferable play style. Furthermore, you can apply specific limiters at any time which will make the game on the one hand more difficult, but on the other hand will give you a greater experience reward. There is not much negative to be said about the game, however, some might criticize the fact that there is no equipment in the game at all. Furthermore, the story can be a bit confusing at times and while each enemy requires a specific approach, there are not that many different enemy types. However, these are tiny issues which should not keep you from playing and enjoying this great game. Thumbs up! 9/10 "

												Transistor is a top-down, turn-based adventure game that takes place in a utopian society. The gameplay is very different from Bastion; in this game, all attacks are planned beforehand during each turn. This game is beautiful to look at and holds a beautiful story within.Pros:+From the music, to the voice acting, to the writing, to the art, this game is beautifully executed. I like the gameplay, but this is definitely a game you buy for the music, story and artwork.+The romance in this game felt genuine and believable to me.+The gameplay is entertaining; different ""functions"" (attacks) can be combined in a multitude of combinations, and there are multiple ways to win each battle.+Like Bastion, there is a new game plus mode where you can restart the game at a higher difficulty and continue levelling.+For those who like the battles, there are bonus challenges, similar to Bastion.Cons:-While planning your turn, you can't pan the screen to look at far away enemies. This is a minimal problem, as you can usually see far enough anyways, and you can also simply walk where you want to see and then cancel the move.This game took me ten hours to complete, but my girlfriend completed it in four hours, which I find amazing. I think most people will take at least six if not 7-8 hours.I really loved this game. While they don't have the big budget of a AAA company, Supergiant has managed to craft something that is both more unique and more impressive than most AAA games.			"

												This is an aural and visual feast, which is no surprise coming from the makers of Bastion. What was most surprising was the elegant combat system. A psuedo turn based mechanic and an adapative weapon loadout system made combat by far the most interesting part of the game. The story lost me, I'll be damned if I could follow it. It didn't seem to matter, it's a short game (about 4-6 hours) and I was glad it ended when it did. Any more and it would have been over indulgent, the chocolate eclair of gaming.			"

												Supergiant Games has done it again.Transistor is an amazing experience in line with the developers previous game, Bastion. Story:Absolutely fantastic. You feel attached to the main character immediatly and the constant chatter of the Transistor deepens the experience to a whole new level. It isn't narrate in the vein that Bastion was, but in the fact that Transistor talks to you and makes comments as you go along. My only complaint in this section is that the game was short (about 5 hours). You'll be begging for more.Gameplay:Solid action RPG with a nice twist. The Turn() system is akin to the VATS system from Fallout where you pause time and can move and attack without much repercussion. The downside of this is if you use all of the meter, you have a cooldown where you can't attack and are vulnerable. Combat can be a little tough, as a lot of the enemies can deal some serious damage later on, so you have to be smart about your attacks.  As you level up you get to choose new skills, upgrade exsisting skills, and choose limiters. Limiters are akin to the Gods of Bastion, in which you can toggle them to increase the difficulty of the game.Music:Engrossing and enthralling. It sets such a mood in the game. Some serious talent here from the composer. Way better soundtrack than Bastion, and I thought Bastion was incredible already.Conclusion:While it is short, it is totally worth the admission price. It is a wonderful experience and I am looking forward for more games from the developers. "

												Transistor is a top-down, turn-based adventure game that takes place in a utopian society. The gameplay is very different from Bastion; in this game, all attacks are planned beforehand during each turn. This game is beautiful to look at and holds a beautiful story within.Pros:+From the music, to the voice acting, to the writing, to the art, this game is beautifully executed. I like the gameplay, but this is definitely a game you buy for the music, story and artwork.+The romance in this game felt genuine and believable to me.+The gameplay is entertaining; different ""functions"" (attacks) can be combined in a multitude of combinations, and there are multiple ways to win each battle.+Like Bastion, there is a new game plus mode where you can restart the game at a higher difficulty and continue levelling.+For those who like the battles, there are bonus challenges, similar to Bastion.Cons:-While planning your turn, you can't pan the screen to look at far away enemies. This is a minimal problem, as you can usually see far enough anyways, and you can also simply walk where you want to see and then cancel the move.This game took me ten hours to complete, but my girlfriend completed it in four hours, which I find amazing. I think most people will take at least six if not 7-8 hours.I really loved this game. While they don't have the big budget of a AAA company, Supergiant has managed to craft something that is both more unique and more impressive than most AAA games.			"

												A visually striking piece of storytelling that drives home the point that you can create a fantastic storyline even when your main character is mute.I'm honestly not sure where to start with Transistor, other than to say this is one of those games I'd recommend everyone play before they die. The story is simple to follow while being beautifully mysterious at the same time, easily warranting a second playthrough just to pick up on the things that you overlooked before. Even if you don't care for a backstory though, what's happening in the forefront is more than enough to keep you interested, all the way up to the climactic end.The main characters--Red, the Transistor, and the four Camerata--are all well-designed and, perhaps more importantly, well-developed individuals who each have a personality that will stick with you well after completing the game. They're characters with motives that seem crystal clear in the beginning, but as the story unravels, your entire perspective gets turned on it's head.Red, the protagonist, is a female singer who refuses to let anyone control her, including the player. She may be mute, but she shows that she still has a prominent voice, despite the circumstances. The Transistor, Red's companion, is a cautious, loving individual that wants nothing more than Red's safety. He wants to protect her, but he's unable to in his immobile state. The Camerata, the villains of the game, is an organization that unleashes a malicious ""virus"" on the city known as the Process, slowly wiping out the entire civilization of Cloudbank. Uncovering the true motivations behind each of these characters is an exciting and surprising part of the narrative. It's hard to gush about this game without completely spoiling my favorite parts, so I'll stop my speech there.Besides the story, there are a few final things that really sold me on this game. First of all, the art direction of Transistor is absolutely stunning. Many times while playing I found myself doubling back just to appreciate the vistas a little longer. Honestly, I wish they'd release an art book, because I'd buy that in a heartbeat. On top of that, if you're familiar at all with Supergiant or Darren Korb, then you know how incredible this game's music will be. This soundtrack, along with the one from Bastion (Supergiant's previous game), are must-buys.Finally, if all of that isn't enough to convince you, the game has Logan Cunningham. And you can never go wrong there.			"

												Transistor isn't just one of those games that you buy, play, and then forget you ever owned. It's something that sticks with you for a long time, and that I believe defines who you are as a video game consumer, for lack of an equally dignified term. A stellar soundtrack, a plot not to be taken at face value, and combat with nearly limitless potential sees to this. I probably spent over an hour in total sitting and listening to Red hum to the music. This is a soundtrack so good that often times I hesitated to proceed to the next area, fearing that the track would change. As well as all this, the voice acting is very appealing to listen to, and much of the plot is revealed through dialogue (or monologue, rather), which keeps things interesting and attatches more emotion to it all. I struggle to think of any aspect of this game that isn't simply exceptional. The art style is somewhat simplistic, but only in the best of ways, and catches the eye. The environments create a sense of a much larger and quite fascinating world that you want to explore and lose yourself in.If nothing else has effectively captured your attention, I would also like to add that I sold literally every trading card in my possession so I could buy enough Transistor cards to craft the badge all three times.Please, do yourself a favor and play this game. Experience this. You won't regret it.			"

The cyber punk noir look of it is interesting and the plot so far is nothing short of interesting and odd. Soon as i finish it ill Post a full comment.

												This game was so much fun. I'll make it short: environment is beautiful, soundtrack is superb, story is great. There really aren't any tutorials and it is not clear what is going on at first, which just makes it all the more intriguing.  The combat system is ""turn based,"" so to speak, and while that may be a turn off, chaining together combos with a variety of functions is quite enjoyable. There are about 12 hours of gameplay, and more achievements can be had via a second playthrough, however there is not much else in terms of replayability. Still, those dozen hours make for a daggone good time.			"

The game doesn't provide enough of a challenge or variation in combat situations to actually use the multiple combinations you can make to your satisfaction. Story recursion proveides some more challenge but it's  the same few enemies over and over and limiters dont help much once you get a hang of mixing functions properly. it's still a ""buy"" but on sale only.

												ProsNice graphics and music. Awesome voice acting . Nice ""artwork"" and ""feeling"" during the gameCreative and interesting skills systemFun and moderately challenging combatNice atmospere and good storyNo grindingCons Short playtimeNo multiple save slotsNo ""Sand box""No difficulty setting I would recommend the game to those who appreciate the good music and and nice graphics.The voice acting was well excuted and personally it was one of the best voice I heard in general , really soothing and deep voice. The atmospere of the game was also nice. These things made me engaged in game. However, I dont like the lenght of the game (1 story mode play would take Probably 3 - 6 hours for the most users) and sometimes I just lost where to go because basically no maps available. And too many ""discarding"" thing.What I meant the""discarding"" thing is that - basically you choose one of the things that you can get when you lev up.It can be skill A , skill B and more MEM or more skill upgrade slots something like that and you choose 1 of these choices.This is very fine and I really like the choice in the game. However , I found later that the choice is permanent and theres no ""Skill respec"" until the end , and no turning back even in ""new game+"". So basically , I missed almost half of the skills / choices and there was no way to just ""have fun"" with the skills I missed on sandbox or something . If they had one , I coudnt find it.(Edited later : I found that after after leveling up several times more, I do get the all the skills. so this is not true. No scratch from beginning option though)Speaking of skills and lev up stuff, the skill system is but quite interesting. It is really fun expermenting with these stuff. One ""element"" can be active skill and can be fuction as the passive skill and even upgrade other skills. It makes A LOT OF the skill set possible. It gives you a lot of choices, makes you think a lot , and makes you creative. And at least for the ""elements"" you have, you can change anytime you want on the check point (But no discarded elements) The combat can be played both real-time and ""turn based"" but i think the game meant to be played on turn based. But If you are real quick with the mircro and the planning stuff , I think you may be able to play on real time only. The problem about the combat thing is that there's no ""hard and easy mode"" on the game so you are stuck with the ""normal"" . Otherwise, the combat was fun and pretty nice. Slightly lack of diversity of the enemy but I would say good enough.7.5/10Overall , the game is quite memorable one , and it has some issues but most people would appreciate the game.Don't buy the game if you are looking for huge amount of playtime of the game.

												I played this game start to finish in about 4.5 hours, and when I say start to finish, I mean I literally did not get out of my chair. So that tells you two things: this is a short game, but it's also a very good one.The story is... not sparse, but there's a lot of background detail left for you to fill in, kind of like Dark Souls. Bastion was the same way, but this is even more so.The combat is enjoyable; you can go real-time, use the Turn() system to plan out all your attacks (but then be mostly unable to attack while Turn() recharges), or some mixture of both. The music is aces and I highly recommend buying the soundtrack.Overall, if you've played Bastion, this is more of the same, but that's not a bad thing at all.			"

												Transistor might just be one of my favourite games these past 10 years. I can't remember the last time a game kept me playing for 10-12 hours straight. As soon as the game started, the shivers ran down my spine. The narrator, the soundtrack, the graphics and all the questions surrounding what's going on in Cloudbank and soon the battle system - everything is just perfectly executed. The way you get answers to questions in the game is also quite interesting. You can't just rush through the game and think you'll understand what's going on in Cloudbank, you need to spend time to read about characters and the city itself on boards spread around town. It's an interesting way to indulge the player in the life of the city.You might say that I'm not one to talk about a game, ""20 hours isn't that much"", but that's how long it took me to play through the game twice and get all achievements. It's not a long game in comparison to other new titles but if Transistor was stretched out to give more hours, I feel like it would lose what makes it so amazing.Transistor is an experience that I recommend everyone to have, it'll make you feel all kinda amazing feelings.

Your enemies will evolve right alongside you, to provide you with increasing challenges; each encounter becoming a wholly unique experience with a randomized set of enemies every time you load the game.It's hard to put into words the joy that comes from planning out a magnificent Turn(), then watching Red swiftly execute it and destroy all of your enemies within seconds.This game is truly a gift to all RPG fans.

												Short but sweet. Transistor is an isometric action RPG with beautiful art design, an addictive and unique combat system with loads of customisation and an intriguing storyline that requires some actual thinking on the player's part to fully understand. It also has one of the best soundtracks I've ever heard in a video game. The whole concept would be truly unique if not for Supergiant Games' previous title Bastion, and fans of that game will no doubt feel right at home with Transistor. It is a fairly short game, taking about 7-10 hours to complete, but it's a truly enjoyable experience throughout and definitely worth the asking price. The controls are very well optimised for both kb+m and a controller. Graphical options are pretty much non-existent, but the game looks absolutely gorgeous and should run just fine even on older PC's.			"

												This game is beautiful in so many ways, each of which is reason enough to play.The music is haunting and lovely, and the singer did a fantastic job capturing the character. The cyberpunk / art nouveau aesthetic works surprisingly well, and makes each new area gorgeous and memorable. The voice acting is evocative, drawing at the heartstrings in just the right way. And the plot is elegant and compelling, with the characters making reasonable decisions, trying to fix what's been done, but each solution makes the situation worse.The gameplay is similar to its predecessor, Bastion, but it adds a turn-based-strategy angle to the fighting. So instead of running around simply wailing on stuff, this time you get to plan out your moves. The game also deals with player death in a genius way; when you die, you get respawned but with one of your fighting moves broken (but you get it back a few fights later). The way it acknowledges player death, makes it meaningful, and forces the player to try new playstyles is devious and amazing.The feeling I came away with after playing (twice, for all the cheevos) was melancholy. It's sad, but the good kind, you know? The kind of sad you feel good for having experienced.That's what this game is. An experience - and a good one at that.			"

												I can't deliver enough praise for this game, I really can't. It excels in every aspect; graphics are breathtaking and beautiful, the soundtrack is also beautiful and emotional, and the story, while vague for a good portion of the game, is so intricate, complex and interesting.The second playthrough of the game is a real treat, after starting it I was compelled to write this review as the startling beauty of the game came rushing back. The second playthrough of the game is definitely a different experience and allows you to uncover more about the vague story, piece everything together that you may have missed and feel completely satisifed and astounded. Like another reviewer has said, it's like watching Fight Club or The Usual Suspects or Memento again. The game is fairly short but it doesn't leave you angered or dissapointed it just makes you want to experience it all over again. This game just gives you a wholly unique feeling, a great mix of awe, joy, sadness, wonder... Much like the rest of the game, words can't truly describe this feeling, you'll just have to discover it for yourself.10/10, an utter delight in every way.			"

												I have a hard time explaining how deeply in love I am with this game. It's a masterpiece.(Spoiler Free)The first thing that hits you is the world, and the art, and throughout my entire thirteen hours (on my first playthrough) the environments never get stale or old. Everything is gorgeous and feels handpainted.The story and the characters are incredible and deeply engaging, but I won't say anything more than that all the voice actors involved are phenomenal.Battles are fun, fluid, and tactical. The mixture between the strategy and turn-based combat and something more real-time never gets old. Bastion this is not, Transistor is more methodical, and much slower. You're allowed to take your time to plan out what you'd like to do and put it into action. The skills and abilities system keeps the variety up. Usually I'd find my niche and stick to what I liked, but Transistor had me switching up my abilities at every single checkpoint, and not just for all of the files that I was addicted to collecting to get every single tidbit I could out of the writing.This noir wouldn't be complete without the jazzy cyberpunk soundtrack, which I could listen to forever and never get bored of. Not only is it good on it's own, but it sinks itself deep into the game and plays dynamically and reactively depending on what is happening at the moment.But, above all else, what makes Transistor a masterpiece is the atmosphere. The absolute dedication the game has to it's world and how much it sucks you in at every opportunity. Optional environments and points of interest litter every single map just to get another line or two out of the Voice. The way the music works itself in, the way enemies interact with you and all your abilities, the way the environments twist and change, the terminals you find, the files you can read, and the small interactions and character moments out of Red herself are unlike anything I have ever played before. If I were making a ""Videogames as art"" list, this would top it off.I will never forget this game.			"

												This game is amazing. The level design and graphic style play very well with the game mechanics, and the sound is superb. The sound track is excellent, and fits with the ambiance of the game extremely well. All in all, this game leaves no part behind. My only wish is that it were longer, however at about 6 hours, you will thoughouly enjoy every minute of it. The battle system is pretty well thought out, with a sort of turn/live action mix that plays really well. My one issue is the ability equip screen does not show your current loadout, and so if you forget what you have loaded, you either need to exit the menu or unequip something to see the slots.

												Okay, where do I begin...Overall, yes, I would recommend it, just because Supergiant made a unique experience with a definitive art style.That being said, the game to me is very flawed, especially when you compare it to its spiritual predecessor, Bastion:1) This game is incredibly short. You can beat it in 3 hours, if not less. There is a time and place for games as short as this (Journey, where replays are encouraged). 2) You spend half the game going through a few maps, get to a certain area, and lo and behold your final destination was JUST PAST where you started the game in the opposite direction. You spend the second half retracing your steps through a disfigured Cloudbank 3) Combat and customization are very limited. Combining your abilities in new, unique ways was actually rather satisfying, especially when you discover a new combination to trounce enemies ahead of you. Other than that, there is almost no character progression other than increasing your RAM (literally) and junctioning moves together.4) There were two voices (if you don't count Red's occasional humming), and I didn't feel an emotional connection to either of them because of how they were voiced. It was as if they took a page out of William Shatner's book of acting on pausing mid-sentence, coupled with very monotonous expressions. 5) Biggest complaint about the story though has to be how disconnected I was to all of it. I will say that the ending was well done, though. I can see the rationale behind it. 6) There was almost no tutorial to speak of. I had to figure out almost everything by myself. Any tutorial that was there was hidden behind technical lingo resembling computer code, which I suppose fits the game's style.6/10. Support your indie devs!			"

												This game is unique.The art, music, story and voice acting are all fantastic, and a lot of people talk about it a lot, so I'm going to go straight to the gameplay, because to me, that's what really makes this game stand out.The gameplay in transistor is an interesting and deep blend of strategy, tactics, and action RPG. It looks like an action RPG - one character, running around the game world in real time, trying to pull off attack combos. And you can play it like that, if you get good at the controls. But you can also stop time and program perfectly timed combos to occur.That alone sets this game apart. The balance between those two completely different mechanics - using your moves in real time, and planning out moves in a safe, stopped, environment - straddles two completely different genres, and thus two completely different play styles. Besides the real time action RPG style of gameplay, you can more or less impose a turn based style of game play - the mechanic for stopping time is even called /turn. On your /turn, you try to deal as much damage as possible to your opponents by planning out the right moves in the right order so that they don't get blocked or cancelled. Then, you can just run around the board, dodging attacks until the meter reloads and you can take your /turn again.Obviously, most of the time, you find yourself doing a bit of both. You figure out good move combinations to use in /turn, and then while turn is loading, you try to use those same combos in real time to deal more damage. Sometimes, you find yourself using Turn primarily to dodge or reposition yourself, and doing all your real damage in real time. You find the middle ground that best suits you.But the real complexity and beauty comes in the wealth of moves available. You end up learning a bunch of different moves, and the moves can be adapted to three forms - they can be moves, they can modify other moves, or they can modify your player character. You like explosions, but the explosion move is too slow for your playstyle? Slap it onto one of your faster attacks to give it an extra punch. Or, slap your fastest attack on it, to remove its drawbacks. The combinations and complexity available is staggering, and it makes the game more personal and more fun. When you discover a great synnergy between two moves, that was your discovery, and you can feel proud of it.All of this makes the death mechanic in the game hit even harder. You have a health bar in this game, but when it gets to zero, you lose one of your moves - usually the one that's been most modified, so probably your best move. If you built your playstyle around one synnergy, you effectively have one life. If you have a lot of moves, you live longer, but each hit still really hurts, as it takes away one of your tools, and probably one you designed a little yourself and are proud of. This makes the 'death' of your moves matter to you, and makes the tension of the game more real.Since you can only reinstall moves at a save point, and your ''dead' moves will be unavailable for the next new save point you find, this also changes how you use your save points. In an insane reversal of usual game logic, you might choose not to use the save point that's right in front of a hard battle or a boss, so that you can go to it after the battle, restock, and get back your main moves more quickly. All of this is to say, there isn't another game fully like Transistor. It has elements from several different genres, and playstyles or strategies that you have from those other games might apply to it. But as a whole, this game is a unique experience, and one that is unque all the way down its considerable depths.It's also a very fun, immersive, and beautiful experience, and it can be extremely challenging if that's what you want, but also extremely casual if that's not.

												Probably my favourite game of all time. Basically everything is perfect. A beautifully crafted soundtrack, innovative and fun gameplay, extremely good SFX and voice acting, and whilst I'm not usually one to care about graphics, the artstyle is just absolutely fantastic. This game is a testament to how indie games can be true masterpieces and 10x better than most regurgitated AAA game concepts. My only criticsm would be that the final section of the game is a bit too dragged out and contains way too much talking, but the final boss is absolutely worth it.10/10, no doubt.			"

												This is one of the most beautiful games I have ever played. The attention to detail is astonishing, as anyone who plays this game through the ending will find obvious. The level of immersion in this game is also incredible, with the developers having gone above and beyond to make you feel involved, with everything from the speed of the vehicle or even the weather itself; even your smallest choices seem to affect the narration, and in turn the story. There's subtle foreshadowing to the ending, which I found fitting, and wouldn't want to change even if I could. Simply everything here is perfect. And the gameplay offers so much diversity in options, that alone enhances the replayability in addition to the achievements. Play this game.			"

												It took a while for Transistor to really hook me (about 2/3 of the way through my first playthrough), but at that point I went from mildly disappointed (I really loved Supergiant's previous game, Bastion), to entirely satisfied.  I think the reason for all this is that the combat system is really quite deep, and it took a lot of experimentation before I really started understanding the potential there.  I'm playing it through a second time now and really enjoying it.Aside from the mechanics, the game is beautiful and the soundtrack is excellent.  The story is really intriguing and told in a very minimal way.   A lot of it is told through short voice clips, but if you want to learn more about what is happening, you can also get snipets of story through interacting with the environment, from experimenting with the combat system or from reading message boards :)  Even the way the soundtrack is done complements the story.  I didn't play Bastion on new game+ because I felt like I experienced the whole thing and was satisfied at the end.  I think Transistor essentially requires a second playthrough because there's so much subtle detail packed in that you are bound to miss a lot of it the first time through.  Transistor is a really excellent game, but it is especially rewarding if you are willing to put some effort in.			"

												Transistor is a top-down, turn-based adventure game that takes place in a utopian society. The gameplay is very different from Bastion; in this game, all attacks are planned beforehand during each turn. This game is beautiful to look at and holds a beautiful story within.Pros:+From the music, to the voice acting, to the writing, to the art, this game is beautifully executed. I like the gameplay, but this is definitely a game you buy for the music, story and artwork.+The romance in this game felt genuine and believable to me.+The gameplay is entertaining; different ""functions"" (attacks) can be combined in a multitude of combinations, and there are multiple ways to win each battle.+Like Bastion, there is a new game plus mode where you can restart the game at a higher difficulty and continue levelling.+For those who like the battles, there are bonus challenges, similar to Bastion.Cons:-While planning your turn, you can't pan the screen to look at far away enemies. This is a minimal problem, as you can usually see far enough anyways, and you can also simply walk where you want to see and then cancel the move.This game took me ten hours to complete, but my girlfriend completed it in four hours, which I find amazing. I think most people will take at least six if not 7-8 hours.I really loved this game. While they don't have the big budget of a AAA company, Supergiant has managed to craft something that is both more unique and more impressive than most AAA games.			"

												Roblins Review:Transistor is a surreal and beautiful Sci-fi, Cyberpunk game with a great story, and has a soundtrack that might make your ears try to jump off your head and try to get into the game.~ The Combat is innovative in the fact that you can choose to use a turn based approach or take a direct approach (Although turns are a safer and more efficient way through the game). That along with the many play style options for combat. You can choose to be a tank, or use buffs to weaken your enemies. The game has a way of making you feel very powerful without it being too easy, and if it is too easy you can use Limiters to make the game even harder.~The Story is good, but you're left to figure out most of it yourself, which is something i like, but not everyone will agree on that. You play as a popular singer named Red, and you've just barely escaped death at the hands of the Camerata. A secret-ish Society in cloudbank (the city the game takes place in.) I don't want to say too much about the story. If you want to get every last detail on the characters you can use your combat functions in different ways to gain access to personal files. I liked this feature because it pushes you to try different play styles.~The Soundtrack is Visceral and well done. Most of the songs relating to the story so there is a deep sense of drive and emotion in every note. If you're into techno or anything of that sort you should love it.~The Art in this game is self explanatory. It's just amazing. The world of Cloudbank feels deep like it was once a bustling city full of people. Plus it has the best Flat bread Delivery around. It has a very Cyber-punk feel to it. It's just great.Overall I'd say this is the best game I've played in 2014. It has decent replayability as well. Only thing i have to complain about is that it was too short, and the only reason i say that is because i wanted more!  I highly recommend it. Amazing 9/10.			"

The totally turn based/not turn based system have an incredible flow that always make you want to play more and face the next encounter, ALWAYS hungry for more.Also, it is worth to mention the soundstrack.

												Transistor is an incredible game, to say the very least. Although not very long, the music and visuals are astounding and greatly assist the development of the story. I would TOTALLY recommend investing in the soundtrack if you're able to. The weapon, the Transistor, functions in a manner totally unique to almost all other games I've played. The necessity to switch out and rearrange certain skills/abilities in order to fight certain enemies is very engaging, and results in a near infinite combination of abilities/boosters/passives. The story of transistor is the perfect balance of vague and solidified, giving you enough information to be perfectly aware of what's going on, but leaving enough to mystery that you can imagine the entire world of the game unfolding in much greater detail than is given. The characters all have unique aspects and are voiced, which I really appreciated. The mood and impact of their actions was shown through the voice acting and made it an even better experience. Overall, definitely worth the price, especially now. Grab this during summer sale and do yourself a favor!			"

												To be honest, the plot of this game isn't that great. It's very much implied and in the background, so you have to put it together while you're playing. By the end I still wasn't really sure what was actually happening plot wise in the Transistor world. Characters apart from Red and The Transistor didn't really become anything apart from plot devices, which was disappointing. But I love this game! The art is absolutely gorgeous, and the setting is very cool. It took me so long to complete it because I'd just walk around the beautiful environment.  I found the actual gameplay to be very fun, as I really enjoyed the unique combat system this game uses. By the end I'd grown very attached to the two main characters, and the ending did touch me. Also the mini games are fun challenges. And you get a robot dog!!!!! Good dog.Oh, and the soundtrack is amazing. Red has quite a beautiful voice			"

												Transistor is a game that truly asks the player to think about both their actions in combat as well as their interpretation of the narrative. The game can be also be enjoyed without this effort, but after a blind first playthrough, the game truly comes alive on the second run when the player has heightened curiosity and a desire to experiment with the depth offered by the many combinations of combat abilities available. The soundtrack is also excellent, further heightening the atmosphere and sense of presence that the game has.			"

												TL;DR: Transistor is a good game, and it will make you feel good.Transistor is a narrative-driven turn-based game that always seemed to be reminding me of the Tron universe. It's in the middle of an apocalypse, yet it has an eerie peacefulness about it. As you go about the world and destroy the monsters that are transforming the world, you can't help but take a step back and listen to the protaganist Red hum along to the background music, or look out over a pier for a few seconds and think about the history of a town you never knew. Something about this game calms you down. All of the mechanics seem to cater to a casual playstyle, although some moments can be very intense. Even the fast and reflexive combat system seems to be designed to make you breathe. You can take as much time as you want to plan out your moves, take a breather, take a break from the loud fighting music and explosions that are happening around you. It's calming.Of course, there's the narrator. The more I play games with great narrators like The Stanley Parable or Bastion (the latter of which was the same creator of Transistor). The narrator of Transistor is more personal than the two, though. It addresses the character, not the player. You are simply an observer to this story, and the narrator is unaware of your existence. This game is between Red and her love. You are granted the gift of watching. It's very touching and emotional at some points to realize that this story has to end somehow, and the few moments where the narrator leaves you feel so void and wrong. I'm not really sure what to say about the narration in this game, other than it's not really narration at all. There's just only one character with dialogue.As I said, everything in this game seems to be designed to make you feel calm and content. As evil and chaotic as some parts of this game are, all of it makes you feel reflective, nostalgiac almost. It's a good feeling. This game will make you feel good. It's a pity that I can't think of eloquent enough words to describe this game. Maybe it's because there's a woman screaming nonsense in the other room and I can't process thoughts (sorry if parts of this review don't make sense, but I honestly can't hear myself think), but I think mostly it's because when you find something that is truly beautiful, it doesn't take well to words, and although I wouldn't say this game is pure beauty and art, it is beautiful, and it is deliberate in its design. That's all I ask from a game.			"

												Great replay value, offers the oppritunity to continue from the start with abilities learned in the prior save. Similar to Bastion considering the same devs, but has a rich and individual story of its own.			"

												This is indeed a very short game, but I feel the length is actually very good - it doesn't outstay it's welcome. The story, though actually simple on the surface, has many MANY pages of lore you can find - the abilities are people too. (heh)The art style is very pleasing, the writing is really good, albeit the story is pretty heartbreaking with a rather bittersweet ending. Overall it is a good game, very unique in style, narration and attention to detail.Still it is KIND OF depressing. Mega time.			"

												This game is beautiful. The visuals are so breath taking you want to screenshot the entire game. The story line is intriguing and is build in a similar fashion to Bastion. That is, as you go along you understand more and more until things begin to click. There did seem to be a lack of tutorial however, it makes you engaged to figure out things on your own. You discover what items and abilitys do, and how you get them, each with a unique story, ultimately adding to your discovery of the story line. The gameplay is increadibly unique and fluid, with a fair amount of stratagy laid in to it. The shear number of ability combinations is stagering, with each ability having a attack, amplifier, or passive trait depending on where it is socketed.I would recommend this game, whether it is for the unique combat, amazing visuals, or intriguing story. 10/10			"

												Transistor.I honestly can't tell which one, Bastion or Transistor were more to my liking. Both have their awesome unique mechanics and stunning music.When you start the game, you don't have a main menu, instead you are put right into the game. This really took my by surprise. I think you'll understand what I mean once you launch the game.So, lets get on with it.The Plot: 10/10Just like in Bastion, you are thrown right into the game without any introduction. Just a gal with a sword-like object which apparently talks. First I had no idea what was talking to me. The further you go into the story, the more is revealed, along with the backstory of Red (the main character, the musician). Soon it appears that 4 villans, the Camerata, those who basically own the city Cloudbank. Not only that, they are mostly scientists who care for the city, but made a mistake, and... well, you'll find out.Gameplay: 9/10Bastion had a right-left-midbutton gameplay, while here you get abilities that you use. Not only that, it is also followed with Turn() feature, a planning feature that allows you to stop time and make actions like walking and using abilities for the price of Turn() potential (lets call it that). For instance, a Breach() ability (your very first ability you have access to) uses 20 Turn().Not only that, you get some introduction to different characters who these abilities belonged to. For example, Red's ability is Breach(), an ability that stuns the target and makes it more vulnerable for 1.6 secs. Another one was a racer, when you used the transistor to ""absorb"" his essence, you retrieved an ability that allows you to blink. Furthermore, you can read info on these abilities that reveal about the character.Each ability can also be used as a passive or an upgrade to a different abilities. They can be swapped at any time when you get to an access point.And of course, remember the Shrine in Bastion? Here you have so called ""Limiters"", they work exactly the same as those things in the Shrine, except they also reveal info on the ""Process"" if used.Music: 10/10I won't comment on this. No point.Visuals: 10/10Seriously, the visuals are just amazing. Some may complain tho, that they don't like cyberpunk stuff, but to me, the art in this is majestic. The lights, the sketches, everything deserves a 10 in my opinion.Duration: 7/10Sadly, its rather short, but if you play with limiters you may get a longer enjoyment from this. That's exactly what I did with Bastion. Yet Transistor is still shorter than Bastion. I really wish it either had a continuation or just a longer gameplay. That may ruin the plot however.Replayable? Yes, definitely. Its worth replaying. Unlike Bastion, you don't have to grind here to get levels (because you can't, lol).Overall:I really want to give it 10/10, but I can't. I honestly just can't. I want it to be a bit longer, I want to get more enjoyment, maybe have a reality where Process comes from, where I can destroy its core, where I can have some sort of a choice like in Half-Life at the very end, or... I don't know. I just feel the urge for this to be longer.So any way.9/10, I can't wait for Supergiant games to release a new game. Maybe soon, maybe later, maybe next year (I actually heard they are working on a new game to be released in 2017).TL;DR Transistor is awesome, has great music, gameplay mechanics and great plot. If you feel like you need a game that would allow you to relax and feel some enjoyment, then this is it. I am a Dota 2 player myself, and nothing relaxed me more than Bastion and Transistor (especially transistor, tbh). Go buy it.			"

												A beautifully crafted game with amazing visuals and a wonderfully composed music score. It is a game where you should definitely take your time playing, just taking in the scenery and appreciating the beauty of it. Just the visuals and the music were enough to fill me with a broad range of emotions and made me appreciate this game even more.The combat system is both pretty simple and complex at the same time. It's simple with the fact that it is a combination of real time and turn based combat system. You can pick one or the other. What is complex is that you have to learn the combat system by yourself as there are no tutorials to help ease you into this unique combat system. While it is fluid, I did feel as if this combat system was button-mashy, where i would plan my moves, execute the same combo over and over, and then mash buttons to dodge enemies while I wait for my planning ability to be ready again. There are limiters to make the combat in this game into a very difficult challenge, which I did enjoy.The story is powerful, and able to invoke many emotions in you. But when you think about the story critically, you find that there are many holes in the story and the story is not cohesively held together. I also felt like they kept the story extremely vague and I wish they could have fleshed out the story even more. Just get this game. The artwork and music more than justifies the price of this game.			"

												Not quite done yet, but this game stole my heart in the first 5 minutes. It's just beautiful and atmospheric and smooth and.. perfect. For me, the fights are challenging but never seem unfair (I play with a gamepad). But the story is what makes this game so much fun, especially with all the hidden stuff and small remarks here and there. I also really like that you can change your attacks pretty much all the time. Depending on how you mix the attacks you get, you get lots of new combo attacks and defense skills. You never have to live with that one skill you invested in, you can change it depending on the situation (and sometimes you probably have to). Highly recommended.			"

												Personal Evaluation: My favorite ""Za Warudo"" power fantasy since F.E.A.R., SUPERHOT, and SSBB.The Objective: This third-person game is a mix of real-time and turn-based tactical action using a move selection and modification system that allows for many different play styles.  Functions, which can function as moves, mods, or passive buffs to the player, are aqcuired in the first story run and by leveling.  Applying these requires ""memory"", which you can also eventually expand by leveling.  Functions vary in utility from mobility to buffs and debuffs to damaging attacks and have various tactical effects depending on how they are applied.Executing moves outside of Turn(), the time-stopped mode where enemies are frozen to allow you to plan out a set of attacks, can be time-consuming in comparison to the Turn()-based execution unless the appropriate mod is applied.  In Turn(), your planning potential is aided by a flexible and calculated system where you can erase your moves to select a different one and see how much damage your actions are expected to incur on the enemy (emphasis on ""expected"", as some enemies can turn or teleport from backstab attempts that amplify damage).Similar to its predecessor, Bastion, the game features isometric elements, a ""sandbox"" where you can enter challenge doors or listen to the game's soundtrack (unlocked by completing challenges), and ""recursive"" gameplay (i.e. a New Game+ mode).  Unlike its predecessor, Transistor employs a death machanic that raises stakes without immediately ending a run.  Losing your entire health bar will disable one of your active functions (and, while not disabling them too, uninstall any mods applied to it), reducing tactical options for the round.  The function is recovered after getting through an additional round of enemies once your current round is resolved, and in the meantime, you are able to equip a new function in place of what was lost.  Losing all functions in a single round, while I have not experienced it, presumably results in necessarily restarting the round.  Retrying a round is also possible from the menu screen upon pressing Esc or your controller equivalent.The Subjective: I enjoy the mix of thinking on my feet to reach my Turn() with minimal health loss and planning out insane combos of moves in time-stop.  While it didn't happen often in the main story, losing functions got me to improvise, engaging me further in strategy and tactical consideration.  It is in the New Game+ Performance challenges that this need to improvise and find ways to reach Turn() without dying is magnified, as you gradually get access to functions and memory from a significant limitation, but losing them results in their complete disappearance; I found this challenge mode in particular to be the most difficult, but also the most informative with regards to how the functions can operate together.While you may desire to stick to some basic combinations, the game's challenge modes will present you with a variety of possible movesets that will work to great effect.  For me, it was a thrill to home in on my own hand-crafted deadly set of fuctions for the really stubborn enemies, but, even if I were to lose all but one of them, I still know several other options that will fit into place once I reach an access point to apply new functions.The story is pretty damn melancholic in its overall scope.  The destruction of the city at the hands of the enemy you encounter is not unlike what you see in Bastion, except that instead of the world having fallen apart, it is being remade to an unfamiliar and uninhabitable form.  The aeshetic of the established society reminds me much of the 1920 in the US, and its collapse, perhaps not coincidentally, seems to me to reflect how that prosperous decade would end... but that's just interpretation.Parting Words: I love being mean.

												Totally stunning. Every scene in this game is a work of art and I couldn't get enough. I really dig the story and how the world itself isn't explicitly described; you just have to take all the aspects you're given and piece together your own impression of this sci-fi dreamscape. In terms of gameplay, I enjoyed the combat system. I don't often come across a game with multiple interchangable skills that really encourages me to try different combinations. Usually I find my 2 or 3 favourites and stick with them all game, but this system of losing/regaining skills gave me the extra push to experiment, and that was cool! The soundtrack is magnificent, as everyone says (I'm sure it would sound incredible on vinyl *wink nudge*). It's all the little touches that made this really special for me, like finding a peaceful, pretty spot and letting Red hum a tune.

Full disclosure:This review was written pretty much hot off the presses of finishing the game, and as such everything below is expressive of my raw impressions of the game after completion. Let that say what it will of the quality of my review.--------------------------------------------Supergiant Games has hit the ball out of the park yet again with their second game. As I've made apparent, I liked Bastion, but this game is substantially different from Bastion in many ways. So if you didn't like Bastion (I hope you at least liked the music and narration), don't let that put you off of Transistor. How is Transistor different from Bastion, you might ask? The combat is entirely different, replacing a weapon-based combat system with an ability-based system with impressive depth. As you proceed through the game, you gain new abilities either through leveling up or encountering certain points, and each of these abilities is equipped in one of four slots (1-4 are their hotkeys). However, each of these slots has one open subslot and an additional unlockable subslot, and beside the four base slots, are two slots on each side that are passive slots. As I said, very impressive depth, because each ability operates differently based on whether it's equipped primarily (in the four slots), complementarily (in one of the eight subslots), or supplementarily (in one of four passive slots). The world is likewise in its differences. You're no longer in a fantasy-esque setting in Transistor, and you don't have to worry about falling off floating platforms anymore. You're grounded, but in a world as far out there as Bastion's. It's a fascinating modern, sci-fi styled world full of mysteries to try to grapple with, not unlike Bastion. Yet, these mysteries aren't resolved like Bastion's, not laid out for you by anyone. If you want to understand Cloudbank, you're gonna have to get digging for yourself. Fortunately, you'll probably want to after exploring the place and its characters.The cast is as dynamic as Bastion's, if not more so. There's more detailed background on the much larger casting this time around, and there's more chatter occurring. This isn't to say you're frequently stopped for conversations and the like, you're definitely not, and all the background is entirely optional to look into. You can play the game ignoring the characters as much as you like, and still enjoy it as much as if you were to pay attention, much as in Supergiant's previous title.The music is as vibrant as ever in this game. It's also as vital to the atmosphere as in Bastion, and while there are equally energetic tracks in Transistor's soundtrack as in Bastion, it's of a very different styling. It's softer, of an electronic jazz vibe, compared to some of Bastion's harder, folksy tunes. If you didn't enjoy Bastion's soundtrack, don't worry, Darren Korb has outdone himself in making Transistor's soundtrack distinct from Bastion's, something you can't necessarily say for many musicians.The story is fantastic...If you don't mind a story that won't hold your hand. The plot will keep you moving forward to figure out what happened to Red, as well as who acted against her and why, but perhaps even more compelling than that is understanding the world she lives in. Every part of the story from the characters to the setting to what led up to your adventure is a mystery for you to solve, and personally, I loved that. Even after having finished the game, I have questions, and I doubt there are answers, but I like being left with room to imagine on top of their world.If you don't like that, you may not enjoy it, but there's so much more to the game than that to enjoy if you can look past your discomfort with it. The gameplay and music and art are all lovely to experience and behold.The artwork is of a different stripe than Bastion's. It's a mixture of darkness and brightness, in a bit of contrast to Bastion's primarily bright, varied color palette. Transistor has a harsher, darker color scheme, seemingly set mostly at night, but is broken up by bright lights throughout and a transition into a lighter color scheme as the game proceeds. This isn't dark grays accompanied by muddy browns as seen in other games by any stretch of the imagination, but it is something of a darker color scheme if you're coming from Bastion. Not to mention it's also in an urban setting with more futuristic and interestingly styled buildings. That also serves to differentiate the artwork drastically in its own right, having you ascending stairs along the edge of towering structures and taking elevators here and there amidst buildings serves as a different experience than Bastion would have you expecting.Conclusion: If you're looking for a unique scifi styled game with a complex cast of characters with splendid voice acting, music, gameplay,  and artwork, you can't find much better than Transistor right now. Frankly, if you have to decide between this and Watch Dogs, coming out tomorrow as of this writing, I'd say save your money and buy this. While I have nothing against Watch Dogs and intend to get it myself, I think you'll find a far more compelling experience in Transistor, in essentially every way.Thanks for reading! I hope this helped inform you of the game, and led you to pick it up. It's absolutely worth it.			"

												I feel comfortable using the phrase ""Art Game"" to describe Transistor.The holistic experience of the graphics, sound, and gameplay is superb. The almost-a-puzzle-game battle system is challenging, but the slowly unfolding storyline motivates you to keep moving forward. Play this game if you like games that push video games forward as a viable medium for artistic expression.			"

												I have a hard time explaining how deeply in love I am with this game. It's a masterpiece.(Spoiler Free)The first thing that hits you is the world, and the art, and throughout my entire thirteen hours (on my first playthrough) the environments never get stale or old. Everything is gorgeous and feels handpainted.The story and the characters are incredible and deeply engaging, but I won't say anything more than that all the voice actors involved are phenomenal.Battles are fun, fluid, and tactical. The mixture between the strategy and turn-based combat and something more real-time never gets old. Bastion this is not, Transistor is more methodical, and much slower. You're allowed to take your time to plan out what you'd like to do and put it into action. The skills and abilities system keeps the variety up. Usually I'd find my niche and stick to what I liked, but Transistor had me switching up my abilities at every single checkpoint, and not just for all of the files that I was addicted to collecting to get every single tidbit I could out of the writing.This noir wouldn't be complete without the jazzy cyberpunk soundtrack, which I could listen to forever and never get bored of. Not only is it good on it's own, but it sinks itself deep into the game and plays dynamically and reactively depending on what is happening at the moment.But, above all else, what makes Transistor a masterpiece is the atmosphere. The absolute dedication the game has to it's world and how much it sucks you in at every opportunity. Optional environments and points of interest litter every single map just to get another line or two out of the Voice. The way the music works itself in, the way enemies interact with you and all your abilities, the way the environments twist and change, the terminals you find, the files you can read, and the small interactions and character moments out of Red herself are unlike anything I have ever played before. If I were making a ""Videogames as art"" list, this would top it off.I will never forget this game.			"

												This game is amazing. The level design and graphic style play very well with the game mechanics, and the sound is superb. The sound track is excellent, and fits with the ambiance of the game extremely well. All in all, this game leaves no part behind. My only wish is that it were longer, however at about 6 hours, you will thoughouly enjoy every minute of it. The battle system is pretty well thought out, with a sort of turn/live action mix that plays really well. My one issue is the ability equip screen does not show your current loadout, and so if you forget what you have loaded, you either need to exit the menu or unequip something to see the slots. Overall, 10/10			"

												Another beautiful blend of art and storytelling by Supergiant Games.  I'm pretty much sold.  Next thing they come out with, I'm likely to buy it, blind.Similar to Bastion, you're plopped into a mythos where the assumption is that you already know how everything here works -now, quickly, come help, we've got a problem.  Again, you go careening down a gorgeous rabbit-hole with a perfect blend of real-time and strategic-planning combat.  Another brilliant example of interactive storytelling where you are placed in the plot.			"

												This game is absolutely beautiful, from the wonderful soundtrack that everyone is raving about (and for good reason), to the lighting, to the plot, it's just a wonderfully handcrafted piece of artwork.  This game proves that games are art, and highlights the importance of the subtle things in a game like the aforementioned aspects.  The combat can be both breakable and break you depending on how you react to it, there's definitely room for improvement on the combat but it's new and tried something different.  There is room to get perma-stuck if you're not careful, and your only option will be to start a new game which is frustrating.  Overall it was a wonderful experience and I would definitely recommend it at full price, like purchasing a hand crafted painting for full price, the developers of this game deserve every penny for this masterpiece.  9/10			"

Transistor, stands out with its mysterious futuristic setting, with beautiful visuals and captivating story... its gameplay is made SO well that it can be placed in the RTS category but not feel like RTS... i bought this game for $20 and it was worth every cent, especially if you want to be taken on a journey like you've never seen.

												Full disclosure: I got the game for free from the developers, as I am a fellow SF-based developer. I don't think that clouds my judgement, but you can decide for yourself.The combat is innovative and fun. It starts kind of slow, but once you start getting more and more functions and playing around with the various combinations, it becomes really satisfying. I enjoyed putting together new combos, both in upgrades and in execution order, to deal with the various enemy types. I also liked that the game takes away functions when you die once - this forced me to come up with even more new combos, which was still satisfying! I wanted to share my combos with my friends, such as my stun-cluster-dash. So cool.My only gripe with the combat is some of the enemies rely on being super-fast to get at you. This can get pretty annoying, especially when you don't have the dash function available. So, keep that dash handy.I enjoyed the story and atmosphere quite a bit, but I can understand that many would find it pretty vague and unsatisfying. It's never quite clear why things start out the way they did, and I guess some would be bothered by that. Whatever - I enjoy David Lynch movies, so I'm totally AOK with stories that are more about tone than concrete plot. And the tone is quite amazing in this game. The art, music, and dialog establish a juicy sci-fi-noir vibe that is a pleasure to indulge in.Overall, it starts out a bit slow, but it hooked me soon enough. And I can't wait to play it again in Recursion mode. I beat it once in under 4 hours, so it's a bit on the short side, but for $20 I think that's reasonable. Again, I didn't pay for the game myself, so I can't honestly say how I feel about its length. But I can say that the game doesn't drag itself out, which is important to me as a consumer.			"

												Transistor is an amazingly fantastic game. It keeps you fully engaged with a fresh, original story and unforgettable characters. It doesn't waste any time, immediately throwing you into the shoes of a young woman standing over a dead man's body. As if that wasn't disorienting enough, the sword that has been driven through the man's body starts talking. And it seems to be talking to you. You progress through one of the most beautiful worlds I have ever seen in a video game. It strays from the typical monotone, corporate indifference of most technologically futuristic worlds by imbuing every building and streetlamp with color and personailty. The intoxicating setting combined with the incredible soundtrack make for an invigorating experience. You can even take a break from fighting to allow Red, the main character, to hum along with the music.As you fight your way through the multitudes of unique enemies, you are given access to new attacks and methods of defense. But rather than just choosing your top four favorite attacks and sticking with them throughout the game, you get the opportunity to mix and match each attack to create your own original loadout. For example, you could mix a simple stun attack with a leeching effect in order to continuously deal damage to a stunned enemy, or you could use that same stun attack in combination with with an explosive effect, so that you could stun multiple enemies at a time. Your decisions will deeply effect your entire method of gameplay. But don't worry, no mixture is permanent. You can always go back and switch out certain attacks and create all new ones. If you plan on getting this game, keep your mind open. Transistor will force you to rethink your definition of a soul and what it means to be fully integrated into a society defined by technology. And remember, as you find yourself growing emotionally attached to a fictional sword, you're not alone. Though some people won't admit it, we've all been there.			"

The combat system has been completely redone, with the ability to stop time turning it into more of a turnbased fighter; upgrades are still a pretty big part but you can now mix and match them for the strongest ability you can get.

												Transistor and Bastion are probably two of the best games I've played for a long time. The amount of work the devs have placed into both of them is absolutely gigantic, creating a game that is polished from back to front. I usually have some nitpicks in every game I play, but Transistor is definitely an exception. The graphics are truly magnificent to the eye. There's detail to every little thing in every level, keeping your eyes in constant appreciation of the artwork in the game. It doesn't get boring not even in the slightest. I think if I ever did buy a soundtrack in my life, it'd be Transistor's soundtrack. The music is incredibly elegant, adding extra feeling to the visuals of the game. These two coupled with the fascinating gameplay clash together into a wonderful mix of ""this game is the best thing I've ever played"" kind of game. The gameplay keeps you on board the game nonstop, never getting you unattached. There's tons of upgrades you can get, lots of synergies with those upgrades, and a whole variety of attacks you can do. Voice acting, just like Bastion, is still at its best in Transistor. It doesn't feel cringey, doesn't feel forced, it's fluent and the remarks they make throughout the game keep you hooked up. Difficulty is a big thing in this game. It starts off simple but when you start progressing, it gradually increases and increases, up to a point where some battles do feel like a true challenge. Just like in Bastion, you can boost up the challenge with certain mechanics that stump some of your abilities, but you get rewarded with extra XP. On sale this game is at $3.99. You'll be missing a masterpiece if you don't get it at this price. Game lasts more than 12 hours and is also highly replayable. I recommend you to get this game for once.			"

												One of the most impressive visual environments I have seen in a game. The combat mechanics are deep and have just enough challenge to require a few retries. The story is cryptic and melancholy, forcing you to work out what happened gradually as the game progresses. And... for a working bloke such as myself, it is mercifully short, at just around 5-6 hours.			"

												Bastion was a massive success for Super Giant Games. Most people have played it and numerous gamers own it on at least two different machines. With that in mind it would have been easy for the studio to release a sequel or spiritual successor to it. We’d all have played it, loved it, and raved about it. Transistor is not like Bastion.Starting in a beautifully depicted futuristic city scape you pull an electronic sword from a body and you’re on your way. No explanation is given and no background about the world or yourself is forthcoming. The player, like the character you control is thrown in, as if awakening from some strange dream and this gives a wonderful sense of mystery and discovery as you progress.From the outside this may look to share some similarities with Bastion. The perspective is the same and there is also a narrator of sorts, although he is talking to the female protagonist as you go. Right at the start you begin to think this is going to be another hack and slash but then about five minutes in it asks you to hit the freeze button and everything changes.Here, you suddenly realise you are actually in a real time/turn based cross over style RPG. You can execute attacks in real time (and even boost them to activate almost instantly), but the real trick is mastering the freeze system. Hitting the button stops everything and you then have an action bar you can use up before the enemy moves again. It’s kind of like the V.A.T.S system in Fallout 3 or the system at work in Vagrant Story.During this time you can move around and stack up attacks. Pressing the button again sends you into action like a blur across the screen. The downside is that you then can’t use any attacks or special moves until the bar has regenerated in full. The more attacks you use, the longer the bar takes to recharge. This means you have to be extremely careful about what you are doing as you are often slower than the enemy robots sent to stop you. It’s essential to get in, attack and get back out to a place you can safely recharge as avoiding damage otherwise is almost impossible and you’ll be downed in no time.If your health bar depletes while you have charge time you’ll get a chance to move away from danger. If not, one of your powers will be damaged and unusable until you make it to two save points. This severely limits your attacking options and often leads to a daisy chain effect of you losing all your powers and flat lining. On the off chance you are finding things too easy you can also add a number of handicaps as you go which increase difficulty and the amount of experience you gain.The options you have to play around with are numerous and can be set up in a ton of different ways. This is one of Transistors strengths but we can see it easily overwhelming some players. When you gain a power you can do one of three things with it. Equipping it in an active slot will allow the player to use it via a button press. This could be a long range attack, a fast dodge, an area effect attack or something like summoning a creature to assist you. All attacks have different speeds in real time combat and few of them work fast enough to run through the game hacking away without the freeze system. Each active power can also be boosted by equipping powers as support. For instance, you could take the bouncing bomb power and add it to your long range attack, thus making the attack ricochet off enemies and into others.  You can add two boosters to each active attack which opens up all sorts of crazy possibilities. Finally, you can add powers to your passive support slots. This means they normally do things like boost player speed or increase resistance. Any power can be assigned to any slot on any other power so finding the perfect combination will require some thought and the possibilities are just about endless. The only limit on what you can do is that each power takes up a certain number of points and once that hits maximum nothing else can be equipped.While you are getting used to the combat you’ll be experiencing some absolutely beautiful visuals. The Neo Noir tone of the game is offset by stunning, neon tinged environments full of small details and snippets of information about the world you’re exploring. It reminded us of an isometric Deus Ex or the SNES version of Shadowrun if the rundown world had been replaced with some kind of semi-utopian society. There are also a few pretty big nods to Final fantasy VII in there as well. It’s gorgeous and the musical score and sound effects also help to build a picture of a once perfect, now lonely world where something seems to have gone wrong very quickly.Overall, Transistor is a triumph of both style and design. It takes some getting used to and you’ll need a PC running comfortably above the minimum specs to get a smooth experience but Super Giant Games have tried something a little different here and it works. There’s the odd pacing issue and players will need to spend some time getting used to how the combat works but it’s a rich and rewarding experience and something that you’ll likely return to long in the future.Overall 9/10			"

OverviewTransistor is, the best way I can put it, an isometric, linear brawler with a heavy emphasis on story. It's much in the vein of Bastion, and, considering that the same company made Bastion, this is easy to see. One can skip this entire review by just realizing that if you enjoyed Bastion you would enjoy this; the narrator from Bastion even voices the Transistor.In the story, you play as Red, a well-known singer in the city of Cloudbank. You use a weapon, aptly named the Transistor, as the method of combat. The city is being overrun by a strange, robotic-seeming organism called the Process that overtake whatever they touch. In search of answers, the now-mute Red goes back into the city to search for answers (sound familiar?).The game is fought in real-time but also utilizes a unique combat system called Turn(). Essentially, time freezes and you have an opportunity to plan your moves. Every action you take reduces your opportunity to do additional attacks in Turn(), and when you execute it, you cannot attack (except if certain moves are upgraded) while it recharges.Around Cloudbank are two things: access stations and terminals. Terminals are optional and for additional insight into story, and access stations can be used to upgrade the Transistor and modify it. You have a set amount of ""memory"", and each different move takes up a certain amount. You can upgrade moves using other moves to give it different abilities, like area-of-affect or a temporary switch-sides mechanic. Finally, you can have passive effects. You start with 16 memory and can increase it as time goes on.But this review is getting lengthy, so I'll just cut it down a bit.ProsSimilar to Bastion, which is one of my favorite games of all timeSatisfying combatCaptivating storyEngrossing world that feels realConsCombat is limited by memoryGame is very short; only took four hours to finish on my first sitting (this is somewhat put off by the fact that I did no challenges)Gameplay does not match up to the standard that Bastion set (Transistor is considered Bastion's spiritual successor)No weapon variety; only the Transistor is usedUI can be hard to figure outEnemy mechanics must be learned, as they are not explained wellInconsistent difficulty; hard in some places, easy in othersDisappointing ending; though sentimental, it was lacking and felt rushedA bit too similar to Bastion; generic-named mute protagonist, same narrator, same style, and though it imitates Bastion it doesn't do so very wellSomewhat confusing story; in order to even understand it, I had to look up an external guideFinal VerdictTransistor is an okay game. Not as good as Bastion, but a good game. However, at $20, it simply isn't worth the price. If you want to buy Transistor, wait until it's on sale.I rate Transistor 6/10.			"

												Most people say that you need around 6 hours to beat this once.If you explore every bit and wait for every dialogue, play around with the different functions, crank up the difficulty to max whenever possible and only have reasonable luck with the random based challenges 8-10h is more appropriate (listening to the awesome music included).So with actually playing the game it's 10 hours worth of amazing content for the first playthrough. And the second seems to offer some more things to keep you entertained.I didn't find anything that this game does not do really good except for some user interface issues (mostly when installing functions, though you can drag&drop and stuff, it's just a bit strange when you change a whole lot).---------Please be aware though, there is one minor design flaw. In fact this may wipe your progress if you are not careful so please read on IF you want to play on maxed difficulty and change around your playstyle a lot:After reaching the top of the tower DO NOT LEAVE unless you have a foolproof ability kit or turned off all/some limiters. The game saves after a cut-scene and you will have to fight a high tier dog and some minions. YOU DO NOT GET THE OPTION TO CHANGE YOUR BUILD EVEN IF YOU LOAD. You can pretty much always beat anything before even with a sub-par build and a few deaths but this encounter can be devastating with the wrong build. It took me several minutes of optimizing a test build that was not working as intended.---------Probably the only game where I used Tab for other things than minimizing the window. And I used it a lot. Definitely the only game where I didn't do anything else except holding the Tab key at times...Buy this if you have a working Tab key. If not, wait for a discount. Or don't, because it's incredible. Seriously, the only problem people are having with this game is that it is too short. Great games are always too short, or we wouldn't play the bad games anyway...Edit: 2nd playthroughThe design flaw as explained above is here more apparent and it happens more often, though you should have a good setup at this point anyway. being able to have multiples of the same function also makes stuff very interesting. Most encounters are very easy (with the correct kit) but some encounters seem to be randomized so you can have pretty challenging fights, even though I nearly instantly killed anything, I still only had about 20-30% life after most fights. The challenge rooms you get access to are okay (fighting against a last boss kind of type is forgettable though), the randomized fights can be a nightmare and the repeating ""only fighting against an increasing number of men"" is dumb and very unfair with the wrong abilities. This changes in the later rooms though and I had some pretty fun times going through the last 16 waves, losing my good abilities right at the start and only reaching my standard setup right at the last wave. So far a recursion seems unnecessary, the real meat (plot, style, music) is already inside your bellies, so the only thing left is to play around with the game mechanics. Those are excellent but you should know when to stop before you ruin your experience. See that mode as optional and not as required and you will be fine :)			"

												I rarely write reviews, but I just have to say that Transistor earns a spot on my Shelf of Favorites. If I had one.Transistor is a quite original game with a unique style, which you won't be forgetting after you've played through. Because of its haunting sound design and soundtracks, which compliments really well with the artwork and its mood-guiding colour palette, these together you get a really beautiful and a very atmospherical game you'll find yourself immersed in (Headphones recommended). The voice acting is especially a huge plus.The game doesn't reveal much, but enough to keep you curious and interested to learn more as you play. This is all in an isometric view and is nicely detailed, you'll want to run around and explore a little. The fighting is fun, if you like strategy and weapon function combining, which is creative and you get to decide how you want to use them.I actually don't want to reveal anything more about the plot of the game than what has already been shown and told in the gametrailer, you'll have to experience it and find out for yourself.  I myself, have been wondering about getting the game for a while after I saw the trailer. I was hesitant at first because I was afraid of being let down and disappointed, though I purchased it on Christmas sale later. I now treasure this game and it's worth the price, on sale or not.-- The city's most influential voices disappear one by one. You play as Red, the protagonist, who survived after a failed attack and now have to find out the answer to what is going on and why you got attacked. --Pros:+ Beautiful artwork+ Eye-pleasing design+ Great soundtracks+ Nice sound design and effect+ Great voice acting+ Interesting story developing as you play through+ Fun strategic gameplay+ DetailsCons:- Short			"

												I don't review many games, but Transistor, much like SuperGiant's previous title, Bastion, exceeded my expectations on all fronts.This game is a tremendously soulful piece of work, and from the very start to the very end, is first and foremost a work of art. The music, narration, artistic style and presentation flow together in a way that I would probably say outclasses almost any other game i've played. Anyone with a quibble of curiousity and a penchant for great games, or even works of art, should immediately purchase Transistor (AND Bastion) and enjoy the ride.To touch on the gameplay itself, the combat is inventive and blends several previously done elements (pseudo-turn based combat, action queues, tactical-execution-based combat) into a pretty seamless and enjoyable experience. It is two parts arcade, one part strategic pause-and-think game. It remains fresh and has a lot of room for player creativity due to the openly configurable nature of abilities acquired throughout the game.What follows are some brief pros/cons:Pros:+Incredible Art. From music to artwork, this entire game is a masterpiece.+Gameplay. The combat remains fresh, enjoyable, and creative all the way through.+Difficulty.  Like bastion, difficulty is born of modifiers you can apply to enemies, which give you bonuses for being brave.+Storyline.  Again, this is a work of art and the storyline is rich, heartfelt, and incredibly immersive.+Soundtrack.  Incredible, as usual.Cons:-Length.   The game itself isn't that long, although there are excuses to re-play the game with new conditions and toy around with the combat some more.That's really all I can see anyone really griping about with this game.In total, I'd give Transistor a 9.5/10, as one of the most absolutely awesome pieces of work i've seen in terms of gaming. It isn't a triple-A 40 hour experience... but it's an incredibly rich, artistic romp through an engaging and incredibly envisioned city of Cloudbank.9.5/10-Colt			"

Gracefully narrated story with beautiful level-desing, manifold and various combat style, perfect artworks and magnificent soundtrack. I like idea of planning turns instead of simple hack-and-slash mechanics. Tragic plot about silent lady and incorporeal man in dying futuristic city made me drown in thoughts and tears. Behind the game there is a lot of difficult questions of love and public benefit and innovations and self-sacrifice and not-so-far-future to think about.

												Interesting story/setting.  Combat plays more like a puzzle, with the puzzle being as hard as you decide to make it using optional settings (limiters) you gain through the game.  Single playthrough took me 8 hours, but you get the option for a NG+ that also changes the dialogue you experience the second time through; which gives another perspective on the narrative.  As expected from Supergiant, the art and soundtrack are excellent.  The game at times can feel like walking through the work of Gustav Klimt.  The soundtrack is a largely ambient set of aucoutic guitars and subtle electronic puncutated by vocal hums.  The game also features a couple full tracks with lovely lyrics.The negatives for me were related to the amount of menu activity.  Pieces of backstory and character information are hidden in skills you use, and using the skills in different ways unlocks more of that information.  In order to change how your skills are arranged (to use them differently), you have to visit a menu and shuffle things around between most combat sequences.  It's not a big deal, but slows down the feel of progression and the pace of your play.  It feels tedius.  Granted, you could skip the unlocking of this information and stick to a skill arrangement your comfortable with.  Additionally, some skill arrangements work better for some fights than others, and you don't have any way to predict what the next fight will be, so you usually have to fail the combat sequence to go readjust for the fight.When you're out of the menu's and fighting, you do appreciate the maleability of the skills.  Using any single skill as either an active, augmenting, or passive ability and over a dozen skills, you can create what feels like an endlessly diverse series of offensive arrangments.  Really cool.Overall, a very positive experience.  Definitely worth the $19.99 price tag on release.			"

												Transistor is a big and yet a small step from Bastion.There are certain things, which remain similar to it, but for the most part it's completely different.The themed music and fitting art style  is definitely the most similar to Bastion as they were done by the same people.So are the Function Upgradesystem in Transistor and the Item Upgradesystem in Bastion very similar, as both offer a lot of possibilities.There are also modifications to yourself or the enemies in Transistor, very similar to the Gods.But this is also where the similarities in those two games end, which is what most people don't see.Bastion is a Hack and Slash game, there much easier to jump in.Transistor is a ""semi turn-based"" RPG and I am putting it into qoutations for the simple reason, that Transistor needs to be played as a turn-based game AND a realtime game and even though it tries this very weird idea for gameplay, it works beautifully, once you fully grasped the idea of what you need to do.Transistor is not a game which will guide you at your hand. It very much wants you to learn almost everything on your own. It only tells you how to fight, how to use Turn(), how to upgrade and how to use limiters. So how a Upgrade actually affects a Function is for you to find out yourself.For example, once you use a Function during Turn(), it won't be active during the realtime section unless you have a certain upgrade on it, aside from a few certain functions. If you don't have any active Functions for the recharge phase of Turn(), you're not going to be able to do much and have to run away. If you only have active functions during your recharge phase, you can fight more, but you won't do a lot of damage. The goal is finding the sweet spot between those two, which the game itself provides more than enough practice for in the challenges.The overall story of the game is confusing, if you don't go and actively search for every little bit of extra information or fully unlock all bios, but if you do, you'll see how it all fits together. It's sadly only 5 hours long, if you do all that with a few limiters on and you won't get a full gameover either, at least I didn't experience one. Though I myself aren't to sure wether what I saw at the end of the game actually is the ending of the game, since it wants you to do a second playthrough.So to sum it up:Music: 5/5Art: 4/5, because pure white screens are annoying.Gameplay: 4/5, because it requires a lot of getting used to and experimention with abilities.Story: 3.5/5, because it makes sense, but only when you spend to time to unlock almost everything.Bastion vs Transistor: It's not comparable, since they are already gernes wise completely different games. So, people, please stop comparing these games. They, of course, do not play the same.			"

												This game manages to both feel like a work of art and an exciting, interesting action RPG at the same time.  Gameplay is highly customizable with several powers and power combinations to choose from.  There's both a strategy and a real-time element to combat, which works well with the game as a whole.The soundtrack is in a class of it's own. AMAZING doesn't even begin to describe it; in my opinion, it is better than Bastion's, which is saying a lot. Literally my only complaint about this game is that it feels too short, even assuming multiple playthroughs.The bottom line for me is this: if you like video games and have even an iota of appreciation of them as an art form, you should own this game!

												Bastion is an easy and accurate point of comparison for Transistor; if you like one, you'll probably like the other. But the gameplay here is a lot deeper and richer, so it's worth a look even if you didn't care for Supergiant's previous effort.Similar to Bastion, the story is simple but beautifully presented. The futuristic/maybe-computerized city of Cloudbank is a visually lush setting for monster bashing, and the snippets you find and decipher throughout the game paint a unique portrait of the city's history and the villain's motivations. It's easy to get drawn in, even if, from a player's perspective, you're just running around murdering everything in your path.It probably helps that your rampaging is so enjoyable. Combat is real-time, but you can periodically freeze time to cue up a string of commands as if it were turn-based. That combined with the incredibly flexible system of combining your power-ups into increasingly elaborate attacks opens up a tremendous number of options, both on-the-fly and in terms of your overall playstyle. Want to kite around and chip away at range? You can spec for that. Want to play fully real-time as a bruiser? Sure. Want to mind control everyone into killing each other? Go for it. Run around unleashing monster turn-based combos whenever you can? Yessir.If anything, the biggest problem is that the mechanics are SO flexible that it gets daunting. Thankfully, there are a handful of mechanics that guide you towards new combinations (avoiding the Diablo 3 ""here is a new option that you have no reason to care about"" issue) and, like Bastion, the game's difficulty is rather forgiving but has options for you to increase it on the fly.But bottom line, this is beautiful, enjoyable, and distinct experience that doesn't overstay its welcome. Highly recommended.			"

												Honestly... I was expecting some game like a Bastion. And Transistor is like a Bastion... a very good game with interesting original story and excellent soundtrack; just press TAB in a game and haroine will start a humm : ) to the music!...and I can't forgot, this game have REALLY AWESOME fight system. Partly real-time, partly turn-based.Simply, You stop the time. Plan your moves, attacks, evasions, corruption of enemies, etc.Then You press a space and your turn is executed within a second. But... after that You have to wait for your turn again (but in the real time). It is like you combined chess, when your opponent have turn after You, but you can still move too.+ it is really good that every skill which You've found can have three functions:Main skill, support skill, passive skill = and its only up to You how you will mix themSo don't wait and try this game. It is really good!			"

												The system for combining and modifying attacks really makes this game special. By allowing the player to respec at every checkpoint, the game allows the player to experiment with this system, which is complex and nuanced enough to give satisfying rewards to experimentation. The best combination I've found so far is void() with purge() and crash() as an opening attack. Limiting the total slots available for attacks forces tradeoffs and compromises that make the process of building and rebuilding Red's skill set continually interesting.I've finished one playthrough in about 6 hours completing a fair number of the optional test levels. I'm looking forward to playing a new game with more skills unlocked to allow for more experimentation.The story is mysterious, but enough hints are provided to make it intriguing. The relationship between Red and the Transistor really carries the game, although it doesn't immediately develop.The ability to pause time is a nice inclusion because it allows for a slower, strategic playstyle. I used it for nearly every encounter. Waiting for the cooldown is a drag, but the game thoughtfully allows the player to make tradeoffs to mitigate the cooldown.Lastly, the music and art style are beautifully atmospheric, and I found the voice work solid.

												This game was an incredible experience. It played naturally, had just the right amount of challenge, and tells a beautiful and dark story in a beautiful and dark way. Its major flaw is simply being too short. It feels like 2 acts of a 3-act game. It was really not until the credits rolled up the screen that I realized that there was no third act, that the boss was indeed the final one, and that there was nothing left to be done.Why they made this decision, I do not know. This game could have been even more - gone even more deeply into a story more compelling than almost any other. But it was cut short, and that is tragic to see.9/10			"

My mind is constantly wandering, thinking about mundane adult things and It's hard for a game to hook me in like they used to when I as younger.This game hooked me within the first 5 minutes. The story is amazing; it's not laid out for you page, by page. A lot of it requires inference, and that inference comes from playing the game. It makes you want to explore. It makes you want to learn more. It makes you play, over all.The art style is great. It fits perfectly with the theme of the game, and the music is simply stunning.Seriously, just buy this game. It's pretty short, only took me a few hours to complete, but well worth your money. Buy it with the soundtrack. Give the devs some money. THEY DESERVE IT!			"

												""Hello, world!""Supergiant did it again. Transistor is even more polished than Bastion, the other famous action RPG from Supergiant Games. The plot and Cloudbank's universe are incredibly rich and detailed, such as the whole art of the game. However, stunning visuals would be nothing without the top-notch soundtrack and voice acting present in Transistor. Everything is blooming with creativity. It's an open-minded game filled with complex and diverse characters, including the fierce and strong female lead. Gameplay is easy to learn and hard to master and the game provides all kinds of challenge so we can get there. The Turn() system adds strategy to the table and makes you really put your brain to work during battles. Transistor is a really unique game that everyone should check out as soon as possible.

												If ever you come across that common question of whether video games truly belong in the world of high art, along with the likes of time-immune paintings, masterpiece films and all-time hit singles, you only need to answer it with Transistor.To say that Transistor is a work of art is no exaggeration. The beautifully painted art style reminiscent of Supergiant Games' brilliant favourite, Bastion, go hand in hand with the lovely soundtrack by Darren Korb. Ashley Barrett lends her vocals to most of the soundtrack as the protagonist, Red's, singing voice while the gravelly voiced Logan Cunningham returns as Red's companion, a man stuck in a sword. Their story is one of hardship, as they fight a system off in the hopes of getting what was stolen from them back. This good story backs its visuals and audio to make it an attractive package.The drawback that most see in dedicating a game as art is the common mistake of letting the gameplay slide into abandon. Thankfully, Supergiant Games made sure that the game's mechanics is deep and enjoyful. The combat system is incredibly customizable and allows for versility. I was eager to try out as many combinations as possible to find one that suited my playstyle and I eventually found my favourite life-stealing spamming long shot laser that exploded upon contact. There is an alright amount of enemy variety, especially since enemies gain abilities as you progress through the story.In short, Transistor is not only brilliant to look at or listen to, its fun to play and has a story worth following. Sounds like the perfect package, right? Now, some have complained that the game is really short and not worth the full retail price. My first playthrough lasted 9 hours, since I took my time to explore both the wonderful science fiction world and the expansive combat options. One should know that the game comes with a New Game + option, known as Recursion where you retain your levels and combat options as you play through the story again. In this mode, the enemies are leveled according to yours to make this second playthrough a tough one. While this NG+ option is there to add to the game's worth, not many would want to play through a second round.I've been playing this for 15 hours so far and am halfway through my second playthrough, loving it all the same the second time. To me, this is a work of art, one I'll be recommending to many.			"

												When a friend asked me what Transistor was like, I said it was like Bastion, but moreso.  Initially, I wasn't so certain as to whether or not this was fair to Supergiant's second game, but the more I thought about it and the more I played, the harder the patterns were to ignore, to the extent that it may even be called a design aesthetic.  To cover the traits shared by both...*  A stylized, eye-catching isometric world (Transistor specifically is Klimt and Mucha taking on cyberpunk)*  A well-promoted, atmospheric soundtrack with solid vocals*  A central hub to refine combat talents, listen to music, reminisce*  A somewhat unique combat system that heavily involves customization of weapons*  A means of tweaking difficulty by changing enemy behavior and PC limitations*  A plot that is concerned with the excesses of technology*  A bit of a political agenda (Bastion is about colonialism, Transistor, about individuality, dystopia, and the banality of a world that tries to please everyone by consensus)*  A thought-out, built up world supporting the story*  A strong, nearly intrusive narration*  A silent protagonist trudging through a landscapeWhere they share influences, they also share flaws.  Weapon customization isn't easily tailored to enemy groups (it's randomized in New Game+, it can't be) and some combos are game breakers.  My favorite setup, which was like tazing someone into quicksand and then golfing a live grenade into their gut, was to spam Void(Get + Purge), then Load() + Breach(Crash + Ping, aligned with both packet and enemy).  If I didn't get one-hit kills, it was only because I misaligned, and nothing late in the game was dangerous enough to get me to tweak my methods.The same combat system is just barely interesting and fun enough to sustain itself, considering how heavily the game relies on it.  The puzzle aspect of using Turn() seems particularly underutilized, since you only use it once perhaps ten minutes into the game and never again.  Even something as mundane as flipping off a few switches using Breach() or rapidly navigating around using Jaunt() or (let's not get too ambitious) a stealth sequence revolving around use of Mask() might add some dynamism to gameplay that is otherwise combat-dependent.The world is well-thought out and also empty.  The city or the immediate location is gestured to in context of a larger world, but the current environment is made to be the only relevant thing and the current environment only very rarely has NPCs to interact with.  Owing to the silent protag/narrator combo, this means that your interactions with the world are limited to the passive storytelling that is the narrator's exposition or your reading of a third-hand account.  Sybil, as the easiest example among the NPCs, has a duality and is complex because we are told that she has a duality and is complex.  We never see her as the cheery social butterfly, we just see her, briefly, as covetous to the point of violence.  In spite of this emphasis on telling over showing, certain details are poorly telegraphed by both games.  In the instance of Transistor, The Process can apparently turn people into The Process, at least once, but no one is surprised or confused by this when it happens.  It is taken as not worth mentioning.To Transistor's credit, it has resolved the matter of not initially having antagonists.  Transistor does have antagonists.  Sort of.  You know who they are at the beginning and you pursue them and fight them, though the reasons why are ultimately confused or dissatisfying in their results, much like they were in Bastion.  One can have dissatisfaction in storytelling, and I often love movies and TV series that end on bummer notes, but when you're controlling a character, pushing them against various odds to do the thing that their world needs them to do, stories that feel incomplete or under-resolved stand out more.  Adding to this, the New Game+ has less going for it now than it did in Bastion.  At least in Bastion, you could choose among ending options.  New Game+ in Transistor offers three things: the ability to continue leveling and get duplicate functions, slightly more populated combat settings (none difficult enough to turn off any of the limiters), and slight change in atmosphere as signaled by different posters and one altered bit of dialogue.  That's all.  Oh and you get your achievement.  Lovely.To summarize, Supergiant makes a particular game.  It's arty and appealing to the senses and has controls that establish a baseline level of enjoyment, but there's too much devoted to getting the baddies and since they aren't good at developing a plot or characters, corners are cut and they settle for an experience where they tell you most of what's going on.  In my opinion, a lot of effort that went into conceptually creating a distinctive world ends up going to waste because they're awful at storytelling.  But it's a reliable and somewhat unique type of game and gaming experience, and if you're into that, then Transistor could be a game for you, so long as you only play it the once.  It feels like an improvement on the Bastion model, but its strengths and shortcomings also feel more extreme in part due to fatigue resulting from being the same type of game.B-?			"

												From the same people that brought you Bastion (which you should have played at least twice by now) comes Transistor. Beautiful music, gorgeous art, solid gameplay, incredibly deep story, and the outstanding voice acting that they've become known for makes Transistor another proud feather in Supergiant's hat.			"

												I think the Noire flavor and the intentionally opaque plot are a compliment to combat well refined. They took the standard of Bastion and elevated it to the next level, allowing freedom to compose your own style of battle. Along with the limited Turn Based mode to plan out an attack? It combines with the gorgeous art for a FUN game.And really, it is.			"

												""The river always finds the sea""Supergiant games they guys who made the beautful Bastion, are at it again. While Bastion had okay combat Transistor knocks it out of the ball park with some really cool yet different style of combat. You really don't see the combat in Transistor in any of game. The soundtrack of Transistor is just as good as Bastion. The only thing is it is very short. Only about 6-8 hours of gameplay which is shorter then Bastion. And as for the story, without any spoilers, it made me cry. The ending was simply beautiful. In the dark world that became of Cloundbank (the city in Transistor) the ending made you feel warm, happy and then you cried. Better then Bastion? The more I think about it the more I think it is. Both games are amazing and you should buy them both. Now I'm not a guy that works for video game review companys but I think this deserves a very high rating everywhere. So good.9.6/10			"

												I loved Bastion and I love this game even more.The narrative style is different but still present. The sound track is just as excellent as Bastion's if not more so. The art style is different but just as good. Everything you liked about Bastion is there and just as good, but different.Except the combat. The actual combat itself is brilliant and rewarding, with thousands of possible ability permutations and lacking the feeling that any one combination beats out the others. All the abilities are useful, all of them fun, and all of them let you tackle each fight in a variety of interesting ways.Some people have complained about the combat in this game, but their complaints are quite bluntly bewildering to me. While it does get increasingly challenging, and dying can be frustrating, I never had to redo any one fight more than twice, and the game autosaves often. I have not enjoyed a game this much in a very long time. It is exciting to even talk about. This is Game of the Year - or at the very least the Indie Game of the Year. For $20 you get around 9 hours of singleplayer content that is brilliantly designed, written, and narrated.For $10 you get a soundtrack that is around 1 hour, 9 minutes of excellent videogame soundtrack.In my opinion you do yourself a disservice not purchasing this game.

Setting:You play as Red, a singer who lives in the art deco cyberpunk city of Cloudbank.Cloudbank is an apparent democratic utopia where the citizenry vote on everything. 'Everything' including things such as the weather, the colour of the sky and the daily layout of the city. Here is a city which is almost certainly a step sideways from our reality and into the virtual, much like The Matrix movie or the TV series Reboot. There are 'back doors', loopholes and hacks much like one might find in software. The game locations are named after coding terms, and the names of your abilities and the ubiquitous Process, your primary antagonist throughout the game are reminiscent of faulty or malicious programming. Then of course there's the name of the city itself: Cloudbank being reminiscent of something ephemeral and unreal, a distributed network of servers which may be real or virtual. The game opens with Red having survived an assassination attempt by four individuals who call themselves the Camerata, and her voice has been stolen.Red is kneeling next to a man impaled by The Transistor, the weapon that they attempted to kill her with, a blade reminiscent of a circuit board. The blade hums to life at her touch, and her not-exactly-deceased friend speaks to her from it. He’s character, narrator, and your only weapon of choice. However his memory is corrupted and with Red unable to speak the nature of their relationship is built up gradually over the course of the game. Red takes the Transistor and sets out looking for answers and vengeance against the Camerata as a mysterious force known as 'The Process' seeks to stop her and corrupt and unravel reality.Visual Aesthetic:Visually this game is a joy to behold, with a rich colour palette in a semi painterly style with an isometric viewpoint and a glorious attention to detail. Transistor is a digital world, a cyberpunk art deco utopia in collapse with a plot of vengeance running through it. This is like playing through painting, one that turns from contemplative and sombre to dynamic and sharp with the neon bright light show that combat brings to the fore. Holographic effects and stylised programming glitches also help sell the virtual reality you romp through. Music:The music and sound infuse a soul into Transistor which goes beyond a beautiful score. Much of the music is that of Red’s and, word of advice, pay close attention to the lyrics as they are more integral to the storyline than it may appear. This is especially true at pivotal moments where a track may ‘corrupt’ and alter, providing insight and subtext to a situation, or foreshadow coming events. Gameplay:As an ARPG, combat takes the lion’s share of gameplay as Red cuts a swath through the Process in her hunt for members of the Camerata.Each ability gained can be used 3 ways with the Transistor: an active attack, a modifier for active attacks or a passive ability that augments Red. You slowly gain information about the world by using abilities in each of these ways, giving you a new incentive to change up your build. This information helps paint a vibrant and culturally rich world – a fusion of 1920s art deco and democratic utopian cyberpunk gone wrong.The twist, is that Red is able to pause the flow of time and modify the world through abilities. Red can even later acquire super user access with glorious results. During ‘Turn time’, Red can queue up actions (movements, attacks and other abilities) with action points and then unleash them rapid-fire on your enemies.Movement is important in both modes of combat, so turns and real time are one part positioning, one part offense, and one part “NONONONO RUN RUN RUN.” One could sit still, but efficient movement and punching through the abstract high tech nightmare programming of the Process with planned out status effects and backstabbing will give you a significant upper hand. One could also play solely through real time, but you would miss out on the glorious satisfaction of watching Red execute your plan (and multiple unlucky foes) in a bullet time moment of neon samurai fury.Gameplay death is also handled in an interesting way. When your health bar drops to zero (and it will) you won’t die, rather an active ability will get burned out of the Transistor for a few checkpoints. Only once all active abilities are burned out do you start again from the last checkpoint. This temporary loss of an ability forces you to experiment and find new strategies and this helps keep the gameplay from stagnating. The combat is broken up with contemplative treks through this apparent utopia in collapse (apparent as even before the impending process wrought apocalypse there are indications that prejudice, inequality and a lack of personal agency were more present than Cloudbank’s citizenry would care to admit).  Here, the interactions between Transistor and Red really shine. Narrative:The relationship between Transistor and Red is the core of the game’s story and how they communicate is really what makes it – how Red expresses herself despite being mute is especially compelling. Body language involving the sword, clever use of message board terminals, split-second decisions she makes. Red is a complex, interesting character whose personality is drawn in assured and precise strokes. Quiet moments and sudden decisive actions reverberate with equal strength and land home with an intimate touch and the force of a sledge hammer respectively. She may have been a singer, but her response to tragedy is what outlines who she is. She is action and silent fury with burning purpose. The only thing left when the world and everyone else is long gone.Transistor provides a contrast to Red. A sword with the power to alter reality, a weapon of enormous power is one of the more subtly vulnerable characters I’ve come across, one that speaks fondly and protectively of Red, and tentatively speaks heartbroken confessions in dire situations. Having the narrator in the form of Transistor on board for the ride and his interactions with Red makes this very compelling and I think more intimate. His writing is excellent as is delivery of the voice acting. Transistor and Red really are a perfect match. A body and mind without a voice, and a mind and voice without a body.The overarching plot as well, is told in a very minimalist fashion and is deceptive in its depth. It is a larger world from a lore perspective than one might think. One which is subtly told and implied through character exchanges, terminals, and abilities. The latter is quite interesting, a good union of gameplay and narrative exposition, although the ability exposition can be a slog at times. as it is delivered via text.VerdictThe gameplay is near perfect the story compelling, and the presentation flawless. If I were to lay criticism at Transistor it would be a desire for more solid and defined chunks of lore, world building and narrative. The storyline can be completely incidental and missed if one does not seek it among the sublime ARPG romp. That said, I’m still thinking about world, the story, and its myriad meanings. It is an experience which has really stuck with me after the credits rolled. It is also one of the only games that I have felt I needed to play through again immediately after, to ‘Recurse’ as the game tantalisingly puts it.			"

												I don't want to comment on the story as I could give something away. The game doesn't have a tutorial but it's not really a problem/disadvantage. As you progress & level up you can choose abilities also known as functions that have an active, upgrade & passive ability depending on how you equip these functions as well as combining with other functions provides a big pool of experimental fun. This mechanic reminds me of materia managment in Final Fantasy 7.My first playthrough took about 17 hours (your mileage may vary), most of it was experimenting with the functions, but on my second playthrough, which is new game plus was actually more fun than the first time because you carry over the functions from your first playthrough as well as re-earning duplicate functions which increases the gameplay/strategy element even further. You could obtain all the Steam achievement on two playthroughs if you an achievement achiever.Side note, you can obtain flac versions (as well as mp3 v0 and mp3 320) of the Transistor soundtrack at https://supergiantgames.bandcamp.com/album/transistor-original-soundtrackIf you purchased the original soundtrack from Bandcamp & want the extended soundtrack which is basically humming & a few instrumental versions of the original soundtrack contact SuperGiant games or alternatively buy the soundtrack on Steam which has both original & extended or listen on Youtube if you're curious before spending cash.If you've played Bastion, you'll will find transistioning to Transistor a lot of fun.

												Absolutely brilliant. The soundtrack, story and characters(as few as there were) could have made a visual novel all on its own but Transistor tops it all off by having an amazing and permutable battle system. Not even counting the special Turn() based strategic battling, the sheer number of choices, combinations and OPTIONS you have to battle is insanely staggering.You can pick 4 actives, 2 upgrades per active, and 4 passive abilities. With a total of 16 different choices to slot into any of those. The numbers seem 'small' but doing a bit of math on this and I realize I can't properly account for all the situations and duplicate abilities you can also have later on. Not only that, but the order of the abilities even matters for some cases, amplifying or accidentally nullifying what you're trying to do.The amount of ways you can tailor your skills, number in the hundred thousands, if not the millions and that's not even including your own personal playstyle, timing and strategies. This is a game that rivals many others in sheer options of battle choices while maintaining a subtle yet engaging storyline. I can honestly say I felt this game was a true masterpiece, battle, story, art, soundtrack, replayability. God damn.			"

The game fills those with beautiful audio and visual elements like it's predecessor, Bastion. $20 may not seem like it's worth such a short amount of time, but in that time you could fill it with perhaps 3 movies for the same price if not more. The mechanics are incredibly fun and flexible, though the UI can be abit clunky. Some combinations of skills may seem perfect, but that perfection is balanced on each person's playstyle and desire to push the level of skill vs fun. An incredibly good game, all in all.			"

												Transistor... I love Bastion. It is one of my favourite games ever, one I keep pushing unto everyone I know, so when I hear of transistor I had to preorder it. Finally it came out and off I went. The game is a worthy successor. Bastion without being Bastion, familiar enough for nostalgia but different enough to escape repetition. The graphics are excellent and work very well with the game type, the soundtrack is absolutely amazing, everything in the sound clicks together, music, effects, narration. The action switches between two game modes giving you both frenetic pace and tactical stimulation. The story is also gripping, you quickly create a bond with the characters and get emotionally invested, knowing what happened to the city, why you, who are they. The only problem is when you answer all those questions and... that's it. The game feels short, leaves you a bit of a bitter after taste. Maybe because of how pleasurable the trip until the end is, and not so much by fault of its own. I guess that in that, it is not Bastion. Play it, enjoy it.			"

												This game is short and didn't have the same authentic feel as Bastion.  The story was interesting and complex, but a little clunky in places.  While I enjoy having certain story elements left up to the reader/player, I think a longer, more fleshed out game would have been nice.  There also doesn't seem to be a whole lot of replayability.I only complain about the length, because what there was of the game was really fun!  The combat system was unique and took thought, and it was challenging.  The main character is a strong kind of go-get-um lady and that's pretty cool.  All of the little elements made the game really interesting as well.  Overall, I recommend the game, but not quite for twenty dollars.  It's a fun, short game, that you can probably complete in one sitting.			"

												Transistor is the second game from Bastion developer Super Giant Games, and it is another exceptionally crafted artistic RPG.In Transistor you play the role of Red, a beautiful and talented musician who has seemingly lost her voice.  The game begins with Red pulling a sword like device known as the Transistor out of the chest of a dead man.  Immediately the Transistor begins talking to Red as if it knows her.  The voice of the Transistor is how we learn what's going on in this abandoned ghost town of a city called Cloudbank.   Much like the narrator in Bastion comments on the situation of Caelondia, the Transistor will talk to Red about things happening in Cloudbank.  It seems Super Giant Games really has a thing for mysterious apocalyptic events that wipe out flourishing cities.  Not only is the Transistor your talking guide through the game it's also a very powerful tool and weapon.   In the beginning the Transistor only has two functions loaded into it, thus giving you two different attack options.  As you level up you'll unlock   more functions, function upgrade slots, and passive function slots.  The function customization and use is incredibly deep and fun to experiment with as you explore combinations to fit your play style.  It really makes the combat an enjoyable sandbox of trial by fire.Every function in the game has 3 optional ways of using it in the Transistor.  The first use is an Active attack and used to directly afflict damage or other debuffs on the enemies.   The second use is an upgrade slot to an existing Active attack.  This will add extra abilities to your attacks.   The final use is a passive slot which will grant you various buffs or abilities that are always active.  With 16 different functions to unlock, and each having 3 ways to potentially use them, you can see the amount of customization gets exponential.  And even more in new game plus when it allows you to unlock another copy of an already used function.Using the functions in the variety of ways will also reward the story loving fanatics.  Each function you discover is linked to one pronounced citizen of Cloudbank, and as you use the functions in combat you'll unlock background information regarding their history.  It's a fun way to learn more about the story and reward players for trying new combinations of function loadouts.While the story of Transistor may seem eerily similar to Bastion the combat game play is quite different.  Arguably Transistor can be played in the same real time hack-n-slash style of Bastion, but in all likelihood you'll be using the strategic pause mode for most battles.  This mode feels like a turn based strategy game.   When combat is paused you are shown a progress bar of action points to spend.  Every movement, every function will use up action points until the bar is full.   This allows you to plan out your attack before committing to the plan.  Once you execute a plan you'll see all your attacks played out in real time.  You'll then need to fight in real time as you wait for the cool down timer on strategic mode.  It really is a good balance of real time and turn based combat.The thing I loved most about Bastion was it's story, soundtrack and art direction, and once again with Transistor they delivered.   A hauntingly desolate city again brought to life by beautiful landscapes and enchanting music you'll be humming along the way with Red.While it may be relatively short it has replay value in new game plus, just to try more function combos.  If you enjoyed Bastion then you'll find Transistor worthy of a play.			"

												Supergiant has made another innovative game with great art, and this time, with superb gameplay. Unlike their last game, Bastion, Transistor has a much more in-depth combat system that is cool to toy around with. Now for what everyone's waiting for: the story. The story of Transistor is very similar to the one that was in Bastion's. Supergiant brings back many of the things we've loved from Bastion and puts in it Transistor. The game drops you into a world that is being torn apart, and you have to try and fix it. There is a narrator in the game that serves to tell the story about how the world around you was, although he takes a more laid back seat in his role in that instead of narrating every single thing you're doing, here, he'll talk to you as a companion and friend. While the fact that the story between the two games is almost identical, the main difference between the two games is the world you're dropped in, and why the world is being destroyed.You start off in not so much as a world that Supergiant has made, but a city called Cloudbank that is part of that world. Cloudbank has a Tron kind of feel, where it is unsure whether the characters you are seeing are really alive, or just some programs living in a digital world. On the one hand, when they die, their souls or processes go into your Transistor, giving you extra powers. On the other hand, the characters are exactly the same as human characters except for that fact. The game tries really hard to demonstrate this idea that even though every character in the game is some kind of computer program, they still have all behave differently and have flaws like normal humans. Characters end up having tons of personality, except instead of forcing you to learn about them, Transistor does this more subtly by giving you the choice to read about the lore of the world or not.The storytelling in the game has also been improved from Bastion. Instead of the singlular path of find all the cores, find all the shards, then find the last core and the last shard to power up the bastion machine, Transistor's story is a lot less linear and way more subtle. As said before, much of the story lies in the background of the powers you gain, as well as the OVC stations (pretty much the newspaper) that are placed around Cloudbank. Transistor focuses mainly on telling a good story but because of that, it ends a little short. By no means is Bastion a bad story, but it was practically one big fetch quest for 70% of the game, which was good because it made the game longer, but the story was made weaker and the weakness in its gameplay was made much more obvious. If anything, I wish this game was longer but at least the story doesnt feel as forced as Bastion, forcing you to continuously retrieve things to power the bastion. Your playthrough could last anywhere from 4-5 hours on the first playthroughbut there is a new game+ mode called recursion in the game that lets you keep all your abilities and your level as you start the game over again.Other than the story, the gameplay is the most noticeable improvement in Transistor. Instead of dodge rolling and then spamming left or right click, this game relies on 4 active skills that you can add 2 passive skills to each, and 4 passive skills that buff your character. Each and every skill you have can go into any of these categories and its up to you to mix and match each skill to fit your playstle. You use these 4 actives in combat and when you are in a pinch, you can use the pause mechanic which allows you to plan your attack. With these mechanics,Transistor is a much more tactical and interesting game  since you get to carry most, if not all, of your skills into combat with you into a fight. In the end, Transistor has taken many of the things in Bastions, and improved on them. The story has been made less linear, the gameplay has been totally rehauled, and you'll fall in love with the art style, the crumbling world, and the characters all over again.			"

												Transistor is a fantastic game: great music, great visuals, great gameplay, and an interesting story.This one hit all the sweet spots, in my opinion. Good length, too - each play through (and it's very much worth recursing/game+'ing the game once) takes about 10 hours.Now, if you're looking for another Bastion, then you may be disappointed. Most of Transistor's combat takes place in a  turn-based mode, where you plan out your movement/attacks, then execute your plan and watch it play out. You can fight in real time (and some of the challenge trials are actually easier this way), but for the most part you'll end up taking too much damage and/or getting knocked out of your attacks to make it a very useful way to play.Difficulty is great, in that it scales wonderfully. By default, you'll have a fairly easy time killing the Process. However, there are 10 limiters that you can choose, which will make the Process stronger, in exchange for faster leveling up. I can honestly tell you that running with all 10 limiters will make for a very harrowing experience.Again, as I mentioned, you should totally play at least twice - first time around gives a good experience, but the second time around - when both you and the Process are leveled up, and you can start stacking functions for extra-brokeness and fun, is what really makes the game.Final word - this is the only game that I've gone out of my way to get 100% of the achievements.

												I've never been moved to tears upon playing a video game until now. Despite the obvious flaws that the game has, (bugs, crashes, framerate issues) the game is carried by the weight of the story alone. While the gameplay was fantastic, it isn't the greatest video game I've ever played, but it's one of the greatest, if not the greatest, stories I've ever been told. The only thing that truly saddened me with Transistor was the mere fact that I didn't have more time to spend in Red's world. Without a doubt, I would recommened this game to anyone that cares for a story in video games. For anyone that claims that a video game can never truly be a work of art, this would be my go to game to show them.			"

												The game is a little on the short side (7 hours to beat first playthrough) but the story is unique, the theming is fantastic, and the beats are fresh. An indie game of high quality you can expect from the makers of Bastion. However, be aware the combat is very different from Bastion, but is still really well designed and fun in its own right. It's sort of a meshing of real time action and turn-based calculative strategy combat.I personally found this to be a lot more fun than Bastion despite being a pretty short game. Gets a 9/10 from me. And because this is the internet my opinion is a fact. Buy it. You won't regret it.			"

												Transistor is one of those games that you don't want to pull away from with its story and fun gameplay. It does a very good job at building the sci-fi world it is set in with various interactable objects and character profiles that add even more depth to the plot. The actual gameplay is very easy to get into and still provides a good challenge at points like some boss fights.The game is very well made as a whole with little to no glitches, except for one bug where clicking to a location becomes somewhat unresponsive and difficult to interact with points of interest. However I've only encountered this bug after playing for longer sessions.Overall Rating: 9/10I recommend this game for anyone whose a fan on action RPGs and strategy games.			"

												A brilliantly (overused: True) paced and beautifully balanced game oft forgets the story it is trying to tell in search of becoming something it isn't. Whether in pursuit of innovation or not, games of this fashion commonly gloss over facets that players wish more deeply explored; point being, this game will break your heart, the soundtrack will grace you back in to it's somber tale, the combat whisk away formalities in light of strategy and challenge, and the character depth and interaction will, undoubtedly bring you laughter, anguish, unncertainty, and understanding. That all without even mentioning the art, and barely tapping at the resource pool that is the lore of this game. Stories like this one do not come along oft enough, and Bastion rings the same in my ears. SuperGiant has done it again, and done it just as well.9.5/10			"

												This game is great. ENTIRELY. GREAT.If you are wondering if you should buy it or not; DO IT (insert shia labeouf face here)This game presents a gameplay i've never seen before. You mix turns with real time based strategy in the same space. Also, you unlock functions, and you can equip them as passives, actives, or upgrades in other actives, having different effects on each and making your creativity run as you discover new combinations that suit your play style so you can do well on the game, also making the gameplay even more unique. These alone makes it worth the experience and your money.Some other add-ons:The game is really smooth. Nice graphics and animations, and you should not have problems running it even if your computer is not a gamer specs.Awesome music. I'm listening to it even off-game.Great and beautiful story. Runs of all the clichés you can find out there. If you start playing and think ""Oh probably this or that will happen"" you probably are wrong.I give this game my 10/10.

												I just finished this game, and I'm sad to have to see it end. It was a truly fantastic game, on par if not better in its own way than Bastion. The story interested me and held my attention throughout, especially with the way it tells itself through the narration and environment. The music and art style were absolutely beautiful as I'm sure you will hear many people say. The combat felt fresh to me, easy to get a grip on but nothing I've ever really seen before.The only nitpicks I have with the game are: A) The boss fights are dreadfully easy once you get a hang of the game.B) There is a certain enemy type towards the end of the game that felt really cheap to me (though that may just be because I was worse at the game than I thought).C) I'm not sure how I came under the impression, but I thought ""Recursion Mode"" (New Game+) would include extra story elements or different dialogue in certain areas. After a bit of research after finishing the game, I discovered it was nearly all enemy layouts and enemy difficulty and such, much to my dismay. Though if you're into the combat, I suppose that's not really a negative.D) My game crashed. Once. In a challenge map. Before it began. After the game saved. No biggy, but something to watch out for.Overall, absolutely amazing game that will stick with me for a while, and may very well become one of my favourite games. I whole-heartedly recommend buying it, especially if you enjoyed Bastion. Even if you didn't, buy it anyways, Supergiant deserves all of your money.10/10 would bang, play, finish, get upset by, reason with myself so I stop getting upset by and then write a review that got way longer than I intended again.

												I really love this game, the story was intrguing, the atmospere and art was amazing, and i found the combot to be very innovative, and thanks to the limiters and enemies that get more and more difficult, the gameplay stayed diverse and it really felt like my actions mattered. All that being said, i felt that the story was a bit short, and the character development was a bit lacking. i also would have liked a little more info about the world, because i feel that the short story would have been ok if i at least had lore to keep me entertained. Also, i just wish that there where more agency tests/battles agains other enemies with turn. That was hands down my favorite thing about the game, but i just wish there was more. However, i still find the game to be incredebly enjoyable, despite this, and if you are only going to do an incursion or 2, i think that all of these things can be overlooked.

												Hello world!Supergiant comes back with another installment, same narrator (or at least the same actor), world still falling apart, but this time, it's in the future!For Bastion fans, Transistor has all of the flavors of  Bastion, with a whole new story and significantly changed combat elements.Combat this time often time involves the usage of the ""Turn()"" ability.Turn() is essentially a planning phase where you can plan out your attacks, then when you execute, it happens instantaneously, then you have a recharge time before it can be used again.Being in the non-discript space future, there are a decent amount of programming references embedded into the game.As a programmer, I thought that was kinda cool, because I felt like I had a secret hand shake with the developers saying ""Hey, I got that!""Even if you're not a programmer, those minor references don't really effect the story at all, so nothing will be missed by anyone that plays this game.So to break down the pieces, gameplay, I would say is equivalent to the level that Bastion output.Music, dare I say, better than Bastion. The song for the trailer, We All Become was fantastic. Old Friends was great as well.Combat, personally, I liked it. I've heard some friends that preferred Bastion's combat system to Transistor, but I'm definitely a fan of RPGs, and Transistor feels more like an RPG with its system.Story, I'm kind of mixed. Shortly in, it becomes apparent that there are elements of romance. My video game taste palate initially wasn't expected a romance, but grew to accept and even really like where it took the story.All of those elements combined, it makes this game one of my absolute favorites.I would absolutely recommend it.Gotta get that ten outta ten!System.exit(0) || return 0; //Whichever you prefer.

The constant narration really connects you emotionally to the game, not to mention  the stellar sountrack. Its indie rock/grunge/electro-pop style is really unique and suits the mood of the game very well. Everything you should look for in an RPG and more. Brilliant.			"

												Transistor is one of those games that you don't want to pull away from with its story and fun gameplay. It does a very good job at building the sci-fi world it is set in with various interactable objects and character profiles that add even more depth to the plot. The actual gameplay is very easy to get into and still provides a good challenge at points like some boss fights.The game is very well made as a whole with little to no glitches, except for one bug where clicking to a location becomes somewhat unresponsive and difficult to interact with points of interest. However I've only encountered this bug after playing for longer sessions.Overall Rating: 9/10I recommend this game for anyone whose a fan on action RPGs and strategy games.			"

												Overall Transistor is a really captivating game and is easily one of my current favourites. The music in Transistor is beautiful, and really sets the mood throughout the game. The visuals were lovely, and the game has really nice character designs. Storyline and narration may be one of my favourite aspects of the game, and the ending broke me (it came quite unexpectedly but was a really touching).Gameplay is unique as you can choose to strategically plan your moves or dive headfirst into battle, depending on your preferred play style, but i found both to be enjoyable (though i stuck to planning more). Game was also a good length and has replay value (Recursion). It is also extremely customisable, as you are able to try all sorts of different combinations with the skills, and the results are often stunning, experimentation with different combinations was really interesting. I would say this is one of the games you should pick up when its on sale bc it's worth the money :)			"

												This game has a beautiful and unique way of storytelling. The story doesn't fit into any specific genre, and is confusing in a good way, meaning you can't predict it based on other stories/games.The art style fits perfectly and the soundtrack is just beautiful and well integrated into the gameplay. Yet the biggest surprise for me is the gameplay and skill system. The way of combining functions (skills) allows for many different effective play styles without forcing the player into making permanent choices. It doesn't make much sense to compare Transistor and Bastion, since their concepts are quite different. I personally liked Transistor better, since it's art style and gameplay goes even further away from a usual fantasy setting.			"

												I played it, it was great. I started playing expecting a relativley easy game. Its not, at least with limiters on. The soundtrack: Nice, really good. I would recommend it just because of the soundtrack. Combat/boss fights: The regular combat is interesting. You get turns to pull out crazy combos and wipe out enemies. The Boss fights doe. The first boss fight we REALLY GOOD, and so was the Second and the last. I won't reveal much of them though. Just trust me, the boss fights are good.Graphics: Looks really nice, probably better on a high quality computer. (My computer isn't the best)Story: I am pretty sure that there is only one story line even though you are given multiple choices. The ending is just right (insert meme here)/Overall:I am not very good at being a critic, but it is a 9/10. Worth getting on the sale or just regularly.			"

												In Transistor, you play as Red, a famous singer who is targeted by a mysterious group known as the Camerata. Fortunately, you escape, taking with you the mysterious sword-like Transistor - containing the soul of a man you once knew. Above all else, Transistor is a love story. It tells the tale of a woman in love with a city, its people, and maybe even a sword. Set to a fantastic score by Darren Korb (also from Bastion), the world is full of vibrance and culture. Every area reveals more of the city and the culmination of events that led to the formation of the Camerata and the invasion of the Process.Play it if you:+ Enjoyed Bastion+ Enjoy strong narrative and world building+ Like isometric gameplay (a la Diablo and Bastion)			"

												+Graphics+Music+Controls+Price worth it on or off sale-Story-CombatWhen I first started the game I was a bit confused on what I was supposed to do. But the sound and labeled objects helped turn the learning curve. This game was very technical based there is no doubt about that, think the Matrix or Tron - but a lot of the terminals didn't really make sense with the main story, and none of the fuctions within didn't really change game play.I enjoyed progressing through the main story and fighting the mini bosses. There was another learning curve with the interface and the different skills you needed to equip in order to progress to each new area. But it only took a few minutes to read about each one and figure out which one merged well with the other.I learned that passives are your friend in this game, but you only have so much memory at first to equip them. You'll need to play through thie story a few times to get to max level and unlock all the achievements - which i'll do on my own time. I'm not really hardcore on having all of them.Everything else I listed above was amazing and well constructed.

												This was more of an artpiece than a game. It looks nice and it was kind of fun. Skillwise, I'm average and I never died once in the whole game (not counting the bonus challenges in the tree). That should tell you something. Pretty short. Only 2 bosses, I think, and they're both easy.Basically, you get extra chances even if you die, because if you lose all of your health you only temporarily lose an ability. You have 4 of these to lose before dying, so you're not in any serious danger. You can usually replenish these after almost every fight.Plus, I think the story isn't really exaplained. It's just kind of vague. (Trying not to give away spoilers) One guy let another guy borrow ________. He had good intentions, but the other guy... used it for evil... Why? Dunno. Everything kind of gets deflated and resolved easily.It's worth seeing, though.			"

												I didn't know what to expect going into this.  I'm not a fan of this kind of style, gameplay, etc etc.  So it's not something that I jumped into expecting to like it.  And I have to say that I'm surprised.  There is a story.  That you work out most of by yourself via the dialogue.  The combat is very strategic, which is why I find myself dying often.  The music is beautiful.  And getting 'Red' to stop and hum to the music randomly takes up a lot of my time as well.  If you plan on getting this, get it with the soundtrack.  I'm still slowly but surely working my way through the game and I'm having a good time.A few things that annoy me is the lack of variety when it comes to fights.  Its strategic in the fact that you have to plan out how you fight or you'll end up losing or breaking your attacks ...which is super annoying but they're not gone for good.  Its not like you don't encounter anything new but they slowly/painfully add new monsters to fight as you go and it can sometimes just all blur together.  To sum it up:  Its an awesome game so far.  Gives an amazing story but at the same time leaves so much open for you to let your imagination roam.  Fun and stuff.			"

												Bastion was a major case of ""came for gameplay, stayed for aesthetics"". Transistor is more like ""came for aesthetics, stayed for aesthetics"". Gameplay is ok, but does not become tedius only because the game itself is rather short. Planning the turn and combining the effects are interesting mechanics, but have little actual depth and are fun only for the 6-7 hours it takes to beat the game once. Which is kind of perfect.Now, the aesthetics are brilliant. A futuristic sci-fi city where programming code is a part of everyday reality, is painted in the most unlikely style of Art Nouveau, and this unexpected combination provides a unique experience. Like in Bastion, sound is very tightly knit to the visual, to an almost synaesthetic effect.The story has two very different layers. The big picture is vague: to the very end we can only guess what the city actually is, can one leave it or not, what is the nature of the forse destroying it, and so on. This, however, is not sloppy worldbuilding, but rather a deliberate refusal to focus on the minutae of the narrative background and keep it blurred to focus on the story of Red, which is told with all the immediacy. A human story of hard work, love, betrayal, retribution and redemption gets through, from the first cue of the man in sword, to the last pictures in the credits.			"

												The world needs more games like this. Beautifully crafted world, fantastic music and lyrical approach to the lore and story-telling is what makes this game a piece of art. The story is not, as opposed to many games, just an information dump with no meaning to it, but rather a fluid path through concepts and ideas. It let's you use your artistic imagination to ""fill in the gaps"", relate to your own life and let's you use your emotions to experience it.The mechanics are also fantastic, I would compare them to blizzard's Diablo 3 - you combine skills, thus getting different results and ways to fight. The combination of real time and turn based combat is very interesting and enjoyable.			"

												This game takes us on a roller coaster of not knowing what is going on until you start piecing things together. That's when the magic of Transistor comes together in a beautiful story, unlike any other I've experienced.The gameplay mechanics are really solid, providing you with many combinations and ways that you can defeat your opponents. With this, it gains replay ability as well as its achievements and different difficulty ""perks"". Transistor joins videogames, visual art and sound together in a massive heartfelt composition that will stun you for a long time.I don't think this is an experience that can be put on words, only by playing will you understand it.

												Transistor is a good game, don't get me wrong. Just like Bastion it has beautiful graphics, but also like Bastion it's very short. Transitor is more of a strategy game unlike Bastion which was played in real time. You can press spacebar to pause the game to plan your attacks. You have a sword called Transitor with a dead mans soul inside of it. The main character is a singer named Red who lost her voice, apparently you live in a future city where a computer virus took over and killed people.Anyways back to the sword, you can unlock different powers to apply to it but I ended up using Breach() most of the time. One thing that I have a problem with is that the game seemed WAY too EASY. I only died once in my whole playthrough. Because if you die you just loose a function, you only actually die until you loose all functions. I guess if you play NG+ it will get harder because you could apply more limiters. which are things you can unlock that make the game a bit harder for an XP boost. So I will do a second playthrough at some point but in general I don't think this game is worth $20 but I got it for $5 on a sale and I would say it was worth the playthrough. The story of the game was pretty simple but surprised me, I'm not gonna spoil it though. If you played Bastion, you kind of have an idea of what your going into, so I do reccomend this game. "

												Transistor is... interesting. I was sucked in by the number of potential combinations of combat abilities - and then I stuck around for the beautiful artwork and atmosphere of the game.Transistor is an orthogonal view RPG - similar to those of the early 2000s. It's not standard, though: you don't have a party of multiple characters, and you don't have conversations with NPCs (or at least, not as such). Combat occurs in bounded areas, which you can't leave until finishing the combat - but your character can move freely within these. Abilities can be used in real time, or planned out using a ""pause"" kind of ability (which has to recharge after being used), making the combat more turn based and strategy focused.There are three main things however, which really make the game shine.First is the mystery/detective style story. The game starts with your character right in the middle of things, with very little explanation - and as the player, you spend the game trying figure out what happened and what exactly is going on. I found this to be a great storytelling technique, and very quickly got me hooked. Little snippets of information are ""fed"" to you through by your narrator companion; you also find various clues as you explore.Another way of finding information is cleverly linked to the second notable thing about this game: the combat abilities.As you progress through the game, (and level), you receive abilities called 'Functions' (a computer programming reference). Each one can be used as an active ability, set as a passive bonus, or used as an upgrade to your active Functions. This means that each new function you gain can have 3 different effects - and there are then an almost limitless number of potential combinations. The best thing about this though, is that you can freely change how you combine your Functions throughout the game. If something's not working for you, change it up. You can use one set-up to be effective against large numbers of weak monsters, and then change again for the boss battles. If you think a particular combination of Functions might be cool, fun - or even just good for a laugh - try it out, and you can always change again later. This encourages improvisation and experimentation, while also removing the pressure of making the right decisions on how to upgrade your character (which sometimes detracts in other games).The Functions also tie in with the game's backstory. Each one is named after a character (including the one you control), and as you use the Function in different ways, more information about this character is available to read. This acts as another incentive to change around your Function combinations by slowly feeding you more of the story.Finally, the whole atmosphere of the game really is something to experience. The character portraits and cutscene artwork are amazing, the way the protagonist hums along to the soundtrack of the game... I'm not sure what else to say - you have to see if for yourself.Only a few complaints:I found the combat to be a bit of a grind as I neared the end of the game (though that may just be me).I also thought everyone's praises of the soundtrack were overrated, and left me disappointed. Ashley Barrett's vocals *are* stunning - but although the the music fits the environment of the game, it's just repetitive and mostly forgettable.If all that leaves you wanting to know more - go play it! Why are you still reading this?However, if that doesn't grab your attention, and you prefer your games to be a bit more standard with an overt story that starts more slowly - this one isn't for you.

												Most people say that you need around 6 hours to beat this once.If you explore every bit and wait for every dialogue, play around with the different functions, crank up the difficulty to max whenever possible and only have reasonable luck with the random based challenges 8-10h is more appropriate (listening to the awesome music included).So with actually playing the game it's 10 hours worth of amazing content for the first playthrough. And the second seems to offer some more things to keep you entertained.I didn't find anything that this game does not do really good except for some user interface issues (mostly when installing functions, though you can drag&drop and stuff, it's just a bit strange when you change a whole lot).---------Please be aware though, there is one minor design flaw. In fact this may wipe your progress if you are not careful so please read on IF you want to play on maxed difficulty and change around your playstyle a lot:After reaching the top of the tower DO NOT LEAVE unless you have a foolproof ability kit or turned off all/some limiters. The game saves after a cut-scene and you will have to fight a high tier dog and some minions. YOU DO NOT GET THE OPTION TO CHANGE YOUR BUILD EVEN IF YOU LOAD. You can pretty much always beat anything before even with a sub-par build and a few deaths but this encounter can be devastating with the wrong build. It took me several minutes of optimizing a test build that was not working as intended.---------Probably the only game where I used Tab for other things than minimizing the window. And I used it a lot. Definitely the only game where I didn't do anything else except holding the Tab key at times...Buy this if you have a working Tab key. If not, wait for a discount. Or don't, because it's incredible. Seriously, the only problem people are having with this game is that it is too short. Great games are always too short, or we wouldn't play the bad games anyway...Edit: 2nd playthroughThe design flaw as explained above is here more apparent and it happens more often, though you should have a good setup at this point anyway. being able to have multiples of the same function also makes stuff very interesting. Most encounters are very easy (with the correct kit) but some encounters seem to be randomized so you can have pretty challenging fights, even though I nearly instantly killed anything, I still only had about 20-30% life after most fights. The challenge rooms you get access to are okay (fighting against a last boss kind of type is forgettable though), the randomized fights can be a nightmare and the repeating ""only fighting against an increasing number of men"" is dumb and very unfair with the wrong abilities. This changes in the later rooms though and I had some pretty fun times going through the last 16 waves, losing my good abilities right at the start and only reaching my standard setup right at the last wave. So far a recursion seems unnecessary, the real meat (plot, style, music) is already inside your bellies, so the only thing left is to play around with the game mechanics. Those are excellent but you should know when to stop before you ruin your experience. See that mode as optional and not as required and you will be fine :)			"

												I cried. Some people don't like that the game doesn't spell out all of its meaning. I think the plot's allegorical nature is part of what makes the game so mezmorizing. The gameplay mechanics aren't fantastic, and replayability is about the same as reading through a book; not great. But once through is really all I need. And yet... I feel like a part of me also got stuck somewhere in the transistor, locked until I decide how the riddle should be solved.  I just...

												""The river always finds the sea""Supergiant games they guys who made the beautful Bastion, are at it again. While Bastion had okay combat Transistor knocks it out of the ball park with some really cool yet different style of combat. You really don't see the combat in Transistor in any of game. The soundtrack of Transistor is just as good as Bastion. The only thing is it is very short. Only about 6-8 hours of gameplay which is shorter then Bastion. And as for the story, without any spoilers, it made me cry. The ending was simply beautiful. In the dark world that became of Cloundbank (the city in Transistor) the ending made you feel warm, happy and then you cried. Better then Bastion? The more I think about it the more I think it is. Both games are amazing and you should buy them both. Now I'm not a guy that works for video game review companys but I think this deserves a very high rating everywhere. So good.9.6/10			"

												Bastion was a game that chagned how i looked at games. It continues to be a game that I buy for everyone I can. If bastion is Supergiant's Classic tale, then Transistor is a tragedy.It's hard to talk about it without spoiling. Bastion cuts you at specific moments, Transistor never stops.Transistor is a beautiful game. I will likely gift it out with Bastion to anyone else who will play both. You wont go wrong			"

YouTube™ Video: Transistor (Turbo Button Reviews)

			Turbo Button Reviews is a series of short, sweet, and to the point video game reviews. In this episode, I review Supergiant Games' masterful Transistor, which you pretty much need to play immediately.		

Too long; didn't watch -- Transistor has an absolutely captivating sense of style, a memorable upgrade system, and a super fun hybrid of turn-based and real-time combat.  It's one of the best games that I've played in a long, long time.			"

												Transistor is a top-down, turn-based adventure game that takes place in a utopian society. The gameplay is very different from Bastion; in this game, all attacks are planned beforehand during each turn. This game is beautiful to look at and holds a beautiful story within.Pros:+From the music, to the voice acting, to the writing, to the art, this game is beautifully executed. I like the gameplay, but this is definitely a game you buy for the music, story and artwork.+The romance in this game felt genuine and believable to me.+The gameplay is entertaining; different ""functions"" (attacks) can be combined in a multitude of combinations, and there are multiple ways to win each battle.+Like Bastion, there is a new game plus mode where you can restart the game at a higher difficulty and continue levelling.+For those who like the battles, there are bonus challenges, similar to Bastion.Cons:-While planning your turn, you can't pan the screen to look at far away enemies. This is a minimal problem, as you can usually see far enough anyways, and you can also simply walk where you want to see and then cancel the move.This game took me ten hours to complete, but my girlfriend completed it in four hours, which I find amazing. I think most people will take at least six if not 7-8 hours.I really loved this game. While they don't have the big budget of a AAA company, Supergiant has managed to craft something that is both more unique and more impressive than most AAA games.			"

												Transistor combines a beutiful world, a fantastic soundtrack, and satisfying combat to create a great game held back both by an overly vague story and a lack of things to do.  The game isn't long, which isn't too much of a problem, but I left it wanting more, and not simply new game plus.  I wanted more new enemies, more stories, more boss fights.  If you're fine with a shorter experience, then Transistor is a must-buy.  Hell, if you're fine with a game that relies on new game plus to last a long time, then Transistor is still a must-buy.			"

												Not great but ok. I can't avoid comparing it to Bastion. You have main story, you have storyteller, you have your own place where you can rest (Bastion in Bastion, Backdoor in Transistor). In overall it looks like developers tried to repeat success of Bastion. But the problem is that story is not that great, art is not as detailed as in Bastion, soundtrack is boring and repetitive and whole Backdoor concept is useless. As for Backdoor I hate it the most. In Bastion you could build your own island to receive new stuff and complete trials to receive parts needed to upgrade your weapons. In Transistor you have Backdoor where you can complete trials to unlock new songs from soundtrack to listen in only in Backdoor. And thats all.			"

												Have you ever thought about playing with art? Well, if you're visiting this game's page, this is your chance to see how it feels like!First of all, this is no simple indie easy money score. You can see that there were hours spent on dedicated work, constructing this piece of art. I can start by telling you what you already know and what makes this game easy on your boring days, but, instead, I'll just skip to what makes it good and different.Imagine yourself playing a Neil Gaiman's graphic novel (storyline and arts), produced by a Blizzard (isometric gods) and Square Enix (turn based combat milestone) partnership. This gets close to the experience. You will never believe how awesome this game's battles are, until you actually play it. So many possibilities... very few enemy types though. And about the graphic/arts... there is so much to say about it. You may see a mix steam punk and futuristic sci-fi on the references. Gorgeous begin to describe... And the soundtrack?! Mesh up old club music with electronic beats and you get really impressive results!This game was born a classic. With so many uncreative work popping up every single day, this game only lacks more world wide publicity to get it amongst the great ones, where it belongs.			"

												Supergiant, the creators of Bastion, present you with a similar game in that the soundtrack is beautiful. the artwork and animations are pretty. it has a strong story gameplay is very funOn my first playthrough, I made a huge mistake by not realizing that planning (the turn-based element) was important until the final boss, so I had essentially done a no-pause run through the game, which made it more difficult. Fortunately, the game is replayable, so I can restart (on a harder mode) and change up my playstyle. I highly recommend this game to anyone, especially returning fans of Supergiant.  "

												I'll start out by saying - this game is amazing! Supergiant games yet again doesn't fail to deliver a game filled with praise-worthy content. Exellent soundtrack, high quality narrative and interesting game mechanics are but few things that will accompany you through the game. Thus said, the only thing that didn't leave me statisfied was the length of the game. It's quite short, yet replayable a little, since you'll not be able to unlock everything in just one completed campaign. Sooo..Definitely recomended!			"
