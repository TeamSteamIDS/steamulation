												As a RPG and Stepmania enthousiast, this would seem like the perfect Indie game for me. And indeed, it was fun to play. It was unique. It was something fresh. And being a RPG fan, I am used with doing repetitive things in order to get that one rare drop.One warning is that even casual gamers who would like to simply play the game and go through the story, might still face some moments where they have to engage battles over and over to get that last item for a recipe. Bite through it, the way you make story progression is quite slow in itself. Ronald Jenkees kicks ♥♥♥, but not after the 6~7th time in a row. Yeah, having only one fixed song per enemy doesn't get you on your toes that much. On sales it's usually just one buck, so hopefully no buyer's remorse after you've even spent an hour at it.			"

												Before the Echo (the game was known as Sequence previously) is an interesting RPG. The game plays like Dance Dance Revolution with the notes divided into 3 separate note tracks running concurrently on the screen for casting spells, defending against attacks and regenerating mana. There is a quirky story to pull you through to the end but what won me over was most definitely the music tracks behind the gameplay.I can't really gauge how difficult it is to play for beginners to the genre due to my many years of playing rhythm games from Stepmania, Guitar Hero and my current timesink of Osu!. Anyone who has played such games should find no problems however with adapting to the mechanics.Due to the RPG nature of the game, it can become a grind for specific items to drop on the monsters which are used to craft items needed to progress in the floors. The game does not come with any additional content beyond the story that I am aware of (I played mostly at release back in 2011).Before the Echo wasn't the most challenging game personally but it sits in my game library as a comfortable purchase when I look back over two years. Give it a go if it is on sale but just be aware it may not be fun for everyone; the usual disclaimer case for most games in the rhythm genre.			"

												Art: 9/10 (I am being a little too much critical here, it is above great!)Code: 10/10 (can not see flaws, very agile and stable! +there is calibration feature to fix A/V off-sync!)Enjoyability: 9/10 +consists great humour! (especially check item descriptions!)Beatmaps: 7/10 (sometimes weaker beats result in two keypress, when the strong one is one key press)Toughtness if necessary: 10/10 (there are four difficulty settings: easy, medium, hard, spasmodic)9/10PROTIPS: #1: Use ASDF instead of arrows and numeric keypad 4,6 to rotate and 1,2,3,7,8,9 for spells. Really comfortable! #2: Medium is too easy. #3: Spasmodic difficulty most likely will require playing against easier enemies repetitively in order to level up and beat stronger enemies or to use recipes, because that will help a lot; makes game a little more like RPG because of the repetitions, but that is enjoyable, really. If that is not for you, take hard or normal. When I started with normal and went to 4th floor, I felt it was too easy for me and I went for spasmodic difficulty. I found it really challenging and that is what I really hoped for.			"

												I have to admit, this game surprised me. I got this game from a bundle and decided to install it to try it out. I end up really liking it and played it until the very end. It's a rhythm based game, you have to change between 3 panels with Q and E, you use the arrows to hit the notes.When I saw the tutorial I thought the game would be insanely confusing and hard to play, but it's quite nicely done, as you see all 3 panels at once at any time, so you see what is coming.The art is really cool, the music is awesome and the story is even more awesome! I wanted to play until the end to know what happens... It's full of surprises, it's hiralious and you get hooked right into the story.The spells aren't limited to only damage, you have shielding, direct damage, DOT, healing, boosts... Alot of different spells to use. You have to kill the monsters and ascend floors until you reach the top. All monsters have specific drops which you have a certain percentage of getting everytime you kill them (with music of course). You also have to craft/find your gear and you can learn new spells by using scrolls and completing the songs with high accuracy or note combos.Theres not many bad things to say about the game... My only real issue with the game is the hitboxes... Sometimes it looks like you miss but it actually works and sometimes you think you succesfully hit the note but you didin't. Luckily this rarely happens so it didin't affect me too much. Maybe i'm just bad at the game though, I don't know!This game is definately worth looking into, especially since it is only 4.99$. I'd say anybody that likes good stories or rhythm/music-based games should really try it out!			"

												Now I have to admit when I first started playing this game I had quite low expectations of it. I absolutely love rhythm games but I couldnt see how they could successfully combine this into a RPG style. Although I was proved wrong as this game is AMAZING!!The mechanics of the game are very unique and there is nothing quite like it. You use the rhythm of the music to fight a battle. To this you use the arrow keys and click them as soon as the arrow reaches the bottom of the screen. And this is when it gets unique. You have 3 fields to control via this rhythm ability. Mana, Attack and Defense. Mana is collected and can be used to cast spells in the attack field. You can switch through these fields at your free will. You need to make sure that you use each field correctly and at the right time to survive and win the battle. The story of this game is what most suprised me. It had me hooked throughout the entire thing. There are many twists in the story that keep you guessing throughout the game. The voice is acting is very well done and the characters are very likable. You really do get to know the characters. In a rhythm game a gripping story is the last thing I would have expected. I am not going to go into detail about the story but just experience it for yourself and you will see how great it is. The whole look of the game is completely incredible. The art style gives a real great look to the game that compliments the awesome gameplay. Throughout the floors you get different items. You have collect these items through playing the levels. I felt the items abilitys were very well balanced and contributed well to the gameplay. These items are obtained through a random drop rate on levels. Some items have a very low drop rate on levels later on the game. Unfortunetely this is where my only bad point comes from this game. To get these items it can become very grindy with you having to repeat these levels multiple times in a row just to get it. This can get very boring after a while.I'll end this review with the best part of the game, the soundtrack. It is made of music by Ronald Jenkees and Michael Wade Hamilton. I always feel that a game has a great soundtrack when I like it so much that I even listen to it outside of the game itself, and with this one I did. It is incredible and goes great with a rhythm game. Overall this game is a true masterpiece and a bit of a hidden gem. This game is possibly one of the best I have ever played and I really highly recommend it.TheIronicGamers rating system Don't ever buy this game. Maybe consider it on a sale. An average game.A good game that should definitely be considered.A must play! "

TL;DR --> It costs less than an euro during sales, and it doesn't mean it's a bad game. It's a sign to purchase it as a duty.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------If you're reading this, congratulations! You have a good taste in videogames.As a hardcore rhythm game player, Before the Echo caught my attention soon enough but honestly I didn't know what to expect. The conclusion after beating everything is a fully recommendation of the game.Before the Echo (also known as Sequence) is a rhythm game with RPG elements. The basic stuff  in summary (HP, Mana, EXP, weapons, accesories...). The main character, Ky, has somehow placed himself into a tower where he needs to fight mobs and bosses in order to escape.The battle system consists in getting control of 3 labels of notes. They have different purposes and you need to know when to focus into one or another. I won't explain their features here since the game has tutorials for that.PROS:+ The artwork is cool. Backgrounds are good-looking, and so are characters and foes. + The soundtrack, as you might expect from a rhythm game, is pretty awesome. It also combines many music styles so if you're open minded with that stuff you'll probably enjoy it a lot.+ 4 difficulties, from lame to more challenging. + The RPG system is pretty well included. Just as simple as it needs to be.+ The storymode is surprisingly interesting. The characters' charisma helpsa lot here.+ The dialogues. This is actually one of the most remarkable features. Dialogues in this game are VERY hilarious. Together with a pretty cool voice acting, dialogues will keep you super entertaining and will provide many, many laughs.CONS:- Despite having a cool artwork, there's not too much variety, specially from foes.- At some points grinding/farming is mandatory.- All achievements can be obtained no matter the difficulty you set, which makes them WAY less satisfying.- No leaderboards. - Steam version works like a Flash game (for instance, I couldn't make screenshots, nor broadcasts). All in all, I've had a GREAT experience with this game. It has some minor flaws I could perfectly ignore, and every rhythm player should try this out. You'll surely find some good fun and discover a very consistent title despite its price (less than an euro during sales... WHAT?).Final Mark: 7.5/10			"

												I love rhythm games. Whether it's Elite Beat Agents, Dance Dance Revolution, Project Diva, Rhythm Heaven or iDOLM@STER, I can't get enough of tapping along to arrows and beats. When you combine my love for that genre with my love for RPGs, surely you'd have a winner right? Well, Before the Echo proves that isn't necessarily true. Before the Echo attempts to bring together RPGs, rhythm mechanics and cringe-worthy hipster jokes. In theory, these three aspects could get along rather famously. Unfortunately, in this case they get along about as well as a feuding family. After waking up in a strange tower with no idea how he arrived there, Ky is beset by strange monsters. Guided by his 'shepherd,' Naia, Ky has no choice but to work his way up the seven floors of the tower, defeating enemies and guardians through the power of rhythm. Only then will he be able to escape his strange experimental prison and return to his own world. Sadly, only the ending of the plot holds any real interest, and even then it's pretty bizarre and will be hit or miss for most players. The previous several hours leading up to it gives you little insight into what's happening or the purpose of the tower. I suspect this was done to increase the mystery and suspense, but all it does is leave you feeling irritated and without purpose. This is worsened by the horrific script and characters. The dialogue is clichéd, overwritten, uninteresting and seems to rely on pulling out cringe-worthy jokes every few lines. This can be forgiven to a point, since most of the jokes intentionally parody the lameness in hipster culture. Unfortunately, they're not very funny. The characters have incredibly two-dimensional personalities and you'll feel no affection for them at all. The only saving grace is the voice acting. Script aside, the actors, for the most part, do a tremendous job of portraying their characters. Strangely enough, one of my favourite parts of the game was the credits. They're narrated by the actors playing Ky and Naia and it's probably the most enjoyable credits sequence I've experienced in any game.With that out of the way, let's get down to the nitty-gritty: the gameplay. In essence, Before the Echo can be broken down into two parts: rhythm battles and RPG-style item synthesis. On each of the seven floors, your primary goal is to collect the materials needed to create a key that will open the door to the next floor. To obtain these ingredients you must battle nearby enemies. After defeating them, you have a chance at obtaining various items that will likely be useful in synthesising items such as armour, weapons, new spells and the required key. Sounds good, right? The problem is that some of these items have a relatively low drop chance and you're often forced to play the same 2-3 minute battles over and over and over again. In fact, on the seventh floor, I had to replay the same battle 13 times before the item I needed for the key dropped. It can be absolutely infuriating being forced to do the same battle again and again. On the bright side, the battles themselves are pretty fun and incorporate some very unique ideas. Once you begin, you're presented with three different boxes on your screen. One is for attacking, one is for defending, and the third is for regenerating mana. Both you and your enemy have a health meter and it's your job to deplete theirs to zero before they either do the same to you or time runs out. So, where's the rhythm, you ask? Once the music begins, each of those boxes becomes flooded with arrows. As arrows come down, you need to hit the corresponding arrow key. So, when the enemy's attacking you, you'll need to hit the arrows in the defence box. When you're attacking, you must hit all the arrows in the attack box to pull off spells. The catch? Only one box can be active at a time. Whilst you can see them all on screen at once, you have to swap between them using the Q and E keys to be able to interact with them individually. This can lead to some particularly hectic moments, especially on the higher difficulties where choices must be made on whether to sacrifice your attack to defend or vice versa. It's a very clever and intense little system that can provide a great deal of challenge for veterans of the music genre. To actually attack your foe, you must choose and cast spells assigned to your sphere by hitting the corresponding numerical key. At first, you can only take a couple of spells into battle at once, but by the end this can be expanded to seven. New spells are learned by synthesising items and passing specific musical challenges. The attacks themselves include direct damage, damage over time, healing and more. There's a decent variety, but the real strategy comes in picking one spell over another. Do you pick a spell that does more damage but has a shorter recharge time? Do you take the most powerful healing spell even though it requires a huge amount of mana to cast? The spell choice adds a much needed layer of depth to the game. If that doesn't sound hard enough then don't worry, it doesn't stop there. Each floor of the game has a guardian that presides over it and can interfere in each battle. By exercising their individually unique powers, guardians can seriously hinder your progress. Some can drain your mana while others can reverse the position of arrows, block your view of the arrow grids and even change the playback speed of the song. Once you finally forge the key and finish a floor, you then must then confront the guardian and defeat it. The guardians attack far more aggressive than regular enemies and the battles tend to have shorter time constraints. It's great fun. Underlying all this great fun, however, is one massively poor design choice: synthesising items costs experience. Picture it: you spend an hour destroying enemy after enemy and collecting all the items you need, only to fail your synthesis and lose two levels worth of experience. It's incredibly frustrating. Each time you synthesize you are literally betting your hard-earned experience to increase or decrease the chance of success. On later floors it can be utterly devastating to lose so much. At least you don't lose the items, I guess. The music used throughout the game is of fairly good quality. Fitting in with the theme of the game it's mostly electronic-sounding, which will really be a hit or miss thing for individual players. The tracks used during battle are solid, but there just isn't enough variety. Across the seven floors there are only around 10 songs used, and you're stuck with the same song for each battle. So, if you're fighting that same enemy five times, you hear the same song five times, which gets monotonous. Outside of the battle the music just sort of merges in with the rest of the game and is easily forgotten. Aesthetically, the game starts off solid but starts to disappoint the further you play. The stylistic, artsy design of the characters and environments are fantastic the first time you encounter them, but they're reused far too often. Background graphics are reused a number of times throughout the game and enemies are palette swapped to an offensive degree. Character design, however, is well-rounded. Each of the guardians sports a unique and interesting design that sets them apart from each other and matches their somewhat stereotyped personalities. Ky may look like a generic hero, but you certainly can't fault him artistically. So, did I enjoy Before the Echo? Yeah, I did. It's a fun game with some great mechanics and intriguing ideas going for it. If there was reduced experience gambling, less incessant grinding and a few additional songs, it could have been a far superior game. It may not be hardcore enough as either a rhythm or role-playing game for some, but there's still plenty here for both camps to like.			"

												A rhythm rpg? In the weirdest mashup since Puzzle Quest, this brilliant little indie game manages to create a unique niche and thrive in it. The writing turns some people off but I enjoyed it and found it relatable. Maybe that says more about me than the game itself. It definitely gets grindy, but the mechanics are very unique. Can frequently be purchased super cheap. Give it a shot, you'll probably be surprised.			"

												I've been buying a lot of bundles recently, I picked up ~20 in July, and Sequence has been one of my favorite pulls thus far. *NOTE: This review will be fairly biased, as I enjoy dj-ing/mixing electronic dance music.If you like rhythm games like Tap Tap Revolution, music - in particular the electronic dance music genre, grinding, and crafting, then you will really enjoy this game. Ronald Jenkees does a lot of the music for the game, and if you like his style then you will love the music found here.The aesthetics of the game are nice - the artstyle for the characters and backgrounds are well-detailed. The music is very, very good, however, if you do not like the electronic genre, then you may get tired of hearing the music, and this is critical because it is the core of the gameplay and (so far) the variety is not too expansive. You will also grind quite a bit, so you will be hearing the same tracks repeatedly. The story is decent, nothing too fancy. The voice acting is not bad, and the comedic banter between the main characters is funny at times. There is also some teasing of common RPG elements, which I always find very nice when not overdone.The controls are easy to familiarize yourself with - you use the WASD keyes and/or the arrow keys in combination with the numbers (spell hotkeys) and Q and E. The tutorial is skip-able but extremely important for understanding the mechanics of the game. The learning curve is moderate to difficult - especially if you are not used to playing rhythm games. I am pretty good at beatmatching by ear, so I tried the 2nd hardest difficulty and had to tone it down a level - my finger dexterity on the keys are still rusty; however, I plan to do a playthrough on the hardest difficulty once I beat the game.Gameplay is very, very fun if you are interested in the rhythm genre. You have three windows, Defence, Spells, and Mana. Arrow kills will fall in the Defence and Mana windows, and you can swap your active window with the Q and E skills (left and right respectively). If you fail to press an arrow key in the Defence window, you lose health depending on the type of arrow (basic white color = -1 HP, and so forth). If you fail to press an arrow key in the Mana window, there is no effect.Arrows will only fall in the Spells window when you activate one of your spells with the number hotkeys, however, you must also have enough mana to cast the spell. Failing to press even a single arrow key in the Spells window will cause you to fail in casting it and you will not be refunded your mana. Spells are the way you damage your opponent, and you can also heal yourself. I believe you can only have 4 active spells at a time (you start with 2 slots and unlock more as you progress through the tower).Between battles, you can craft and equip different items. There are 7 floors in the tower you wake up in, and you are given new crafting recipes as you reach new floors. One item will always give a permanent bonus (ex: +1 to offence), and others can be new spells, armor, or weapons. You can also scrap your items for experience points. When you craft, you have to pay exp. to increase the chance of success (you can even pay lose levels if you want to pay that much exp); if you fail, you are not refunded the exp. Levelling up is done automatically, you do not have to allocate skill points. As you progress through the game, monsters will have a unique ""guardian ability"" for each floor - for example, on the 2nd floor enemies (once per battle) can activate an ability that makes the falling arrow keys fade to invisibility as they reach the lower quarter of your window. Listening to the beat of the music really, really helps because the keystrokes tend to match the beat very well. With enough practice, you can even swap windows freely and continue pressing arrow keys to the beat. There is a craftable item for each floor that allows you to ignore guardian effects (except when you fight the bosses).Boss battles are fun and the character's are pretty funny. Each boss will use their guardian effect more frequently, and you cannot negate it with the inhibition item. If you are interested in rhythm games, definitely pick up this fantastic game.Highly recommend! "

												Sequence is an entirely unique game which combines rhythm gaming with RPG mechanics. Three boards drop arrows simultaneously in a DDR fashion - one for attack, one for defense, and one for regeneration of mana with which to attack further. The player rotates between the boards while pressing the arrows in time with music in order to win the battle, gain experience and items, craft weapons, and learn new spells.It's quite fun, if a bit short. The voice acting is quite solid for a budget title, the music is fairly good, and the graphics are perfectly serviceable if quite static - however, for the type of game it is, that doesn't get in the way.The story gets a little odd (if predictably so) towards the end, but all in all, I had a lot of fun throughout. It's more for rhythm game fans than RPG fans, as those mechanics are the dominant ones, but it's definitely worth a look if you want to try something different.			"

												Before the Echo (used to be Sequence) is a game that combines the rhythm game genre and the RPG genre. It combines the element of grinding from RPG games and rhythm game EXTREME TAPPING EXTRAVAGANZA!!! very well, and if you are a fan of both, definitely get this game. This game is only $4.99 and is totally worth it, even at full price. I've never seen a game that has successfully combined two different genres together so well.Before the Echo also has a story included inside of it. I really love all of the character voice acting especially the sassiness of the main characters, Ky and Naia (it's pretty funny because of the amount of sass).There are also automatic saves that appear very often, which is great. Music is also very fun and upbeat as well. Also, this game has taught me one lesson. Multitasking is hard.			"

												This game is surprisingly addictive. While other indie games like Limbo, Braid, etc., may make a better first impression with their stark visual style and challenging gameplay, Sequence is the game I find myself coming back to the most. It's just plain fun. The game has amazing replay value, too. The different difficulty settings mean you can always give yourself a new challenge, and if you happen to be lucky enough to own a PC compatible dance pad or guitar, then there are even more ways to play it, too.I'm not a huge fan of rhythm, but I was pulled in by the game's deep strategy. There is a lot more to this game than just pressing buttons to the beat! In fact, there is so much more to it that it might be off-putting or confusing to some people. In order to be successful, you have to be good at multi-tasking, and there is no such thing as a perfect run on the songs (due to the three-screen system, missing some notes is inevitable).The music is good, with all the tracks distinctive and crisp. The art style is so-so. Another interesting feature of this already interesting game is the story. With a game like this, I really would have expected a tacked-on story or even none at all. However, the developer put in a decent effort to make an engaging tale with a few twists and turns. It didn't blow me away, but it is by no means terrible. It's a little above standard visual novel quality, and while I wouldn't reccomend playing the game for the story alone, I think quite a few players will be pleasantly surprised by just how good it is.All-in-all, one of my favorite indie games. I'm a little sad that more people haven't played this game, as it is a fresh take on both RPG and rhythm games. Definitely needs more love!			"

												Definitely an awesome game for anyone that enjoys step mania, DDR, and possibly even rhythm and music games in general.  However, if you find Step Mania or DDR challenging or frustrating, this game is likely going to be too hard for you.  It forces you to not only hit arrow keys in time with the music in the same fashion, but adds even more layers of difficulty.  There are no color codes on the arrows themselves to tell you what beat the note is on.  So you have to go purely on listening to the music, and sometimes the arrows are just on really awkward notes or tones of the song, like a series of 16th notes where only a few of them have arrows on them.  Tack on that you are watching three sets of arrows at once instead of only 1, having to swap fields of arrows to be hitting, and apply strategic thinking to when to cast spells and what to cast SIMULTANEOUSLY and you need to be so good at something like Stepmania that you don't even have to think about the arrows.  You have to be able to do them almost completely subconsciously to keep up with this game (At least at the Hard difficulty level)  If you're that good, this game will knock your socks off.  It's incredibly fun.The only real downsides to it come from sheer lack of variety.  The game has RPG mechanics for sure, and that includes trying to collect items with a % drop rate.  Meaning if you get unlucky (And you WILL get unlucky) you may be grinding the same exact monster for half an hour.  Which means the same damn song for half an hour straight.  What is worse, each monster does not have it's own song.  Some repeat.  This can get seriously old.For 5$, this game is awesome.  Something I've never seen before and very well put together.  And at that price, the lack of variety is understandable.  Personally, I'd love to see a sequel, and would be happy to pay four times as much if they just make sure to really crank up the variety so the game isn't such an awful feeling grind at times.  The foundations of this game are rock solid.  It just needs a few more coats of paint.     "

												Definitely an awesome game for anyone that enjoys step mania, DDR, and possibly even rhythm and music games in general.  However, if you find Step Mania or DDR challenging or frustrating, this game is likely going to be too hard for you.  It forces you to not only hit arrow keys in time with the music in the same fashion, but adds even more layers of difficulty.  There are no color codes on the arrows themselves to tell you what beat the note is on.  So you have to go purely on listening to the music, and sometimes the arrows are just on really awkward notes or tones of the song, like a series of 16th notes where only a few of them have arrows on them.  Tack on that you are watching three sets of arrows at once instead of only 1, having to swap fields of arrows to be hitting, and apply strategic thinking to when to cast spells and what to cast SIMULTANEOUSLY and you need to be so good at something like Stepmania that you don't even have to think about the arrows.  You have to be able to do them almost completely subconsciously to keep up with this game (At least at the Hard difficulty level)  If you're that good, this game will knock your socks off.  It's incredibly fun.The only real downsides to it come from sheer lack of variety.  The game has RPG mechanics for sure, and that includes trying to collect items with a % drop rate.  Meaning if you get unlucky (And you WILL get unlucky) you may be grinding the same exact monster for half an hour.  Which means the same damn song for half an hour straight.  What is worse, each monster does not have it's own song.  Some repeat.  This can get seriously old.For 5$, this game is awesome.  Something I've never seen before and very well put together.  And at that price, the lack of variety is understandable.  Personally, I'd love to see a sequel, and would be happy to pay four times as much if they just make sure to really crank up the variety so the game isn't such an awful feeling grind at times.  The foundations of this game are rock solid.  It just needs a few more coats of paint.     "

												I started playing and could not stop until I finished the story.Everything about this game is great. The story is mysterious, the characters have personality and are well-voiced, there is a simple crafting element, and the sense of incremental progress that you want in an RPG. The rhythm mechanic works very well! It keeps battles interesting and fun.My only complaint is that there is not enough music. The system in this game deserves a wide array of music. There were only ~12 battle songs throughout the game. I found myself a little disappointed when I'd face a new monster or boss and think, ""Oh, it's this song again."" I do like the quality of the music, and would prefer quality over quantity, but the ideal case would be both. :)If you are a fan of rhythm games and RPGs, this is the game for you!9/10			"

												While both rhythm games and RPGs are not unknown land to me, a game that combines both of them in an almost seamless way made for a very unique experience. The overall visual design is good, especially in terms of colour and consistency, and the voice acting just adds another layer of quality. The story itself puts a bit of a twist on the caught-in-a-video-game trope and is well-worth the play, and the characters are quirky and unique enough to be interesting. What stood out in terms of writing though was the humour which was present throughout the whole of the game on many different levels, such as dialogue but also e.g. weapon descriptions. It knows its audience well. Of course, as a combination of two genres, the game, while scratching the surface of many gameplay features (e.g. crafting, character equipment choice), cannot reach the depth of e.g. an RPG in terms of gameplay, and, unsurprisingly, every rhythm game could do with even more songs. Still,  Before the Echo  is a lowly priced and highly recommended hidden gem.			"

												If you've ever seen or played Dance Dance Revolution, that kind of sums up the fundamentals of this game. But it is slightly deeper than just hitting the right button with the song rhythm because they throw in some RPG elements like spells, armor, and weapons alongside some basic character stats like hit points and mana. The music is the strong part of the game although so far it's been mostly techno type stuff. The story is vague and dumb. Overall, it's a bizarre attempt at mixing these two game genres together and the execution comes off pretty weak. It's definitely different...I'll give it that.			"

												I always heard great things about Sequence, how it mixed elements from your typical RPG with rhythm game mechanics in a very unique way. I don’t know why I didn’t picked it up earlier, probably because I wasn’t sure if I’d actually like it but truth is I bought Sequence on the Steam Autumn Sale of 2013. Well, it turns out rumours were right and my suspicions were correct. The game is great, it possibly has one of the best soundtracks I’ve ever heard on an indie game and the arstyle looks absolutely beautiful with some nice visual effects. The combat relies on a typical rhythm match game, where you have to press each key at the right time and it’s probably better if you don’t try to press the keys when you see them on the right spot but when they coincide with the music “beat”. The combat screen is divided in three different fields, the Mana field which everytime you match a certain key you regain mana and mana is used to cast spells, the Spell field where you need to match keys everytime you activate one spell and if you miss one key of the combo the spell casting cancels and you still loose your mana and the last field is the Defense field in which everytime you miss one of the keys on this field, that key will deal damage to you. That is about it for the combat, everytime you beat an enemy you’ll gain experience and loot, each enemy can drop three different items and those items are either equipables or crafting materials. The story takes you to a tower where you’re guided by a girl named Naia via an intercom and she explains to you how everything works and that you need to reach the top of the tower which has 7 floors and in order to proceed to the next floor you need to find the required materials to craft the key to unlock the door for the next floor and also defeat the guardian of each floor at the start of it, from what I understand these battles with the guardians are considered boss battles. On each floor you have a safe room where you can equip yourself, craft new items and spells and also learn and practice your spells and also this is where you’ll unlock the door leading to the next floor and where you can choose to battle enemies, from what I saw there’s three different enemies per floor.  I’m gonna be honest and you can probably see by my playtime according to Steam, I only reach the second floor and I’m currently fighting the second guardian but I’m pretty sure II won’t play Sequence anymore, not because I don’t like it, because I really do, but because I’m extremely bad at rhythm games and I found the battles to be rather frustrating for me, which might end up with me taking alot of time in order to beat the game and that kinda makes me sad because I’d love to experience the whole story and unfold the mystery behind Sequence and its world, from what I’ve saw thus far the story seemed to promise but I disliked the voice acting in this game but I do believe you can turn it off on the options menu if you don’t like it either. Sequence is certainly a very unique game and a very good one indeed, but like I’ve said, if you’re not good at rhythm games you’ll have a hard time with it, eitherways you should totally give it a try, it is totally worth your time and money but unfortunately it’s not my kind of game.

												I received this game as part of one of the Humble Bundles, and I'm glad I did!  I really enjoyed this game, and I would highly recommend it.  :)  I also think it is worth the $5 on Steam.  To give you a general idea of this game, it is similar to Step Mania only with an actual storyline.  If you don't know what Step Mania is, it's basically DDR (dance dance revolution) for the PC.  However, Sequence is kind of refreshing because it isn't just arrows flying up the screen to music.  In this game, you have three different sets of arrows that travel down the screen, and you have to switch between the sets.  One is your defense, one is your attack/magic, and the other is your mana.  This keeps things interesting and sometimes challenging (depending on the difficulty).  Yes, you are battling enemies instead of ""dancing"" to music like you would in Step Mania.The storyline is excellent!  There are a few plot twists that you will not see coming, and the characters are very likeable.  The dialogue is probably one of my favorite parts of the storyline, and it had me laughing a few times.  The script is usually spot-on for some things that members of our generation would say.As for the music, I like most of the music, but it gets very repetitive very fast.  You'll play through the same songs over and over.  Be prepared for that!  The achievements are very reasonable, and there is no reason why you shouldn't be able to get all but one or two during your first play-through (unless you are doing the bare-minimum to get by).  There is one achievement, however, that you will not be able to get on your own unless you know a little computer programming.  That is slightly unfair in my opinion, but it is what it is.  If you do have knowledge of programming, you'll probably pick-up on it rather easily if you happen to see the right part.As for the difficulties, I played through medium.  Throughout most of it, that was way too easy for me.  There were a few battles later on where I did have a challenge.  The good news is that you are allowed to change the difficult through the first three ""floors"" of the game.  However, things don't get super difficult until you get to the final floor.  If you happen to lose a battle, you still gain experience in most small battles.  You are also given a chance to repeat with no penalties.  This is actually really nice, especially in those bigger challenges.  However, it may make the game a little too easy for some of you hardcore gamers.  Overall, this is a nice, short game that I would recommend!			"

												Sequence is ""an one of a kind"" game. In its core it is a rhythmus game mixed with some light rpg elements. You get experience, levels and items which make you stronger and you can craft some items and you fight monsters.The dialogues may appear childish to some people (not to me) and the story is probably told in three or four sentences. But for me it was interesting enough and left me with a lot of unanswered questions which made me curious for a sequel.While fighting monsters you have three ""rhythmus screens"" you can switch freely between: the mana screen (only for regeneration of mana), the defend screen (block attacks to avoid damage) and the spell screen (match the combination to attack with your spells). Watch a gameplay video to get a better impression.As a sidenote you can not choose the music for the game. It is preset and there are ""only"" between 10-15 playable songs. Personally I found them quite enjoyable . Also you need to grind a tiny bit during the game in order to gain experiences and the right items. If those minor things are no problem for you I can only recommand this game to you.			"

												This is a great great great game. If you're into rythm games, go and grab it. The battle interface is great, the controls are flawless, and there are difficulty levels to keep you busy for a reasonable amount of time.If you're into RPGs, however, be wary that this game is not really an RPG. It's much more of a visual novel, with no control of what your character does or where it goes, no side quests, no character customization either at the start or during the gameplay. Also, the synthesis system is a bit grindy, but you eventually acquire items that drastically improve drop rates.Finally, most of the supporting characters are well written and the plot is interesting.

												Stepmania RPG with great voice acting.Only downside is the mandatory grinding which I assume is the artificial way of the dev to increase the replay value, considering that the core gameplay doesn't really change from the beginning to the end, other than giving you more spell slots and increased intensity.Would recommend this to any DDR / Rhythm games fans.

												Personally used a DS4 gamepad for Sequence. Having played through it using only the gamepad, I have no idea how it handles with a keyboard, but I can say that the gamepad felt completely natural to use. Switching through the fields using the triggers was outright cathartic.Sequence is a gameplay-focused game, and the gameplay is as fantastic as it is interesting. The field-based rhythm combat isn't just a novelty, it has handfuls of legitimate merit. I'd even go so far as to call it innovative. The inherent multi-tasking and battle system means that the game is less execution-heavy than you might like, but playing on Hard did mean that Piano Jam left my fingers aching nonetheless. Battle system itself revolves around the use of skills and micromanaging several fields. Things start to fall apart here - the usefulness of skills is determined by your stats (automatically allocated after each level-up) entirely and utterly. Pulling off a skill doesn't nearly matter as much as the stats behind it, and at several points in the game I had to go to a previous area to grind up a few levels because I was simply unable to deal enough damage to defeat an enemy in the time allocated (you only have until the song ends). Taking into account that the insurmountable enemies in question were rather easy otherwise, it was a total chore. Stats don't belong in this game - instead of skillfully outmaneuvering the enemy through sick beats, you're either painfully chipping away at their health pool or utterly annihilating them, and all in the space of about 2-3 levels. The reason this game has so many stats is because it also bills itself as an RPG, and stats are a required part of that I guess. It fails as one. There's no sense of playing a role whatsoever, and the worldbuilding is so thin it completely collapses under itself at several points. All the item descriptions are all completely irrelevant puns (funny ones, but quick wit doesn't flesh out a world), and the entire premise is waved off by the characters as intentionally arbitrary, which tries as hard to engage as a prince betrothed to a simian. This game is about as much an RPG as your average dating sim.You progress through the game through the game's shallow crafting system. Choose an enemy to fight, and they have a chance to drop an item. Use these items to craft an item that will allow you to progress to the next area. How quickly you are able to craft this item depends on whether or not an enemy decides to drop the item. While it should be noted that there are some late-game items that increase item drop rate, the progression remains steadfastly a nightmare. Farming for items isn't fun. Whoever thought it was fun is a monster.Combine this with that crafting recipes requires EXP. On it's own, this is a fantastic idea. However, combined with the stat-dependent gameplay and already tedious farm-based progression, it does nothing but serve to remind yourself how much of a chore it should have been to get through the game, had it not had the lucky break of being legitimately enjoyable to play. I don't see myself replaying it anytime soon, though.The character banter is alright, though the story is so horrendous that I was left shocked by the sheer contrived garage leaking out of that final 10 minute exposition dump that sold itself as an ending. Shocked at a point I'd long since become apathetic. It's almost impressive how bad the plot is. The weak sense of intrigue initially spiked is just dragged out and finally shot like a dying dog. The super secret Sequel hook is hilariously nothing as well.Art direction, I found, was fine, outside of rather cheap-looking UI. There's not enough of it though - there's a total of about 8 area images, and a single sprite per character or monster. No CGs for major events, and even those scarce few images are reused to hell and back. There's budget, and then there's ridiculous.In spite of these problems, I completely and totally recommend that you play Sequence. The choice of music is stellar, the mechanics responsive, and as a whole the game is plain fun. The gameplay doesn't just carry it, it vaults it to the finish line. I'd love to see a sequel.Regardless of its other issues (they're important to know, and I've spent the majority of the review ragging on them as a result), they're superficial to the very meaty game itself. And that's the bottom line.			"

												The writing and voice acting in this game is too good for it to be a five dollar game. The innovative gameplay is worth the cost of the game, but the story and voice acting really makes you wonder why they're only charging five dollars. Be sure to keep playing till the reveal and the ending, which will be worth the effort! "

												Great than Thapster app. It contains a lot of wonderful musics especially the last one with the boss scene, hard like hell but challenging to achieve 100%. The story is basic for me but I have a little surprise of it a bit though.If you like music-tap game so this is the best game I can recommend.And the other thing that I love is the publisher releases their soundtracks for free.

												Great sound track, beautiful artwork, interesting story and a really clever gameplay concept. Can't recommend this enough. My only issue is that the artwork seems to have been designed for a lower resolution (1366x720?) than what I usually see these days, still the overall quality makes it easy enough to see past that.

												I found this to be a great little game that blends music rhythm and RPG elements to create something rare and interesting. The story isn't made with a whole lot of depth, but it is unique and enjoyable. I love most of the songs so much that I want to obtain them separate of the game - but within the game, I find myself feeling soothed and relaxed by the sounds while at the same time my heart pounds as I ""fight for my life"" in keeping with the rhythm. Although I have completed the game, I can see myself returning to it just to have those normally-conflicting feelings every once in awhile...and because of that, this is one of the best indie games I have ever played.

												Hope this will help other gamers and rythm ethusiasts, have fun! ^.^Sequence is a rythm game with an actual story (not a bad one in my opinion), but won't spoil it :P it has combat mechanics which really few games have done it well if any. you have 3 ""panels/tabs"" in which you run the rythms, the atack one, defese one and mana gathering one, it's basics are well explained in it's well made tutorial.Cons:- if you want to 100% can be a tinsy but grindy to get materials for crafting ( YES IT HAS CRAFTING);- for a rythm game it doesn't have that many songs;Pros:- an actual decent story with twist;- good, funny dialogue with great voice acting;- challenging yet fun gameplay;- nice variety of skills;- has crafting and items with boosts and what not's;- cartoony/anime graphics but well made in my opinion;- trains observatory and reflex skills;- story wise doesn't have replayability but it's fun to replay it from time to time;- story easter egg, FIND IT;- not hard to 100%;- you can pause during battles whenever you want; "

												Sequence blends a ton of ideas together, and does a wonderful job of it. It has an engrossing story with believable characters, great gameplay mechanics, the ability to alter your approach to the challenges they give you, and has great music to boot. As a guy who's not too into music and rhythm games, the RPG elements really made me stick with the game, because even if the challenge seemed too great, I knew I could go back to previous floors to get enough XP to give me the small boost I needed, or else just to hone my skills. Though I didn't sit down and play the entire game in one sitting, I found myself coming back to the game once I had started it, which in itself speaks greatly of its quality. In short, I want to thank Iridium for making such a good game, as well as releasing it as part of a Humble Bundle. I'll be keeping an eye out for future releases!			"

												A lot of love was put into this title, and I feel like it deserves due notice. My experience was on medium difficulty of someone who is not musically inclined, though I am a fan of rhythm games.The RPG aspect of the title is somewhat limited. There's three equipment slots, but overall there's a clear progression of ""this item is pretty much completely better than this other one,"" blandly increasing stats, though they -- like all the other items in the game -- may have punny item descriptions or names. The accessories slot, the third item slot, is interesting though -- if you ever find yourself needing certain items to progress, two later-game items let you increase your item drop rate at the cost of decreasing your stats, essentially. Or you can have a more unique attribute like doubling critical hit chance or decreasing spell cooldown. Leveling up is an across-the-board boost to your stats, but one interesting mechanic is in crafting -- you have to trade exp for chance to craft, exp is a currency. The level cap is 34, but you can beat the game in your mid-20s. I beat it at level 28 with relative ease compared to the grinding (more on that later).Spells are acquired to directly combat enemies. They are all balanced differently (mana cost, damage, length of time to cast the spell, spell cooldown, difficulty of the arrow sequence) so there's plenty of choices in gameplay style. You can have a maximum of 6 spell slots to unload direct damage, damage over time, healing, and life-draining spells. There are also two buffing spells that boost the damage of the next spell, and a barrier spell to decrease the number of arrows thrown your way on the defence field. You can ALSO play the game significantly more aggresively by using the Convert spells to trade a bit of health for a load of mana, allowing you to ignore the defence and mana fields if you want to try your skill at hammering out life drain and heal spells in between Converts.The rhythm aspect is definitely its strenth. The higher BPM, the more chaotic. Managing all three fields is ideal for defeating enemies within the time limit of the song and for the most fun in general, as you bounce seemlessly between defending, attacking, and recharging. On medium difficulty, it seems like the game is SIGNIFICANTLY more merciful: players do NOT have to have perfect coordination -- just have an arrow in the space of the outlines and you'll hit it. There's not ""perfect"" or ""ok"" score like in DDR to tell you how precise you were(n't). Perhaps this is changed in the higher difficulties, especially since the game mentions that players who are more musically inclined should play them.One of the weaknesses of the game is definitely fatigue and pacing. For a rhythm game, there are NOT a lot of songs -- about 25 in total, including background music that isn't used in combat, when there are 7 floors of 3-4 enemies each with a boss on each floor. Before getting items to increase drop rate, you may spend 5+ fights on each enemy to acquire their drops. Even with decreasing the number of encounters, you will hear the same songs over and over again on different floors, though spaced out decently well so it's not completely repetitive. If you don't like the two artists who contribute 99% of the music or the combat system itself, then you will not enjoy this game for very long (I highly recommend checking out bits of the soundtrack; not every song is like Piano Jam or On Cue, they tend to be more like Super Fun or Derty).The story starts off fairly cliche and parodying, but it develops over the course of the game. Voice acting is good regardless of content; as an indie game, it's interesting that the programmer/writer also voices the main character fairly well. I highly recommend sticking to it (assuming, of course, a seemingly weak story is the main sticking point to enjoying the game). The final boss throws a curveball into the setting if you didn't pick up the foreshadowing before, and there is a hidden ending. And, of course, perhaps you will enjoy the story throughout because of its humor; others have praised it, but I was ambivalent.Overall, there's at least ten hours of gameplay, likely more for a 100% completion. It has a nice amount of replayability since the game allows you to change difficulty up to the third floor (wherein you should be able to decide the right difficulty for you), an incredibly low price, decent RPG mechanics, fairly unique rhythm mechanics, and servicable art (it's a rhythm game with THREE FIELDS, you have neither room nor need to show much more). A niche title as a rhythm game alone, but one of the best for those who want a rhythm game with progression. Buy it, especially if it's on sale for $2 like it was the Christmas I bought it!			"

A fun twist on RPG playing, but probably one of the first in a long line of RPGing and exercising (if you actually use a dance pad).  I just played using a laptop and it was still great.  Fun animations, and very exciting once you get into the flow of battle/music.  Jamming out while ♥♥♥-kicking, what could go wrong?  Only downsides I see are there only being a limited amount of monsters to fight.

Triple screen DDR RPGDDR = Dance Dance Revolution game where you press arrow sequences in time to the musicThis game adds 3 different screens of arrows to make it more brain-meltingly hard. Initially it seems impossible but becomes a lot easier with practice. You earn XP with each victory which you can use to craft items and new spells but the probability of crafting success is never 100% guaranteed.Pros:+ Multiple difficulty levels, Normal difficulty is actually challenging and gradually pushed my (limited) DDR skills to the limit. Improving your DDR skills requires practice and is rewarding.+ Rocking battle music by Ronald Jenkees+ Floor 3 boss made me lol+ Full voice acting + Just plain fun, more fun than a whole bunch of AAA games that I have played and gotten bored of.Cons:- Limited variety of battle songs. They get reused multiple times.- Ending was unpredictable but I personally found the explanation unsatisfying. Hidden ending unlock was very challenging and equally unsatisfying, explaining nothing. - Hardly ever needed to use defensive spells on Normal difficulty- Impatient players may find this game too grindy and/or challengingIf you have any interest in DDR games, this one comes highly recommended.8.5/10			"

												Sequence: 8.5/10The first thing I’d like to touch upon is the engaging gameplay. Think Guitar Hero, but more complex; directional arrows will fall from the screen and you must match them at the bottom, to the beat of the song. But where it becomes more complicated is that there’s “three screens” – one for offense (casting spells, which lowers your opponents health, heals you, etc.), one for mana (which is the resources for spells), and defense (in which you counter your opponent’s attacks; if you match the arrows, you don’t take damage, but if you don’t, you take damage equal to what the arrow is worth). This leads to a very fun experience, because you must decide on the fly if you want to cast X spell at that time, while managing mana and seeing if you want to finish that spell, or negate the damage incoming to you, etc. The spell must be finished completely, without mistake, to be cast; if you mess up one note, it doesn’t do anything, so the more rewarding the spell, the more difficult to pull off. I am not ashamed to admit that I had to shelf my “best” healing spell for a moderate heal because I could never pull it off. The game is at its best when you’re on equal terms with your opponent, having to juggle mana, spells, and defense. Unfortunately, the difficulty isn’t always there, and I’ve been able to literally completely ignore defense and just go for mana and spells. This is okay when the enemy is essentially a “gear check”, so to speak, but it happened more than I’d like. The game has seven floors (perhaps more, I’m currently on floor six of a stated seven), and each floor has a “special power” (that is designed to hinder you) for each fight: for the sixth floor, for example, you can’t see the screens you’re not currently selecting. Another power is that you’re unable to switch screens until the timer is expired, so you better make sure you’re on the defensive screen, or you’re going to be taking a lot of damage.  I would like to note that I was very surprised at how well the (controller, never tested the keyboard) controls worked; I was swapping screens and hitting notes effortlessly, and I can count the amount of times I was disoriented / confused on my hand. Being a rhythm game, the music is important, and Sequence delivers. I’d like to note that I enjoy it so much I’ll be throwing the tracks on my iPod for repeated listening. Said tracks are varied so it’s not just the same type of music, although I do wish there was more variety when you’re grinding; hearing the same song all the time on the same enemy did kind of get on my nerves. But, still, they’re good songs, so I don’t mind much. For each song, the tempo dictates how the notes are going to hit you: if it’s a slow song, there’ll be fewer notes, but they’ll count for more, while the opposite is true for frantic music.  While the story does exist, it’s not very engaging. I am – as I’m sure a lot of others are – tired of the main character waking up and not knowing what’s going on / amnesia / what-have-you. The dialog between the main character and your ally is often amusing (they’ve had discussions which includes ♥♥♥♥♥, “…like a Disney without hidden sexual innuendo, they were missing something”, etc.) that I’ve forgiven the absence of the story. And, without spoilers, the dialog made me care for the plot development about two-thirds of the way through the game, so the plot is a lot better than most games in this genre.My largest complaint is the grinding required to advance in the story. I am at heart an RPG-enthusiast, so I really don’t mind grinding – usually I enjoy it. Sequence, however, doesn’t pull grinding off very well, though. The game employs a crafting element to the game, which is required to use to advance. You can craft items such as permanent health increases, items that disable the hindering “special powers” that each floor uses against you, and, most importantly, key items that allow you to challenge the boss for that specific floor. To get these specific items, you must defeat certain enemies, and upon defeating them, you have a percentage chance to get one of three items that they carry. This wouldn’t be so bad, except you must often get a 25% drop from multiple enemies, and this quickly becomes annoying when they pose no threat to you. Without said grinding, however, the game would be at least half as long, so I don’t mind it too much…but enough to complain about it. ;)Another small complaint is the difficulty curve. In the beginning, it was about perfect for me and my difficulty setting (I chose the default “normal” difficulty), since I wasn’t fully aware of how to time the notes and how the game worked, etc. Then floors two through five didn’t give me many problems…and then the sixth floor is kicking my ♥♥♥. I feel like they’re trying to prolong the game with unnecessarily high “gear checks” at this point. This would be more forgivable if said difficulty curve was more spread out and not super noticeable after having a very easy time previously.Overall, I am very impressed with this gem of a game that I paid $1 for (among two other solid games). In fact, I like it so much that I played five straight hours of it one day, and am planning on putting all of the songs on my iPod to listen to later. While there are some small flaws in my eyes, the positives far outweigh the negatives. TL:DR = 8.5/10; Pro = Gameplay is very fun, music is great, fun dialog.Con = Unnecessarily long, RNG-reliant grinding, spiked difficulty curve.[I played this game offline; I have eight hours logged as of posting.]			"

												This game's a hard one for me to explain- part RPG, part stepmania, all rolled up in an aesthetically pleasing pun fest (I LOVE PUNS) with a great (albeit kinda limited) soundtrack. I can't get enough!It's got nice voice acting, it's a bit of a grind fest if you want to craft and unlock spells (Both grinding and crafting are my kind of thing so these are positives for me), and it's got a neat mechanic of paying XP for items instead of currency! And the pièce de résistance of this game for me is the 3 arena style, where you have three fields of events going at once. One controls your spellsets, one is for defence, and the last one is for your mana pool. Missing an arrow in all but the mana field might cost you dearly! Switching between them is crazy fun, and timing is crucial if you want to chain events up.All in all, beautiful game!			"

												The Puzzle Quest of DDR/Stepmania. A combination that surprisingly works. All with great voice acting and a decent story tying it all together. The soundtrack is also great, but it would greatly benefit from more tracks. The concept of dealing with three sets at once seems daunting, but once you play it, everything just clicks and every battle is a series of rhythmic keystrokes. I grabbed it on sale for $1 and I can't argue with the value. As a fan of DDR and RPG's it was certainly worth a shot and I'm not disappointed. Played it to completion in 2 days. It does get a little grindy if you're trying to 100% the game and it does get pretty difficult (especially if you're not accustomed to the genre), but it's certainly worth a shot.			"

												I’m horrible at rhythm games, I’ve never had the speed and skills to get through the harder difficulties and at the easier levels it feels like it’s to simple and child’s play. So I was kinda meh about the whole idea behind Sequence. But as soon as I got in there I must say that I really REALLY enjoyed rhythm gaming mixed with RPG elements, fighting, spells, mana and so on. Giving my successes and failures a deeper meaning.It surprisingly fun to pull of a combo in Sequence and you’re rewarded with fun characters, good dialogue (not the best voice acting maybe but still fun dialogue). And for the first time I want to get further and deeper through the game… and it’s a rhythm game! The hardcore rhythm gamers will probably enjoy this, and the casual ones will like this, and the non rhythm gamers will still enjoy it for feeling more like a puzzle game.Give this game a chance!Recommended./ Nurgleprobe "

												You wake up in a room with no recollection of how you got there. The last thing you know you were getting ready for bed and now you're here. A girl over the intercom tell you you're in a tower with seven floors and that you have to get to the top to get out. That's it. Oh, and by the way, you have to fight monsters and floor guardians in rhythmic RPG-ish-style battles. Are you confused yet? I was.This game features four difficulty modes and I have to admit I played this on the easiest setting, which for a rhythmically challenged person such as myself was hard enough on the last couple of boss fights. You are free to change the difficulty around in the beginning, though, since you can switch up until the third floor. The gameplay consists of fighting monsters by switching around three different 'fields'. There's a defensive, mana, and offensive field where you need to correctly push up, down, left, right according to the sequence they come down in. The trick is in juggling these three fields, since you're not able to play them all at the same time. When notes (I'll just call them that) come down in the defensive field and you miss them, you gain damage. To damage the opponent, you need to cast spells and hit the right notes in the spell or offensive field. To regain the mana you spent by casting spells, you need to go to the mana field where hitting the notes restores mana. There are quite a couple of spells in this game, ranging from healing spells to direct offensive spells to damage over time. At first it can be a bit confusing, but it does get easier over time. I personally played this game with a controller and often found myself pressing the wrong buttons when in a rush to reach the right field, causing me to miss notes. For me, the controls as such were something to get used to, but maybe it's easier when playing with a keyboard. After each battle you gain a certain amount of XP and there's the possibility of getting items. While XP is used to level Ky, the protagonist, up, it is also used as a currency. On every floor you are given a couple a recipes you can use to synthesize items, gear, and spells. In order to do so, you need to invest some XP into the synthesizing process, a little more if you want a better change of success or a little less if you want like gambling. Spells can be learned by synthesizing scrolls and then 'using' the scrolls - again, with XP. You then need to finish one of the songs with a certain percentage of correct notes or a certain combo streak. The spells learned can then be put into your ring of spells, which starts out with two slots but increases to six as you progress in the game.  Now, the music. The music was the high point of the game for me, as most of the tunes were catchy and didn't really annoy even after a reasonable amount of time spent playing. Outside of the battles I cannot recall any kind background music, though I'm sure it was there. Just not memorable. The sound effects were all right, nothing much to say there. The voice acting on the other hand I really liked. I think the characters sounded real enough, though the script was a bit of a hit or miss at times: I think the topics of conversation and references made might not be everybody's cup of tea.And last but not least, the story itself. So you start out with only knowing you need to get to the top of this tower with seven floors and that your shepherd, Naia, will guide you through via intercom. I won't spoil the story, but you won't find out much more than that until the end of the game. The ending itself, while explaining everything, felt a bit disappointing to me. If this game had relied on the story for its success, instead of the gameplay and banter among the characters, I don't think it would have worked out. All that said, I do recommend this game if only for the fact that it's so cheap and quite a lot of fun. It's not a very long game, it took me a small ten hours to complete from A to Z, but the fun to cost relation definitely says that if you're thinking of getting this game you should give it the benefit of the doubt.

												When I say Sequence is ""DDR with RPG elements"", people give me a funny look.   However, I say that the game is one of the best indie titles I've ever played.  The gameplay takes some getting used to (a whole lot of multi-tasking) but it is well worth it once you step over the learning curve and move into mastering it.  It helps quite a bit that the game boasts a strong soundtrack with the amazing Ronald Jenkees taking up most of the space.The game is ultimately fun, but it is not without its flaws.  Much of the game is repeating songs over and over in order to get materials for new skills and items.  Grinding may be fun at first, but it can get taxing towards the end of the game.  The story is also something to consider.  Its not terrible, but it isn't very special either.  Overall, Sequence is a whole lotta game for only 5 dollars.  I recommend it.			"

It's a kind of RPG with a DDR-like combat system, where you earn experience to level up or spend it to learn new spells and craft new items.And the end result is pretty good with solid gameplay mechanics, a fair level of challenge, an interesting story with well-written dialog and a really great soundtrack (which is essential, given the nature of the game).Also, it's dirt cheap, so if this kind of game seems even remotely interesting to you, then you should definitely get it.

												I’m horrible at rhythm games, I’ve never had the speed and skills to get through the harder difficulties and at the easier levels it feels like it’s to simple and child’s play. So I was kinda meh about the whole idea behind Sequence. But as soon as I got in there I must say that I really REALLY enjoyed rhythm gaming mixed with RPG elements, fighting, spells, mana and so on. Giving my successes and failures a deeper meaning.It surprisingly fun to pull of a combo in Sequence and you’re rewarded with fun characters, good dialogue (not the best voice acting maybe but still fun dialogue). And for the first time I want to get further and deeper through the game… and it’s a rhythm game! The hardcore rhythm gamers will probably enjoy this, and the casual ones will like this, and the non rhythm gamers will still enjoy it for feeling more like a puzzle game.Give this game a chance!Recommended./ Nurgleprobe "

												The game is basically DDR with RPG elements so you can craft drops from enemies to better your stats or learn more spells and harder monsters drop better items. Combat makes you cycle between defence, attack and mana regen modes which is interesting because it means it isn't just about hitting notes on time. Humour is really funny in between combat, characters all look nice and the music is great. HOWEVER the RPG element shoots itself in the foot when you find yourself having to grind the same level 40 time with the same song over and over again because you are trying to get some stupid item with a low drop rate to advance.

												Sequence takes a unique twist on the PC - DDR genre and turns it into an enjoyable experience by mixing in RPG elements.Story - 9.2 (The story and the characters were very well done and kept me wanting to find out what's going to happen more and more.)Gameplay - 8 (The game centers around the management of three fields of arrows rather than just one. The difficulty scales nicely and the bosses are a nice touch to the music-rpg theme. The item drop percentages and item-grinding might turn you away a little bit but it is not that bad.)Music/Sounds - 9 (Enjoyable songs and sound effects but definitely could use more songs to add more of a mix and make it feel less repetitive.)Overall - 9Replayability - 2 (Not much to be replayed here, just achievements and same game different difficulties if you want.)Worth it? - It's 5$ and very well worth the buy.-Minor Spoiler - I'd also recommend you to listen and watch the ending credits, they were entertaining.

												You wake up in a room with no recollection of how you got there. The last thing you know you were getting ready for bed and now you're here. A girl over the intercom tell you you're in a tower with seven floors and that you have to get to the top to get out. That's it. Oh, and by the way, you have to fight monsters and floor guardians in rhythmic RPG-ish-style battles. Are you confused yet? I was.This game features four difficulty modes and I have to admit I played this on the easiest setting, which for a rhythmically challenged person such as myself was hard enough on the last couple of boss fights. You are free to change the difficulty around in the beginning, though, since you can switch up until the third floor. The gameplay consists of fighting monsters by switching around three different 'fields'. There's a defensive, mana, and offensive field where you need to correctly push up, down, left, right according to the sequence they come down in. The trick is in juggling these three fields, since you're not able to play them all at the same time. When notes (I'll just call them that) come down in the defensive field and you miss them, you gain damage. To damage the opponent, you need to cast spells and hit the right notes in the spell or offensive field. To regain the mana you spent by casting spells, you need to go to the mana field where hitting the notes restores mana. There are quite a couple of spells in this game, ranging from healing spells to direct offensive spells to damage over time. At first it can be a bit confusing, but it does get easier over time.

												Sequence is an interesting game wich mixes DDR with rpg elements. As you unravel the curious story of Ky, a man trapped inside the misterious Tower, with no idea how he got there. The gameplay is rhythm based (in the vains of ddr or guitar hero), but you have three ""lanes"" between wich you keep changing in order to attack, deffend and recover your mana. Sounds weird, well it is, but it's fun (even though I'd recomend a xbox controller to play).    Now, the game starts really pretencious about its own plot, and about how ""different"" it is. Usually this is bad, but this is one of the rare ocasions where I'd say it's okay, considering the plot is interesting, well voice acted, and the gameplay is inovative (if a little grindy on the serach for crafting materials).    Finally, the great attencion to details seals this deal for me, you can change not only your difficulty, but the speed your notes run at. Plus, you can listen and play any song you've discovered on the extras menu. If it wasn't for a lack of in-game volume controll I'd have nothing to complain about this Interesting, and quite underrated Rhythm based RPG.			"

												Sequence is a classic RPG, except that combat is performed by out-DDRing your opponent. To defend yourself and cast spells, you need to press buttons in time with moving arrows, which move with the beat of the music. I figured I would like it going in, but it suprised me by surpassing my expectations.Combat is fun. At any time, you can switch between three modes: defending yourself, casting spells, or gaining MP, and there are many ways to approach combat. There's definitely a lot to think about, and having a plan is more important than hitting every arrow. The one downside is that trying to get certain drops can be a grind.The plot is a bit short, but the dialogue between the characters is amazing. This is one of the funniest and wittiest games I've played. The music is enjoyable, but it would've been nice to have more tracks. The art is pretty nice, for being 2D stills. And it's fully voice-acted.This game could easily sell for more than $5. It's absolutely worth it.			"

												Think DDR with a keyboard. Sounds fun yeah? It is. I played through this game using the Easy mode, and it sometimes was a bit too easy, even though I've never played DDR-on-a-keyboard-game. It was interesting with a sort of lackluster story, witty dialogue, fun gameplay, and mediocre art. The characters and dialogue were pretty funny and entertaining, which helped staple this game together a bit better. It had me laughing at some of the item descriptions, names, and thoughts of characters. The only thing that literally had me banging my head against the desk and wishing it to stop was the fact that the music was so limited. There were 3-4 songs per level, and you sometimes had to play them over and over to harvest materials. And also a limited number of artists. I get it, it sucks to pay for licensing, but when the majority of your game requires that you listen to music while pecking at a keyboard, you might want to make sure you get a few more songs. I found myself taking breaks because I was literally sick of the same songs over and over again. I wish this game had more songs, because it was pretty fun to play. I'd give it a higher review if I didn’t physically flinch every time I heard a note that was similar to ""Stay Crunchy"". 5/10			"

												Sequence is a bold game. It seeks to stride across the threshold of gaming and give you a slap on the behind. While it accomplishes this, with it's Rhythm baised RPG-ness, it is also a game that suffers from the traditional flaws of RPG's.In Sequence, the storyline is that you know nothing and by playing the game you learn things. This alone is not worth it, so the characters make witty jokes, puns and whatever else to try keep you amused during this festival of boredom. The problem is that much like with any RPG, you have to grind, and grind you must. In sequence, this involves playing songs over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over  and over			"

												As someone who isn't very talented when it comes to rhythm games, I yelled obscenities rather often during my experience with Sequence. But with the intriguing story, funny banter, and amazing soundtrack, my lack of coordination still couldn't keep me away.

												How to even describe Sequence? It's a kind of RPG with a DDR-like combat system, where you earn experience to level up or spend it to learn new spells and craft new items.And the end result is pretty good with solid gameplay mechanics, a fair level of challenge, an interesting story with well-written dialog and a really great soundtrack (which is essential, given the nature of the game).Also, it's dirt cheap, so if this kind of game seems even remotely interesting to you, then you should definitely get it.

												For anyone who has ever enjoyed a Dance Dance Revolution kind of game at any level, there is an appropriate difficulty setting in here for you. And on the easiest setting it may even appeal to fans of RPG without any sense of rhythm. It caters to the whole range very nicely. And since it lets you change the difficulty as much as you want for the first few levels, you can play around until you find what is comfortable for you before it is locked. But keep in mind the tutorial is the same easy difficulty regardless of what you have chosen, the real level starts after it, of course. :)And the music is pretty nice too.I enjoy this game, and recommend it for any and all of the above.

												I really don't get some of the negative reviews here. First of all, it's a rhytm game - a very specific genre, which is, well... about keeping the rhytm and there isn't usually much else to it. RPG elements, like equipment, levelling up, crafting, are a very nice twist to it - but that's it. It's still a rhytm game - and if you don't enjoy things like DDR, Osu! etc. - you probably won't enjoy Before the Echo, either.As a huge enthusiast of both mentioned genres, I enjoy the game greatly. I admit, the grinding tends to be quite monotous and gets boring after a while - then again, you don't have to be like me and craft every item possible. As long as you keep defeating different enemies, you shouldn't get easily bored. Humor and the story, though simple and there's not that much of it, make me want to keep going, if just for the sake of satisfying my - and main character's - curiosity about the place he got trapped in.Also, for the people complaining the game's too easy - when you choose the difficulty level at the very beginning, make sure you read the descriptions carefully. It helps. :p			"

												Beaten - 15 hoursBefore the Echo (or Sequence as it was formally called) is essentially a dance dance revolution/stepmania RPG.   Mechanics:- In battle, you can switch between three ""dance"" screens (where you match the sequences given like in DDR). Each screen is useful for one of three things: Mana, Attack, or Defense. So in order to prevent damage to you, you match the sequence on the defense screen.  You also collect items and abilities that you can use during battle.Another interestign mechanic is the game provides you ""recipies"" on each floor. In order to get the items needed to make something, you have to defeat an enemy. Then, to actually craft it, you get a 50% chance of success. To make it greater, you can sacrific XP 9and potentially level).  Pros:- Mechanics are fun- Music is catchy (although can get redundant)- Cool crafting system (although not terribly deep)- You can level up above the necessary requirments if you feel like it to make it easier.Cons- Can get grindy			"

												The true entertainment for this game comes from first the challenge of managing to actually beat anything, then listening to the hilarious dialogue. It's RPG element is kinda cool, but there ARE a very few points in the game where it feels like you're just grinding enemies to get powerful enough. The final bosses are particularly difficult; I got to them around level 30 and had to go get about 5-6 levels before I could even consider beating them.If you really enjoy Rythmn games, the 'combat' is especially fulfilling if you pull off a successful cast while stopping all damage.If you don't particularly enjoy Rythmn games, the dialogue may still even be worth the money to buy this game; it is HILARIOUS. They've taken every chance they've got to make a joke, while still maintaining a somewhat serious tone for the main story, which is actually pretty cool unto itself.			"

												What is sequence? I had no idea when I got this game but when i played it I was amazed. The best way to describe it is an RPG crossed with DDR (Dance Dance Revolution). I gotta say I love the idea of having to swap between lanes in order to attack the enemy or to block  an enemys attack. The only downfall to this game is its lack of a selection of music, (and in a music based game this is a bit of an issue) instead it repeats the same 9-10 songs for each battle. E.G. could you imagine DDR or guitar hero with just 10 songs?See also:DDRGuitar Hero			"

												Very unique spin on an otherwise commonly used rhythm game mechanic.Anyone who has played rhythm games is all too familiar with the standard mechanic of having 4 columns of arrows falling in tune with the music. Sequence manages to make a very strong tactical/multi-tasking game out of it by having 3 seperate grids. One grid is the mana grid, which you use to get mana to cast spells - it's very common to miss lots of beats here in preference to landing beats on the other 2 grids. This is also where the beats primarily follow the song. Another grid is the defensive grid - beats that fall here and you don't hit will reduce your HP until you hit 0 and lose. The other grid is the spell grid. At any time you have the mana for it, you can choose to cast a spell - the effects vary from dealing damage to the enemy, healing, lifestealing, hitting the enemy with damage over time, giving yourself a mana boost, boosting the strength of the next spell you cast. Each individual spell has its own beat combination that doesn't change with the exception of inverting a few presses, left instead of right, etc, and also significant changes between difficulties. All these different spells are balanced by difficulty of input, how much blank space is there in between beats (to allow for swapping to other grids), as well as cooldown before you can cast that same spell again. Anything less than 100% on a spell input results in it failing, going on cooldown, and using up mana.All those different factors result in a very frantic level of multi-tasking that I have never seen in this genre, and continuously leaves me mentally engaged, instead of just sitting back and hitting buttons corresponding to a beatmap all day. Incredibly satisfied with Sequence for gameplay originality and engagement.Music: I'm not that big of an electronica fan, however, Ronald Jenkees has made a good effort to change my mind on that. The music for the beatmaps are all catchy. DJplaeskool did a good job with the rest of the soundtrack.Writing/dialogue: There is a large community wide disagreement between enjoyment and annoyance of the dialogue between the 2 main characters, so your mileage will vary heavily in that regard. What I can say from an objective point of view is that it is very mechanically solid, all the characters in the game have lots of personality, and the voice acting also performs just as well as the writing.Story: The story is neat and fairly original, and with an excellent great reveal at the end.RPG Elements: Probably my least favorite aspect of the game, but they work solidly enough. In order to progress to a higher level in the tower, you need to do the same 3 beatmaps on the existing level enough times to collect enough drops to craft a key to be able to start the boss fight to go to the next level. This part is just fine, since it encourages a not-excessive amount of replaying the same content to a good amount of replayability. By collecting those drops, you can also craft items that make it so your spells are stronger, you have more survivability, and/or a larger mana pool. There's also experience that gets used to improve those stats via level ups, and gets used in crafting. The big reason why I'm iffy on this, is that especially on the higher difficulties, I put myself in a dilemma of whether I just need to get less bad at the game, or if I just need to grind out some better stats to give me a better fighting chance.Overall: All the parts come to work together without any major flaws to spoil the image, and where the game truly excels is its innovative take with the 3-grid system.

												I HATE rhythm games. They're tailored to those with ludicrous skills and timing and don't ever quite grasp the concept of balance very well.I don't hate Sequence because it at least tries to be a bit more generous while still failing to grasp an equitable balance of difficulty. I found most of the experience enjoyable because it's an RPG and it uses interesting mechanics so despite my implied ineptitude, I could apply strategy and grinding to bypass obstacles. It has great audio composition (being a rhythm game, I'd expect no less) and an interesting story. It alludes to a sequel that has yet to come at the time of this writing and the game's been out for some time, but I would probably enjoy it too.I played the game on the medium difficulty and found it challenging, but fun. That broke down when trying to learn the last spell where the difficulty suddenly went to extremes. Because there's an achievement dependent upon successful acquisition of this spell, I found it necessary to replay the entire game on the easy difficulty and still found myself frustrated by the difficulty leap at the same point. Even when I reached the target I was given, it still would not give me the spell because (while not indicated at all) I had to exceed the target. If you want to complete the whole thing, play on easy. If you don't mind missing the achievement and finishing everything else, play on medium. If you hate yourself and your life, there are two even harder difficulties. Enjoy!			"

												This is a bit of a mixed review. The battle system is pretty interesting with the switching between screens and thinking up the best strategies to beat the enemies. I also have fun with the crafting system (but it does make the game grind-y; I find grinding rewarding so I enjoy it, but if you have little patience for that sort of thing, trying to gather all the materials and experience points to craft stuff might get on your nerves). Overall I've spent a lot of hours entertained by the game and am invested enough to want to get all achievements, craft all items, etc. So for the price I think the experience is really worth it (and I even got it on sale).That said - I expected an RPG with a rhythm game gimmick, and got a rhythm game with an RPG gimmick instead... the rhythm game battling is like 90% of the game. But it's not quite strong on its own to be what I'd call an ""amazing"" rhythm game... the music is a bit bland and sounds more like a nice BGM than something to actively enjoy. I also appreciate sleek visuals/designs in rhythm/music games but the battle screen looks pretty basic. This would've all been 100% fine if there was just more besides the battles to the game... like if you could actually move through a map and  meet the monsters in random encounters or something, in a more RPG-y way. Or if the story and characters were more unique and there were more and better written narration and dialogue, in a visual novel-y way. The characters are pretty basic and the dialogue is cringey at times (trying a bit too hard to be witty/funny to be taken seriously, kinda generic, uncomfortable moments like one point where the r-slur is used). Basically I feel like the game is fun but falls short of being Great. Better visuals/music, more varied gameplay, better story/writing - if it had any one of those 3 things, I think it might've been enough. I wouldn't even demand to have all three at once. But as it is, it feels like it falls short of its potential. I think the core idea of integrating rhythm games with RPG in a battle system is really great and that the game could've been better.But like I said, since it's cheap, I do think it's worth its price. So if you enjoy rhythm games you might as well get it because it'll probably provide quite a few hours of fun. If you don't like rhythm games, I'd just say you won't be missing out on much if you pass.			"

												So I really enjoyed this game but some of the mechanics and choices of the game design completely kill this game for me. First, progressing through the levels requires you to farm monster drops from the various enemies. Normally, this wouldn't be too bad but getting screwed by RNG never feels good in any game. After you finally get all of your materials to craft a key to progress, you spend experience to increase the chances that your crafting succeeds. The decision to implement F2P game design into this game is mind boggling. So after you spend all of your experience to craft your key, you end up losing levels and stats which makes you much less likely to be able to beat the boss. In a normal game you could just trust your skills to get you through the level. However, if you don't do enough damage to an enemy before the song ends then you end up losing the battle. I really wanted to enjoy this game. I really did. But the implementation of the rpg system and the horrible crafting system really made me hate it.With the bad being said, I would still have to recommend this game. Even wth all of the systems that I really dislike, the game still has me enjoying the musical gameplay while frantically switching between the different styles.TLDRPros:unique gameplaygood soundtrackCons:hate the story and characters (subjective)annoying rpg/crafting systemcan't turn up/down in game soundRNG sucksGrindyWoud still recommend even with the cons			"

												Sequence is a Hybrid of a Rhythm game and an RPG. Every combat is done in the way of a rhythm game like, say, Guitar Hero. With each battle you gain experience, materials and equipment, which you can all use to become more powerful, and face harder enemies, progressing through the story.That may or may not seem like it works for you, but trust me, they've done a damn fine job with it!You're Ky, and you wake up in a Tower, with amnesia. Everything inside feels like a weird game in which you're but a pawn. You life is in danger, or so you're told, and so you fight for survival, learning about the place and its purposes on the way.While the story did feel a bit cheesy for the most part, it did have a few cool ideas, and a few twists to keep it interesting. It's not the main focus on the game, but I think it added quite a lot of character to it. There's not much in way of graphic style in this one. The graphics consist mainly of hand drawn backgrounds and characters, with a bit of animation when they talk. It's not bad, by any means, just not something that you'll play this game for.Even during the battles, each spell you cast (more on that later) only produces a few sparkles as visual effects, but it's just enough not to feel empty. All in all, it's very simple, and let's you focus on the gameplay, while maintaining an appealing look. The only criticism I have of it is that certain spells will overload the screen with particles, obstructing necessary information.Another thing, regarding the interface. Outside of battle it's nothing special, but it's certainly easy to navigate. But when in-battle, it gives you every bit of information necessary without having to look for it too hard. And this is a great since, since this game WILL challenge your multi-tasking abilities (in a good way!).Good job on that! Keeping it simple, yet complete.I would now talk about the music, but music and gameplay are directly tied in Sequence. So I'll try to summarize gameplay and then talk about its strengths and weaknesses.As I said before, you're in a Tower. You're guided by Naia, who gives you recipes as you go along.You go from floor to floor, with a Boss Fight in the end of each.When you enter a floor, you'll be given recipes for Equipment, Spells, and a Key and Inhibitor for that floor. There are 3 enemies in each, which drop 3 different materials, for you to craft later. When you craft the key, you're able to unlock the door to the next floor, and fight the Guardian.Your characters has Mana (to cast spells), Health, Defense (to lower the damage you take), and Offense (to increase the damage you deal through spells).You can improve these either by leveling up, or by wearing different pieces of equipment. Equipment is mainly linear in its progression, without many sidegrades. Trinkets, on the other hand, are a bit different. These can improve your spells' cost, their cooldown, make battles harder to improve item drops, etc. These are actually more tailored for different types of gameplay, and some have pretty cool effects.Some you get by crafting, others you can get by enemy drops.The Inhibitor is used to lower the Guardians' effects (more on that later).Then, there are spells. You can craft them, and then have to learn them. How do you learn them? You play a certain track on the game, with an added challenge (which can be a note streak, or a given accuracy). These are carefuly designed, as they would be in Guitar Hero, with different button presses following the notes' pattern (to an extent, of course).They weren't too hard, mostly. But the final one was way more challenging, but also very fun to play, so I won't complain.This pretty much it for when you're outside the battles.How are the battles, then?Well, there will be arrows falling, to the beat, and you'll have to press them. Pretty simple. But that's not all, of course.(There are single notes, or doubles. For these, you have 2 sets of ""arrows"" on the controller/keyboard, to make it easier, specially on a controller. It works really well, and you'll find yourself a master of it by the end, and it feels great! The game does a very good way to constantly challenge you, making you better, without being frustrating.)In every battle, you have 3 screens you need to pay attention to. One, is your Defense screen. Each arrow you miss here will damage you, so you need to keep an eye on it.Another one is your Mana screen. This one has the same spell learning pattern, making it the closest to the song, with a lot more notes. Each failed note doesn't penalize you, but you gain one Mana for each note you strike, which is needed to cast spells.Finally, you have your Spell screen. You have a spell wheel, with your different spells (you have a limited number that you choose outside the battles). Each has a different effect and costs more/less mana, with a bigger/lesser cooldown.Each time you activate a spell, its notes will start dropping. The spell is cast if you strike them all. If you fail a single on, bye bye mana.That's it, mostly. Your objective is to lower your opponent's life before he does yours. Every piece of information (damage dealt, received, mana, etc.) is easily visible to you, which is great.You will be constantly switching between these 3 screens during the battles, which sometimes gets a bit chaotic at later stages, but never too bad. The whole game is a constant balance between when you can afford to take damage, when you need mana, and so on, rarely feeling stale!With each enemy is a song associated, so you'll repeat some on them quite a lot for their items/experience, but it's not too grindy.One more important aspect is the Guardians! Each one has a special ability, that'll mess you up, during their fight, and the fights in their floor. These can go from obstructing your different screens (so that you need to be there to see what's happening) to accelerating the tempo of the songs, or the last one, that switches the arrows. This one was diabolical. Everything you had learned goes to hell, and you need to play everything in reverse. But it doesn't last long, so it's all good. It's these differences that keep some of the battles very interesting, and you never know when it might throw you off of your comfort zone! The music was done by DJPlaeskool and Ronald Jenkees. It's a mix of electronic/synth music, with a bit of rock. It's wasn't something I was into at the start of the game, but it started growing on me. I ended up enjoying the music quite a bit, although I won't listen to most of it outside the game. Although, the last song, and so freaking epic... Man, I wasn't expecting that. That song had changes in tempo that worked great musically and from a gameplay standpoint! (It's called Piano Jam, search it on youtube). That one I'll be listening to for a while. Great job!So, I enjoyed the music, but I do believe it lacks a bit in replayability comparatively with other rhythm games. But it's also a very unique and very well designed game. I ended up enjoying it way more than I expected, and it had many brilliant design choices. There isn't much negative to say about it, really, aside from having to grind a bit, and perhaps looking a bit too simple. But even that didn't really lower the experience much for me.I really enjoyed Sequence, and I think it does a great job of mixing the rhythmic combat and RPG elements.One thing though, is that during the battles, while the notes do fall on the beat, there isn't as big of a connection to the notes and there is on the Mana screen (or the spell learning). Each spell has a pattern (with some random elements) that is independent of the song, and the enemies as well. So, it might not feel like like you're playing the music.But I don't think it detracts from it too much, and those modes are still present.Sequence is surprisingly great! "

												Sequence is a rhythm game/RPG hybrid. Now, before you scroll past this review, hold up a sec. I never liked rhythm games either, and I'm having a blast with Sequence.Why, you ask? Well, the whole rhythm part of the game blends seamlessly with the RPG aspect. Your character has an inventory, stats and all that RPG jazz (though no choice and consequence so it's not a REAL RPG!), and from his equipment and statistics come his fighting abilities. Ky (the hero) fights with spells, casting them at his enemy if you input the correct rhythm sequence. He also has to defend and regain mana, also done by inputting the correct rhythm. Now, while he's casting spells, he can't defend or regain mana, unless you quickly switch screens during your rhythm input, a tactic which is unnecessary in the beginning but becomes more and more vital as the game goes on, and spells start to have pauses between their prompts.This whole combination of RPG and rhythm game is brought with wonderful humour. Don't expect silly puns, lazy groaners or pretentious in-jokes, the game just approaches everything with a healthy and snarky brand of humour, from the dialogues to the item descriptions. Of course, since it's a rhythm game, the music is a very important element, and it doesn't disappoint. You'll hear a lot of it, but it never bores. The composers enlisted by Iridium to score the game have done a great job, and all the music is extremely engaging to listen to.Again, don't be surprised if you find yourself gnashing your teeth at the screen in the beginning. Once you learn to correctly input the prompts by listening to the music, instead of visually, you'll find it becomes a lot more manageable and you'll improve in leaps. And once that happens, you'll have awesome fun with it!			"

												Similar to Stepmania and Dance Dance Revolution but entirely unique in its own way. Sequence offers an entirely new idea to the practice of pressing arrow keys by utilizing three different windows for different game mechanics. These include The Attack window where you can ready your attack against your foe, The Defense window allowing you to nullify your opponents' attacks, and the all important Mana window with the ability to regenerate mana, which is used to cast spells.The game includes an emotive storyline which will lead the player through he many mysteries that await the protagonist and his 'Shephard'. While keeping the modern-day theme, Sequence maintains a healthy dosage of humour whilst keeping al seriousness intact.When I played this game the music amazed me, it's hard to believe that a game can have so many good soundtracks, and with the game costing so little it's a wonder why more people don't buy it simply for the music. I give this game a 10/10 for originality.			"

												This game serves as a reminder of how socially challenged I am. I loved the soundtrack. I loved the dialogue, character development, voice acting and subtleties in the story (hidden ending). All are very well done.On top of that, the game is a really unique experience. The RPG elements are well balanced and the gameplay is skill dependent. In my opinion, this game actually has replayability if you're fan of the rhythm genre. If you're a hardcore rhythm genre fan, I recommend playing on spasmodic difficulty. The gem sequences of the songs are well done and intuitive, and on spasmodic difficulty the gameplay feels very satisfying. For the price, it's a complete steal.			"

												I bought this game because I happened upon a fifty percent off cupon for it and figured why not just give it a shot. So far Sequence has exceeded my expectations on many levels. Despite being a DDR-like game that is fun and addicting in it self. With all of the spell pickng and the mana pools. It also has a very compelling story that makes me want to keep playing it even  when it's been 2 hours. On top of that the music is phanominal I only wish there were more songs. I highly reccamend that you play with a controller rather than a keyboard. While it is playable on a keyboard I can get tricky when selecting spells. All in all for a game I just picked up on a whim Sequence has been one of my best investments on steam thus far.			"

												You juggle three separate beatmania windows (defense, spell casting, mana regen) in a story like tetris attack.And now time for me to take a ♥♥♥♥ on this game and explain why it's bad. There's a drop system, but you almost only get ingredients--which means there's a craft system. The only way to get the keys you need to acess the next level of eneimes and progress in the game is to hope the levels drop the ingredients you need and THEN hope you succeed in crafting. Every time you craft you sacrifice your exp (INCLUDING LEVELING DOWN) and here's the kicker: you can fail to craft, which will expend the exp regardless. It almost sounds absurd how badly this game wants to eat your time while pretending it's fun. If time is money then this game is on the same level as those horrendous microtransaction modeled games. The poorly voiced dialouge is littered with social justice warrior overtones (I wish I were joking), and since all your fights are timed you'll end up wanting or needing to grind levels to hit harder faster. OH WAIT I SPENT MY EXP AND LEVELED DOWN BECAUSE THE RNG REFUSED TO CRAFT PROPERLY. Don't worry though, you can increase your chances to craft successfully by.........spending more exp per attempt.Uninstalled, I regret spending money on this ♥♥♥♥ fest.			"

												The mashup of RPG/rhythm is very cool, and switching between the different aspects of the battle is a great idea.  That's where my praise of this game ends.In one of the worst openings to any game I've ever played, we are immediately subjected to terrible dialogue with worse voice acting.  Every line is delivered awkwardly and with a shoehorned-in joke.  The writer goes out of their way to try to poke fun at RPG/gaming stereotypes, and not a single joke lands.  If that wasn't bad enough, we're subjected to approximately 20 minutes of tutorials before we can even play the game.  A character even calls the game out on having too many tutorials, which begs the question why this was not fixed prior to release.When we finally get to play the game, we find that we're in for a repetitive, non-stop grind.  Let's go through the steps it takes to learn a new spell:  1) grind multiple battles against one or more enemies. 2) craft the spell, which may fail, requiring repeat of step 1. 3) learn the spell, requiring you to play a mini-game, which is a more boring version of a regular battle, oh and by the way the song is the same song you heard 6-7 times during step 1.  What should be an exciting aspect of an RPG (learning a new spell, oh boy!) is instead reduced to a slog.  And that, in a nutshell, is Before the Echo.Stay away from this one.			"

												Sequence is probably the first game ever that has combined a rhythm type game with RPG. Make no mistake this is an indie game, the rhythm feature is rather lackluster and the watered down RPG leaves a lot of be desired. The developers claim that this game should take you 12 hours, ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. It will take you 6 hours max to beat this game if you skipped item farming. Combine item farming with the rather limited collection of music and you are in for one hell of a repetitive ride. Luckily this game makes up for all of its errors with its impressive voice acting; the various bosses you meet have various distinct personalities that make them super memorable. The game presentation is also very beautiful and organized. The music, although limited, is ridiculously catchy. Finally the game base price is five dollars that alone negates every negative thing said about this game! Go buy it and promote creative indie development.			"

But what makes this game worthy are its dialogs (with a good voice acting) and descriptions of the items. Trust me, you'll laugh your ♥♥♥ off xDOh, it has 5 difficulty modes so it's not only for pros, don't worry.You can even play it with a dance mat! But I recommend you to play it with a regular gamepad.Of course there's always a downside: there are few songs and most of them are meh.

												As someone from the DDR generation, it takes a lot for a rhythm game to receive a good review from me. Keep that in mind when reading this review.Before the Echo is a very interesting approach to the genre. It combines RPGs and rhythm. During the game you equip your character with various equipment and spells and fight monsters.Fighting monsters is accomplished by toggling between a magic, defense and mana field and trying to hit the arrows at the proper point. You will frequently find yourself choosing between recharging your mana, defending against enemy attacks, and using magic against the enemy.This combat approach is very well implemented when using a controller. They obviously put a lot of thought into it, and it makes sense. The music is fine. It didn’t stand out as anything special to me. I didn’t really “feel” it though, so it was more a matter of watching the arrows than listening to the beat. This can probably be improved by ensuring your audio settings are correct. I have mixed feelings about the tutorial and plot. The tutorial accomplishes its purpose well, after playing through it, you know how to play the game. The plot consists of waking up in a tower, having a snarky/sarcastic woman tell you what is going on, and then fighting monsters to get a key to move to the next floor. I don’t know more than that, as the game quickly lost my interest. I was very glad we have the ability to skip the plot scenes. I found the character’s interactions very annoying. Despite being well designed, the game didn’t grab my interest. It felt like it was missing something. It is inexpensive enough that fans of the genre might as well give it a try, but casual players should look elsewhere.			"

												Wow. Sequence, we've got a lot to talk about.Sequence is basically a DDR/ITG + RPG mashup, which may sound odd, but it works pretty fluently. Even as someone who's been an avid fan of the four-arrow dance games for over a decade, it took me a while to get fully accommodated with Sequence's unique gameplay.However, one thing I certainly did not expect from a game like this was a compelling plot with brilliantly well-written and fully voiced characters. Sequence's story gives the game a lot of depth and was probably the driving factor for me. Definitely a huge highlight of this game.I could nit pick for quite a while, though. The music isn't anything extraordinary, it can be a bit grindy at times (as both item crafting and item drops are chance based), and the battle interface could use a little bit of work to make it easier to see what spells are ready, what the mana cost is, how much you have at the time, etc. Since I played with the keyboard, having all the tutorials and controls based around a 360 controller was also a tad confusing.Sequence is pretty fun and I would recommend it to rhythm game/RPG fans or people who enjoy a really good story.

												Oh dear God I love this game. This is a really addictive and difficult (On hard difficulty at least) rhythm RPG. You have to switch between three panels, each of which you can see in the background even if you're not using them. The defence panel is to stop attacks that enemies throw at you, any missed will cause you to take damage. The spell panel comes up with the rhythm of any spell you cast, and missing even one will cause the spell to fail. Finally, the mana panel has rhythm which fits the song and replenishes the ability to use spells. Very difficult to keep track of the three, yet whenever you mess up you KNOW it's your fault. It also lasts a fair amount of time, however the necessary random drops can be quite frustrating. ALWAYS make all items you can on a floor, they will be needed.			"

												Sequence is a cool RPG/Keyboard & Controller DDR hybrid where you switch between 3 panels of moves in order to defeat your enemies. You can craft weapons, armor and a bunch of other items to make your character stronger as well. While the game has some really cool concepts, it failed to keep me interested for long. Despite all of the different spells and abilities you can use, the game started to feel tedious to me.This is by no means a bad game; the gameplay mechanics are pretty decent, and while the voice acting and writing are semi-cringeworthy, Sequence is definitely worth a try if you see it on sale.6/10			"

												If you like DDR-esque games this could be a good choice for you.  It has good writing and passable voice acting to go alongside it.  The gameplay is novel and has some tactical depth to it as well.It is however a very obvious straight console port.  Without an analog stick you cannot preview spells before casting them, making it difficult to tell when you have enough mana without simply memorizing the mana costs.Another negative is the fact that it has no volume controls in the game at all, and the sound effects are kindof terrible.  The music seemed okay I guess.			"

												One of the best rhythm games out there. Combines an awesome soundtrack by Ronald Jenkees with very unique and fun gameplay. You have 3 DDR-like ""boards"" playing at the same time, one where enemies deal damage to you if you miss the notes, one that you can miss that lets you build mana, and one that only starts playing when you have a spell to cast. The game includes RPG elements in the form of item drops and crafting (which gets you more spells and more ways to get an advantage over enemies). Also has some nice art, decent story and entertaining characters. Would definitely recommend for its current price.			"

												Kind of a nice rhythm-rpg hybrid. Doesn't work quite as well as some of the better puzzle-rpg hybrids. A bit too busy at times in the battles, due to the shifting focus. Suffers for me from not being able to alter the difficulty by song. Some are very much tougher than others to do well during, and I just found myself turning down the difficulty instead of working to improve my coordination like I would with Rock Band/Guitar Hero. The sound track is mercifully quite nice to listen to, including a few real gems. The game needs some work to be really good, but I look forward to a potential sequel. 3/5			"

												So I heard you like music, rpg, good humor and have fast fingers? This game is for you then. I'm not sure how I got to this game at first - btw it was called Sequence, but they had to rename it. I think I got to this game trought some sale ticked from crafting badges on steam and I'm very happy that I bought it.I have never seen a game like this - it combines a lot of elements that I love. It's fun, but it can make you rage ofcourse too, cause some music fights are real hard - atleast for me. Game has it's real own real nice athmosphere.Pros and cons:+ mix of game features+ graphics+ story+ humor+ music+ bis emoticons on Steam- missing volume settings(or at least I can't seem to find one anywhere and the in-game music/sound is higher than my normal and I don't like editting my volume everytime I play it)- most of the time u are pressing arrows in the fight - even tho u need additional keys for switching between attack/defense/mana and for spells, it would be cool if you could use dancepad for playing this gameConclusion:If you are a person who loves good games you should give Before the Echo a try for sure.

												One of the best rhythmic games out there. Other then that, it's a mix between that and RPG style progression. I'll give ya a list of pros and cons so you can better decide on whether you should buy Beyond the Echo. I personally recommend the game. By the way, don't mind ♥♥♥♥♥♥ Metascore for the low rating, and I mean that for this game and for all the other games out there. Enough rambling though.Pros:- Very, very low price.- Amazing soundtrack!- Original gameplay.- Beautiful hand painted scenarios.- Mix between rhythmic and RPG genres.- Awesome setting!- Prequel to ""There Came an Echo"".- Really funny parts!- Over 12 hours of gameplay for such a low price!- Quality voice acting.- Cuddos for the ending sequence.- Credits scene! Cons:- Can get grindy after a while, due to repetition of certain songs.- Rather simplistic, yet enjoyable gameplay.- The final boss fight is simply to easy! Learning the final scroll should be the ending sequence. (it's so god damn hard!)- No more cons, so just buy the damn game already!

												Before the Echo (formally sequence) is a game with many good ideas.  This is a shame, because it buries them in terrible design and writing.Let's start with the good.  The basic gameplay of the game revolves around a rhythm based combat system. This is similar to DDR or Stepmania, but with three step charts (one for your attacks, one to defend, and one to recharge your mana).  This system is intuitive and rewards both musical ability as well as strategy (primarily for when you attack).  If this game was just a series of songs which had to be defeated using this system it would have been great.Unfortunately the game has been lengthened with the most obnoxious forms of grind.  To get to the next boss fight and to proceed to the next area, you must craft a key.  To get the items for crafting the key you must fight the three monsters on your level.  They have a random chance of dropping various items, with some of the required items having a very low chance to drop.  And on top of this, crafting isn't guaranteed.  You can sacrifice your XP (and possibly lose levels) to increase the chance of success, but the success rate caps out at 95% so you can still fail.  If you do fail you lose everything and have to repeat your hunt for those items from scratch.This means that the game very quickly forces you to repeat the same fight over and over and over again, long after it has ceased to be challenge anymore.  This completely killed any enjoyment I had for the game.  I have a feeling the developers added these grind elements to lengthen the amount of time that people would play the game, but it had the opposite effect for me.While the grinding aspects are what kill this game, I should note that the writing is also horrible.  Absolutely everything in the game, from the dialogue of every single character and every single item description, is written in this ironic hipster tone.  This might have been amusing if it had been done in moderation, but as it is every bit of text in the game is trying to show you how funny it is, when very little is even amusing (unless you find lines like ""I feel like my brain got stabbed by a hobo"" to be hilarious).  It also kills your sense of immersion when absolutely every character is aware (and comments on the fact) that the game mechanics don't make sense and seem to be completely artificial.			"

												Not my kind of game.  You combat bad guys by using one of three panels.  Spells to attack/defense, gain mana, and defend.Basically you use a controller or keyboard to press arrows as they fall, like a DDR for your fingers.  Unfortunately I could not see myself enjoying it.I can see that it is well made, with ingame voice acting, and a thought out combat system.... but it is a niche game and this type of niche game is not for me it would seem.

												This is an extremely fun game. Just like how Puzzle Quest: Challenge of the Warlords introduced RPG elements to make Bejeweled better (and succeeded), the introduction of RPG elements to the music game genre made it better as well. Grinding is a little tedious, since each monster you fight has one specific song they use, and you will need to fight it multiple times to get all the items necessary for crafting, but with only a few exceptions, the songs are ALL good. The game is stable, the art style is pretty cool, and the voice acting is funny at times. It's easily worth $5, especially if you like music games.			"

												I love rhythm games. Stepmania used to occupy all my time when I was younger, but this game is just so messy. Casting spells then waiting for them would create awful timing where you'd end up having to defend yourself by the time your spell appear, so you'd have to stagger your timing, and failing a spell will punish you with reallocating your timing between attacking and defending to regenerate your mana. To make it worst, each fight is a timelimit based on the song's length so if you get to a choppy start, you're pretty much screwed. Timing is everything with rhythm games and for me there's just too much to keep track for me to enjoy actually playing the game.Plus, this game is a pain in the ♥♥♥ if your play style involves two hands.

												As a huge fan of Rhythm games and RPGs I thought that this game would be amazing, but I am extremely disappointed.While I ultimately ended up playing on Spasmodic difficulty, and am capable of getting 100% on several songs when I 'practice' in the bonus mode, the RPG elements, coupled with the field switching mechanic makes many foes extremely challenging.Speaking of RPG elements, there is absolutely no explanation of the actual mechanical effects of the offense and defense stats. It's logical to assume that defense decreases the damage you take from missed gems, which is in turn multiplied by the gem color, but no indication is given about how much defense reduces how much damage.Coupled with the fact that you can't see actual concrete stats from enemies (only vague bars), and the RPG mechanics seem to be a gimick that was tacked on to a rhythm game to make it 'harder' without requiring them to add more songs or harder difficulties for the songs.Ultimately, I'd rather play something like Stepmania on the harder difficulties for my Rhythm game fix, and then play an RPG like Dragon Age or one of the various Elder Scrolls.I give this game a 2/5. I might have given it a 3/5 purely for the snarky dialogue during the cutscenes, but the audio quality is hit and miss. (You can tell that certain lines were recorded on different days when the ambient sound changes)			"

												I really have to amend my previous recommendation.   This game is good, but it's not as great as I thought it would be.  The lack of RPG elements beyond combat and item use really kind of hobbles the game. This would be great if it fell back heavily on the rhythm game aspect of the game, because that genuinely shines.  The problem is, there are only a very small handful of songs.  Very small.   Each area, you don't get random encounters, you get a small stable of enemies to CHOOSE from.  Combat gets you items to combine into the key that gets you to the next area.  You will fight these same enemies over and over until you get the drops you want, playing through the same light airy techno/electronic music over and over.  The artwork is beautiful, if amateurish (it looks like it's hand painted by someone's really artistic friend), and the dialogue is fan-♥♥♥♥ing-tastic, and delivered very sarcastically and deadpan.  But this doesn't stop the actual gameplay from getting really tedious.			"

												So I got this game for like 50 cents.  It's marked at 5$, so I'm going to treat it like it's a 5 dollar game.It's not worth 5 dollars.  Want a decent 5 dollar game?  Check out Knights of Pen and Paper, or when you grow a sack get X-Com UFO Defense.So why isn't this game good?  I've played tons of rhythm games and this one has 'decent' music, but has no real assemblence of something you could nod your head to and say: yea, this works in a rhythm game.  It simply doesn't and the input is bad.  Now to meet anyone that says: maybe you're just bad at rhythm games, maybe I am, but I the music alone is not motivating and doesn't telegraph much of a downbeat let alone figuring out the count.The game tries extremely hard to be hip and ironic.  Using references of date ♥♥♥♥, crystal meth, and getting stabbed by a hobo in less than 1 minute to get you to say: YEA, THIS IS HIP!It's a huge grindfest that just wares down compared to other grind games [like Knights of Pen and Paper].  You have to find items by selecting monsters to fight, then craft items from those items found, but you have to spend xp to increase the rate of success.  If you fail, everything you bid is lost and you have to go back to the half-hazardly made ACID-Pro electronic music.It's 5 dollars, sure, but it's not at all worth that.  There's so much this game attempts to do that sounds really cool!  [That Bejeweled RPG game series that came out a few years back was actually cool!] This game is not!  It has a lot of things it's trying to do, but all of them are executed poorly.  If anyone can get through this rhythm game and say 'yea this music guides me', then you have an ear I simply do not possess.  The game even says, listen to the music not so much watch the arrows.  If you listen to the music, it will throw you off!  I muted this game and aced every monster I came across.The music is 'good', but it's not good for rhythm based games.			"

												So this is a game that attempts to mash together a RPG and a rhythm game. This wouldn't be bad if it was executed correctly, but it isn't. The battle system is overly complicated, having to control a DDR clone which doesn't even time that well with the mediocre soundtrack on 3 screens at once (having to switch between the one you want). Also, the attempt at humour (that it attempts to shove in your face every 5 seconds) just really isn't that funny. It might actually be one of the least funny games I've played.			"

												At first glance, this game is a unique rhythm and battle game. I would enjoy this IMMENSELY more if there were multiplayer. Fighting against stale AI is pretty dull, but I like it for what it is. The dialog is full of excruciatingly bad deliveries of unwitty jokes and poor ""insightful"" satirical sarcasm that belittles people's intelligence in an almost superfluously verbose manner (as if they are talking to a child). I don't need the explanations of these poor attempts at ""correcting"" whoever they are trying to correct and I am sure most people didn't eg., when they say the word ""Mana"" and say it is pronounced ""Mah-na"", It came off so pretentious and belittling. It would just be so much better if they didn't have this unnecessary dialog for the tutorial, people want to get straight to the gameplay and see if they like it before wasting an hour of dialog! I know how ""Mana"" is pronounced, I am sure most avid gamers are familiar with it and even MTG players. BUT the MAIN character, I guess because of the personality he was given? He speaks FOR me. He called Naia annoying, dear god is she annoying! The voice actor who did her, I don't know if it was a girlfriend of one of the developers or something, but she has that valley girl voice that makes me want to rip my hair out every time I hear her vocal fry. She stutters here and there and fails to convey her credibility as a ""guardian"" in the game. Despite her lines and voice acting being terrible, the main character proves a redeeming glimmer of hope of tolerance. Being there were some sound issues already, I expect way more and some of the sfx are not mixed into the overall game volume very well. The music, thus far, is pretty bland. It would be better if they were all original tracks catered to the players and developers. I recommend the game if you can catch it on sale or in a bundle or if you have a 10-16 year old sis/bro, otherwise I'd say to go find a different rhythm game. If multiplayer comes to be in this concept, then it's on!			"

												Played this for a little more than 30 minutes and it's not what I expected. I expected an RPG with rhythm based combat, like it actually advertises. But it falls short on every level, except for the music. The music is actually something that I enjoyed listening to. The graphics are very basic; the art looks ok, but there are basically no animations. It feels very empty and simple. I'll admit I can't expect a 'retail quality' game for this price, it's true. But still, if you build expectations you better deliver.The combat is a nice idea, but poorly executed. You pick an enemy from a list (I know, right?) and then fight it by pressing buttons on the beat of the music. It's nothing fancy, and about everything is text based, items included. You explore the tower by picking levels from a list as well. Wait, what?There's just no style; it doesn't stand out. There are some cool ideas in it, but like I said, it's really, really poorly executed.Sorry guys, it's not worth the money.[Rating: 69/100]			"

												What you need to play this game well: An additional peripheral. This is mainly because fingers-on-the-keys Dance Dance Revolution is boring as hell. If that isn't an issue for you, the MMO style grind and the constant DDR-ing to cover up for the lack of other gameplay elements may be the killers instead. Not to mention the dialogue was written in an annoying Brenda Hampton (of 7th Heaven) -style 'edgy'. Basically, ♥♥♥♥ this game.			"

												I could really do without the lame dialog and the awkward voice acting. I was willing to look past the poor attempt at Japanese anime, in hopes this was going to be a great mash-up of my two favorite genres. Sadly, this game fell sort of my very low expectations. The main character has only one pose, and two facial expressions (angry eyes, open mouth and angry eyes closed mouth).I give it a 3/10 for pure laziness.			"

												This game is regular rhythm game with small extra gimmicks but little content.In this game, like in other rhythm games, you press different keys (in this case arrow keys) in the rhythm of music. The extra gimmick of this game is that you simultaneously fight against monster and there are different rhytm lines for Mana, Attack and Defence. See some videos about this, if you want to know more as I am not going to explain this further in this review. This little gimmick is not bad, but it isn't revolutionary either. In the end the game is extremely bland and for a person like me who isn't fan of this kind of genre, the game was waste of time excluding funny conversations that the characters make in the story that gave some delight. What makes me not to recommend this game is that it is very repetitive. There is only a few of songs and the gimmick that this game has is seen very quickly.Grade: 5/10I would only recommend this to a person who is fan of this genre and who has tried all other variations of this kind of games.Last edit was to change Grade from 4 to 5 to be more in line with my other reviews.

												The voice acting / tutorial speaker is really annoying. It put me in a bad mood up until the very end when I was trying to complete it and couldn't figure out how to get through that last part because it was explained awkwardly. I was really trying to give it a shot but was in such a horrible mood from listening to that lady and couldn't figure out how to get out of the tutorial that I just gave up and closed the whole thing. I could consider this an unfair review as I didn't put effort into the game past the tutorial, but the fact that it was torture for me up until that point left enough of a bad taste for me to write this.

First time I played it detected my pad and therefore forgot to mention the keyboard keys which I had to find on my own (and you have to rebind them cause they are stupid. Try using the up and low arrows quickly at the same time for example).Second they are not responsive. I've played rythm games before and never had any problems (especially at lower difficulties).Third. The story is non existent, the dialogs are terrible and probably made for 13 year old kids.The voices are so bad it hurts.Fourth the music is bad. It's not electro it's not techno, it's closer to elevator music.Fifth I'll be having nightmares about this game.Sixth first time I'm writing a review but I felt I had to.

												8/10This is the good ol' dance pad game, except you use your keyboard or controller (recommended) to push the right buttons at the right time.You have 3 different... let's call them ""beat displays"":One is for mana (which you need for your attacks or for healing yourself), one is for your attack/s and one is for blocking the enemy's attacks.The story is the average ""You wake up in a strange place, want to get out of there and have to play by the rules of your abductor"" one, but it's still interesting and funny.Conversations between the main character and NPCs sometimes refer to websites like ♥♥♥♥♥ and YouTube, memes like ""That's what she said"" and ""Yo dawg..."" and sometimes they even make jokes below the belt you might have heard before.The game's soundtrack is quite repetitive, but it has a lot of good tracks that are worth it.You like playing with music?

												When I was a kid, I really liked DDR.  I bought this game because I thought it would be like DDR.  I am disappointed that this game is not a whole lot like DDR.I'm having trouble separating my disappointment of this game as a scratch to my DDR itch and how I feel about the game as its own thing.So first I have to say, if you want to buy this game because you're like me and want to scratch that itch, give it a pass.  The objective of this game is to miss a bunch of notes on purpose, which drives me absolutely insane.  Just watching arrows pass by without being pressed.By itself?  I dunno, it's got a lot of cringey humor and some mediocre voice acting.  The RPG elements seem kind of compelling?  But also really confusing?  It just feels really unpolished, I had a lot of trouble grasping how well I was doing because the visual feedback is less than great.  I think, mechanically, this kind of step rythm game just wasn't meant to be mixed with an RPG.			"

												Only the worst sort of game starts by corralling the player into sitting through a mostly non-interactive, twenty-minute-long tutorial consisting predominantly of banter between two characters you've never met before and have no connection with.

												How this ended up in my library I'm not sure, but I have a bunch of games I got in sale packs and I slowly tick them off the list. While I was never huge into any guitar hero or rythm games thus making me a poor judge of this, I played this for about 10 minutes and deleted it with the objective of never trying it again. Maybe someone else likes it but hitting little up, down arrows and trying to make a battle out of it isn't my idea of fun. Parrapa The Rappa was a million times better and 15 years older.			"

												TL:DR - One of the most unique $5 gems you can pick up. Definitely worth checking out.Sequence is a game I strongly enjoyed playing not because of its music, art-style, or its plot, all of which are really well done. It's the unique gameplay that Sequence carries. Yes, on first glance, it's like Dance Dance Revolution. However it's unique because you play three different windows that you can switch to at any time. One window is for defense, one is for regaining MP, and the other is for spells you cast. I kind of feel like a music mixer by switching between these three windows constantly and hitting several notes.The thing that also makes Sequence shine is the fact that it has so much potential in its core game that it's one of those few games out there that could spawn a successful sequel if it wanted to! It's also a quick game (took me 7-8 hours to 100% the game on normal difficulty, maybe another hour or two to get the rest of the achievements) with lots of replayability in the other difficulty levels. It's only $5 too!			"

												Imagine playing DDR with your hands and managing three machines at the same time.  That is pretty much the core of this game.  If you like rhythm games that consist of four directions, you might like this.  Essentially, you're juggling three DDR boards, but it's not like there's constant arrows (it does get harder, mind you).  One board is like charging up your mana.  One board is strictly for inputting attacks.  The remaining board is to defend against enemy attacks.Oh, and I think there's a story here, too, but nobody cares.			"

												A fantastic game in which all of the mechanics have been honed to perfection. The DDR Max-RPG hybrid system works flawlessly, the voice acting is top notch, and the dialogue is great. Little touches such as being able to spend experience points to increase synthesis success, having a practice mode to work on your timing, and more are all done well. The hand painted enviornments look gorgeous, and the character and enemy designs are great, although a couple of the later enemies are palette swaps of the early ones. The soundtrack is great, with several catchy songs you'll find yourself humming in the shower later. Unfortunately, the number of tracks is rather limited, and each enemy is assigned only one song, but the songs are still good enough that they don't get annoying. The only flaw I can find is that there is no free play mode, as at this point I have reached such a high level that even the hardest battles only take around thirty seconds to win. Still, its hard to fault a game for not letting you replay it enough, so I'll conclude by saying that this is the single best indie title I have had the pleasure of playing on Steam. A fantastic game that should be enjoyed by all.			"

												So like you're this guy named Ky and you wake up in a tower of power wondering where the hell you are. Suddenly, a voice rings out and it's from a girl named Naia, who is pretty chill but willing to sass Ky whenever he acts like a nerd (which is often). She teaches him how to harness the power of DDR-like magic in order to defend himself because if he doesn't, then he ends up dead. Being dead is pretty bad, so try to avoid that. As Ky climbs up the tower, he runs into weirdoes who possess the power to screw with his playing field in increasingly annoying ways. There's a lot of puns, references, and wordplay in the game, which can be a dealbreaker if you're some scrub who can't deal with it/ignore it. You, the player, must guide Ky in his journey to find out who put him in the tower, why he's there, and who Naia is.			"

												Sequence is a rhythm RPG, which is, in and of itself, an interesting concept. It delivers this with surprisingly unique gameplay, an interesting story, and an excellent, albeit limited, selection of music to play along to.In terms of gameplay, it's not unlike DDR in that you have four arrows that you have to hit to the rhythm as they reach the bottom of the screen while music plays in the background. However, the similarities stop there. Combat involves rotating between three screens: your damage screen, your mana screen, and your spell screen. The damage screen represents incoming attacks from your opponent, and each arrow missed on this screen will result in your health taking a hit. The spell screen is used for all of the abilities in the game, where you must select what type of spell you want to perform and then hit every arrow in that spell for it to succeed. The mana screen grants mana, for casting spells, with every arrow that is hit. As a result, the game turns into a very interesting experience where you have to time spells so that you don't take too much damage, and prioritize each of these screens so that you can keep yourself alive and deplete your enemy's health bar before the song ends.When a battle concludes, loot is dropped. This loot can be used to craft specific items on each floor, such as new weapons and equipment, a key to get to the next level, and a few other secrets that are best observed within the game. Especially towards the end, there are some very interesting items that can be crafted, and a lot of secrets and hidden content. I highly recommend crafting every item in the game, waiting until after the credits, and then exploring a bit more based on what you learn. This game quickly becomes intriguing, and knows how to deliver on it.One point of criticism I have for this game is that, if you're looking to craft all of the items in the game, it can get a little repetitive. Each enemy has the same song every time you fight them, and when you get close to the end, there are a few items that have pretty low drop rates. Having to repeat the same fight fifteen times in a row, as a result, can get a drab. Luckily, it's not the exact same pattern of arrows every time, and the gameplay is engaging and fun enough that I didn't find this to be much of an issue, but it is something worth mentioning.If you're a fan of rhythm games, Sequence brings a twist on a traditional formula that makes it feel almost entirely new. I'm glad I put in all of the time that I did, and I think a lot of people would be surprised at how much they enjoy it.			"

												Puzzle Quest is to Bejeweled as Sequence is to DDR. Sequence is a dungeon crawler / RPG of sorts in which battles are done in DDR-like matches. Of course, arrows are hit with keys instead of a dancepad. The twist is that there are three different playing fields, and you have to switch between them. One regains mana as you hit notes, one blocks incoming damage when you hit the notes, and one is for casting spells. It's an interesting concept, and while it's done very well, it still seems to be amateurish. I'm glad I played it for a bit to get a good idea of the game, but it's not worth the grinding to continue.			"

												An extremely novel idea executed very well. The story is so-so, and the voice acting feels like it was done by bored devs, but the gameplay and audio really make this a win. It is a mixture of a rythm game and an RPG, which pits you against an oppenent to music where you must hit notes on your gamepad/keyboard in rythm on one of 3 boards to win. 1 board gains mana, 1 casts various spells, and 1 defends on attack. Balancing which spells you take into fights, which boards you focus on, and handling the special abilities that bosses throw at you is a lot of fun. It doesn't hurt that the musical selection is also very good.			"

												Interesting concept with the 3 different screens of arrows you have to switch through.  Tries very hard to be an 'offbeat RPG' like Puzzle Quest, but ultimately the RPG elements are unimportant and the story sequences feature a bunch of flat and emotionless voice actors trying to be hip and witty.If fanboys of the Matrix got together and tried to film another Matrix with no budget and an all-new script they wrote themselves, the dialogue would probably sound like it does in this game.  It's painful.  If you watch the trailer and listen to one of the devs trying way too hard to be hip while describing the game, you'll understand why it turned out this way.Sadly the music is a low point as well.  You would think in a game built entirely on timing, music and rhythm that the audio tracks would be a high point, but all of these tracks feel like recycled DDR tunes.If at some point in your life you *really* enjoyed finger DDR or Stepmania, you might like this game.

												As someone who loved stepmania and was addicted to it for a long time this game feels right at home. It includes an interesting mechanic of swapping between windows to attack, defend or regenerate mana which at first takes some getting used to but after that it is like second nature. The game includes some great soundtracks, and it was sad defeating an enemy early just because the song would end early. The audio goes perfectly with the visual aesthetics of the game  and the artwork is truly stunning.There is some farming involved in progressing through the game but if you play any RPG this is nothing out of the ordinary.Over all it is unique and lots of fun. great music and highly addictive.

												TL:DR - One of the most unique $5 gems you can pick up. Definitely worth checking out.Sequence is a game I strongly enjoyed playing not because of its music, art-style, or its plot, all of which are really well done. It's the unique gameplay that Sequence carries. Yes, on first glance, it's like Dance Dance Revolution. However it's unique because you play three different windows that you can switch to at any time. One window is for defense, one is for regaining MP, and the other is for spells you cast. I kind of feel like a music mixer by switching between these three windows constantly and hitting several notes.The thing that also makes Sequence shine is the fact that it has so much potential in its core game that it's one of those few games out there that could spawn a successful sequel if it wanted to! It's also a quick game (took me 7-8 hours to 100% the game on normal difficulty, maybe another hour or two to get the rest of the achievements) with lots of replayability in the other difficulty levels. It's only $5 too!			"

												Sequence is a fun but simple DDR-style rhythm game with just enough uniqueness to keep the 10 hours it takes to reach 100% completion interesting. Its voice acted narrative, level-up system, and loot and inventory elements help it rise above its fundamentally repetitive nature. Several NPCs have some really great dialogue, which kept me eager to push through to the next story scene. It would have been nice to have a lot more variety in the music, but thankfully the handful of tracks, especially Ronald Jankee’s work, are all great. Considering only two people made the game (and it only cost me $1.25), Sequence was and is a memorable experience worth playing.			"

												Like most people on my friendslist, I got this game for free thanks to Feep on NeoGAF. I only recently started playing it, and.... was blown away by it. Everything just fits together perfectly: the gameplay system, music,  story, dialogues, humour, animation... It's such a great all-round package, the game deserves a lot more exposure. It's so much more than just another quirky indie game. If you don't already have it, buy it. If you own it and it's in your backlog somewhere, play it now. Trust me, you'll be doing yourself a favour.			"

												An unexpected combination of DDR and RPG, Sequence does a great job at taking the rhythm experience and applying a battle system to it. Using a 3 board setup, the player must switch between gathering mana, casting spells, and defending against incoming attacks. While it is difficult to get the hang of, the system grows on you. There is a little bit of a grind but the story has pacing that makes up for that.			"

												At first, this looks like a simple arrow-rhythm game and some RPG bits with a story thrown in. But then you start playing. The arrow-rhythm game is actually combat against a monster, with 3 screens, your spells (which decide when to trigger) defense (occasional arrows), and mana recovery (pretty much constant arrows). You jump back and forth between these 3 screens, juggling the 3 purposes. The progress of the RPG bits feel solid though not spectacular. But the story is just absolutely amazing. The pacing is perfect, with a few twists and an ending that ties back to the very beginning.			"

												So like you're this guy named Ky and you wake up in a tower of power wondering where the hell you are. Suddenly, a voice rings out and it's from a girl named Naia, who is pretty chill but willing to sass Ky whenever he acts like a nerd (which is often). She teaches him how to harness the power of DDR-like magic in order to defend himself because if he doesn't, then he ends up dead. Being dead is pretty bad, so try to avoid that. As Ky climbs up the tower, he runs into weirdoes who possess the power to screw with his playing field in increasingly annoying ways. There's a lot of puns, references, and wordplay in the game, which can be a dealbreaker if you're some scrub who can't deal with it/ignore it. You, the player, must guide Ky in his journey to find out who put him in the tower, why he's there, and who Naia is.			"

												I played all the way through this and enjoyed it. It can be grindy, because each stage/monster has a drop table, and if you need something with a low drop chance you just have to play the same thing over and over. I have a pretty high tolerance for that sort of thing, but if playing the same level more than once bothers you, then you'll probably get irritated and quit before finishing.			"

												Rhythm game meets old-school turn-based RPG. This is every bit as peculiar as it sounds. The music is slick, much of it licensed from capable hands such as the wonderful Ronald Jenkees, and the gameplay can be quite punishing on higher difficulty levels. I would recommend playing this game witha controller, and indeed have not checked if it is possible (or enjoyable) without.You'll be switching between three sets of scrolling DDR style arrows: one for incoming damage that is blocked by accurate hits, another (typically containing the most difficult pieces of the song) recharges your Mana pool on accurate hits, and a third for spells. Spells are cast with the right analog stick, which (after a delay) sends down a specific rhythmic snippet that changes it's tempo to fit the current song (the specific direction of arrows changes every time you cast, and the difficulty level also changes the spells, making the more complicated versions of the same basic rhytmic idea). The game has you madly flying between these screens to defeat enemies before the song ends--it's one wierd, wild ride and it's well worth it. Battles are tense and fascinating, and there's a lot of room for varied play styles in your spell collection of choice as well as a lot of room for growth within the broad difficulty span. There's even a practice mode where you can just play through the full songs in a more standard rhthym game format. Highly recommended.			"

												If you're a Stepmania and/or DDR addict, I won't recommend this to you, cause you already own this game.For those of you not quite as addicted to keyboard-dancing: Sequence pardon me, 'Before The Echo' (lawsuit trolls forced them to change the name) is a rhythm game, but with a catch--and added RPG elements. The controls can take some getting used to, especially because a certain kind of multitasking is required of you in all battles, but you'll quickly pick them up. They're fully customizable to suit your own preference--which you will be glad for, as the highest difficulty will have you crying for mercy at times. That said, there is something incredibly satisfying about the combat system, and that certain something is what has made me return to this game multiple times, eventually beating it on the hardest difficulty setting with no little satisfaction.Gameplay aside, Sequence Before The Echo manages to weave in a nice story with likable characters, with some of the most natural-sounding dialogue I've heard in years. I loved its sense of humor, found everywhere from dialogue to item descriptions. Without spoiling anything, the ending had me both widening my eyes and laughing at the same time.The music is above-average, as it should be for a music-based game. Some songs are better than others, and there's definitely a few earworms in there.Long story short: why haven't you put this in your cart yet?			"

Being mediocre at it, i thought that it would be a simple 2 maybe 3 hours to finish this.Now, what i did not expect was the engaging storyline, the funny banter and the relationships that develop. If you are a storyline kind of person and can do so-so in stepmania, i would encourage you to give this a go. While ""grinding"" for levels is a thing in this game, you'll notice that you would do the same in any DDR / stepmania type of game. Watch yourself get better as you aim for that perfect all the while gaining more power (by leveling) and actual skill of both memory and reflexes.All in all, i find this to be my hidden gem.

												Sequence is an excellent amalgamation of the RPG and rhythm genres. It features an engaging storyline, frenetic battles and plenty of humour. Your ascent up the tower is punctuated by meetings with Guardians - absurd characters who block your path - they're one of the many highlights of the game, along with the insanely catchy soundtrack. It is techno based and fits the mood of the game perfectly . Unfortunately, for the scope of the game, the soundtrack is a little too limited. There is a lot of grinding towards the end which exacerbates the problem, however, when you consider that the game was coded by one man, it is easy to forgive.To sum up, the game is a steal at $5.

												Sequence is a fun but simple DDR-style rhythm game with just enough uniqueness to keep the 10 hours it takes to reach 100% completion interesting. Its voice acted narrative, level-up system, and loot and inventory elements help it rise above its fundamentally repetitive nature. Several NPCs have some really great dialogue, which kept me eager to push through to the next story scene. It would have been nice to have a lot more variety in the music, but thankfully the handful of tracks, especially Ronald Jankee’s work, are all great. Considering only two people made the game (and it only cost me $1.25), Sequence was and is a memorable experience worth playing.			"

												OUTSTANDING game.First of all, I adore indie games. I love the creativity and teamwork that comes with creating indie games, and they are my favorite genre to play and watch. I picked up this game on my queue during the Steam summer sale, but let me tell you, it's at least worth the five dollars standard price.As an avid lover of rhythm games, I was pleasantly surprised at the complexity of each level. The difficulty increased without overwhelming the player, and the spells come in a great variety that essentially allow the player to beat the game in their own style. The art style is consistent, entirely due to the fact that every visual was created by the same artist! And it's so very sweet on the eyes.Moving on to the characters, I have to say that while it is a rather short game (I finished all achievements in around 2-3 hours, after resetting my glitched game, a result of an error on my part) and thus we don't get to see much in terms of character depth or development, the characters' presence was enough to add quality and personality to the game without taking away the mystery and shock of the plot (I loved each of the Guardians and applaud the voice actors, as well as the artist, for providing such animated spirit). The ending leaves several questions unanswered, and if you're ambitious enough to get the hidden ending, you get a taste of even more secrets yet to be revealed.I couldn't put this game down. It was funny, intriguing, and the artwork and music are STELLAR!Now, to be fair, the game did have some drawbacks. I feel like the characters were a bit flat, but, if you play the game, you'll figure out why they seem to be so...scripted. It is a short game (hence the low price), but the crew that worked on it was so small! Aside from the voice actors, very few people put together a game that I will proudly call one of my all-time favorites. Iridium Studios, thank you for this masterpiece; I will cherish it for years to come.			"

												Overall, I liked Before the Echo. I'm quite fond of rythm games in general (hard player on Guitar Hero, but not expert) and I liked the mix of rythm and RPG elements here.At first I wasn't much into the artstyle but I got used to it and kinda like it now. Same went for the dialogues which are a bit cheesy, especially in the beginning but then you get into the story and it's all ok. I found the story interesting and mostly went to the end of the game for that. Oh and the voiced credits is a nice little bonus ^^.As for the game mechanics, they mostly work well. You got stats to increase with stuff and level up, and spells to unlock and select for your build. The ""line"" selection during combats gives you control on how to spend your time and keystrokes.Though, the main negative point I have with this game lie in the game design. I started the game in Hard mode because I'm used to rythm games, it gives a little challenge and at first it was all ok. But, as after floor 3 you can't change difficulty, I regretted that choice much later when I needed to unlock more spells and couldn't because it was too hard for me (struggling with keys and controller, more used to frets). So I finished the game with only 7 of the 20+ (?) spells unlocked. And I unlocked 2 of them out of necessity for the floor 7 boss and final boss.The second complain I could make about the design of the game is about the final boss. On floor 7, once beat the boss of the level, you immediatly encounter the final boss and start the battle. There is a noticeable difficulty increase from the floor 7 boss. Therefore if you barely beat the previous boss, you can't beat the final boss and you have to go back and farm to level up and increase your stats. Also, because the damages notes are random, and in the battle the rythm of the song varies a lot, you end up in a total random fight when casting your spells and it ends up being infuriating. I lost my temper there with 20-30+ tries.

												Before the Echo, once called Sequence, is a fun and short rhythm fighting/dancing role-playing game. My game time represents how long it took for me to beat the game and it ended just at the right time. The pacing of the game and story go well together. There was a short grind near the end of the game, but it was good practice and leveling for the last few bosses which are quite a challenge.I bought the game on sale so add this to your wishlist if you think the price is too much currently. Regardless, make sure you don't miss out playing this title.			"

												Fun and interesting concept. The story is kind of weak... I mean if I woke up in a tower and some girl told me that I had to fight my way to the top and could die at any moment I'd probably be a little bit more questioning but it serves its purpose. The music is absolutely terrible but what can you expect from an indie game... I guess the only real complaint I'd have about it is that all of the songs are so similar that it kind of sounds like you're listening to the same song over and over again. It gets annoying.

												Wow, surprisingly addictive gameplay.  I think I've put more hours into this than my GH/RB games that are currently collecting dust.  The RPG elements really keep you pushing forward to get better gear and move up the levels to finish the story.  It's also one of the only rhythm games for the PC that pretty much nails the accuracy - I was starting to wonder if that were possible.  You're able to calibrate to your monitor/speaker settings so you'll have an accurate game no matter what system you have.  It doesn't require a demanding computer, either.Easy mode is fairly easy while the harder levels provide plenty of challenge for experts.   Ronald Jenkees' music is very catchy.  Gamepad (i.e. Xbox Controller) is highly recommended. As long as you have one and you like rhythm games, this will be the easiest $5 you'll spend.			"

												Love this game! The music, the backgrounds, the characters! I'm a long time fan of DDR but this was something else entirely. I loved having to switch through the three different panels to gain mana, defend, and attack. Towards the end, it started to get a little too easy for me once I figured out a sure way to win each battle (certain combinations of attacks in certain 'sequences' ...haha). Next time I'll have to play through on a harder difficulty - first time through it I think I did it on a step up from easy.And a nice little story to keep me engaged and curious. I only wish there was more! 15 hours of game time is pretty good, though. But it's very relaxing to play so I think I'll be coming back to it often.If you have yet to acquire a sense of rhthym or musicality, this game might be a bit hard to get used to... but I still recommend it.

												I have always been a huge supporter of indie games, so when I heard there was a game that combines RPG elements with music rhythm action I had to check it out. Be forewarned though, Sequence is not for everyone. It's bare-bones design and mildly annoying but sometimes entertaining characters and text descriptions might not appeal to everyone. But for just 5 bucks, it is hard to complain when you getting something unique and quite addictive, if you're into what it has to offer that is. The story is bland and the menus are simplistic but Sequence offers an intense, one-of-a-kind battle system that will leave you wanting more. It even supports the dance pad accessory!			"

												As a long-time rhythm game (in this case Stepmania) player, I was really excited for Sequence. The game looked to be just the right mix between rhythm and RPG elements, with a fun soundtrack to back it up. Unfortunately the game gets a little too grindy for my taste - you can beat pretty much any encounter in the game provided that you're a high enough level. Leveling up is a chore though, and the bonus for beating an enemy skillfully isn't enough to outweigh the immense grind. A lot of the depth of the game involved simple grinding to get better levels, as later bosses had too much health and an item or a couple of levels was enough to make it easy. The grinding is really boring though as the regular creatures usually don't pose much threat. If you're a fan of rhythm games I'd recommend picking it up, but if you're new maybe give it a pass or play it on a lower difficulty. I played it on Hard because it said ""for the not musically challenged,"" but most of the difficulty came from luck not going in my favor.			"

												I've been playing Before the Echo for years, and still wholeheartedly recommend it.  Several years back it was released as an Xbox Indie game called Sequence.  Controller, dancepad, and guitar support.  Not too much later it was ported to PC in all its glory.  I bought it again because, why not?  Although the voice acting and story get a lot of criticism, I love them both.  Maybe its just my kind of humor, but I find all of it both clever and charming.My only complaint about the game is depending on your dificulty of choice, you can get some harsh difficulty spikes right after you pass the point you are no longer allowed to chance your difficulty.  Be warned, but otherwise this game is loads of fun.  RPG plus Rhythm game with loads of style and witty dialogue thrown in.  Also, the creator voices the main character and honstly, I think he does a terrific job.  Well done, all around.  The game is well worth the price tag.			"

												Taking a simple DDR based rthym game and turning into an RPG combat system was a suprisingly good idea. Unfortunately the way progression in the game is very grindy, but the core combat mechanics are more than fun enough to keep you playing. And while a simple arcade concept such as this could have easily gone with a cheesy and overly simplistic story, they went all out here, the game's got a very good story and is well voice acted.Simply put, for the cheap price it's currently available at (or even better, free with There came an echoe) it'll provide hours of fun and a great story.

												This game's pretty cool, being kind of a mix between Guitar Hero and Dance Dance Revolution, with you pressing arrow keys to the beat of admittedly catchy music(you'll end up replaying fights so much, those songs will eventually become mind-numbingly boring), and some classic rpg statistics and battles thrown in. It plays pretty intuitively, although it can be a little complex, and the difficulty doesn't seem to scale very well, as the settings are awkwardly simple, boringly simple, and from there are just horrendously complex, especially when first begining the game. Most noticably, the dialogue and voice acting are absolutely superb. that alone makes it worth the ride. I cannot emphasize the humor enough.			"

												Games like Sequence are the reason Kickstarter and the Indie Game movement exist. It's not a perfect game, not everyone is going to enjoy it and it will never receive a lot of fame and recognition. However, for the niche audience that can appreciate it, Sequence is a game like no other.The closest thing I can relate Sequence to is Puzzle Quest. The game doesn't play like Puzzle Quest but what that game did for Match-3 games, Sequence does for the rhythm genre. The base game has you traveling up a tower by fighting enemies, collecting their dropped items, and synthesising items such as keys, weapons and armor. Battles give you experience which will level up your stats while armor and weapons are equipable and can also improve your abilities. Where Sequence differs from the average dungeon crawler is that combat is played out by putting you in a rhythm system similar to StepMania, if you're using a keyboard, but with three separate boards. One board is defensive, one board is for building mana and one is for casting spells. On the first board, any notes that you miss will count as damage against you so catching them defends your HP. The second board will have a constant stream of notes. Missing them doesn't hurt you but catching them restores your mana which you need to cast spells. The last board stays dormant until you cast spells, the only way to damage your opponents. When you cast a spell, it takes mana and makes you complete a short rhythm sequence. Failing it causes the spell to fail but completing it will cast that spell. While it can be a lot to juggle at once, the game does a great job of teaching you and ramping up the difficulty slowly in order to build your skills both in game and out.The gameplay by itself is fun for a while but as the entire game is built around grinding items and EXP, it would get boring very quickly if it weren't for the well written story pushing players forward. The tone reminded me of The World Ends With You in the best possible way, but felt wholy unique. Your main character finds himself waking up in a tower with no idea how he got there. The voice of a girl named Naia tells you that you are stuck in this tower/game and you will need to make your way up 7 floors to escape so off you go. While there are some predictable moments, the story as a whole never becomes too transparent and despite a few moments when I swore I was done after one more battle, curiosity kept me pushing ever forward. The characters are all voiced as well and while none are particularly mind-blowing, it's a nice touch and the quality stayed consistent throughout. If you do find your bar set particularly high in regards to VO quality, they do have an option to turn it off as well although I doubt this will be necessary for most people.That's not to say the game isn't without it's rough spots. For a music-based game, Sequence has a surprisingly limited soundtrack of only about 10 songs that show up in battle. This means several monsters will have you playing the same songs repeatedly. Thankfully, they aren't bad and some of them I didn't mind repeating but considering each monster all but requires multiple playthroughs anyway, don't be surprised if you wind up hearing the same song 10+ times. As that suggests too, the gameplay is simply too grindy and while item drops are pretty common, it can be irritating when you need one specific item and have to fight the same monster over and over just to move forward. Finally, the song balance is a bit odd as by the end of the game, the length of the song decided more battles for me than my HP did. It felt like very artificial difficulty (you lose if the song ends before killing the enemy) and it would have been nicer to have some of the songs be just a bit longer, especially in Floor 7. Depending on your strategy, you may not have a problem with this but it showed up several times in my game.Overall, if you're looking for something different and enjoy music gameplay, Sequence is worth a shot.

												It's a rather fun, challenging, rhthym game. The game plays like DDR for those unfamiliar, and the music is pretty good. It's the same music featured in Bill Simmon's B.S. report. The game is really polished. I had no glitches of any sort and it never crashed on me.  I can get back to playing this game after a year or so because there's no ""grinding"" aspect.

												This game is amazing. If a game that combines rhythm game and RPG appeals to you then this game would be something to look at even if that combination of genre wasn't so rare. First off to all the people who aren't scared off from thinking of potential problems or weirdness already, it's not just ""let's smash these genres together"". It's very functional as a rhythm game and they made that part of gameplay the ""battle"" portion of the RPG. You switch between ""fields"" to either defend against attacks, cast spells or regain mana. The balance of strength of attacks and difficulty pulling them off feels nice and natural and the game overall feels just wonderfully made. Like any RPG you might need to grind a little but just remember to pay attention to getting good equipment and good spell usage and it shouldn't get too bad. I think the only negative I can really think about gameplay is there isn't any ""turn based"" alternative for anyone that isn't physically capable of playing a timing based game, but for the rest of it it's good to go. Music and visual aesthetics might depend a bit on individual taste to say for sure but I personally loved both in this game.  The story is awesome too, unlike a lot of other RPG's it doesn't give you a ton of story which works since plenty of the interest comes in the mystery and uncertainty. You get just a few cutscenes every floor, long enough to enjoy the strange characters but not so long you forget you're playing a video game. Trust me there's not really any throw away characters.Saddly as much as I'd like to go on I don't know how much deeper I can dig without risking any spoilers or rambling on too much, but trust me when I say this is a unique gem of a game worth playing through to the end.

												Ever played StepMania? This game plays a lot like it, but with three different planes you can switch between, and a nice side of RPG experience point earning with an interesting story and tons of laughs. No, really. Within five seconds I was already in love with this game because of the banter between Ky and Naia. The ending isn't what you would expect, either, and will have you going "".../what"" along with the characters. The music is great to groove out to, there are four difficulties for the musically (dis)inclined, and the background art is beautiful.A little caution if you're against people joking around 80% of the time and making pop culture or using memes. You aren't able to choose the songs that you can play, outside the three you're given for a level, but thankfully the songs never get annoying.All in all, it's a pretty fun game, and is well worth the $5 you pay for it. Even the credits are worth listening to.			"

												Before the Echo is a unique, one-of-a-kind sort of game that has both the elements of a rhythm game and RPG. Maybe unique isn't always a good thing, but this game definitely nailed it with its unique concept and amazing gameplay. If you like rhythm games like me, then you will most likely enjoy Before the Echo just as I did. It has a set of amazing soundtracks,  great gameplay, very interesting characters and a clever story premise. If I have any complaint, it'd probably be the grinding you have to do to craft the recipe items, but even so it wasn't that bad and hey, what's an RPG without a little a grinding am I right? I'm definitely recommending this amazing game, 9/10			"

												I played Before the Echo on Linux using a Steam Controller, and had a great time. The concept is simple, but well executed, and playing with the Steam Controller's two touchpads was perfect for such a precision game; I enjoyed not having to press buttons all the time but having the possibility to just touch the right area; so I'd recommend the config I shared to any player using a Steam Controller ;)The music is nice and the dialogs are witty, and all that with relatively good voice acting. There are some good 12+ hours of gameplay on the normal difficulty, plus some cool bonuses and optional hidden ending for the hardcore looters.For this price, it's definitely a good buy, even if you're not particularly interested in rhythm games in the first place (that's my case, and I still really enjoyed Before the Echo).

												It's an RPG with a DDR-esque battle system. Having three simultaneous DDR-esque streams going -- one for offense, one for defense, and one for healing -- at all times during battle keeps things from going stale and allows the player freedom to strategize. If you like rhythm games, this is definitely a good one to get. It doesn't hurt that the writing and characters are also excellent.

												The game's a grindfest if you try to get all of the achievements, and not really deserving of the ""10+ hours worth of gameplay"" description, but overall great writing and gameplay; the gimmick was fun for a few hours until it alternated between getting boring due to overlevelling while grinding for items and 2HKOing everything (and not immediately since spells take time to wind up), and being reasonably fun again afterwards. (Floor 7 gimmick was annoying as heck though)I recently got access to my DDR pad again (I had a better (actually metal) one but the USB connector doesn't seem to work), so I tried playing the game with that (This is possible if you use AntiMicro): there weren't enough buttons and trying to press the A and B buttons to switch panes was disorienting at best since muscle memory from DDR had me keep my other foot on the center panel instead of doing anything productive, so I ended up getting a keyboard, remapping F1 to F6 as the spell keys and F9 and F10 as the pane switch keys, holding it like a guitar, and mashing the F# buttons appropriately.This worked surprisingly well overall, except my DDR pad is garbage at detecting inputs, which was frustrating. It also didn't help that my balance was skewed by holding the keyboard (Playing on the Hard difficulty, for reference, so there are a nontrivial number of notes) and the fact that I looked like a dork while jumping around with it, but still, it was reasonably fun (and good exercise too, especially since you only have your arm up to your elbow for balance).Definitely worth $1 when on sale, and definitely worth buying my first $20 steam gift card.

												Considering that this is a blend of rhythm games and RPGs, my two favorite genres, I don't know why it didn't catch my eye on day one. The general gameplay involves switching between three play fields - one to gain mana to cast spells, one to actually use the spells, and one to defend against enemy attacks. It's the kind of concept that must be played to get a good idea of, but let me tell you, it's great. Most of the gameplay music is by Ronald Jenkees, who I now know to be a fantastic artist. While the ending is a bit lackluster on all accounts - a tad 'what the heck?', a bit of open-endedness, even on the secret ending, and a special achievement that might or might not really bug you (I was fine with it, and rather liked it) - Sequence/Before The Echo is an indie game that you need to buy right this second. Just be ready for tons of horrible puns.			"

												Great music, good voice acting -- especially for an indie venture -- and a very nicely written story. The story is intriguing, especially later into the game, and the characters are hilarious. Dialogue is snarky and well-written, and had me laughing a lot. In my opinion, the only thing truly lacking was the gameplay, which was a little weak. I only played on medium, and it was challenging by the end of the game, but the content was repetitive.This isn't so much a problem of difficulty, but more a byproduct of the game's small pool of resources compared to many other rhythm games.All in all, as a cheap-♥♥♥ game it's a nice buy. It makes for an especially nice deal during Steam Sales and the like.			"

												Had this game recommended to me as a good music game hybrid, and was pleasantly surprised.  I'm not usually an RPG fan, but this game is enjoyable so far and there's no question that I'll see it through to the end.As a long-time DDR/stepmania player, I stepped quite easily into hard mode.  The charts themselves are still pretty easy for me, and I can easily get 100% while unlocking spells.  However, during regular gameplay, coordinating switching between panes with hitting notes is a new and interesting challenge.The biggest downside so far is the lack of content.  The soundtrack, while well-made, is extremely limited, and you'll end up hearing the same handful of songs over and over (so far maybe a half dozen songs in the first 4/7 floors of the tower, compared to dozens/hundreds in your average true rhythm game).  That coupled with the fact that I'm better than halfway through the game in under 4 hours suggests that this game won't have replay value.Other thoughts:- The art is somewhat low-res (720p?) and you can't change resolutions.  You can choose full screen or windowed though.  Not something I notice during gameplay, but nowadays I'd expect full HD (or preferably vector) art.- So far I've only gotten one defensive spell and it's not that powerful.  There's a huge emphasis on attack-heavily-and-occasionally-heal with not much in the way of actually defending.  Some battles you can coast through without using the defense pane much at all, so it's not equally balanced throughout.- A lot of the items/spells seem ignorable in general, unless you're a compulsive completionist like I am.- Each floor of the tower has 3 different enemy battles (each with 3 different item drops), plus a boss battle.- It's interesting that the item drop probabilities are shown, that way you can quantify how bad your luck is when grinding.  Sure, I got the 35% item in 3 of my last 4 battles, but I only got one of the 85% item that I need three of.  Haha.- The boss battles don't seem to be replayable, but they do unlock new songs when you complete them that will be used in the higher levels of battle.- Most people complaining about the name change (from ""Sequence"") have no idea how trademark law works, or why companies are obligated to protect their trademarks.Overall, this game is well worth that 99c sale price, but it seems like something I'll play through once and then forget about.  I absolutely love the concept, but it needs more content for sure.			"

												Personal fan of rhythm sync games like Rock Band, G. Hero, DDR, DJ Portable, etc. but this, in a nutshell, is just SO much better. It's not about nailing every note or playing dozens of songs in a music library.

It plays pretty intuitively, although it can be a little complex, and the difficulty doesn't seem to scale very well, as the settings are awkwardly simple, boringly simple, and from there are just horrendously complex, especially when first begining the game. Most noticably, the dialogue and voice acting are absolutely superb. that alone makes it worth the ride. I cannot emphasize the humor enough.			"

												Sequence does what Puzzle Quest did for block-clearing puzzlers but for the music/DDR-eque games.  The RPG elements and items collecting added to my music genre is a breath of fresh air and just what this genre needed.In this game you have not one, but 3 stream of arrows coming at you, one is health, another is mana and one is for spell activation.  The gameplay is very addicting and the music is varied and fun to listen to while playing.  With such a low price, there is really no reason to miss out if you like rhythm games.			"

												This game is good. Games like Guitar Hero and DDR never caught my interest, but I still enjoyed this game's gameplay quite a lot. I do, however, like RPGs (so long as they aren't basic, dry, turn based 1980s JRPG battles), and the gameplay here is quite at bit more engaging. Especially later on, you can get some battle strategy going.Anyway, the rest of the game is good too. The story is good, especially the ending, and the characters/writing, voice acting, the item descriptions (deserves its own mention), and etc. And of course the music. For a music-based game to work, the music has to be good, and it is great here. Check out Ronald Jenkees and DJ Plaeskool and listen to a bit of the music, and if you like what you hear, play this game.			"

												This game has a charming storyline, referencing memes and elements of popular culture that should endear the average media-savvy player. However, it's main draw is its unique (as far as I know) music-based combat system.Find any youtube video of Sequence gameplay, TotalBiscuit for one. While you're watching, try to play along. Get in time with the beat and mime hitting the keys with your fingers. If you're liking the feel of it, buy this game. This feeling is enhanced once you have more agency in the game itself. if you've enjoyed any kind of rhythm game (Guitar Hero and etc.) and wanted to feel more like a badass while doing so, buy this game.Imagine what it must be like to jam along with electronic rock/techno, and then to pluck those tunes out of the air and convert them into raw magical power, which you then convert into a righteous fireball. For a small sum, you too can feel this power. I am a Music Magus; hear me groove.			"

												This game is basically DDR (on a controller/keyboard) mashed up with an RPG. If that sounds like heaven to you, then you're in for a good time. You battle monsters by completing sequences of notes, swapping between three different 'tracks' to attack, block, and charge up mana. The only major problem with this game is that it is *extremely* grind-y. To move past each level, you will need to craft a key, which requires collecting multiple items dropped from the monsters in that level. The monsters will only drop the items some of the time, and multiple items are usually required so you might end up fighting the same monster (and playing the same song) several times in a row. To make matters worse, crafting the items you need costs XP (meaning more battles to earn it back) and has a chance of failing (meaning even more battles to find all those items again). Playing the same song over and over again gets old very quickly.Overall, this is a good game for rhythm game fans, but be warned that it can get repetitive.			"

												Before the Echo is like this weird Rhythm game and rpg rolled into one. You play the game by matching Arrows in three different fields. Defense blocks attacks, There's an attack field where you need to hit all the arrows to cast spells. Then there is the mana pool where you replenish your mana for more spells. The thing is you queue your spells up on your own. So you have to either take a few hits while you get a spell off on the enemy or maybe you'll find that gap in the enemy's attack pattern. Besides that the game has a ton of other rpg elements like monster drops, item synthesis, equipment, learning new spells and more. I also enjoy the voice acting and all the snarky sarasm that goes on between the guy you play and Naia the girl over the intercom. I was really laughing at the first boss encounter poor old percival was offended by my words. Then again he was asking for it.I say pick this up if you like rhythm games and want a splash of rpg stuff to go with it.			"

The story is more elaborate than you would expect for a $5 rhythm-based RPG. But being elaborate doesn't make it good. The gameplay is the highlight of this game and it certainly impresses. This game transforms Stepmania the way that Puzzle Quest transformed Bejeweled. I definitely recommend buying it, even at full price. Unless you're completely terrible at rhythm games, in which case you might find it frustrating, although it isn't particularly hard on the standard difficulty.			"

												Puzzle Quest is to Bejeweled as Sequence is to DDR. Sequence is a dungeon crawler / RPG of sorts in which battles are done in DDR-like matches. Of course, arrows are hit with keys instead of a dancepad. The twist is that there are three different playing fields, and you have to switch between them. One regains mana as you hit notes, one blocks incoming damage when you hit the notes, and one is for casting spells. It's an interesting concept, and while it's done very well, it still seems to be amateurish. I'm glad I played it for a bit to get a good idea of the game, but it's not worth the grinding to continue.			"

												An extremely novel idea executed very well. The story is so-so, and the voice acting feels like it was done by bored devs, but the gameplay and audio really make this a win. It is a mixture of a rythm game and an RPG, which pits you against an oppenent to music where you must hit notes on your gamepad/keyboard in rythm on one of 3 boards to win. 1 board gains mana, 1 casts various spells, and 1 defends on attack. Balancing which spells you take into fights, which boards you focus on, and handling the special abilities that bosses throw at you is a lot of fun. It doesn't hurt that the musical selection is also very good.			"

												Interesting concept with the 3 different screens of arrows you have to switch through.  Tries very hard to be an 'offbeat RPG' like Puzzle Quest, but ultimately the RPG elements are unimportant and the story sequences feature a bunch of flat and emotionless voice actors trying to be hip and witty.If fanboys of the Matrix got together and tried to film another Matrix with no budget and an all-new script they wrote themselves, the dialogue would probably sound like it does in this game.  It's painful.  If you watch the trailer and listen to one of the devs trying way too hard to be hip while describing the game, you'll understand why it turned out this way.Sadly the music is a low point as well.  You would think in a game built entirely on timing, music and rhythm that the audio tracks would be a high point, but all of these tracks feel like recycled DDR tunes.If at some point in your life you *really* enjoyed finger DDR or Stepmania, you might like this game.  Otherwise, skip it.			"

												Rather unqiue rythem game, if you've ever played stepmaina using a keyboard you should recongize the combat system a bit.  You basically get three feilds, one to rebuild mana, one to block attacks from your oppenent, and finally the last feild is for attacking with spells, all of which is timed to the tempo of the song.  Each spell uses a different sequence of steps as well. Each level you are collecting ingredents to make a key to continue on, or other items to help you in your quest. The caracthers are fully voiced, and are very charming and humorous.  At the price of some starbucks coffee or some meal you can't really go wrong.			"

												When I heard about this indie title, being addicted to rhythm games like Stepmania and the possibility to play with a dancepad already got me interested. Ready to press arrows blindly according to the patterns, what I really found is that Sequence is a simple rpg game, in which are injected rhythmic mechanics with average difficulty. Mixed genres dude!Iridium Studios managed to produce something difficult to classify, yet the gameplay alone will entertain you for a decent amount of time. Yes, because while I enjoyed the game in its essence - the crafting system, the bosses and the good ol' leveling up - the story and the characters can't really get you hooked.Plus, I don't get why sentences by the main character are constantly being interrupted: you feel like a spoiled brat who needs a lesson for no particular reason, and the moment after we're oh so important like the future of the world depends on us. XDPlot twists, kinda forced, kinda rushed. Someone likes that, others don't.Despite the full controller support, I fully played it on keyboard - more fit in handling the controls in my opinion - and it was a good experience overall: my playtime reached ~20 hours, not bad for an indie game so I cannot say I didn't enjoy the run! The achievements offer a medium challenge to accomplish, so if you're an achievement hunter this is a nice game to 100% .Finally, would you look at the price! Looks like an on-sale game already, so definitely give this title a chance if you're searching for something outside the box.			"

												Bit of a mixed bag, Sequence is a rhythm game about using three different playing to fight monsters.  There's the defense field in which you defend against incoming attacks by aggressors by blocking their attacks pressing the corresponding keys.  The spell field in which you cast spells with different effects such as DoT, healing, or fast recharge low damage spells.  And the mana field in which you replenish mana, which is used to cast spells, you can only have one of these fields open at a time and there is a time limit for defeating the monster, which is an interesting concept.  The monsters have a chance of dropping various items, the lower the more rare and they all give a different amount of experience. You use your experience to craft items, spell scrolls, or keys which you use to use to progress, herein lies some of the problems of the game.  It feels like a grind, just a huge grind.  You end up wasting so much time either killing the same monster over and over again to find that ONE item you need to make better gear or spells, and you can end up wasting all of that precious expereince you earned making you down on experience, although you do lose out on some items.  It just gets very very repetitive around floor four you notice none of the spells bring anything new to the table.  It doesn't help the writing isn't super compelling.  Not to mention the music is reused and the only time you feel like you're actually playing a rhythm game is when you're in the mana field, which is when the keys actually feel like they correspond to the music.  It's got cute ideas but it's riddled with flaws, it's worth checking out if you feel confident sinking money into just to get a feel for it, hey if you're into the grind and slamming on keys for 10 seconds at a time (roughly how long it takes to get your mana replensihed) then be my guest.

												A fantastic game in which all of the mechanics have been honed to perfection. The DDR Max-RPG hybrid system works flawlessly, the voice acting is top notch, and the dialogue is great. Little touches such as being able to spend experience points to increase synthesis success, having a practice mode to work on your timing, and more are all done well. The hand painted enviornments look gorgeous, and the character and enemy designs are great, although a couple of the later enemies are palette swaps of the early ones. The soundtrack is great, with several catchy songs you'll find yourself humming in the shower later. Unfortunately, the number of tracks is rather limited, and each enemy is assigned only one song, but the songs are still good enough that they don't get annoying. The only flaw I can find is that there is no free play mode, as at this point I have reached such a high level that even the hardest battles only take around thirty seconds to win. Still, its hard to fault a game for not letting you replay it enough, so I'll conclude by saying that this is the single best indie title I have had the pleasure of playing on Steam. A fantastic game that should be enjoyed by all.			"

												Wow, surprisingly addictive gameplay.  I think I've put more hours into this than my GH/RB games that are currently collecting dust.  The RPG elements really keep you pushing forward to get better gear and move up the levels to finish the story.  It's also one of the only rhythm games for the PC that pretty much nails the accuracy - I was starting to wonder if that were possible.  You're able to calibrate to your monitor/speaker settings so you'll have an accurate game no matter what system you have.  It doesn't require a demanding computer, either.Easy mode is fairly easy while the harder levels provide plenty of challenge for experts.   Ronald Jenkees' music is very catchy.  Gamepad (i.e. Xbox Controller) is highly recommended. As long as you have one and you like rhythm games, this will be the easiest $5 you'll spend.			"

Then the game became boring. Incredibly boring. The idea of combining Rhythm and RPG was not a good idea at all. The monsters have little variety, becomes very repetitive and the synth system is messed up. Though, I will admit that the music is actually very good and catchy.

If you like rhythm games that consist of four directions, you might like this.  Essentially, you're juggling three DDR boards, but it's not like there's constant arrows (it does get harder, mind you).  One board is like charging up your mana.

												DDR/Frequency/Amplitude with an RPG twist. If you have ever been a fan of rhythm games, particularly those by Harmonix, you (hopefully) have come across the Frequency/Amplitude series. With its rapid track-switching gameplay, it was a unique and underappreciated entry in gaming history. Now, Sequence takes the track switching mechanic, applies simple DDR-style controls, and turns it into a monster-fighting RPG.

It can be grindy, because each stage/monster has a drop table, and if you need something with a low drop chance you just have to play the same thing over and over.

												Here's a strange melding of RPG and rhythm game that shouldn't work as well as it does.  Though I believe the game would be a hard sell to most players based on a description of its gameplay, I also think that's a shame.  Sequence is a wholely unique and worthwhile experience.Calling Sequence a role-playing game is accurate but also potentially misleading: RPG elements like experience gathering and equipment crafting are a substantial part of gameplay, but, outside of rhythm sections, you'll only be navigating through menus.  There is no exploration and very little to do outside of rhythm battles and item creation.  While this sounds shallow (and perhaps, on the surface, smacks of dumbed-down, ""casual"" game design) , there's plenty to do thanks to the clever design and balancing of Sequence's underlying mechanics.  The music is great, too! (Though I do wish there was more of it.)Highly recommended for rhythm fans.			"

												Great music, good voice acting -- especially for an indie venture -- and a very nicely written story. The story is intriguing, especially later into the game, and the characters are hilarious. Dialogue is snarky and well-written, and had me laughing a lot. In my opinion, the only thing truly lacking was the gameplay, which was a little weak. I only played on medium, and it was challenging by the end of the game, but the content was repetitive.This isn't so much a problem of difficulty, but more a byproduct of the game's small pool of resources compared to many other rhythm games.All in all, as a cheap-♥♥♥ game it's a nice buy. It makes for an especially nice deal during Steam Sales and the like.			"

												It's an RPG with a DDR-esque battle system. Having three simultaneous DDR-esque streams going -- one for offense, one for defense, and one for healing -- at all times during battle keeps things from going stale and allows the player freedom to strategize. If you like rhythm games, this is definitely a good one to get. It doesn't hurt that the writing and characters are also excellent.

												I can recommend this game to anyone who likes rhythm games. They did a good job at implementing RPG elements into the genre and wrapped everything up in a surprisingly decent story. You can play this with a keyboard, but I found it a bit easier to play with a controller.So basically you ""fight"" yourself through a tower with seven floors and their guardians, and by fighting I mean you press directional arrows in three different windows to either defend yourself, regenerate mana or cast spells. If you're bad with coordination you might have trouble on the higher floors as switching quickly between the windows will become mandatory.My two major gripes with the game are a lack of different soundtracks early on (luckily there will be more variety later on, and some of the soundtracks are amazing) and incredibly frustrating RNG at times. Both item drops and crafting items are based on a percentage, the latter costing experience which makes failing a little more frustrating. If you want to get everything, you WILL have to grind a bit. Other than that, I found it overall enjoyable and enticing.			"

It's not that the game is bad, rather that its an idea who's implementation seems inherently flawed.The base mechanic of the game is the traditional ""press one or more of the 4 directions on the beat as instructed"". However, the twist is that you have three panels of arrows to rotate between and timing your presses correctly on them has different effects. There's your mana regen panel where each correct press earns you a little mana to cast spells. There's another that represents spellcasting where successfully landing a series of presses will cast a spell (more on this later). The last one represents defense where a sequence of arrows represents the enemy's attack; if you miss any here you take damage.The problem is that the defense panel's arrows (i.e. the enemy's attacks) occur at random, but you have to manually trigger your spellcast sequences. You may already see the issue here: you build mana, cast an attack spell, and arrows start to fall in the spell cast panel and defense panel simultaneously. The game's prescribed cure for this is to constantly keep up a ""barrier"" spell which effectively mutes the enemy. So the game requires you to continually recast this barrier spell so that you can actually cast the spells you want in between each barrier cast. In my opinion this is a kludge of a game mechanic. You get involved with a whole lot of busy work just to occasionally do something meaningful. Perhaps it all gets a bit smoother with some practice, but whats to engage you enough to want to get that good?I found a majority of the music to be ignorable at best. I've enjoyed some of Ronald Jenkees' music, but what's offered here I'd be reluctant to classify as even B-side music. The dialog is atrocious, the story is insignificant, and the graphics are the kind of crappy animatics that have now become standard fair in a sea of indie game dev mediocrity. The game would be perfectly suited for two hands on the keyboard, but I was forced into using a controller. (Oh I hope this wasn't just because I had a controller plugged into my PC; I'm not going back!)Perhaps worst yet is that the game devolves into a grind as each enemy you face has the chance to drop (at most?) one of three items of increasingly rarer chances to drop. You can face an enemy multiple times (enjoying the same music each time!) to get all items from an enemy. Why? Did the game need a time sink like this? Again, its more poor game design that not only contributes nothing fun, but actually contributes frustration.I really wanted to like this game. I had it on my wishlist as soon as it was released and bought it while it was still named Sequence. Despite the game's somewhat novel concept, it seems like the developer tried to throw a hodge-podge of ideas and twists at the rhythm genre, but just ended up with an overly-complicated and unfun mess.Unless you're some kind of rhythm game fanatic, skip this one. 6/10			"

												A surprising hit, expecially for the price (1.24 on daily deal).  Combines ddr rythem game with RPG.  You have three fields that can have arrow markers fall and you need to juggle between them to defeat monsters.  You have a ""Defense"" field to prevent damage, a ""Spell"" field to cast spells, and a ""Mana"" field to regenerate mana.  Maintaining the fields can be a challenge, but very fun.			"

												A hidden gem in the rhythm game genre, Sequence combines DDR and RPG style battles to form a game completely addicting and worth coming back to. The story draws you in, and the artstyle of this game certainly helps in keeping things look fresh and interesting. There's also some better good humor between the characters which at parts can be silly, but not really be enough to make you feel like none of the characters cares about whats going on. However, the game suffers from some problems such as a rather small song catalog and the occasional grind, but it isn't enough to ruin the entire experience. Another thing to note is that this game is designed for controllers, while you can play with a keyboard, and I haven't had many problems doing so. If you're into this kind of stuff, buy this game as soon as you can, it's a one of a kind experience.			"

I was blown away at the humor the game had, and the strong story (fans of the puzzle quest series know that it's a bit lacking there).

												A fantastic game in which all of the mechanics have been honed to perfection. The DDR Max-RPG hybrid system works flawlessly, the voice acting is top notch, and the dialogue is great. Little touches such as being able to spend experience points to increase synthesis success, having a practice mode to work on your timing, and more are all done well. The hand painted enviornments look gorgeous, and the character and enemy designs are great, although a couple of the later enemies are palette swaps of the early ones. The soundtrack is great, with several catchy songs you'll find yourself humming in the shower later. Unfortunately, the number of tracks is rather limited, and each enemy is assigned only one song, but the songs are still good enough that they don't get annoying. The only flaw I can find is that there is no free play mode, as at this point I have reached such a high level that even the hardest battles only take around thirty seconds to win. Still, its hard to fault a game for not letting you replay it enough, so I'll conclude by saying that this is the single best indie title I have had the pleasure of playing on Steam. A fantastic game that should be enjoyed by all.			"

												Sequence is a rhythm based, story driven RPG that follows the story of Ky and his 'handler' Maya as they traverse a tower full of strange creatures, 'guardians,' and internet memes.

												Rhythm game meets old-school turn-based RPG. This is every bit as peculiar as it sounds. The music is slick, much of it licensed from capable hands such as the wonderful Ronald Jenkees, and the gameplay can be quite punishing on higher difficulty levels. I would recommend playing this game witha controller, and indeed have not checked if it is possible (or enjoyable) without.You'll be switching between three sets of scrolling DDR style arrows: one for incoming damage that is blocked by accurate hits, another (typically containing the most difficult pieces of the song) recharges your Mana pool on accurate hits, and a third for spells. Spells are cast with the right analog stick, which (after a delay) sends down a specific rhythmic snippet that changes it's tempo to fit the current song (the specific direction of arrows changes every time you cast, and the difficulty level also changes the spells, making the more complicated versions of the same basic rhytmic idea). The game has you madly flying between these screens to defeat enemies before the song ends--it's one wierd, wild ride and it's well worth it. Battles are tense and fascinating, and there's a lot of room for varied play styles in your spell collection of choice as well as a lot of room for growth within the broad difficulty span. There's even a practice mode where you can just play through the full songs in a more standard rhthym game format. Highly recommended.			"

												9/10An interesting blend of RPG and rhythm game that works incredibly well.Before the Echo is a game that combines the usual mechanics from rhythm games, where you have to press keys/buttons with the precise timing according to the music played, with elements from RPG games - leveling up, acquiring new gear, crafting, etc. And it does so very well. Basically, you have 3 screens - Attack, Defense and Mana. You use the Mana screen to recover Mana spent, the Attack screen to cast spells and the Defense screen to block incoming enemy attacks. To advance through the game, the player needs to know how to administer all three screens, changing between them whenever needed and using the proper timing to cast spells so that they're not cast at the same time an enemy attack is coming. The player can then learn new spells with varied effects like damage, damage over time, healing, creating a protective barrier, etc. The stronger the spell, the harder it is to cast it. Items improve the character's stats, making the character cause more damage, take less damage, recover more Mana, etc. Bosses have special abilities of their own that makes the battle harder.At first, the story seems to be overly simplistic, but as the game develops and the story unfolds, it's revealed that there's a lot more to it. Characters are interesting and there is character development throughout the story and the voice acting is very well done.For those who like a challenge, the game has four difficulty levels, with the hardest difficulty being for those lovers of rhythm games. The easiest difficulty still presents some challenge at later levels. (I actually had to reduce the difficulty to Easy for the last boss)And, of course, the soundtrack - truly amazing. I would have expected a good soundtrack for a game that is heavily based on music, but even then, it surpassed my expectations.Highly recommended.			"

												Impulse buy after seeing the screens and noting it was a rhythm game RPG. Equip gear and spells and pretty much play DDR across 3 panels. One is a mana panel which will replenish your mana pool for every correct ""note"" you hit. One is a Defense panel where when your monster attacks notes will popup and for every miss you start loosing hp. In your attack panel notes will appear depending on what spell you cast. Some will deal damage some will heal you and others will cast buff/debuff on the playing fields. The difficulty will change appropriately at least for people who have played the konami music games. A little tricky getting used to panel swapping but all in all a pretty interesting and well done rhythm music game.			"

Hm, but I guess the goal is to find friends who have similar tastes.  That's why they're your friends... (or, if not, I'm doing all of this totally wrong...) So, I guess this is to say, if you're a TRUE friend, you will love this game.  No pressure.  But, then again, what the hell does my opinion matter.

												Imagine playing DDR while using 3 boards to play 3 player at ones, Although thats alittle harder, Sequence plays by using the arrow keys and q and e to switch between 3 boards, Magic, Damage and Mana boards. While you dont take damage in the Mana board, Its important to watch your other boards. Magic is where you can do damage to the other player, While Damage is that other players attack,Its a bit short overall, But has 4 different difficulties.I would recommend it to anyone who likes rhythm games.

												As someone who's been playing Dance Dance Revolution emulators on PC since 2003, I drooled at the chance to try this.  I was not disappointed.  In the same way that Puzzle Quest was a role-playing adventure using Bejeweled as its combat system, Sequence is a fun, genuinely hilarious quest that has you playing DDR to represent combat.  This is a lot more creative than it sounds.  You're faced with three streams of arrows; one for offense, one for defense, and one for regaining mana used to fuel your attacks.  Constantly shifting between streams, organizing your list of spells, and seeking out rare materials for crafting new gear is made even more fun by the top quality music, great voice acting, and a script that is much funnier than you'd ever expect.  The $5 price is yet another reason you should add this to your collection.  Don't pass this up.			"

The rhythm is pretty nice and it has a decent yet small selection of songs. The game is a bit of a grindfest. The object of the game is to grind songs by defeating the same monsters over and over to make keys to progress from level to level. It's kinda like RPG meets Stepmania.

												OMG *Frothing at the Mouth*Ok. So this game is like... It's like 3 DDR matches going on at once. You have to beat one to stay alive, and another to kill the opponent. It's all about prioritizing, while still keeping up the rhythm.It's got writing that's actually funny (like Recettear), and it's fully voice acted. I didn't think I would care at first, but the voices make the writing pop even better. It's definitely aimed at our age group, but not in the sense that it's corny like Saved by the Bell, but more like someone our age actually worked on it.Also, it has Ronald Jenkees in it. I found that enough to be worth the $5 alone.If you like DDR/Guitar Hero, and also like Chantelise, Recettear, or Gyromancer (basically anything that follows the simple 3 stat RPG formula. Maybe even FF3) then you should really like this game.Also, I played it on hard mode and I'm now realizing that I really have no rhythm what so ever. Hard mode is actually hard!			"

												It's and interesting game with a blend of genres. I used to play a lot of DDR and Stepmania on PC when I was younger and I was really hoping this would scratch that itch for me. Alas, although I really liked the humor, this falls really flat for me. I expect better responses and controls from a rhythm game and this did not have either. I hated having to switch between different windows to cast spells and regain mana. It completely took me away from the song. There is way to much grind on the stages for my taste, too. Give me more monsters to fight, not the same few to fight over and over on each floor. I think I had too high expectations for this game but for me it is a no go. I can't recommend this coming from a DDR snob like me. 2/5 Fun for some, but not for me.			"

												For fans of Stepmania, DDR, or other similar rhythm games, Sequence offers an interesting twist to keep gameplay interesting. In addition, the game has a unique brand of satirical, self-aware humor that pokes at sacred-cow RPG traditions and Internet jokes alike. Since it combines the RPG and rhythm genres, it can get very repetitive, but if you cn keep yourself interested, it makes for a great time, especially considering the low price. Thumbs up!			"

												DDR/Frequency/Amplitude with an RPG twist. If you have ever been a fan of rhythm games, particularly those by Harmonix, you (hopefully) have come across the Frequency/Amplitude series. With its rapid track-switching gameplay, it was a unique and underappreciated entry in gaming history. Now, Sequence takes the track switching mechanic, applies simple DDR-style controls, and turns it into a monster-fighting RPG. It might sound crazy, but this is probably one of the best genre hybrids since Puzzle Fighter or Bust-a Move.			"

												When I heard about this indie title, being addicted to rhythm games like Stepmania and the possibility to play with a dancepad already got me interested. Ready to press arrows blindly according to the patterns, what I really found is that Sequence is a simple rpg game, in which are injected rhythmic mechanics with average difficulty. Mixed genres dude!Iridium Studios managed to produce something difficult to classify, yet the gameplay alone will entertain you for a decent amount of time. Yes, because while I enjoyed the game in its essence - the crafting system, the bosses and the good ol' leveling up - the story and the characters can't really get you hooked.Plus, I don't get why sentences by the main character are constantly being interrupted: you feel like a spoiled brat who needs a lesson for no particular reason, and the moment after we're oh so important like the future of the world depends on us. XDPlot twists, kinda forced, kinda rushed. Someone likes that, others don't.Despite the full controller support, I fully played it on keyboard - more fit in handling the controls in my opinion - and it was a good experience overall: my playtime reached ~20 hours, not bad for an indie game so I cannot say I didn't enjoy the run! The achievements offer a medium challenge to accomplish, so if you're an achievement hunter this is a nice game to 100% .Finally, would you look at the price! Looks like an on-sale game already, so definitely give this title a chance if you're searching for something outside the box.			"

												Before the Echo is like this weird Rhythm game and rpg rolled into one. You play the game by matching Arrows in three different fields. Defense blocks attacks, There's an attack field where you need to hit all the arrows to cast spells. Then there is the mana pool where you replenish your mana for more spells. The thing is you queue your spells up on your own. So you have to either take a few hits while you get a spell off on the enemy or maybe you'll find that gap in the enemy's attack pattern. Besides that the game has a ton of other rpg elements like monster drops, item synthesis, equipment, learning new spells and more. I also enjoy the voice acting and all the snarky sarasm that goes on between the guy you play and Naia the girl over the intercom. I was really laughing at the first boss encounter poor old percival was offended by my words. Then again he was asking for it.I say pick this up if you like rhythm games and want a splash of rpg stuff to go with it.			"

												I generally don't like rythm games at all but ""Before the Echo"" really got to me. The RPG elements set the game apart from others of this genre and it has genuinely good characters, writing and voice acting despite being an indie game. I sometimes found myself tired of grinding for items to progress to the next level but the story really carried the game, pushed me to keep playing and it payed off in the end. If you don't flat out hate rythm games and if you can appreciate a good and original story, you should give this one a try.			"

												I loved rhythm games and RPGs while growing up. I tried twice, a couple years apart, but this game just couldn't hold my interest.It's not fun to grind. It's especially not fun when it means playing the same song over and over, with nothing new happening. Most of the non-gameplay actions you can take require wagering experience points -- academically, the mechanic is really interesting...but gameplay-wise, it's just frustrating to spend massive amounts of experience points on this.The characters, at least through as much of the game as I saw, were just cringey. It's like Twilight for boys -- a totally non-special guy randomly ends up in a magical world where a woman with a sexy voice flirts with him. I'm looking for something a little more interesting than sarcasm. I don't need an elitist lesson in how everyone but the dev pronounces ""mana"" wrong -- I'm sure there's an audience that resonates with, but it isn't me.The actual gameplay is not terrible, and involves rotating through 3 DDR-style tracks -- one to defend, one to regenerate mana, and one to cast spells. Again, it's academically interesting, but gameplay-wise, it's just kind of infuriating to constantly be shown the opportunity cost of the choosing the track you're currently on.So maybe that's my gripe -- the game always made me feel like I wasn't doing what I should be doing. The game wants me to take risks with my EXP wagering and to not care about the other tracks during gameplay, but my personality doesn't let me switch into that mode. My personality isn't changing, the game isn't changing, and we're just not a match. If you're not like me, this might be the game for you!			"

The story is more elaborate than you would expect for a $5 rhythm-based RPG. But being elaborate doesn't make it good. The gameplay is the highlight of this game and it certainly impresses. This game transforms Stepmania the way that Puzzle Quest transformed Bejeweled. I definitely recommend buying it, even at full price. Unless you're completely terrible at rhythm games, in which case you might find it frustrating, although it isn't particularly hard on the standard difficulty.			"

												The boring prequel to the much more interesting ""There Came an Echo"".  The game plays much like StepMania (DDR without the dancing) although there is an intersting field switch mechanic which you need to exploit to clear the stages.  Alot of odd design decisions went into this game; spend your experince to maybe get an item, craft required items in order to progress the stage, challenge the same stage over and over in hopes of getting key components.  It all adds up to repetitively grinding the same monsters on the same handful of songs over and over in order to progress.  I can only imagine these were added to help artifically increase the length of the game, which would otherwise be extremely short, which leads me into my major issue with the game; the writing.Writing is an issue which it's much better successor shares, everyone is so contrived in following along with the plotline, In this iteration, the protaginist and the supporting heroine are set up as antagonists, but engage in half hearted bickering until events contrive to have the hero off rescuing her a couple in game hours after their intitial meeting; what changed to reconcile these two advesaries?  A couple of passing comments wich imply the possibly the heroine is not 100% commited to organization which is forcing the hero to risk his life.  If only it was that easy for me to reconcile with my enemies.  The story climax involves a forced moral objection to something which, when you think about it, isn't all that bad, which has the hero vowing to commit his life to destroying those responsible and taking on substatial personal risk in the interium.  This isn't a crusader of justice, it's suposedly a VERY bright college kid caught up in a risky mis-adventure.  In real life, 10 of 10 of such kids would not tell the head of a powerful multinational organization which managed to abduct them and spirt them away to tower of death, that not only will you not forgive them, you'll make it your life's work to destroy them for the crime of  setting you up on a blind date  "

												Had this game recommended to me as a good music game hybrid, and was pleasantly surprised.  I'm not usually an RPG fan, but this game is enjoyable so far and there's no question that I'll see it through to the end.As a long-time DDR/stepmania player, I stepped quite easily into hard mode.  The charts themselves are still pretty easy for me, and I can easily get 100% while unlocking spells.  However, during regular gameplay, coordinating switching between panes with hitting notes is a new and interesting challenge.The biggest downside so far is the lack of content.  The soundtrack, while well-made, is extremely limited, and you'll end up hearing the same handful of songs over and over (so far maybe a half dozen songs in the first 4/7 floors of the tower, compared to dozens/hundreds in your average true rhythm game).  That coupled with the fact that I'm better than halfway through the game in under 4 hours suggests that this game won't have replay value.Other thoughts:- The art is somewhat low-res (720p?) and you can't change resolutions.  You can choose full screen or windowed though.  Not something I notice during gameplay, but nowadays I'd expect full HD (or preferably vector) art.- So far I've only gotten one defensive spell and it's not that powerful.  There's a huge emphasis on attack-heavily-and-occasionally-heal with not much in the way of actually defending.  Some battles you can coast through without using the defense pane much at all, so it's not equally balanced throughout.- A lot of the items/spells seem ignorable in general, unless you're a compulsive completionist like I am.- Each floor of the tower has 3 different enemy battles (each with 3 different item drops), plus a boss battle.- It's interesting that the item drop probabilities are shown, that way you can quantify how bad your luck is when grinding.  Sure, I got the 35% item in 3 of my last 4 battles, but I only got one of the 85% item that I need three of.  Haha.- The boss battles don't seem to be replayable, but they do unlock new songs when you complete them that will be used in the higher levels of battle.- Most people complaining about the name change (from ""Sequence"") have no idea how trademark law works, or why companies are obligated to protect their trademarks.Overall, this game is well worth that 99c sale price, but it seems like something I'll play through once and then forget about.  I absolutely love the concept, but it needs more content for sure.			"

												OUTSTANDING game.First of all, I adore indie games. I love the creativity and teamwork that comes with creating indie games, and they are my favorite genre to play and watch. I picked up this game on my queue during the Steam summer sale, but let me tell you, it's at least worth the five dollars standard price.As an avid lover of rhythm games, I was pleasantly surprised at the complexity of each level. The difficulty increased without overwhelming the player, and the spells come in a great variety that essentially allow the player to beat the game in their own style. The art style is consistent, entirely due to the fact that every visual was created by the same artist! And it's so very sweet on the eyes.Moving on to the characters, I have to say that while it is a rather short game (I finished all achievements in around 2-3 hours, after resetting my glitched game, a result of an error on my part) and thus we don't get to see much in terms of character depth or development, the characters' presence was enough to add quality and personality to the game without taking away the mystery and shock of the plot (I loved each of the Guardians and applaud the voice actors, as well as the artist, for providing such animated spirit). The ending leaves several questions unanswered, and if you're ambitious enough to get the hidden ending, you get a taste of even more secrets yet to be revealed.I couldn't put this game down. It was funny, intriguing, and the artwork and music are STELLAR!Now, to be fair, the game did have some drawbacks. I feel like the characters were a bit flat, but, if you play the game, you'll figure out why they seem to be so...scripted. It is a short game (hence the low price), but the crew that worked on it was so small! Aside from the voice actors, very few people put together a game that I will proudly call one of my all-time favorites. Iridium Studios, thank you for this masterpiece; I will cherish it for years to come.			"

Some longtime stepmania players may find it hard to adapt to lane switching, and the arrows which are now coded for game mechanics reasons (like skills, incoming damage amounts), rather than based on beat type. This in particular can make some things (like skill unlock challenges) much harder than you may be used to, for interface reasons.

												Fun and interesting concept. The story is kind of weak... I mean if I woke up in a tower and some girl told me that I had to fight my way to the top and could die at any moment I'd probably be a little bit more questioning but it serves its purpose. The music is absolutely terrible but what can you expect from an indie game... I guess the only real complaint I'd have about it is that all of the songs are so similar that it kind of sounds like you're listening to the same song over and over again. It gets annoying.

												After I listened to Ronald Jenkees' last single ""Try the Bass"" (Hello Youtubes!) I found out that his popular songs where in the game ""Before the Echo"" (ex Sequence), so I decided to try a rhythmic game for once. No regrets.Totally recommended for music fans even though it has its flaws: a few songs and repetitive gameplay. If you can pass that, you will be immersed in an interesting story, nice voice acting, a small RPG-esque game and challenging steam achievements.Note: there was a time when I closed my eyes and I kept seeing arrows flowing down... Yeah, that kind of effect it had on me.			"

												Before the Echo, once called Sequence, is a fun and short rhythm fighting/dancing role-playing game. My game time represents how long it took for me to beat the game and it ended just at the right time. The pacing of the game and story go well together. There was a short grind near the end of the game, but it was good practice and leveling for the last few bosses which are quite a challenge.I bought the game on sale so add this to your wishlist if you think the price is too much currently.

												Haven't finished yet, but I truly love the style, gameplay, concept, and mechanics of the game!Imagine an RPG style ""guitar hero like"" rhythm game. Got you hooked yet? Simply put, the player switches between 3 ""fields"" or screens (Defence, Spell, and Mana) while in game as arrows move down in each field. There's a great deal of multitasking involved because of casting spells, defending yourself, and gaining mana.You win by draining the opponent's HP to 0 by casting damaging spells, but you can lose by losing all of your health or by not winning by the end of the song. It's a great game that keeps you on your toes and equipping the right spells. That being said, don't feel as though there are ""wrong"" or ""right"" spells to use. Some are better for certain levels or battles, but I've been able to use the spells that fit my playstyle. Before the Echo is a great game for people who love RPGs but may not have all the time in the world to spend 60+ hours in.  "

												A hidden gem in the rhythm game genre, Sequence combines DDR and RPG style battles to form a game completely addicting and worth coming back to. The story draws you in, and the artstyle of this game certainly helps in keeping things look fresh and interesting. There's also some better good humor between the characters which at parts can be silly, but not really be enough to make you feel like none of the characters cares about whats going on. However, the game suffers from some problems such as a rather small song catalog and the occasional grind, but it isn't enough to ruin the entire experience. Another thing to note is that this game is designed for controllers, while you can play with a keyboard, and I haven't had many problems doing so. If you're into this kind of stuff, buy this game as soon as you can, it's a one of a kind experience.			"

												As someone who loved stepmania and was addicted to it for a long time this game feels right at home. It includes an interesting mechanic of swapping between windows to attack, defend or regenerate mana which at first takes some getting used to but after that it is like second nature. The game includes some great soundtracks, and it was sad defeating an enemy early just because the song would end early. The audio goes perfectly with the visual aesthetics of the game  and the artwork is truly stunning.There is some farming involved in progressing through the game but if you play any RPG this is nothing out of the ordinary.Over all it is unique and lots of fun. great music and highly addictive.

												A friend of mine actually recommended this game for me quite awhile ago, but i've only looked at a basic gameplay video, and that was it.Many months later, when i recieved my new notebook, and when Steam started doing huge sales, i decided to include games i was ""kinda"" interested on to my wishlist, including this game. Then when this game hit 2 euros, i bought it.Now i'm gonna be honest here. From the boredom gameplay i'm getting from Stepmania, and similar DDR games with no intensity whatsoever, and from there are so many indie games i am ""meh"" at, i expected this game to be no diffirent.Turns out i was wrong on many levels. This game surpasses basic expection i thought this will be. Every ingame music i've heard so far are very catchy, the voice acting is spot on and flawlessly perfect, the many internet references (possibly including a pony one aswell) are hilarious, the story is excellent, and most importantly the gameplay is fantastic.

												Rather unqiue rythem game, if you've ever played stepmaina using a keyboard you should recongize the combat system a bit.  You basically get three feilds, one to rebuild mana, one to block attacks from your oppenent, and finally the last feild is for attacking with spells, all of which is timed to the tempo of the song.  Each spell uses a different sequence of steps as well. Each level you are collecting ingredents to make a key to continue on, or other items to help you in your quest. The caracthers are fully voiced, and are very charming and humorous.  At the price of some starbucks coffee or some meal you can't really go wrong.			"

												Love this game! The music, the backgrounds, the characters! I'm a long time fan of DDR but this was something else entirely. I loved having to switch through the three different panels to gain mana, defend, and attack. Towards the end, it started to get a little too easy for me once I figured out a sure way to win each battle (certain combinations of attacks in certain 'sequences' ...haha). Next time I'll have to play through on a harder difficulty - first time through it I think I did it on a step up from easy.And a nice little story to keep me engaged and curious. I only wish there was more! 15 hours of game time is pretty good, though. But it's very relaxing to play so I think I'll be coming back to it often.If you have yet to acquire a sense of rhthym or musicality, this game might be a bit hard to get used to... but I still recommend it.

												This game is amazing. If a game that combines rhythm game and RPG appeals to you then this game would be something to look at even if that combination of genre wasn't so rare. First off to all the people who aren't scared off from thinking of potential problems or weirdness already, it's not just ""let's smash these genres together"". It's very functional as a rhythm game and they made that part of gameplay the ""battle"" portion of the RPG. You switch between ""fields"" to either defend against attacks, cast spells or regain mana. The balance of strength of attacks and difficulty pulling them off feels nice and natural and the game overall feels just wonderfully made. Like any RPG you might need to grind a little but just remember to pay attention to getting good equipment and good spell usage and it shouldn't get too bad. I think the only negative I can really think about gameplay is there isn't any ""turn based"" alternative for anyone that isn't physically capable of playing a timing based game, but for the rest of it it's good to go. Music and visual aesthetics might depend a bit on individual taste to say for sure but I personally loved both in this game.  The story is awesome too, unlike a lot of other RPG's it doesn't give you a ton of story which works since plenty of the interest comes in the mystery and uncertainty. You get just a few cutscenes every floor, long enough to enjoy the strange characters but not so long you forget you're playing a video game. Trust me there's not really any throw away characters.Saddly as much as I'd like to go on I don't know how much deeper I can dig without risking any spoilers or rambling on too much, but trust me when I say this is a unique gem of a game worth playing through to the end.

												Bit of a mixed bag, Sequence is a rhythm game about using three different playing to fight monsters.  There's the defense field in which you defend against incoming attacks by aggressors by blocking their attacks pressing the corresponding keys.  The spell field in which you cast spells with different effects such as DoT, healing, or fast recharge low damage spells.  And the mana field in which you replenish mana, which is used to cast spells, you can only have one of these fields open at a time and there is a time limit for defeating the monster, which is an interesting concept.  The monsters have a chance of dropping various items, the lower the more rare and they all give a different amount of experience. You use your experience to craft items, spell scrolls, or keys which you use to use to progress, herein lies some of the problems of the game.  It feels like a grind, just a huge grind.  You end up wasting so much time either killing the same monster over and over again to find that ONE item you need to make better gear or spells, and you can end up wasting all of that precious expereince you earned making you down on experience, although you do lose out on some items.  It just gets very very repetitive around floor four you notice none of the spells bring anything new to the table.  It doesn't help the writing isn't super compelling.  Not to mention the music is reused and the only time you feel like you're actually playing a rhythm game is when you're in the mana field, which is when the keys actually feel like they correspond to the music.  It's got cute ideas but it's riddled with flaws, it's worth checking out if you feel confident sinking money into just to get a feel for it, hey if you're into the grind and slamming on keys for 10 seconds at a time (roughly how long it takes to get your mana replensihed) then be my guest.

												This game is excellent. Normally, RPGs and music games both face issues, but I can't readily see them in this title. It took the gameplay of Rockband: Unplugged for the PSP and made it actually functional, and into an intuitive battle system. The RPG elements, with the ability to gain and lose levels as you spend time bettering your character, made character building interesting and every upgrade felt impactful. The voice acting was well done too, though similarly with There Came an Echo the character development was not endearing, focused too much on antagonistic dialouge rather than meaningful trait building. Still, however, you can skip these scenes so you can get away from that as much as possible. The game itself, I'll warn, has little replay value. There's no software to add custom tracks like in Audiosurf, the music gets used on multiple levels and, given you are grinding, you get to hear the songs over and over again. If the music was bad, this would have been worse of an issue but I can't honestly say that the songs were terrible and didn't go so far as to play abrasive music from Dubstep, etc. Other things I'd change would be additions of things like local PvP, clearer labeling on the spell circle to tell which spell was which and what numbers corresponded to which slice of the circle, and more than seven levels/three battle senarios per level.  All in all it is a fun game. For 5$, it has about as much content as you'd expect and with as polished as it looks, sounds, and feels I can't recommend it enough.			"

												This game is a cross between Dance Dance Revolution / Stepmania and Puzzle Quest.If you reacted to that sentence with ""hey that sounds cool,"" this game is for you. Not certain? Still worth a look.Playable with the keyboard, a gamepad, or a dance pad (which I really want to try one of these days), the basic gist of the gameplay is hitting arrows in time with a beat a la DDR. For the Puzzle Quest influence, this has an RPG story where you beat monsters to collect items and proceed up a tower. You flip between three ""boards"": one board's arrows are attacks aimed at you, and clearing the arrow defends against the attack; one board will regenerate your mana; a third board is active when you cast a spell, and nailing that sequence means your spell succeeds.The dialogue is refreshingly snarky, and fully voice-acted.The all-important question: how's the music? Very good, and there's a solid variety too. At least, variety within the style - they're all going to be a bit dancy-technoey.			"

Sequence is a fantastic game for rpg fans, rythm/music fans, and fans of good stories with humor. It also features music of ronald jenkees. One of my favorite electronic artists. The songs fit the game perfectly and do a great job of setting the mood.  I also highly recomend using a controller, but the keyboard controlls work nicely as well. Don't miss out on such a fantastic adventure. ~PR0XIDIAN			"

												When I heard about this indie title, being addicted to rhythm games like Stepmania and the possibility to play with a dancepad already got me interested. Ready to press arrows blindly according to the patterns, what I really found is that Sequence is a simple rpg game, in which are injected rhythmic mechanics with average difficulty. Mixed genres dude!Iridium Studios managed to produce something difficult to classify, yet the gameplay alone will entertain you for a decent amount of time. Yes, because while I enjoyed the game in its essence - the crafting system, the bosses and the good ol' leveling up - the story and the characters can't really get you hooked.Plus, I don't get why sentences by the main character are constantly being interrupted: you feel like a spoiled brat who needs a lesson for no particular reason, and the moment after we're oh so important like the future of the world depends on us. XDPlot twists, kinda forced, kinda rushed. Someone likes that, others don't.Despite the full controller support, I fully played it on keyboard - more fit in handling the controls in my opinion - and it was a good experience overall: my playtime reached ~20 hours, not bad for an indie game so I cannot say I didn't enjoy the run! The achievements offer a medium challenge to accomplish, so if you're an achievement hunter this is a nice game to 100% .Finally, would you look at the price! Looks like an on-sale game already, so definitely give this title a chance if you're searching for something outside the box.			"

												If you're into beat-matching games like DDR and your general run'o'the mill end-battle screens with experience and levels a la Final Fantasy, this is definitely worth a go. The music is great too, I really liked 'Still Crunchy'. I recommend playing it with a controller.			"

												Fun, original game with good graphics and EXCELLENT music by Ronald Jenkees and Michael Wade Hamilton. However, it's not for those who dislike either rhythm games or electronica. For those who do, though, get this game. Still, a word of warning if you do: Play this with either a gamepad or a DDR dance pad unless you're looking forward to carpal tunnel syndrome. If you don't have either of these for PC, then get it from the Indie Games channel on Xbox Live.			"

												Brilliant mix of RPG and... rhythm game?!Dance Dance Revolution style games have always seemed a little dodgy on a control pad, but Sequence amps up the difficulty by introducing three separate fields -- defense (missed notes hurt you), spells (getting all notes in a spell casts it) and mana (a constant stream; each note hit gives +2 mana).Monsters drop various items, which can be crafted into new spells, weapons, armour, accessories, and the key required to face that floor's miniboss. My biggest issue with the game, as it happens, is that the various random events -- random drops, percentage to succeed/fail at crafting -- can be frustrating when luck is not on your side. You might find yourself fighting the same monster a dozen times before getting a key item supposedly dropped in 42% of battles.But the art is good and the writing is great, even if the story does fizzle out somewhat as it becomes more serious. The item descriptions are especially fun; with very few exceptions they are awful, awful puns. (An example off the top of my head is the Lightwave Sword: ""Also Lightparticle Sword."" The description for Polish Remover is ""Hitler"".)			"

												One of the best games I have ever played. It is not a large scale game with lots of things to explore, no. Just an interesting storyline, simple yet fun concept, enjoyable music, awesome sense of humour and brilliant conclusion. It is all these well-crafted and small but meaningful bits that made the game superior to so many games out there.Definitely a must play!			"

												SEQUENCE has a special place in my soul. Best DDR Style thingamajig I've ever played. Great Music. Great Story. Intense exciting gameplay.Even broke one of my xbox D-pads trying to beat the boss (Those crappy silvery D pads that rotated, screw those things).Just sad there will never be a sequal to sequence.

												This game as far as I'm aware is a one of a kind that kept me heavily engaged throughout. Althought the end was strange and rapidly unraveled, I truely enjoyed every minute. This was the best 79p I've ever spent and probably ever shall (bought it in the winter sale) I highly recommend this game.			"

												OUTSTANDING game.First of all, I adore indie games. I love the creativity and teamwork that comes with creating indie games, and they are my favorite genre to play and watch. I picked up this game on my queue during the Steam summer sale, but let me tell you, it's at least worth the five dollars standard price.As an avid lover of rhythm games, I was pleasantly surprised at the complexity of each level. The difficulty increased without overwhelming the player, and the spells come in a great variety that essentially allow the player to beat the game in their own style. The art style is consistent, entirely due to the fact that every visual was created by the same artist! And it's so very sweet on the eyes.Moving on to the characters, I have to say that while it is a rather short game (I finished all achievements in around 2-3 hours, after resetting my glitched game, a result of an error on my part) and thus we don't get to see much in terms of character depth or development, the characters' presence was enough to add quality and personality to the game without taking away the mystery and shock of the plot (I loved each of the Guardians and applaud the voice actors, as well as the artist, for providing such animated spirit). The ending leaves several questions unanswered, and if you're ambitious enough to get the hidden ending, you get a taste of even more secrets yet to be revealed.I couldn't put this game down. It was funny, intriguing, and the artwork and music are STELLAR!Now, to be fair, the game did have some drawbacks. I feel like the characters were a bit flat, but, if you play the game, you'll figure out why they seem to be so...scripted. It is a short game (hence the low price), but the crew that worked on it was so small! Aside from the voice actors, very few people put together a game that I will proudly call one of my all-time favorites. Iridium Studios, thank you for this masterpiece; I will cherish it for years to come.			"

												I went into this game fully knowing it was a DDR game. Being mediocre at it, i thought that it would be a simple 2 maybe 3 hours to finish this.Now, what i did not expect was the engaging storyline, the funny banter and the relationships that develop. If you are a storyline kind of person and can do so-so in stepmania, i would encourage you to give this a go. While ""grinding"" for levels is a thing in this game, you'll notice that you would do the same in any DDR / stepmania type of game. Watch yourself get better as you aim for that perfect all the while gaining more power (by leveling) and actual skill of both memory and reflexes.All in all, i find this to be my hidden gem. Simple gameplay, GREAT storyline and above all memorable chracters.			"
